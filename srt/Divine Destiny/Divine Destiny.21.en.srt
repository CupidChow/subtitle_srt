-Yinyin. -I'm Here.

7
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,570
Why are you yelling so early in the morning?

8
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,900
You didn't even call me senior.

9
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,480
Senior Yinyin.

10
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,620
I thought...

11
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,550
You thought I left without saying goodbye?

12
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,860
I'm not that kind of person.

13
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,490
But this time,

14
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,810
I'm not going with you to Xixuan.

15
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,770
Please deliver my master's message of "See you"

16
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,390
to Junior Master Ziyang for me.

17
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,700

00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,390
Why do I feel like it's spinning?

And I feel...

21
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,950
I feel dizzy.

22
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,860
Did I drink fake wine?

23
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,660
I drank a lot yesterday.

24
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,730
Why am I fine?

25
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,380
I'm afraid that I can't go to Xixuan alone.

26
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,329
Fine.

27
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,780
I'm going with you.

28
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,850
I'll take you to the foot of Xixuan Mountains, okay?

29
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,030
Really?

30
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,060
Let's go.

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,400
Stop pretending.

33
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,980
I'm not pretending.

34
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,860
I'm really having a headache.

35
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,120
My head hurts.

Heavenly Fox.

37
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,600
The isolated island ahead is where Uncle is.

38
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,360
This is Uncle's boat.

39
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,420
Uncle must know you are here,

40
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,710
so he sent a boat to pick you up.

41
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:37,800
I knew it.

42
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,100
He's been thinking about you.

43
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:41,260
Heavenly Fox, please.

44
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,420
Heavenly Fox.

45
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:12,520
What's wrong?

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,700
Maybe

47
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,320
I shouldn't have come.

48
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,089
Heavenly Fox.

49
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,100
Are you angry that Uncle is not here to pick you up?

50
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,210
Don't be angry.

51
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,880
Since I could remember things,

52
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,140
Uncle has been sitting under the bodhi tree

53
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,330
and has never left there.

54
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,390
He let many people down.

55
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,020
But he has kept his promise

56
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,320
to stay on the Endless Sea.

57
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,470
Thus,

58
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,400
we shouldn't meet each other.

59
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,850
Why?

60
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,020
Does it matter if I meet him or not?

61
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,760
He's still the same person.

62
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,730
I didn't persuade him to leave the Endless Sea back then.

63
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,909
Why should I ask for trouble this time?

64
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,159
Qingyi.

65
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,580
Heavenly Fox has her own plan.

66
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:56,860
Stop talking.

67
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,840
But Uncle...

68
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,060
Tell your uncle.

69
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,580
If he changes his mind one day,

70
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,670
come to me in Peace Hall in Xixuan Mountains.

71
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,510

72
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,200
Heavenly Fox has left the Endless Sea.

73

It's not the time yet.

74
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,620
It's good not to see her.

75
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,490

Lychee meat.

80
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:51,860
What else?

81
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,760
Fish balls soup.

82
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,810
And a pot of good osmanthus wine.

83
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,380
You know me well.

84
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:03,620
Cheers!

Well.

87
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,130
It used to be quite lively in this yard.

88
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,960
Now it's only you and me.

89
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:18,940

asking Senior Ji Bingxian to join us?

91
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,970

00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,540
Why are you here so suddenly?

94
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,000
Allow me to go back to my room and put on some clothes.

95
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,070
Don't you know?

96
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,860
Yinyin and Ji Ruochen have come back.

97
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,540
Really?

98
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:46,670
Where are they?

107
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,020
Why did you gain so much weight

108
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,220
after leaving Xixuan?

109
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:20,810
You...

110
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,100
Do you want me to beat you?

111
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,570
You're fat.

112
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:24,690
Did you steal and eat

113
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,870
what I left in the library?

114
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,400
The weather is so nice today.

115
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,420
You really ate it?

116
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,630
Who ate your dried sweet potatoes?

117
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:30,880
I...

118
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,040
This is a disciple of a branch of Xixuan Sect.

119
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:36,800
His name is...

120
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,030
What's your name?

121
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,460
I'm Ji Ruochen.

Nice to meet you. Seniors.

123
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,210
Yes.

124
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,280
These three

125
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,909
are my best friends in Xixuan Mountains.

126

If I'm not around,

127
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,250
the three of them will take care of you.

128
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:47,570
OK.

129
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,900
I'll listen to you.

130

What's going on?

131
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:50,770
I don't know.

132
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,740
You're Ruochen, right?

133
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,020
Nice to meet you.

Yinyin.

135
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,900
Why do you want us to protect Ruochen?

136
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:00,420
Judging from his looks,

137
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,060
his cultivation

138
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,300
should be above us.

139
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:04,350
Well.

140
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,340
What's going on between Ruochen and Yinyin?

141
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,940
Maybe this is the romance

142
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,920
between them.

143
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,740
He just looks powerful.

144
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,730
He's outwardly strong but inwardly weak.

145
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,720
He couldn't walk after drinking a little wine.

146
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,620
Why are you looking at me?

147
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,380
Qiushui.

148
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,000
Logically speaking, you're married.

149
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,640
You should understand that.

150
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,620
They are calling you.

151
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,300
Senior Bingxian is always modest.

152
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,950
We should learn from her.

153
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,039
Yes.

154
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,450
Let's go up the mountain first.

155
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,539
It's not proper if we keep talking at the foot of the mountain, right?

156
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:37,850
Xuanzhen.

157
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:39,770
I'm not going.

158
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,809
Let's go, Yinyin.

159
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:41,850
Go.

160
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,590
Let's go.

161
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,090
Qiushui.

162
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,100
After we go up the mountain,

163
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,620
cook her favorite tofu crab roe soup.

164
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,140
No problem.

165
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,020
Yinyin, don't worry.

166
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,620
Since you left Xixuan,

167
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,250
everyone has been missing you.

168
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,120
No one will stop you from coming back

169
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,100
just because you are a monster.

170
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,050
That's right.

171
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,900
I also heard that Ming Yue and Ming Xin

172
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,910
always wanted to go down the mountain to find you,

173
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,010
let alone Jingxiao Zhenren and Ms. Huang.

174
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,740
I'm going to the Taixuan Palace to see my parents.

175
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,390
I'll come to you later.

176
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,160
By the way,

177
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,300
Zhen and Shui,

178
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,160
this is

179
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,360
Junior Ji.

180
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,410
Show him around.

181
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,540
This is his first time here.

182
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,430
Alright. Just go.

183
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,660
I'm impressed after these days.

184
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,420
Yinyin is really a good actor.

185
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,430
It's like she really doesn't know Ruochen.

186
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,300
She was not acting.

187
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,950
She really doesn't know me.

188
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:43,440
-What did you say? -What?

189
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,860
So many things happened

190
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,980
after you left Mount Luoran.

191
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,520
We should have caught up with you.

192
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,070
Unfortunately,

193
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:57,330
we can never see Senior Yunfeng again.

194
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,680
Luo Xichen.

195
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,660
I'll remember this name.

196
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,460
I didn't expect that Senior Yunfeng died.

197
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,740
And Yinyin has lost her memory.

198
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,630
What's your plan next?

199
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,740
Actually, I brought Yinyin back this time

200
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,180
to ask Master Ziyang and others for help.

201
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,230
And

202
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,990
I will tell masters

203
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,580
about what happened to Senior Yunfeng.

204
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,340
Senior Ji.

205
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,920
Ziyang Zhenren wants to see you.

206
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,710
That's good. I'm about to go there.

207
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,330
Let's go now.

208
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,100
Why are you crying?

209
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,950
Why are you crying?

210
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,980
Look at me now. I'm fine.

211
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,330
I can walk

212
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,760
after I'm completely detoxified.

213
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,300
-Get up. -Yinyin, don't worry.

214
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,140
Your father is fine now.

215
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,350
I must avenge my father

216
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,240
and let Xuxuan experience the taste of being poisoned.

217
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,270
Yinyin.

218
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,460
You can't get involved in

219
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,770
what's between Qingxu Sect and Xixuan Sect anymore.

220
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,660
I'm very happy that

221
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,080
you came back safely this time.

222
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:19,850
By the way,

223
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,480
did anyone

224
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,040
give you a hard time when you went up the mountain?

225
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,730
Seniors and juniors were nice to me.

226
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,270
By the way,

227
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,860
on my way back,

228
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,120
I met a disciple of a branch of Xixuan Sect.

229
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,600
His name is

230
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,540
Ji Ruo...

231
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,120
What is his name again?

232
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,850
-Ji Ruochen? -Ji Ruochen?

233
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,470
You all know him?

234
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,440
He said this is his first time here.

235
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:50,510
Yinyin.

236
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:51,910
Did anything happen

237
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,700
after you left here?

238
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,790
After I left here,

239
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,170
I went to the Monster Forbidden Zone.

240
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,860
I seem to have forgotten a lot after I came out.

241
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,380
And it gives me a headache when I try to remember.

242
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,130
You went to the Monster Forbidden Zone?

243
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,930
I remember that a senior was injured.

244
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,530
I wanted to go to the Monster Forbidden Zone to find Nuwa's tear for him.

245
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,340
But I can't remember

246
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,220
what happened

247
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,530
in the Monster Forbidden Zone

248
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,980
or who

249
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:27,700
the senior...

250
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:30,820
Yinyin.

251
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,700
Don't think about it if you are having a headache.

252
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,660
Let me take you back.

253
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,220
Yes.

254
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:34,910
Go get some rest.

255
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,410
Let's go.

256
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,100
Hurry.

257
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:38,920
How are you?

258
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,450
It hurts.

259
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,880
I went down the mountain

260
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,060
without Master's permission.

261
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,180
It was all my fault.

262
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,340
If I hadn't acted recklessly,

263
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,990
Senior Yunfeng wouldn't have died.

264
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,650
This sword

265
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,730
was left by him.

266
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:07,960
I think

267
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,030
it's better to give it to Master Ziyang.

268
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,510
Feng only cares about

269
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,320
Xixuan Sect in his heart.

270
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,480
He has never had any selfish motives.

271
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,890
He died

272
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,650
to protect you and Xixuan.

273
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,680
He had no regrets.

274
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,020
Lan.

275
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,610
It seems that Yinyin has forgotten Ruochen.

276
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,430
I wonder what happened

277
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,320
after Yinyin went down the mountain.

278
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,110
Yes.

279
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:02,750
No.

280
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,120
I must go to Ruochen and ask him.

281
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,270
Lan.

282
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,430
Senior Ziyang just summoned Ruochen.

283
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:10,840
If you want to ask him,

284
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:13,310
wait until they're done.

285
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,770
Ruochen,

286
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,560
although you suffered so much,

287
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,640
you've finally regained your cultivation.

288
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,700
You are lucky.

289
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:29,200
Don't act on your own again.

290
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,310
Okay.

291
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,850
I understand.

292
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,450
Ruochen.

293
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,730
It's difficult

294
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,660
to solve Yinyin's problem.

295
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:42,620
Master,

296
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,460
please allow Yinyin and me to be together.

297
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,340
It's not about that.

298
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,270
I'm afraid

299
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,010
there is nothing we can do

300
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,660
to help Yinyin remember you.

301
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,200
Why?

302
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,680
Master Iceberg is the supreme lord of the monster clan.

303
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,080
She has countless precious treasures.

304
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,860
If my guess is right,

305
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,490
it was her most precious treasure,

306
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,340
Nuwa's tear,

307
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,300
that helped regain your cultivation.

308
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,580
And Yinyin

309
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,410
must have become like this

310
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,380
in order to get Nuwa's tear.

311
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,500
If that's the case,

312
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,680
even Senior Ziwei

313
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,180
can do nothing about it,

314
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,340
let alone us.

315
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,960
Master. You mean

316
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,620
Yinyin used her memories about me

317
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,560
in exchange for Nuwa's tear?

318
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,790
I think so.

319
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:42,510
It must be like that.

320
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,100
How could you believe Heavenly Fox?

321
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,080
She must be unwilling

322
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,500
to let you be with Yinyin,

323
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,050
so she told you that.

324
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,230
I don't believe it.

325
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,600
If you don't believe it,

326
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,850
you'll know after you go to the Peace Hall.

327
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:03,730
The Peace Hall?

328
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:04,740
Yes.

329
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:05,990
The Peace Hall.

330
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,950
Heavenly Fox finally escaped from the Peace Hall.

331
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,250
But now she has come back to the Peace Hall.

332
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,740
I don't understand

333
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,350
why.

334
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:16,960
Wait.

335
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,210
I just want to remind you

336
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,840
you're the one who will face the calamity.

337
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,460
No matter when,

338
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,490
you shouldn't forget your responsibility

339
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,650
and the safety of the Three Realms.

340
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,650
Why are you looking at me like that?

341
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,800
You suddenly left Xixuan Mountains

342
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:07,700
and took us to the Monster Forbidden Zone mercifully.

343
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:10,530
Were you really helping us?

344
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,190
Of course I didn't do it to help you.

345
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,480
I did it to help my disciple,

346
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,599
Yinyin.

347
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,890
So you knew

348
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,040
about Master Iceberg and Nuwa's tear,

349
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:23,359
right?

350
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:24,730
Of course.

351
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,210
Master Iceberg is the most affectionate

352
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,570
in the monster clan.

353
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,090
In order to keep the one she loves,

354
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,210
she has been exchanging all kinds of treasures

355
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,870
with true lovers

356
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,670
in the Three Realms.

357
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,650
In exchange for what?

358
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,370
The most precious thing in the world.

359
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,030
That is, all the memories about their loved ones.

360
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,800
In order to help you,

361
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,790
I think Yinyin agreed.

362
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,100
No wonder she remembers everything,

363
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,100
except me.

364
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,200
Then what do you think?

365
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,610
Nuwa's tear is precious.

366
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,730
It can't be easily obtained.

367
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,840
It was you.

368
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,920
You tricked Yinyin and me into going to the Monster Forbidden Zone.

369
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,520
You wanted her to forget me

370
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,980
and everything between us.

371
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,210
Do you really think

372
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,820
I tricked you into going to the Monster Forbidden Zone?

373
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:22,940
Ji Ruochen.

374
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,350
I think you've forgotten

375
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,860
who insisted on taking Nuwa's tear

376
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,630
and who insisted on going to the Monster Forbidden Zone?

377
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,650
Yinyin knew you couldn't let go,

378
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,160
so she sacrificed herself to help you.

379
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,210
No.

380
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,410
No.

381
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,030
You can only blame yourself.

382
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,530
You can't let go of that sword,

383
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,980
the grudges, and the martial arts world.

384
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,130
You said you want to run an inn outside the border.

385
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,740
Can you let go of your righteousness

386
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,740
and responsibility of facing the calamity?

387
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,050
Do you still think I should be blamed for your breakup?

388
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,630
You should be blamed for that.

389
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,380
That's impossible.

390
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,040
Don't blame me.

391
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,100
I did it for your own good.

392
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,970
A man who cares about the world

393
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,020
will only drag you down.

394
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,620
You should stay here

395
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,350
and become the new Heavenly Fox.

396
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,340
Silly boy.

397
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:52,540
Master.

398
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:55,820
Yunfeng.

399
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,120
Goodbye. Master.

400
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,610
I'm leaving.

401
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,410
Yunfeng.

402
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:17,900
Silly boy.

403
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,240
If I'm hated by righteous sects,

404
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,260
will you really not dislike me?

405
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,630
If anyone dares to bully you,

406
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,990
I'll beat him up.

407
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,560
Ruochen.

408
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,540
I was worried about you.

409
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,770
Are you okay?

410
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,280
I thought you were going to die.

411
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,090
Ruochen.

412
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:09,920
Why?

413
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,660
Answer me.

414
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,660
Why?

415
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:18,510
Clerk.

416
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,950
From now on,

417
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,410
I'm going to forget you.

418
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,350
Yinyin.

419
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,040
Tell me.

420
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,330
What should I do?

421
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:38,700
Who's inside?

422
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:47,870
Yinyin.

423
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,860
What's wrong?

424
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,810
Are you unhappy?

425
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,410
No.

426
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,400
You're a grown man.

427
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,680
You always look like you are going to cry.

428
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:04,730
I'm really afraid that you'll be bullied after I leave Xixuan Mountains.

429
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:07,620
Use this.

430
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,590
Thank you.

431
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,130
What's wrong again?

432
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:22,660
Nothing.

433
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,490
Thank you.

434
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,700
I remember.

435
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,050
Your name is

436
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,130
Ji Clerk.

437
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:39,420
Yinyin.

438
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,440
Do you really remember?

439
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,730
I couldn't remember your name before.

440
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,770
But it just came to me

441
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,470
and I suddenly remembered

442
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,260
when you drank with me on the roof that day,

443
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:48,960
you told me

444
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,180
your name is Ji Clerk.

445
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:51,980
But

446
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,660
you don't have to be surprised.

447
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,070
Yes.

448
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,070
I told you that

449
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,320
when we drank on the roof that day.

450
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,630
By the way,

451
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,580
didn't you say

452
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,740
you wanted to come here to look for a friend?

453
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,560
Did you find her?

454
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:08,820
Yes.

455
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,330
But it's been too long.

456
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,670
She has forgotten me.

457
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,440
Oh.

458
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,380
I still couldn't keep her.

459
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,030
Look at you.

460
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,070
You nag here all day

461
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,590
about "I lost her again"

462
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,760
and "she disappeared again".

463
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,830
Can't you go get her back?

464
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,090
Get her back?

465
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,380
Even though she has forgotten you,

466
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,210
you can make friends with her again

467
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,070
and get to know her again.

468
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,340
Get to know her again?

469
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,840
Make friends with her again?

470
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:44,890
Yes.

471
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:45,910
Isn't it that simple?

472
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,550
It's better than

473
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,540
being sad here all day, right?

474
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,300
Yes.

475
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,050
You were right.

476
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,630
Thank you, Senior Yinyin.

477
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,440
You're welcome.

478
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,380
Be happy.

479
00:23:59,190 --> 00:23:59,890
I'm giving this back to you.

480
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,210
Keep it.

481
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:13,820
Yinyin.

482
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,490
Let's start over.

483
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,690
I'm so mad!

484
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,470
What

485
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,400
made you so mad?

486
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:32,810
It's all because of you.

487
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:33,910
Because of me?

488
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:34,580
Yes.

489
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,070
In early spring every year,

490
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,390
the Evil-Repelling Beasts will become irritated and howl.

491
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:39,830
But today,

492
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,230
it suddenly stopped howling.

493
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,170
It made me unable to sleep.

494
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,900
Now that you mentioned it,

495
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,740
I really didn't hear the Evil-Repelling Beasts

496
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:48,840
howl today.

497
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,820
What does it have to do with me?

498
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,030
Of course you have something to do with it.

499
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,620
You're drawing the charms.

500
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,290
Ji Ruochen said

501
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:02,380
we can't let the Evil-Repelling Beasts

502
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:03,290
howl to distract you.

503
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,170
So,

504
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,000
he found a way to shut them up.

505
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,370
Now,

506
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,160
you can focus on drawing charms.

507
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:10,810
But I can't even sleep.

508
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,140
How do you know I like chicken wings

509
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:14,960
instead of chicken feet?

510
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,810
And you know I don't eat the tangerine pith.

511
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,460
Didn't I scratch you just now?

512
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,740
It should be its turn.

513
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,960
Be good.

514
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:47,420
Fine.

515
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,540
I'm going to scratch both of you, okay?

516
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,260
Stop licking.

517
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:08,960
Yinyin.

518
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:10,460
What did you call me?

519
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,490
Senior Yinyin.

520
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,690
Enough.

521
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:17,960
Be quiet.

522
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,660
Go have fun yourselves.

523
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:19,830
And

524
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,930
don't howl again.

525
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,180
If you howl,

526
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,330
I'll remove your hair on the tail.

527
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,850
In Xixuan Mountains,

528
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,270
Senior Yinyin is the best.

529
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,520
They only listen to you.

530
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,590
Did Xuanzhen tell you that?

531
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,430
When did he become a busy-body?

532
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:46,240
I'm giving you this again.

533
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:46,850
Clean your hands.

534
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,130
I know

535
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,140
you want to thank me for what happened yesterday.

536
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,780
But you don't have to

537
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,800
do this.

538
00:26:58,370 --> 00:26:59,360
Do you really think

539
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:02,720
I treat you well

540
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,010
because of what you did last night?

541
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,440
What else could it be?

542
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:08,390
Fine.

543
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,720
Whatever you say.

544
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:12,720
We have plenty of time.

545
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,700
There's no rush.

546
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:18,560
Plenty of time?

547
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,130
What's wrong?

548
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:23,250
Nothing.

549
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,340
You should rest well in the future.

550
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,490
Don't let others bully you.

551
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,000
Understand?

552
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,040
Under your protection,

553
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,320
is there anyone in Xixuan Mountains

554
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,420
who dares to bully me?

555
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,190
Sir. Miss.

556
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:58,870
Sorry.

557
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,280
Master went to see the Crown Princess.

558
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:00,930
But

559
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,280
Master knew you would come.

560
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,840
He has prepared rooms for you.

561
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,180
Should I take you to rest first?

562
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,530
When will the Imperial Advisor come back?

563
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,270
I don't know.

564
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,770
Maybe ten days.

565
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,740
Maybe two or three months.

566
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,230
Can you inform the Imperial Advisor

567
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,800
that we want to see him now?

568
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:16,780
Well...

569
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,440
It's not convenient.

570
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,920
Why don't you stay here

571
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:20,950
and wait in the temple?

572
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:21,900
Ridiculous!

573
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,290
Please lead the way.

574
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:28,640
Okay, please come with me.

575
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:31,960
Qing.

576
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,060
What do you mean?

577
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,630
Do you really want to stay in this temple

578
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,410
and wait for him?

579
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,150
You didn't meet him when he went to Qingxu, right?

580
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:40,420
Just wait.

581
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:42,920
But

582
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,940
do you really believe what Sun Guo said in the letter?

583
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,580
Whether we believe it or not,

584
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,650
we have to be here.

585
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,270
Actually, you can...

586
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:57,730
Qing.

587
00:28:58,810 --> 00:28:59,890
We have agreed long ago

588
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,520
to return to the God Realm after the 100th lifetime ends.

589
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,630
What's the point

590
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,980
of me going back alone?

591
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,270
Let's go.

592
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:42,720
You...

593
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,100
You're finally here.

594
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,750
If you still don't show up,

595
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,990
I will become like a stone.

596
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,200
How did you know I would come?

597
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,660
With your competitive personality,

598
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:01,960
you will leave

599
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,120
after you met all the people you should meet here.

600
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,980
You're attentive.

601
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,860
Then what are you doing here?

602
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,070
Do you want to go with me?

603
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:11,300
Yes.

604
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,020
I want to go with you.

605
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,960
Back then, I chose the righteous cause for the world

606
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,830
and ignored the person I love.

607
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,130
But it's different this time.

608
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,490
No matter where you go,

609
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,620
I will be with you.

610
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,310
You have a friend, right?

611
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,810
You said you want her to remember you again.

612
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,300
Having you is enough.

613
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:51,490
Yinyin.

614
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,180
Yinyin, what's wrong?

615
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:05,430
Yinyin.

616
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:06,370
Yinyin.

617
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:07,590
Yinyin.

618
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,700
Is she having flashbacks?

619
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:22,190
I'm sorry.

620
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,180
I didn't mean to let you suffer so much.

621
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,100
What are you waiting for?

622
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,240
Come and help.

623
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:52,850
Yinyin.

624
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:53,890
Are you okay?

625
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,390
Are you feeling better?

626
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:01,860
Who are you?

627
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,180
Master.

628
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,670
Why are you here?

629
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,190
I came out to get some stretches.

630
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:12,270
Stay here.

631
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,820
I have something to tell him.

632
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,640
You. Come with me.

633
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,230
Why can't Yinyin recognize me again?

634
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:29,640
What do you think?

635
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,720
She has forgotten you again.

636
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,130
Impossible.

637
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,610
What is impossible?

638
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,500
Do you think

639
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,210
Master Iceberg

640
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,500
doesn't know your tricks?

641
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,350
I'm not afraid to tell you the truth.

642
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,020
From the moment Yinyin got Nuwa's tear,

643
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,490
she can never fall in love with you again.

644
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,550
No matter what you do,

645
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,140
it will be useless.

646
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,410
Even if she gets to know you again,

647
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:53,850
she will still forget you

648
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,600
once she falls in love with you.

649
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,040
And

650
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,630
the more deeply she falls in love,

651
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,400
the more thoroughly she will forget you.

652
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,300
I don't believe she will forget me.

653
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,030
I will find a way

654
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:09,840
to make her know me again.

655
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:11,630
What is it?

656
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,220
Do you want her to suffer

657
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,280
the pain of heart breaking and soul devouring again and again

658
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,140
and forget you again and again?

659
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:19,850
Ji Ruochen.

660
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,840
You said you love Yinyin.

661
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,820
But you're torturing her like this.

662
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,440
If you really love her,

663
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,300
don't hurt her anymore.

664
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,060
Do what you should do.

665
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,300
Don't let her down.

666
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,590
Master.

667
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,160
Who is he?

668
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,050
He's just an unimportant person.

669
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,210
Let's go.

670
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:17,139
Master.

671
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:18,600
No need to say anything.

672
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,969
Hierarch Ziwei has been waiting for you.

673
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,560
Master.

674
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:42,880
Ruochen.

675
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:44,440
You have regained your cultivation.

676
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,070
Congratulations.

677
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:47,440
Master.

678
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,659
I've recovered,

679
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:51,690
but I have countless questions in my heart.

680
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,570
I hope you can help me.

681
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,450
You mean Nuwa's tear?

682
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:02,780
This treasure belongs to Master Iceberg in the monster clan.

683
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,230
You can never take back

684
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:07,410
what you exchanged with her.

685
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,440
However,

686
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,540
you still have a chance

687
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:14,540
to let Yinyin remember you again.

688
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,800
Please tell me.

689
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,400
The person Yinyin knew

690
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,870
is Ji Ruochen who was taken back by me

691
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,260
to Xixuan Mountains from the inn outside the border.

692
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,540
But where did you come from?

693
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:31,050
Are you a human or a demon?

694
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,670
I'm afraid

695
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,860
even you don't know about it.

696
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,470
Master.

697
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,230
Are you talking about

698
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:41,220
the Blue Fire in my body?

699
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,570
Ruochen.

700
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,240
Give me your hand.

701
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,840
What on earth is this?

702
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,010
Why did Yinfeng say it's a demonic object

703
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,210
when he saw it?

704
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,280
When I was outside the border,

705
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,860
Zhang and Huaniang

706
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,920
also asked me to hide it.

707
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,480
Do they know something too?

708
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,510
This fire is neither good nor evil.

709
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,500
If you use it to do evil things,

710
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,520
you'll be a demon.

711
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,810
If you use it to save the world,

712
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,720
you'll be righteous and decent.

713
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,240
If you practice it successfully,

714
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:34,800
you will be reborn and will rebuild your soul.

715
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,590
By that time,

716
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:38,990
Yinyin may remember you again.

717
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,710
Please tell me

718
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,480
how to practice this technique.

719
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,310
Since you were born with it,

720
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,110
you need to figure it out yourself.

721
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,460
What I can tell you is

722
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:57,030
it comes from the Nine Hells, the forbidden place in the Three Realms.

723
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,270
There is a tower there.

724
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,050
It's called the Demon Tower.

725
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:04,530
The tower was built with the Blue Fire.

726
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,790
The Demon Tower?

727
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,790
I think I have seen this tower somewhere.

728
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,420
In that tower,

729
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,400
the Blue Fire flashed across my eyes.

730
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,130
The tower has been built.

731
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:24,650
If we let it break out of the Nine Hells

732
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,730
and come to the mortal world,

733
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:30,000
the Three Realms will be in chaos,

734
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,500
and all living things will suffer.

735
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,330
In the Three Realms,

736
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,000
only you

737
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:38,550
can stop it from coming out.

738
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,630
This is also the real reason

739
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,520
why I brought you back to Xixuan Mountains.

740
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:48,640
Master.

741
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,760
You mean

742
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:52,800
I should destroy this tower?
