[Divine Destiny]

3
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,979
[Episode 31]

4
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,780
It looks like Ziwei Zhenren

5
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,420
hasn't come out from his seclusion yet.

6
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,090
Right.

7
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,130
He's about to become an immortal.

8
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,670
Who wants to care about

9
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,120
the lives of mortals like you?

10
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,510
Ziyang.

11
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,060
As the acting hierarch,

12
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,950
you'll suffer great losses this time.

13
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,720
Maybe this is

14
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,140
Xixuan's calamity.

15
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:30,579
Imperial Advisor.

16
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:31,920
Your Grace.

17
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,740
Everyone.

18
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,990
I'm willing to give you my life.

19
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,790
Please

20
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,070
let the disciples of Xixuan

21
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,540
live.

22
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,110
Stop pretending.

23
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,210
Xixuan Sect

24
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,440
went against the righteousness

25
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,410
and destroyed the spiritual caves.

26
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,100
You have this

27
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,730
coming.

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,350
Everyone.

29
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,110
Aren't you all the victims

30
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,660
of Xixuan Sect's wrongdoing?

31
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,950
You should surrender and admit your guilt.

32
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,920
How dare you

33
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,510
pretend to be pitiful here?

34
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,840
You're just like

35
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,960
your dead disciple.

36
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,010
Everyone.

37
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,360
There are many treasures in Xixuan Mountains.

38
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,740
-If you want...
-Ziyang.

39
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,640
I can have the treasures too

40
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,870
after you die.

41
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,430
Who dares.

42
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,360
Yinyin.

43
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:41,930
You're still alive.

44
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,770
Sorry I'm late.

45
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:43,850
Where is Ruochen?

46
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:44,750
He

47
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,450
is probably hiding at the foot of the mountains.

48
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,310
It's the Universal Cannon.

49
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,460
It can even break the Luoran Formation.

50
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,030
It can kill us all.

51
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:55,990
Calm down.

52
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,090
I practiced divine arts.

53
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,340
I wonder if I'm a match.

54
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,560
It's finally time to become famous.

55
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,820
What is becoming famous in a battle?

56
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,520
Let me show you.

57
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,230
Wonderful! Wonderful!

58
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,170
The Dragon and Tiger Universal Cannon.

59
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,959
Dragon Elephant. White Tiger.

60
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,769
That's it? How dare you show off?

61
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,529
You even practiced divine arts.

62
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,380
Who is behind you?

63
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,000
Yinyin, get your friends out of here.

64
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:25,880
Don't get them implicated.

65
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,860
What are you waiting for?

66
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,700
Let's kill these losers.

67
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,310
Kill them!

68
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,110
Kill!

69
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,530
Ji... Ji Ruochen?

70
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,950
He... He's still alive.

71
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,430
You're not dead?

72
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,260
-Mr. Ji.
-Ruochen.

73
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,280
I am Ji Ruochen.

74
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,390
Master.

75
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,680
Poor kid.

76
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,940
I only knew Xixuan Sect

77
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,580
colluded with the monster clan.

78
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,130
I didn't know

79
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,680
you even colluded with the demon clan.

80
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,030
Xixuan must be destroyed.

81
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,230
It's unforgivable.

82
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,040
Didn't you say you want the treasures?

83
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,900
Now,

84
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:43,240
why do you want to kill again?

85
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,210
I have a treasure here.

86
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,240
I wonder if you want it.

87
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,620
This...

88
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:02,370
What's going on?

89
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,510
Look! Spiritual caves!

90
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,600
Why are there new spiritual caves?

91
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:11,610
Why are there still spiritual caves?

92
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,150
Yes, there are new spiritual caves.

93
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,860
Look carefully.

94
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,760
It doesn't matter even though the spiritual caves have been destroyed.

95
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:24,690
Well.

96
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,920
We have small ones now.

97
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:32,980
Spiritual caves.

98
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,100
Spiritual caves.

99
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,270
Spiritual caves. Spiritual caves.

100
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:43,930
No!

101
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,750
Spiritual caves. Spiritual caves. Spiritual caves.

102
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,410
It's just a map.

103
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,090
If I'm happy,

104
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,390
I can give it to you.

105
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,170
But you

106
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,060
want to attack my wife's sect

107
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,260
and bully her.

108
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,820
You even want to kill her.

109
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,510
No one will be happy.

110
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,360
If I'm unhappy,

111
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,250
no one can be happy.

112
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:25,740
Ji Ruochen.

113
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,450
Who is your wife?

114
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,450
Zhang Yinyin, the chief disciple of the Taixuan Palace.

115
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,620
She is my wife.

116
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,120
Yinyin, you…

117
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,260
No, no.

118
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,480
I'm not his wife.

119
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,180
What are you talking about?

120
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:47,950
Everyone.

121
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,630
I think you know the way

122
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,570
down the mountains.

123
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,020
When you're still alive,

124
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,610
go back to where you came from.

125
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,310
If you come to apologize one day,

126
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,150
Xixuan's hierarch

127
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,870
will still welcome you.

128
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,020
How arrogant!

129
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,940
You alone

130
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,890
can stop my army?

131
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,360
Imperial Advisor,

132
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,720
are you talking about the 100,000 soldiers from the Netherworld?

133
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,630
The army

134
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
has been driven back

135
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,430
by me and my wife long ago.

136
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,020
Driven back? How is that possible?

137
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,440
The army was driven back just like this?

138
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,620
If the Demon Emperor's men could come,

139
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,600
they would have arrived.

140
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,600
But now there is no sign of them.

141
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,850
Did Sun Guo lie to us?

142
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,100
Right. No sign of them.

143
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,640
Ji Ruochen.

144
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,260
Don't try to deceive us.

145
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,780
Everyone, follow me.

146
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,620
For the people in this world,

147
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,850
let's kill this demon.

148
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,290
Your Grace.

149
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,780
What's the rush?

150
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,010
Everyone else can leave today.

151
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,760
Only you

152
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,240
can't.

153
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,730
You caused chaos for your own greed.

154
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,710
And you killed Senior Yunfeng.

155
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,500
I must pay you back

156
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,380
for doing those things.

157
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,180
Do it now!

158
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,420
Diminish his arrogance.

159
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,580
Kill him!

160
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,440
Demon! He's a demon!

161
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,420
Run!

162
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,410
He's a demon!

163
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,870
He is a demon!

164
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,100
Honey.

165
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,300
Don't chase them.

166
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:56,980
Don't get hurt again.

167
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,520
Who is your wife?

168
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,780
Don't talk nonsense.

169
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,400
Although you saved Xixuan this time,

170
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,960
I won't forgive you if you do this again.

171
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,000
Yinyin.

172
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,000
Let's go.

173
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:13,790
Come.

174
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,830
Should I continue to call you Ruochen

175
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,840
or should I call you

176
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:53,820
Demon King?

177
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,350
Suit yourself.

178
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,660
It's just an address.

179
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,220
So you've been to the Nine Hells.

180
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:05,930
You want to ask

181
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,440
about the Demon Tower, right?

182
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,080
Who else asked?

183
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,020
Ji Tianxia.

184
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,570
If my guess is right,

185
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,440
he must be disappointed.

186
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,250
What about you?

187
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,550
Senior Ziwei was wrong about you.

188
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,840
Not just you were wrong.

189
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,770
You shouldn't have counted

190
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,350
on me alone.

191
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,220
The bigger the stake is,

192
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,210
the greater the odds are.

193
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:40,830
Really?

194
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,830
What about those who can't become the stake?

195
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,400
Xuanzhen. Qiushui. Senior Bingxian.

196
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,530
And Yinyin.

197
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,310
And the disciples who are still fighting with the enemies.

198
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,560
What are they?

199
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,630
Senior Yunfeng is dead.

200
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,440
If I didn't come today,

201
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,830
you wouldn't care about

202
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,160
their lives, right?

203
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,130
For justice,

204
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,760
sacrifice is inevitable.

205
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,000
Besides,

206
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,560
if not so,

207
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,160
you wouldn't have been forced back here.

208
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:26,780
Ruochen.

209
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,070
Although you have become the Demon King,

210
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,570
you still care about Xixuan in your heart.

211
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,110
Right?

212
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:34,640
Otherwise,

213
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,770
why would you come back

214
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,240
to save Xixuan?

215
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,160
I've become a demon now.

216
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,760
I don't want to destroy the tower either.

217
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,850
Now you've forced me back.

218
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,350
Do you think

219
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,250
it's helpful

220
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,560
to achieve your justice?

221
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,080
You are just not thinking straight for now.

222
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,350
Master.

223
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,530
Maybe this is the last time I call you Master.

224
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,190
Consider this kowtow

225
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,020
as the repayment for our master-disciple relationship.

226
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,520
From now on,

227
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,860
we'll go our separate ways.

228
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,390
Ruochen.

229
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,900
Ji Ruochen.

230
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,170
Ruochen.

231
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,240
Senior Qiushui.

232
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,780
I heard you were in the back of the mountains.

233
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,210
So I came to you right away.

234
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,060
What's the matter?

235
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:58,760
Ms. Huang and I

236
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,090
were stopping Qingxu Sect in the back of the mountains.

237
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,250
But we still let

238
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,230
Xuxuan escape.

239
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,620
Yinyin found it out.

240
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,540
You know her temper.

241
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,930
So she summoned the bird

242
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,390
and went straight to Qingxu to avenge his father.

243
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,280
If Jin Shan hadn't changed his mind suddenly,

244
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,730
we wouldn't have failed.

245
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,920
I wonder what Ziyang told him.

246
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,730
Instead, Zhenwu Temple got the advantage.

247
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,830
We were defeated in the back of the mountains.

248
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,740
I don't think Sun Guo and the others could be any better.

249
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,250
Not really.

250
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,360
They have the support of the Netherworld.

251
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,340
It's enough to destroy Xixuan.

252
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,970
Yinfeng. Why are you here?

253
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,060
Did you leave your ascending behind

254
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,280
just to laugh at us?

255
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,130
You are injured.

256
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,270
Yinfeng.

257
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,390
It's fine that you and Gu Qing ran away.

258
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,270
But you're making sarcastic remarks here.

259
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,990
Don't think you can do whatever you want

260
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,520
just because you're Qingxu's guest.

261
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:52,810
It sounds like

262
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,510
you were used by Sun Guo

263
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,380
because of me.

264
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,070
You...

265
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:57,900
To be honest,

266
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,150
I don't care who is the winner

267
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,290
between you and Xixuan.

268
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,130
I'm still waiting here

269
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,060
because I want to say goodbye.

270
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,510
Since Gu Qing and I

271
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,849
are useless to you,

272
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,339
it's not wise of us

273
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,710
to keep staying here.

274
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,310
Bye.

275
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:20,599
What?

276
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:22,560
Are you going to side with

277
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,930
Zhenwu Temple after leaving here?

278
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,400
Don't think I don't know

279
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,690
your private deal with Sun Guo.

280
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,180
Helping you get the dharma-laksana back is a lie.

281
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,550
His real purpose is to win your support.

282
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,700
You should be the one

283
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,010
who was used.

284
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,730
You still want to be a couple of immortals?

285
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,530
You're daydreaming!

286
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,610
Report!

287
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:44,930
Report!

288
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,180
I just got the news.

289
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,240
Sun Guo's alliance was defeated by Xixuan.

290
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,140
What did you say?

291
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,450
Xixuan won?

292
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:51,480
Yes.

293
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,450
How is that possible?

294
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,180
We have 36 sects and 100,000 monster soldiers.

295
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,770
Was Xixuan Sect under the help of Heavenly Soldiers?

296
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,630
I heard it from those who escaped.

297
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:00,300
What did they say?

298
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,940
They said Ji Ruochen came back from the dead

299
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,180
and has become the Demon King.

300
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,050
He specially came back to help Xixuan.

301
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,260
His cultivation level has reached the peak of martial arts.

302
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,650
No one can stop him.

303
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,740
Ji Ruochen was killed by Gu Qing's sword.

304
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,370
Do you have any evidence to prove what you said?

305
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,310
Yes.

306
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:17,890
Zhenwu Temple asked me

307
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,260
to give this to you.

308
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,800
This...

309
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,220
What is this?

310
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,250
This is the ashes of Luo Xichen, the Crown Princess.

311
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,610
She was burnt to death by the Blue Fire of the Nine Hells.

312
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,980
She was really burnt to death and turned into ashes.

313
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,900
Have all the disciples of Qingxu retreated?

314
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,410
Almost, I think.

315
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,810
Hurry! Build a defense system now! Hurry!

316
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,470
Got it.

317
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,410
Thank you for risking your lives to save us.

318
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,620
Yun Zhong Ju

319
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,620
just took advantage of it.

320
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,900
You're welcome.

321
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:07,510
Bro.

322
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,100
Since I asked Ruochen to destroy the spiritual caves,

323
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,490
Yun Zhong Ju has cut ties with Xixuan Sect.

324
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,220
Why did you

325
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,260
help us

326
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,500
when Xixuan was in danger?

327
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,290
I was thoughtless before.

328
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,820
I've heard about

329
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:25,980
what happened in the Qingyuan Holy Land.

330
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,490
Qing was indeed reckless.

331
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,020
I put everything of Yun Zhong Ju at risk

332
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,880
when I came to save Xixuan this time.

333
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:33,660
You are right.

334
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,220
For the sake of my sincerity,

335
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,830
you should tell me

336
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,500
your real purpose

337
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,570
of destroying the spiritual caves.

338
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,770
Destroying the spiritual caves

339
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,130
was planned by Senior Ziwei before his seclusion.

340
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,760
I was only responsible for carrying it out.

341
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,030
I really don't know

342
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,440
the reason.

343
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,810
Still hiding from me.

344
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,010
Still hiding from me.

345
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,230
I caught a strange fish

346
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,570
when I was fishing.

347
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,500
That strange fish has definitely absorbed

348
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,690
too much spiritual energy.

349
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,580
That's why it's like that.

350
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,600
After you destroyed the spiritual caves,

351
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,390
so many strange things happened.

352
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,180
This is too coincidental.

353
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,350
Is there nothing wrong with it?

354
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:13,670
Bro.

355
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,420
Have you heard of the Demon Tower?

356
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,820
This strange fish is a sign that the Demon Tower will be born.

357
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,870
So

358
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,230
you destroyed all the spiritual caves to...

359
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:37,730
That's right.

360
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,450
Enough spiritual energy

361
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,340
is a must for cultivators.

362
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:41,890
At the same time,

363
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,650
it also reserves power

364
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,460
for the birth of the Demon Tower.

365
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,220
So we had no other choices

366
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:49,190
but to destroy the spiritual caves.

367
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,190
But now,

368
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,630
the Demon Tower will be born anyway.

369
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,480
There's nothing we can do.

370
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,260
Ziwei

371
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,400
took back the person who will face the calamity

372
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,650
because of this?

373
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,000
But his identity of a banished god

374
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,980
hasn't been confirmed.

375
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,580
Now he has become the Demon King.

376
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,250
I'm confused.

377
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,110
Bro.

378
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,110
He is not a banished god. But it's true that he will face the calamity.

379
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,420
I didn't expect that

380
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,520
although Ruochen did save Xixuan Sect,

381
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,250
he didn't destroy the Demon Tower.

382
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,990
My senior and I were careless

383
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,550
and lost the whole game.

384
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,090
Now,

385
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,130
he won't even accept me as his master.

386
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:33,820
You...

387
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,010
You planned everything.

388
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,680
In the end, your efforts are in vain.

389
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,020
Bro, tell me.

390
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,410
Ruochen killed the demons in Haofang.

391
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,860
Later, he took the risk

392
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:45,850
to destroy the spiritual caves.

393
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,420
He never hesitated.

394
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:50,250
He never asked why.

395
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,750
But this time, why did he...

396
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,510
In other words, the calamity of the Three Realms

397
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:57,950
will surely come.

398
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,510
Now, in order to save the Three Realms,

399
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,390
we'll have to try our best.

400
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,280
When the Demon Tower is born,

401
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,530
do the best.

402
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,090
Xixuan will face the calamity.

403
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,060
Yun Zhong Ju

404
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,630
can't be left behind.

405
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:24,760
Bro.

406
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,180
Have you decided?

407
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,650
I won't help you for nothing.

408
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,060
I have a condition.

409
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,690
Please go ahead.

410
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,940
I have decided the next

411
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,770
leader of Yun Zhong Ju.

412
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:42,980
Who?

413
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,160
Shang Qiushui.

414
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,340
Qiushui?

415
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,860
No. No. No.

416
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:52,110
Qiushui is a disciple of Xixuan Sect.

417
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,480
How can he be the leader of Yun Zhong Ju?

418
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,570
Why can't he?

419
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,780
Shi Ji has married him.

420
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,620
Shang Qiushui is my disciple.

421
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:00,970
Since he's my disciple,

422
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,280
it's natural for him

423
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,540
to be the leader of Yun Zhong Ju.

424
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,620
No, no, no.

425
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,470
All these years,

426
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,970
the secret techniques and books of the two sects...

427
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,140
All right.

428
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,920
I know what you're thinking.

429
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,140
Don't worry.

430
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,580
Yun Zhong Ju doesn't want

431
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,350
the secret techniques of Xixuan Sect.

432
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,500
On the contrary,

433
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,770
if he becomes

434
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,260
the leader of Yun Zhong Ju,

435
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,260
I'll teach him

436
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,800
all the secret techniques

437
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,980
of Yun Zhong Ju.

438
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,050
Will you lose anything in this deal?

439
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,720
No, no.

440
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,110
Xixuan Sect will

441
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,220
take great advantage of Yun Zhong Ju.

442
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:36,660
Hierarch Jin Shan.

443
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,350
Thank you.

444
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,350
Goodbye.

445
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,740
The seven secret volumes of the Book of Heaven.

446
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,290
Qing,

447
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,690
under the circumstances,

448
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,500
this is the only way I can think of.

449
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:16,760
Are you crazy?

450
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,880
If you cultivate the seven secret volumes of the Book of Heaven

451
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,160
in the mortal world,

452
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,300
you'll lose your mind

453
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:22,530
and die as the blood rushes to your heart.

454
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,160
It's none of your business.

455
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,100
Is it because I didn't kill him?

456
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:33,780
You know?

457
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,340
My cultivation of these secret volumes

458
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,770
has nothing to do with him.

459
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,990
Just let it go.

460
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,700
God's will

461
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,210
doesn't always remain unchanged.

462
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:50,350
It's not something we can control either.

463
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,530
There must be a predestined life

464
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,140
for someone who can resurrect.

465
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,050
Yinfeng,

466
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,420
maybe we were really wrong.

467
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,020
Just let it go.

468
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,000
I told you.

469
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,630
I'm not cultivating the secret volumes

470
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,120
because of that person.

471
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,800
It'll be too late if I don't hurry.

472
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,640
I'm not gonna watch you

473
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,470
destroy yourself.

474
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,030
Destroy myself?

475
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:25,920
Destroy myself?

476
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,500
What do you mean by that?

477
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,460
Even if I'll die,

478
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:32,010
he must die with me.

479
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,430
Even though he has become the Demon King

480
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,150
and has reached the peak of martial arts, so what?

481
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,440
Anyone who is bewitched by the Blue Fire of the Nine Hells,

482
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,010
according to the rules of the God Realm,

483
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,270
is definitely the enemy of the Three Realms.

484
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,540
If he comes for revenge,

485
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,680
I will do my best

486
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:46,740
to make him die with me.

487
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,030
You are crazy.

488
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,720
You're really crazy.

489
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,710
You've lost your mind

490
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,430
before cultivating the secret volumes.

491
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,510
In this world,

492
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,660
who is the real demon?

493
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:16,990
Gu Qing.

494
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,760
Please leave.

495
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:21,980
Don't disturb me again.

496
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:34,650
Qing.

497
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,830
I'm sorry.

498
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,300
I didn't tell you

499
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,600
about the secret of the seven secret volumes.

500
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,280
After I master this method,

501
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:50,450
I can give my dharma-laksana

502
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,140
to you.

503
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,060
I thought

504
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,680
I could still be with you.

505
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,230
It seems

506
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,720
my dream won't come true.

507
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:19,760
Hierarch.

508
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:20,960
What is it?

509
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,120
I'm here to apply medicine for you.

510
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,680
Are you blind?

511
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,130
I don't need you.

512
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,340
Get out.

513
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:29,860
Hierarch.

514
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,190
May I ask who hurt you?

515
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:32,730
Could it be

516
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,700
Huang Xinglan from the Taixuan Palace of Xixuan Sect?

517
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:37,820
How did you know?

518
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,050
Hierarch.

519
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,820
I think you are poisoned.

520
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,130
How dare you!

521
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,410
Don't talk nonsense in front of Hierarch.

522
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,610
Hierarch, there's something you don't know.

523
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,080
I heard that

524
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,720
Huang Xinglan from Xixuan Sect

525
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,250
has a kind of poison.

526
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,730
If someone is poisoned,

527
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,340
his five internal organs will rot within three days.

528
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,630
And he will be melted into water and die.

529
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:03,100
It is said that this poison is fragrant.

530
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:04,320
It smells good.

531
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,140
That's why it's called Night Powder.

532
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,280
Don't you smell anything?

533
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,660
Senior, there really is a strange fragrance.

534
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,140
Do you have a way to detoxify him?

535
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,190
Please allow me

536
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,060
to get closer to take a look.

537
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,450
Come here.

538
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:29,670
Yes.

539
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:38,800
How is it?

540
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,410
Tell me.

541
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,340
In my opinion,

542
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,760
the poison has spread to the bones.

543
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,490
He will die soon.

544
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,090
Xixuan's monster is trying to assassinate Hierarch.

545
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:14,990
It's unforgivable.

546
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,960
Kill her.

547
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,200
Set up the Four Spirits Formation.

548
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,640
Kill her today.

549
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,410
Yes.

550
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,590
You are just a five-tailed fox monster.

551
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,450
How dare you break into Qingxu alone?

552
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,400
Although I suffered

553
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,710
in the battle with Xixuan,

554
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,460
if I can

555
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,250
send your head to Xixuan Sect,

556
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,420
I can save face.

557
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,470
Fortunately, her face is not badly injured.

558
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,560
If her face is ruined,

559
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:03,960
even if we send it to Xixuan,

560
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,470
her parents may not recognize her.

561
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,380
I'm tired.

562
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,850
Finish this quickly.

563
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,780
Six tails?

564
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:12,630
No. That's impossible.

565
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,170
Even for Heavenly Fox,

566
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,700
it takes 200 years to have one tail.

567
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,430
How did you do that?

568
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:23,130
It was all because of you.

569
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:32,790
Senior.

570
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:35,710
Senior!

571
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,460
Senior!

572
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:39,700
Father.

573
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,340
I finally did it.

574
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,340
Guards.

575
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,120
Avenge Hierarch.

576
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:52,820
Hurry!

577
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:33,909
Yinyin.

578
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,750
Junior Ruochen.

579
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:40,909
I'm sorry.

580
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,150
I'm late.

581
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,250
I did it.

582
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,150
Sorry.

583
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,340
Take a good rest.

584
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,280
Today, Qingxu

585
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,060
went against the rules.

586
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,860
I will burn this place to ashes.

587
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,130
All evil people

588
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,280
must bear the consequences.

589
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:40,510
The world must get rid of evil people.

590
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,350
Don't panic.

591
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,560
Just some evil tricks.

592
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:45,930
Follow my order.

593
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,920
Obey the will of Hierarch.

594
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,880
Kill this demon with me.

595
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:51,990
Go! Go!

596
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:53,710
Go!

597
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,440
Go now!

598
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,180
I didn't expect

599
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,930
you managed to master the Blue Fire of the Nine Hells.

600
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:13,250
Ruochen.

601
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,140
You've lost your mind. You're incurable.

602
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,370
If you kill innocent people again,

603
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,820
I will kill you again.

604
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,880
What I owe you

605
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,630
was paid off

606
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,830
in the Qingyuan Holy Land.

607
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:39,590
If you insist on stopping me today,

608
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,860
I don't mind

609
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,220
if I have to kill you.

610
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:51,390
Ji Ruochen.

611
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,020
As long as I'm here, I won't let you touch her.

612
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,230
That's great.

613
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,100
I'll kill you first

614
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,320
and kill her then.

615
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,470
Ji Ruochen.

616
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,510
I secretly injected divine power

617
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:25,320
into Gu Qing's sword.

618
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,620
From beginning to end,

619
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,620
I'm the one who wants you dead.

620
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:29,830
If you want to take revenge,

621
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,120
just come at me.

622
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,250
Okay.
