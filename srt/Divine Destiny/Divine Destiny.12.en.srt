00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,020
[Episode 12]

4
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,630
But Master,

5
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,440
actually, I am not a banished god.

6
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,479
I already knew that.

7
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,550
I can see the truth from the small details.

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,190
Do you think you can fool me

9
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,560
with your simple tricks?

10
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,450
I think

11
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,570
the reason why my senior let you join Xixuan

12
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,190
is not that you're a banished god.

13
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,450
Then why?

14
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,280
It's for the Three Realms.

15
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,820
Ruochen,

16
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,960
a catastrophe will soon occur

17
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,380
on the Three Realms

18
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,130
And you are

19
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,910
the only one who can save the Three Realms.

20
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,480
Master.

21
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,350
I'm just a mortal.

22
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,579
An infortune is tied to my fate

23
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,590
and shortens my lifetime.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,730
How can I save the Three Realms?

25
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,520
When the time comes,

26
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,650
you will know what you're capable of.

27
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,100
But this news

28
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,650
concerns the safety of the Three Realms

29
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,550
and the foundation of Xixuan Sect.

30
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:51,980
So I would like you

31
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,290
to keep it as a secret for now.

32
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,280
If they know you are a fake banished god,

33
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,840
not only will you be a public enemy,

34
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,000
bur our whole sect will suffer.

35
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,130
So, to keep lying about

36
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,810
my fake identity,

37
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,600
you asks me to marry Gu Qing.

38
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,050
For you.

39
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,760
For Xixuan.

40
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,970
And for the people.

41
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,680
You have to do this.

42
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,780
But Master,

43
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,390
the bluestone's real owner is Yinfeng

44
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,200
He is the one that made promise with Gu Qing

45
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,310
Gu Qing mistook the wrong bluestone.

46
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,750
That's why she mistook the wrong marriage.

47
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,850
I can't keep making mistakes.

48
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,950
Master, please withdraw your decision.

49
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,690
Yinfeng is the real banished god.

50
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,640
But he has long lost

51
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,030
the kindness of being a god.

52
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,070
He doesn't care about the people,

53
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,260
and shows no signs of empathy.

54
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,610
he doesn't deserve to be a god.

55
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:00,820
But you

56
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,790
have an important thing to do.

57
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,620
You have to do it for the Three Realms.

58
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,500
Whether it's an immortal destiny

59
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,570
or a mortal destiny,

60
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,670
following destiny is God's will.

61
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:19,410
Disobeying destiny is also God's will.

62
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,100
I've made up my mind.

63
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,950
Master, please withdraw your decision.

64
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,760
The wedding day has been decided.

65
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,120
Elder Jinshan and Fairy Gu Qing had agreed

66
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,970
It's hard to make any more changes now.

67
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,510
So what if I go against the God's will?

68
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,580
Nonsense!

69
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,840
I know you have already proposed

70
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,750
with Zhang Yinyin a long time ago.

71
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,120
But the situation is different now.

72
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,880
If Yinyin knows the reason,

73
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,409
surely she would understand.

74
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,040
No, she won't.

75
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,280
Forget it.

76
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,670
Come with me to meet someone.

77
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,630
You can make the decision yourself

78
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,180
after seeing him.

79
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,290
Bye, uncle.

80
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,680
Bye, Ling!

81
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,760
A mortal's destiny should be forgotten

82
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,820
Just

83
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,010
don't forget to come back.

84
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,130
Ruochen.

85
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,520
Go and have a look.

86
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:31,550
Mistress.

87
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:42,909
Ruochen.

88
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,350
I have a request.

89
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,810
What is it, mistress?

90
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,340
As long as it is within my abilities,

91
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,290
I will do it.

92
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,540
Then I'll take it as a promise from you.

93
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,050
Master Jingxiao, he...

94
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,540
He's not dead yet.

95
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,570
Although his whole body has been petrified,

96
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,420
he still has a chance of survival.

97
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,860
To save you,

98
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,100
Jingxiao Zhenren got poisoned

99
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,710
If he did not risk himself to save you

100
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,490
the one laying on the bed now

101
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,659
would have been you.

102
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,880
It is all my fault.

103
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,430
Don't be too sad.

104
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,490
I have found a way to cure him.

105
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,860
What is it?

106
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,170
The Secret Arts of Yun Zhong Ju.

107
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,300
As long as Elder Jinshan is willing to help,

108
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,840
the poison will be cured immediately.

109
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,130
Yun Zhong Ju?

110
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,810
But Elder Jinshan said,

111
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,600
if you want him to save Jingxiao

112
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,190
you must agree to marry Fairy Gu Qing.

113
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,990
The marriage between the two sects

114
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,680
will unite us into a family.

115
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,429
Ruochen,

116
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,970
in order to save you,

117
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,270
Fairy Gu Qing lost all her immortal powers,

118
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,150
and can't go back to the God realm.

119
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:43,700
So you already owe her a big favor!

120
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,020
Elder Jinshan cares for his disciples a lot

121
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,740
He won't just let it go!

122
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,320
He won't just watch

123
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,140
Fariy Gu Qing's love for you

124
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,370
getting ignored!

125
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,310
I do owe Gu Qing a favor.

126
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,360
And I will repay her back when I can

127
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,090
But I will not repay her like this.

128
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,350
I cannot disappoint Yinyin.

129
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,670
You cannot change my mind.

130
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,820
I will not marry anyone in this world

131
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:10,810
except for Yinyin.

132
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,210
If I really agree to marry Gu Qing

133
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,670
just for the sake of repaying her.

134
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,990
Action like this

135
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,340
will only hurt Gu Qing even more.

136
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:21,880
You...

137
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,090
So will you marry her

138
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,770
or not?

139
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:37,950
Ruochen.

140
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,690
We have already made countless enemies

141
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,180
in the battle of Haofang.

142
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,330
If we lose our alliance with Yun Zhong Ju,

143
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,490
then Xixuan Sect

144
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,420
will have no allies left!

145
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,690
And if anyone doubts your identity

146
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,270
of being a banished god,

147
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,670
the other sects will surely gang up on you.

148
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,550
Our enemies will join forces to attack us.

149
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,000
Xixuan will be in great danger.

150
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,280
Ruochen,

151
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,750
you are destined to suffer.

152
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,240
The safety of the Three Realms is on you.

153
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,400
So there are things

154
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,160
that you can't just do for yourself.

155
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,450
For the sake of the world,

156
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,500
unite Yun Zhong Ju with marriage

157
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,370
and keep your identity as a banished god.

158
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,830
That is the only way to prove Tao.

159
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,080
Ruochen.

160
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,030
You may ignore the Sect's righteousness

161
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,990
But Master Jingxiao

162
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,520
became like this because of you.

163
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,730
I can live without a husband,

164
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,700
but Yinyin can't lose her father.

165
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,270
If she knew that her father is dying

166
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,530
and you just left him to die,

167
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,720
she would be so sad

168
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,190
and heartbroken.

169
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,660
Hang it higher.

170
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,750
Hurry up.

171
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:24,660
Okay.

172
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:25,870
More to the left.

173
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,450
This way.

174
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,470
Alright, bring it here.

175
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,460
Hurry up, okay?

176
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:30,870
Sure, no problem.

177
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:31,620
It's here.

178
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,260
What about me?

179
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:32,950
You can take it.

180
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:33,710
Clean it up.

181
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:34,950
Be careful.

182
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,620
Okay.

183
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,710
Hang it straight.

184
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,750
This is beautiful.

185
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,690
Yes.

186
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,150
I thought you wouldn't agree with it.

187
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,790
Why do you do so?

188
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,280
You can't disobey your master's order?

189
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,140
We are already engaged.

190
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,320
Is the reason important?

191
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,530
I just want to ask you

192
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,420
is it really your idea

193
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,440
to agree to this marriage?

194
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,530
You can tell me now

195
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,040
if you really don't want to.

196
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:20,980
I agreed to this too.

197
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:30,650
Okay.

198
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,560
I'm relieved to hear that.

199
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,030
Once our marriage is confirmed,

200
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,830
don't go back on your words.

201
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,710
From now on,

202
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,060
we are a couple,

203
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,730
and we'll live and die together.

204
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,490
Don't let me down.

205
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,370
It's windy.

206
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,900
Let's go back.

207
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,410
That guy from Xixuan Sect is so lucky!

208
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,950
Not only did he not die,

209
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,480
but he also got a beautiful wife!

210
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,520
Why don't we have such luck?

211
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,970
Ji Ruochen.

212
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,110
Any news from Xixuan Sect?

213
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,480
What kind of news?

214
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,640
Ji Ruochen is not dead.

215
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,390
He's still alive and well.

216
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,510
More importantly,

217
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,390
according to the disciples down the mountain

218
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,020
Xixuan Sect let him engage with Gu Qing.

219
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:10,630
The wedding ceremony will be held soon!

220
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,530
Wedding?

221
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,140
Wedding?

222
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,730
They're going to have a wedding?

223
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,410
But Qing knew

224
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,380
I am the real owner of bluestone.

225
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,300
Ji Ruochen is just

226
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,560
a fake replacement for the banished god!

227
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,270
Qing.

228
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,140
Qing.

229
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,170
How could she be so foolish?

230
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,760
Even a god

231
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,540
will be influenced in the mortal world.

232
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,780
How could you expect otherwise!

233
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,430
You can only blame yourself!

234
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:48,860
You should have killed Ji Ruochen

235
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,230
when you had the chance back then!

236
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,040
That would've solved many problems!

237
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,200
No.

238
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,430
Qing can't get married.

239
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,380
I want to take her back to Qingxu

240
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,290
and seek after Tao with her.

241
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:02,830
Qing

242
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,220
You lost half of your magical prowess.
Qing.

243
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:04,750
Wait for me.

244
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,740
I’ll find the immortal’s face for you.

245
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,150
Big and sweet candied hawthorns.

246
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:15,740
Sugar figures?

247
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,020
There are sugar figurines, do you want some?

248
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,890
Crispy sugar figures. Come and have a look.

249
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,710
Boss, I want one.

250
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,130
It tastes crispy and sweet.

251
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,850
Sugar figurines.

252
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,090
It's crispy, sweet and pretty.

253
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,990
Sugar figurines!

254
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,190
We're almost at Xixuan Mountain.

255
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,590
That's my place.

256
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,270
There are many delicious food and fun things

257
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:36,880
Let me show you around.

258
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,750
I'm not going there for fun.

259
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,430
I'm going to seek after Tao!

260
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:47,700
Jingxiu,

261
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,300
why don't we rent a horse?

262
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,320
Or we'll really be late for

263
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,430
the wedding ceremony of Xixuan Sect.

264
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,160
Wedding?

265
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,180
Misters!

266
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,910
You said Xixuan Sect is holding a wedding?

267
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:58,480
Yes.

268
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,540
A wedding of the Xixuan Sect's banished god

269
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:01,560
The banished god?

270
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:02,970
Then, who is the bride?

271
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,960
Do you have the invitation card?

272
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,830
Ordinary people like us

273
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,140
can't receive any formal invitation.

274
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,740
We are just going there to join in the fun.

275
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,950
But I hear that the banished god's bride

276
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,050
is also a fairy.

277
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,310
No, no. What fairy?

278
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,670
She's just a mortal.

279
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,040
A mortal.

280
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:17,810
We have to hurry.

281
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,430
Goodbye now.

282
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:18,880
Goodbye.

283
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,540
The bride is a mortal.

284
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,760
If I can go back to Xixuan alive,

285
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,140
I'll make it clear to Master Ziyang.

286
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,920
I'll propose our marriage at Taixuan Palace

287
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,740
This is such a serious matter.

288
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,410
He's so impatient!

289
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,070
So that's why he kept me there for so long

290
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,450
He must be secretly preparing our wedding

291
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,500
to give me a surprise!

292
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,060
Qingyi.

293
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,360
Let's hurry!

294
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,370
It'll be too late if we don't leave now.

295
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,280
What do you mean?

296
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,190
Those two guys were talking about

297
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,270
a wedding in Xixuan.

298
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:54,820
What did they mean?

299
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:55,710
Boss, keep the change.

300
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:56,890
Let's go!

301
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,329
He didn't eat again.

302
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:12,730
Take it away.

303
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:19,470
Forget it.

304
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,170
If you starve to death, it's your fault!

305
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,369
Let's go.

306
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,140
You cook his favorite vinegar fish today.

307
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,120
It's his loss if he doesn't eat it.

308
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,180
Do you remember Senior Yinyin

309
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,570
came over to learn from me for days

310
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,380
just to make this dish for Ruochen.

311
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,580
Xuanzhen.

312
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,490
Xuanzhen!

313
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:51,940
What are you doing!

314
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:52,480
Xuanzhen!

315
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,440
Ji Ruochen!

316
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,130
Ji Ruochen, come out!

317
00:17:58,990 --> 00:17:59,950
Explain yourself right now!

318
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,070
What kind of man are you to just hide?

319
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,730
Ji Ruochen!

320
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,130
So, you won't say anything?

321
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:11,470
Fine.

322
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,110
Then stay inside and never come out.

323
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,740
Don't come out for tomorrow's wedding.

324
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,700
Even if Yinyin comes back,

325
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,380
she doesn't want to see an unfaithful man!

326
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,030
You'll only make her sad.

327
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,470
Just stay inside for the rest of your life!

328
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,540
Ji Ruochen.

329
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,970
Enough, Xuanzhen. Leave him alone.

330
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,600
Let's go.

331
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,130
What are you doing?

332
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,260
The wedding ceremony is about to begin.

333
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,730
Please take your seats, hierarchs.

334
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,440
Please.

335
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,460
Take a seat.

336
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,180
Please.

337
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,160
It's the auspicious time.

338
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,150
Music please.

339
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,790
Auspicious time?

340
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,650
Have they timed our return?

341
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:05,930
Let's go.

342
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:09,920
The Hierarch of Yun Zhong has ordered

343
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,830
irrelevant ones are not allowed to go in.

344
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:12,530
Please leave.

345
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,480
Do you know who I am?

346
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,840
I'm the bride today!

347
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:16,770
I'm Zhang Yinyin.

348
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,940
Today's wedding is for Ji Ruochen

349
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,780
and Gu Qing, the Senior of our sect.

350
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,400
How is that possible?

351
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,750
Ji Ruochen said he won't marry anyone else.

352
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,420
His bride can only be me.

353
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,040
Today's wedding is for Ji Ruochen

354
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,520
and Gu Qing, the Senior of our sect.

355
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,390
Yinyin!

356
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,680
Yinyin!

357
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,470
Yinyin, are you all right?

358
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,270
Please come in, newlyweds.

359
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,310
That's impossible!

360
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:20,960
You can't go in.

361
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:21,760
Go away!

362
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,210
Senior Yinyin! Senior Yinyin!

363
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,090
If I can go back to Xixuan alive,

364
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,540
I'll propose our marriage at Taixuan Palace

365
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:45,980
Don't worry.

366
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,820
Wait for me.

367
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,010
Senior.

368
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,530
Senior.

369
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,560
Are you here to pick me up?

370
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:58,860
Senior.

371
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,770
Ziyang Master asks us to wait for you here.

372
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,640
The Hierarch lets us to tell you.

373
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,680
The so-called destiny

374
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,490
is just an illusion,

375
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:08,850
like a dream.

376
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,570
Why go against God's will?

377
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,590
Now Ji Ruochen is on the path to ascension

378
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,920
Men and Gods have different paths.

379
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,740
Please grant his wish.

380
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,890
Today,

381
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,620
you two hold the wedding in this palace.

382
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,310
It is a great joy

383
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,490
both for Xixuan and Yun Zhong Ju.

384
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,660
The Tao is difficult.

385
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,630
I hope you two can support each other,

386
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,740
tie the knot forever

387
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,240
and pursue the Tao together.

388
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,890
From now on,

389
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,730
you two will sermon together,

390
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,690
work together, and never abandon each other.

391
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,970
Don't let the masters of Xixuan Sect

392
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:00,030
and Yunzhong Ju down.

393
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,390
Yes, Master.

394
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,420
Senior.
Senior!

395
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,570
Move!

396
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,490
Senior!

397
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,280
Move!

398
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,450
Senior.
Senior.

399
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,040
Are you going to disobey Master?

400
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,270
Senior! Senior!

401
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,310
Senior, no!

402
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,150
Senior, no!

403
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,430
What is God's will?

404
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,230
Senior, no!
What destiny?

405
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,050
Senior, no!

406
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,950
I will to cut them all off.

407
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,460
The first ceremony for wedding

408
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,590
is to bow to each other.

409
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,300
Step aside!

410
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,310
Senior, no!

411
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,460
Step aside!

412
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:17,900
Ruochen.

413
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,450
Ruochen.

414
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,640
Bow to each other.

415
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,880
What's wrong?

416
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:04,810
What happened?

417
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,630
Go and have a look.

418
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:06,360
Get up.

419
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,030
Hurry up.

420
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,390
Who is this?

421
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:11,980
What is this?

422
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:12,780
Who does this?

423
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,040
It's a spirit. Five-tail fox spirit.

424
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:16,950
What's going on?

425
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,720
This is Xixuan. Why is there a spirit?

426
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,870
Very bold of you! Zhang Yinyin!

427
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:53,750
How dare you!

428
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,510
Guards, arrest her now!

429
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,390
Hierarch,

430
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,990
you taught us to help each other

431
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,860
like a family.

432
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:02,780
If we do it now,

433
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,570
it'll be like killing

434
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,900
our family.

435
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,220
Yes, Grandmaster.

436
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,110
Yes, Hierarch.

437
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:08,950
Yes, Hierarch.

438
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:09,950
Hierarch.

439
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,480
She is Senior Yinyin.

440
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,300
Yes.

441
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:48,650
Why?

442
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,440
Answer me!

443
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,460
Why?

444
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,550
Ding Ning.
Ruo Chen.

445
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:09,290
Ruo Chen, don't go.
Sister.

446
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,350
You said

447
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,480
you will propose our marriage

448
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,460
Only I can be your bride.

449
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,690
I thought we had a deal.

450
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:27,920
But in the end,

451
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,860
I am the only one who believed it.

452
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,830
Zhang Yinyin, are you done?

453
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,150
Today is my wedding day with Ruochen.

454
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39,020
Don't push him any more.

455
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:52,760
She says I am pushing you.

456
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,960
I'll only ask you one thing.

457
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,930
Will you marry her today?

458
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,060
My marriage with Ruochen has been made.

459
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:18,790
It won't change.

460
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,790
I'll return the bracelet

461
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:43,770
you gave me.

462
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,960
I'll forget

463
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,130
all the words you said,

464
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,930
and all your kindness to me.

465
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:58,480
Ji Ruochen,

466
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,520
I, Zhang Yinyin, don't care.

467
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,740
Clerk.

468
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,340
From now on,

469
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,710
I will forget you.

470
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,390
Senior.
Yin...

471
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,410
Ruochen!

472
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,190
Ziyang Hierarch.

473
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,910
The five-tail fox spirit caused such a mess!

474
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,800
She acted recklessly!

475
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,040
But we just let her leave like this?

476
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,310
It's our duty to kill spirits and demons.

477
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:57,660
How can we just sit and watch?

478
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,080
Capture and turn her spirit into an elixir

479
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,190
Isn't this better?

480
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,530
Go after her!

481
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:04,700
Ruochen!

482
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,130
Let's go.

483
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,860
How dare you! Where are you going?

484
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,110
Evil spirit, how can you run away?

485
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,590
The spirit's toxi.

486
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,190
Ruochen.

487
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,160
You can't go.

488
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,840
If you go, then what about me?

489
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,840
Qingyi, go!

490
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,900
They want to kill spirits!

491
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:44,740
I'm not leaving.

492
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:45,930
I want to be with you.

493
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,570
He abandoned you. But I will not.

494
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:11,870
Ruochen!

495
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,320
Yinyin.

496
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:27,690
Are you alright, Yinyin?

497
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:30,970
Go away.

498
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,160
I'm sorry.

499
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,720
I'm sorry.

500
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,080
I don't want to see you again.

501
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,150
Go away.

502
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,100
Yinyin.

503
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,000
Go away!

504
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,730
Go away!

505
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,660
Yinyin!

506
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,350
Ruochen! Ruochen!

507
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:47,810
Sister Yin, let's go.
Are you alright?

508
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:49,060
Yinyin!

509
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,600
Let's go.

510
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,760
We can't let them escape.

511
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,220
Yinyin!

512
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,010
Ruochen.

513
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,750
Aren't you ashamed enough?

514
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,250
Master.

515
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,680
Yin Yin has turned into a demon.
Shut up!

516
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,060
Since she is a spirit,

517
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,900
she should be killed on the spot.

518
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,200
But I let her go,

519
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,670
because she was my disciple.

520
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:15,220
The most important thing now

521
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,770
is your wedding with Fairy Gu Qing.

522
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,380
It can't be ruined because of an evil spirit

523
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,070
You two

524
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,170
escort Ruochen back to complete the ceremony

525
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,110
Master Ziyang.
Master.

526
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:29,070
I can't follow your order.

527
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:30,930
Ji Ruochen.

528
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,990
If you dare to take another step forward,

529
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,460
you're no longer the disciple of Xixuan.

530
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:40,710
Hierarch.

531
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:49,590
Ruochen.

532
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,300
Let's go back.

533
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:06,300
I can pretend nothing happened.

534
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:11,230
Gu Qing.

535
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:15,320
I'm sorry.

536
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,100
Ruo Chen.
You...

537
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,260
Ziyang,

538
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,750
how do you solve this ridiculous situation?

539
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:46,370
The auspicious time has passed.

540
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,409
The wedding will be held another day.

541
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:53,620
Yunfeng.

542
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:54,330
Yes.

543
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:55,480
See our visitors out.

544
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:55,980
Yes.

545
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,620
Hierarchs,

546
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,560
please go back.

547
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,510
Qing er.

548
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,060
Please leave.

549
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:02,770
Go back.

550
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:15,720
Yinyin!

551
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:17,970
Ji Ruochen!

552
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,040
Yinyin!

553
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,070
Ji Ruochen, come out!

554
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:25,550
Yinyin!

555
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,740
Ji Clerk! Come out!

556
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:33,330
<i>The moon is as clear as snow</i>

557
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:37,840
Who plays the farewell in the attic alley?

558
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:35,480
Yinyin!

559
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:46,410
<i>Love is like a butterfly</i>

560
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,030
Yinyin!

561
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,570
Why are you here so late?

562
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,490
I saw you were practicing the sword.

563
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,800
So I come to see how you're doing.

564
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:54,770
I'm drunk in dancing

565
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,280
I'm not done yet.

566
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,130
I can't get the key points.

567
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,770
Thanks for offering me advice, Senior.

568
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,230
Hand.

569
00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:01,450
[The lonely moon is as bright as snow]

570
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:57,720
Close your fingers.

571
00:35:58,790 --> 00:35:59,810
Gather your energy.

572
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:06,010
<i>A single shadow overlapped with faith</i>

573
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,760
Yinyin!

574
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:15,040
The bustling voices extinguish the leaves

575
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,310
Yinyin! Yinyin!

576
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:22,920
I can't help but cry

577
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:29,810
[Watching people flow like two worlds]

578
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:26,970
Yinyin!

579
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:34,530
I can't stop loving and hating

580
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:40,300
Your tenderness is far away from the world

581
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:38,990
Yinyin!

582
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:47,150
And I can only hug myself to be considerate

583
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:53,030
Disturbance stops when the lights are off

584
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,270
Yinyin!

585
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:57,800
There are still many obstacles in love

586
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,610
[Xi Xuan]

587
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:03,990
[You write the word "goose" on the paper.]

588
00:36:59,390 --> 00:36:59,940
Yinyin!

589
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:02,640
Yinyin!

590
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:12,020
I've had a glimpse in my heart.

591
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,470
Yinyin!

592
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,110
Yinyin!

593
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,280
Why do you come back,

594
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,310
instead of looking for her?

595
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,370
You know I am looking for her.

596
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,410
Why are you still here?

597
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,990
After all, I am also a banished god.

598
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,570
I'm not

599
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,400
at your beck and call.

600
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:44,410
Gu Qing.

601
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,080
If you're here to apologize,

602
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:49,520
then forget it.

603
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,730
I don't need your pity.

604
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,470
I just want to ask you one thing.

605
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:01,900
Ji Ruochen.

606
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:06,510
If you never loved me,

607
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,930
why did you agree to marry me?

608
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:14,880
Is that important?

609
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,290
Yes.

610
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:27,680
Because

611
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,410
you saved my life.
