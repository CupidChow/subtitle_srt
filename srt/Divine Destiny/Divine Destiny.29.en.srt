[Divine Destiny]

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,950
[Episode 29]

4
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,580
Only the blue flames in the Demon Tower

5
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,320
can remove the divine power in Yinyin's body.

6
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,380
No matter what, I have to try.

7
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,930
I finally see you.

8
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:33,430
Be careful, Ruochen.

9
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:20,420
Senior.

10
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,210
Senior.

11
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,660
Seniors.

12
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,680
Why did you gather us here

13
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,750
in secret?

14
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,860
You must have heard

15
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:30,970
the masters

16
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,020
quarreled about meeting the enemy attack.

17
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,260
But Hierarch still insists on defending without attacking.

18
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,960
Maybe he has his purpose.

19
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,730
But we can't wait any longer.

20
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,920
So you mean...

21
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,280
She means

22
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,740
when the sect is in danger,

23
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,340
young disciples like us

24
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,740
should surely step forward.

25
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,700
But I don't know if you

26
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,450
dare to disobey the order

27
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,810
and go down the mountains together.

28
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,820
Go down the mountains?

29
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,130
So you mean

30
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,570
you gather us to go down the mountains and launch a sneak attack on them?

31
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,380
Okay. I've wanted to do this long ago.

32
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,270
That's right.

33
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,140
Why should we always

34
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,210
hide in the mountains like cowards?

35
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,690
That's right. We can't hide anymore.

36
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,890
That's right. We can't hide anymore. Go down the mountains.

37
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,760
How long do we have to hide?

38
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,130
No more hiding. Let's go down the mountains.

39
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Go down the mountains.

40
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,860
Since you all agree with this,

41
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,900
let's meet at the mountain gate tonight

42
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,520
and go down the mountains together

43
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,090
to kill them all.

44
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,360
Yes. Good.

45
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,190
Kill them all!

46
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,930
-Kill them all!
-Yes.

47
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,250
Qing.

48
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,240
I thought

49
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,370
you had returned to the house in the bamboo forest.

50
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,750
I will leave.

51
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,940
But before I leave,

52
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:48,530
I want to ask you again.

53
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,190
Are you really going to

54
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,370
stay to help Sun Guo?

55
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,780
What are you gonna do if I say yes?

56
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,490
And what are you gonna do if I say no?

57
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,659
Yinfeng.

58
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,910
I'm afraid you'll regret in the future

59
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,150
if you help Sun Guo.

60
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,470
I help Sun Guo get rid of the evil man who destroyed the spiritual caves

61
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,950
for the people in this world.

62
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,220
Why will I regret?

63
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,530
Come with me then.

64
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:16,970
Come on. Drink.

65
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,100
Come on. Drink.

66
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,500
I heard that there are a lot of treasures

67
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,610
on Xixuan Mountains.

68
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,150
After we destroy Xixuan,

69
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,970
we can't waste

70
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,620
these things.

71
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,100
That's right.

72
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,110
Everyone.

73
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,380
When we launch an attack,

74
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,380
we shouldn't spare any disciples of Xixuan.

75
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,740
We must kill them all.

76
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,300
Yes.

77
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,700
Yes. Kill them all.

78
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,940
Don't let anyone escape.

79
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,420
That's right.

80
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,520
We shouldn't spare any male disciples.

81
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,500
But we should spare some female disciples.

82
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,150
Mr. Wangchen, what do you say?

83
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,620
You guys.

84
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,790
I don't want what you want.

85
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,950
I just want to go up the mountains

86
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,160
to kill my senior.

87
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,320
Everyone. Don't worry.

88
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:04,490
After we go up the mountains,

89
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,940
I'll make your wishes come true.

90
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,510
Come on.

91
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,560
Good.

92
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,110
Bottoms up.

93
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:10,940
Come on.

94
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,640
Bottoms up.

95
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,570
See?

96
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,200
They have their own purposes and have evil intentions.

97
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,140
They said they want to destroy Xixuan for the people in this world.

98
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,650
But it's just an excuse.

99
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,000
If you help people like them attack Xixuan,

100
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,500
will you really not regret

101
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,320
when you think of this in the future?

102
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,000
Please.

103
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,710
Good wine.

104
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:42,710
Well...

105
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,740
Everyone, please continue.

106
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,820
Hierarch Xuxuan, come with me.

107
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,320
Come on, let's drink.

108
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,990
Let's continue.

109
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,300
Come on. Continue.

110
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,380
Come on. Let me pour wine for you.

111
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,050
OK.

112
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,580
Yinfeng, you...

113
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,570
Since Imperial Advisor

114
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,810
is going to be busy with conquering Xixuan,

115
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,060
Qing and I won't bother you anymore.

116
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,490
We should leave now.

117
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,060
Hierarch Xuxuan. No need to chase them.

118
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,210
With Fairy Gu,

119
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,040
we can't keep Yinfeng here.

120
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,990
If they leave,

121
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,140
I'm afraid our attack on Xixuan...

122
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,360
Hierarch Xuxuan.

123
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,060
Don't worry.

124
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:28,090
I have a perfect plan.

125
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,250
Just us?

126
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,360
I've achieved a small accomplishment in practicing divine arts.

127
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:47,050
It's enough to conquer Xixuan's Wuya Formation

128
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,120
and those old men in the mountains.

129
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,400
I can't believe your divine arts

130
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,730
have reached such a high level.

131
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,180
I'm impressed.

132
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,210
Who are you?

133
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm the Demon King who once ruled the Nine Hells.

134
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,060
I'm also your father.

135
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,010
My father?

136
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,510
In the Three Realms,

137
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,950
only you and I have the Blue Fire of the Nine Hells in our bodies.

138
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,400
So I knew it when I saw you.

139
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,880
It's you, my child.

140
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,610
If it's true,

141
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:25,170
what happened here

142
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,160
back then?

143
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,640
Ten million years ago,

144
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,120
the Nine Hells transported spiritual energy to the mortal world

145
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,950
through the spiritual caves,

146
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,170
in a bid to maintain the balance in the Three Realms.

147
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,320
Back then, the Nine Hells was prosperous, and the people lived in peace.

148
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,120
It could be considered the most prosperous place

149
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,680
in the Three Realms.

150
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,500
Until High Immortal Taiyi showed up.

151
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,820
When the King of Immortals was in seclusion,

152
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,030
he took the chance and launched an attack on the Nine Hells.

153
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,660
He restarted

154
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,840
the Nine Hells' spiritual caves that transport the spiritual energy to the mortal world.

155
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,150
This led to a surge in the spiritual energy in the mortal world.

156
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,300
The Nine Hells was in chaos too.

157
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,740
What did he want?

158
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,140
Did he want to rule the Three Realms?

159
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,300
Yes.

160
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,560
He wanted to be the ruler of the Three Realms.

161
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,630
After he destroyed the Nine Hells,

162
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,650
he built the Demon Tower

163
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,340
on the throne ruins of the Nine Hells.

164
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,950
Once the Demon Tower is born,

165
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,380
it will become one with the Spiritual Tower

166
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,280
in the God Realm.

167
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,410
By that time,

168
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,010
High Immortal Taiyi can use this tower

169
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,260
to gain all the spiritual energy in the Heaven and Earth.

170
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,470
So Master deliberately

171
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,540
sent me here,

172
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,180
because he wants me to destroy it.

173
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,280
You and I are the same.

174
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,870
We were born with the Blue Fire of the Nine Hells,

175
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,010
the only thing in this world that can suppress the spiritual energy in the holy land.

176
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,170
After High Immortal Taiyi built the tower here,

177
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,210
he went after me.

178
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,660
At that time,

179
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,090
you were just born.

180
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,060
And I was seriously injured.

181
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,340
I knew I couldn't protect you.

182
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,100
So I asked the Double Saints

183
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,120
to get you out of the Nine Hells

184
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,190
to hide in the mortal world.

185
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,850
Are the Double Saints

186
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,260
Zhang and Huaniang?

187
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,630
Yes.

188
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,100
We predicted that

189
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,650
ten million years later,

190
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,930
High Immortal Taiyi will face a calamity.

191
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,800
If we destroy the tower by that time,

192
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,810
we can have a slim chance of winning.

193
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,080
So,

194
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,120
when the Double Saints took you to the mortal world,

195
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,850
I activated the hidden star in your fate,

196
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,380
which made you sleep for ten million years.

197
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,400
Until 20 years ago,

198
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,860
the Double Saints thought the time was right.

199
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,480
So they woke you up.

200
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,490
And they raised you as a normal person.

201
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,700
So

202
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,960
my hidden star is ten million years old.

203
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,780
After the Double Saints took you away,

204
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,550
I used my last energy

205
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,240
to seal my spirit

206
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,170
in this throne

207
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,420
before I died.

208
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,410
I did that for this day,

209
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,600
when you return to the Nine Hells.

210
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,630
Oh no.

211
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,260
The Demon Tower has sensed the Blue Fire of the Nine Hells.

212
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,330
This place is going to be destroyed soon.

213
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,100
My child.

214
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,450
You must successfully cultivate

215
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,850
the Blue Fire of the Nine Hells before that.

216
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:34,630
Otherwise,

217
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,820
you will be trapped in this tower forever.

218
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,510
Remember.

219
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,830
When you cultivate the Blue Fire of the Nine Hells,

220
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,450
don't be blinded by it.

221
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,510
Otherwise, it will grow too fast,

222
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,540
and you'll still turn into ashes.

223
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,150
My spirit

224
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,580
is going to disappear.

225
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,660
Let me help you one last time.

226
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:00,700
Remember.

227
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,600
You're the one who will face the calamity.

228
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,390
Only the Blue Fire in your body

229
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,400
can defeat High Immortal Taiyi.

230
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,180
Ruochen.

231
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,590
Ruochen, are you here?

232
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,390
Who are you?

233
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,020
So mysterious.

234
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,940
You can't even protect yourself.

235
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:15,540
And you are worried about someone else.

236
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:19,109
The love between you two is really touching.

237
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,210
But you came at the right time.

238
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,720
How despicable!

239
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,380
You took advantage of me!

240
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,070
Where did you take Ruochen?

241
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,260
You are still thinking about your lover?

242
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,630
You'd better not bother him now.

243
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,400
He's at the critical moment.

244
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,210
Ruochen.

245
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,150
It's useless.

246
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,140
Don't waste your strength.

247
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:17,830
Ruochen.

248
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,860
If you want a resurrection,

249
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,770
you must let the Blue Fire of the Nine Hells devour you first

250
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,340
and then turn it into your own power.

251
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,540
When the Blue Fire of the Nine Hells devours you completely,

252
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,250
you will see your inner demon.

253
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,450
Remember.

254
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,780
Don't be blinded by hatred.

255
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:42,260
♫With my sword, I face the world, breaking through the swirling sand♫

256
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,030
Thank you.

257
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:40,420
What are you doing?

258
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:47,280
♫How many high positions were obtained through deceit and trickery♫

259
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,300
It's boring to just kill you.

260
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,560
You made me suffer the pain of being separated from my loved ones.

261
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:55,360
♫Amidst the shifting sands, who will emerge as the winner in the end?♫

262
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,830
Of course I have to return the favor.

263
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,830
I'm going to let you know

264
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,090
what the real pain is.

265
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:00,530
♫Amidst the chaos and distractions, who can truly let go?♫

266
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,880
♫Not for leaving a mark in history or the glimmer of swords♫

267
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,850
♫The turbulent times change in an instant♫

268
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,760
♫It's all because of you and me, braving obstacles♫

269
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:19,580
♫I traverse the currents of time to be with you again♫

270
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,120
Ruochen.

271
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:26,140
♫I cross endless hills, vowing to stay true to our promises♫

272
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,720
Why are the two thrones the same?

273
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:33,200
♫The sun and moon witness the eternal enmity and grievances♫

274
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,330
Is Ruochen nearby?

275
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:31,980
Ruochen.

276
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,500
Ruochen.

277
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:39,220
♫I only wish to hold your hand and be by your side♫

278
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,420
Ruochen, can you hear me?

279
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:46,770
♫As long as I have you by my side, what more could I ask for in this lifetime?♫

280
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,870
It's useless.

281
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,570
Ji Ruochen is in the underground palace now.

282
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,910
And this place is the mirror image of the underground palace.

283
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,050
No matter how loud you scream,

284
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,170
he can't hear you.

285
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,610
The underground palace?

286
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,900
That's right.

287
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:03,250
The main hall of the Demon Tower is built based on the underground palace.

288
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:06,410
The decorations of the two halls are also the mirror images.

289
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:10,670
And your voice can't get through.

290
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,460
What is this?

291
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,100
Ruochen.

292
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,820
You must wake up.

293
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,590
Yinyin.

294
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,590
From now on,

295
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:06,620
I'll be yours.

296
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,510
If you need me,

297
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:09,650
blow this.

298
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,020
As long as I hear it,

299
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,160
I'll come to you anywhere and anytime.

300
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,150
That's a promise then.

301
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,220
It's the wooden bird I gave to Yinyin.

302
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,570
Yinyin.

303
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,570
My wife.

304
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,210
But why is this bird

305
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,010
here?

306
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,480
Ruochen,

307
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,560
you finally know how to control the Blue Fire of the Nine Hells.

308
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,500
Father.

309
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,330
Remember your mission.

310
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,670
Only you can save the Three Realms.

311
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,440
Father.

312
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,730
Only you can destroy this tower.

313
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,180
Ji Ruochen.

314
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,850
Are you really going to destroy the Demon Tower?

315
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,440
Who are you?

316
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,100
I am the tower.

317
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,270
You have mastered the Blue Fire of the Nine Hells.

318
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,570
You can break the seal and return to the mortal world.

319
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:32,250
But if you destroy this tower,

320
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,760
it will be a lose-lose situation.

321
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,040
A lose-lose situation?

322
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,380
That's right.

323
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,100
You don't know this, do you?

324
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,030
If you destroy this tower,

325
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,760
you won't be able to get out of the tower.

326
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:47,740
Do you think sacrificing yourself for the so-called righteousness

327
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,550
is worthwhile?

328
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,070
Do you still believe in

329
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,730
Ziyang's theory of righteousness at this moment?

330
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,040
Saving the Three Realms?

331
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,620
Protecting the world?

332
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,430
From beginning to end,

333
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,710
you're just his pawn.

334
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,120
Think about it.

335
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,130
How did you get to the Nine Hells?

336
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,290
How did you become like this?

337
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,360
They only told you to destroy the tower and protect the Three Realms.

338
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,090
But no one told you that

339
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,590
you can never go back.

340
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:21,950
Now,

341
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,950
do you still think

342
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,850
they are sincere to you?

343
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,350
You told me that,

344
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,740
because you're afraid that I'll destroy this tower, right?

345
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,980
Yes.

346
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,710
I'm afraid you'll destroy the Demon Tower.

347
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,070
But I told you all this

348
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,820
for your own good too.

349
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,320
You have mastered the Blue Fire of the Nine Hells.

350
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,100
You're the strongest in the world of cultivation.

351
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,650
You shouldn't be manipulated by anyone.

352
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:48,650
What?

353
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,750
Are you still hesitating?

354
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,580
If you don't think for yourself,

355
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,320
what about Zhang Yinyin?

356
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,830
Do you want her to die in the tower too?

357
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,180
What did you say?

358
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,230
Yinyin.

359
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,180
-Look.
-Yinyin.

360
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:21,110
She's also in the Demon Tower now.

361
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,810
If you destroy the tower,

362
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:26,180
you and I will not be the only ones to die.

363
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,930
She can only live if she leaves here.

364
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,750
Maybe like you said,

365
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:40,720
my power

366
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,640
is the strongest in this world.

367
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,710
That's right.

368
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,770
You've become the Demon King.

369
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,100
Once you return to the mortal world,

370
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,900
you will be invincible and kill anyone you want to kill.

371
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:58,460
Smart man, Ji Ruochen.

372
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,370
You are the King.

373
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,620
What are you waiting for?

374
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,970
Take her with you and leave.

375
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,540
Enjoy the supreme power

376
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:10,330
brought by your absolute strength.

377
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,610
What if

378
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,050
I still want to destroy this place?

379
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:20,420
Then you'll kill the person you love with your own hands.

380
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,230
Yinyin,

381
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,040
tell me what I should do.

382
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,380
Since the beginning,

383
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,760
I've been a pawn.

384
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,260
I thought I upheld righteousness.

385
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,190
But everything I did

386
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,310
was arranged by others.

387
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,090
And I got so many people implicated.

388
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,420
Maybe this time,

389
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,240
our good days

390
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,100
will really come.

391
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,940
It's time to end all of this.

392
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,300
That's right.

393
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,670
Take her with you and leave.

394
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,220
Go far away.

395
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,540
You are smarter than them.

396
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,260
You're more cunning than them.

397
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,030
High Immortal Taiyi.

398
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,900
There is no God's will at all.

399
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:45,590
Everything is about our own choices.

400
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,410
Fools live for others.

401
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,280
Wisemen live for themselves.

402
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,260
Shut your mouth

403
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,150
before I change my mind.

404
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,270
From now on,

405
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,330
I won't listen to anyone anymore.

406
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,280
Is there any change?

407
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,100
Stay calm.

408
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,510
Don't fall into Xixuan's trap.

409
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:06,800
Which sect are you from?

410
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,720
Why are you heading towards the back of the mountains?

411
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,150
Take everyone back to report.

412
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:18,990
Senior.

413
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:19,700
Go now.

414
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,930
Senior. Senior.

415
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,550
Xuanzhen, let's go.

416
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,060
Senior. Senior.

417
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:24,920
Let's go.

418
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,610
Your sword is indeed fast.

419
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,360
But it has a form no matter how fast it is.

420
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,470
How can you win

421
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,190
by using something with a form against something without a form?

422
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:02,550
Tan.

423
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,490
Come here.

424
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,180
How is she?

425
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,040
Senior Shi Ji still refuses to eat or drink.

426
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:12,680
She just wants to go to Xixuan to meet Qiushui.

427
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,200
She also said that they are a couple. They should be together no matter what.

428
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:17,860
She said it

429
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,980
like she is the most loyal

430
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,440
in this world.

431
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,490
But Master,

432
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,240
we just received news from outside the mountains.

433
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,100
Xixuan has been completely surrounded

434
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,320
by the 36 sects.

435
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,390
And there are 100,000 monsters going to help them.

436
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,230
Everyone says

437
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,080
after this battle,

438
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,840
Xixuan will no longer exist.

439
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:36,890
Master.

440
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,830
What should we do in the future?

441
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,500
What do you mean?

442
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,400
This is Yun Zhong Ju.

443
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,950
We are not the same as Xixuan Sect.

444
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:48,450
OK.

445
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,820
The fish took the bait.

446
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,490
Master.

447
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,420
Help me! Help me!

448
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:57,570
Up.

449
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,730
Master.

450
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,140
Was that a fish?

451
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,000
When did Yunhai Pavilion

452
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,290
have a fish like that?

453
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,900
It looks like a monster.

454
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,460
This fish

455
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,900
must have absorbed the spiritual energy of the Heaven and Earth.

456
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,010
That's why it's like this.

457
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,020
Logically, the spiritual energy should reduce sharply

458
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,170
since the spiritual caves have been destroyed.

459
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,270
Why has it increased instead of reducing?

460
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:36,930
Ziyang

461
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,560
must be hiding something from me.

462
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,300
Master, where are you going?

463
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,010
Xixuan.

464
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,570
Are you going to help Xixuan?

465
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:45,170
I have something to ask.

466
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:47,840
Check the manpower. The more, the better.

467
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:48,880
Even if anything happens,

468
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,060
we can get away safely.

469
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,120
What about Senior Shi Ji?

470
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,760
She doesn't want to eat or drink, right? She said their love is solid as gold, right?

471
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,650
We might have to risk our lives this time.

472
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,440
Take her with us.

473
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:58,510
Yes, Master.

474
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,500
Congratulations.

475
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,770
After this battle,

476
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,870
the monster clan will

477
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,700
be avenged.

478
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:17,190
They hid the Shenzhou Energy Map, destroyed the spiritual caves,

479
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,470
and became the enemy of all cultivators.

480
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,210
They have this

481
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,210
coming.

482
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:26,640
It's a pity that I can't

483
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,570
kill Ji Ruochen in person.

484
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,050
He's just a thief for fame.

485
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:31,290
It's nothing.

486
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,000
Qingyi.

487
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:42,390
The coral you gave to the Demon Emperor of the Netherworld

488
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,410
is from the warehouse.

489
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,030
If this goes on,

490
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,220
the warehouse of the Endless Sea

491
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,900
will be emptied by you sooner or later.

492
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,800
I'm making the best use of them.

493
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,930
The coral I gave him last time is small.

494
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,310
And he helped us find Yinyin and Mr. Ji.

495
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,390
This time, I'll give him a big one.

496
00:31:58,730 --> 00:31:59,850
Maybe he'll withdraw his troop

497
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:00,990
if he's happy.

498
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,100
It's an emergency. We can't waste more time.

499
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:03,660
Let's go.

500
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,280
No wonder Master said

501
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,630
it's hard to guard against

502
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,590
a domestic thief.

503
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,540
So

504
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,240
you went to bribe the Demon Emperor of the Netherworld?

505
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,820
It's just a gift.

506
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:21,900
I asked you to travel in the mortal world.

507
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,810
But you learned these bad habits.

508
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,350
What's wrong with bad habits?

509
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:25,940
You...

510
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,300
At least I can try to help

511
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,310
drive back the enemies for Xixuan.

512
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,380
It's better than just watching and doing nothing.

513
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,870
Mr. Ji and Yinyin

514
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,190
are dead.

515
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:34,680
If they knew this,

516
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,180
they would definitely agree with me.

517
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,640
Am I right?

518
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,800
Qingyi is right.

519
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,130
-We can't
-Shut up.

520
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,890
just watch them die.

521
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,140
Did you see Ji Ruochen died with your own eyes?

522
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,400
He was stabbed by Gu Qing's sword

523
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,240
and fell into the spiritual cave.

524
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,580
And Yinyin...

525
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,150
Stop talking.

526
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,610
Xixuan Sect is in danger.

527
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,790
Do you think I should save them?

528
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,540
Yes.

529
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:14,590
Why?

530
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:16,560
We share

531
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,020
a common fate.

532
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,100
That's right.

533
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,230
If Xixuan falls,

534
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,910
it will be difficult for the Endless Sea to survive.

535
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,780
Uncle, you agree?

536
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,610
How many Honghuang Guards should we take?

537
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,650
The Demon Emperor has 100,000 monster soldiers.

538
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,010
Let's take 1,000.

539
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,780
Considering the power of the Endless Sea,

540
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,510
I'm sure one Honghuang Guard can defeat 100 monster soldiers.

541
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,380
Ling alone is enough.

542
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,760
You want more?

543
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,840
No.

544
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,290
Thank you. Uncle.

545
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:46,900
Qingyi. Ling.

546
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:47,850
My order is

547
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,320
no matter how many people the Demon Emperor has brought,

548
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,790
don't let anyone of them enter Xixuan Mountains.

549
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,730
Yes, Master.

550
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:57,900
Go.

551
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:18,679
You're awake.

552
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:26,810
I have eliminated the divine power in your body

553
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,880
with the blue flame.

554
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,560
Although your wound looks better,

555
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,460
it will take a few days to recover.

556
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,250
Ruochen.

557
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:46,440
How did you become like this?

558
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,460
What happened?

559
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:56,260
I saw my father in the tower.

560
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,220
Your father?

561
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,210
He is still alive?

562
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,130
But why was he in the Nine Hells?

563
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,820
Why was he in the Demon Tower?

564
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,080
It was just his spirit.

565
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:12,170
My father was the Demon King of the Nine Hells.

566
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,180
The blue flame in my body

567
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,780
is the Blue Fire of the Nine Hells.

568
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,120
I inherited his bloodline.

569
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,460
No wonder.

570
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,050
Every time the blue flame appeared,

571
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,250
you became a different person.

572
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:33,650
So

573
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,380
I am the born Demon King.

574
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:40,540
What?

575
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:42,990
I've become the Demon King.

576
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,900
Are you scared?

577
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,300
Why should I be scared?

578
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,130
You promised.

579
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,050
You only belong to me

580
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,040
in this life.

581
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,490
Even though you have become a demon,

582
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,670
you are still my demon.

583
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,690
I can bully you, and you should listen to me.

584
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:13,990
That's great.

585
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,250
Then let's just live here

586
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:18,820
and go nowhere.

587
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,420
I want to be with you forever.

588
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,450
I also hope

589
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,560
you can remember me forever.

590
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,110
What about the Demon Tower?

591
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:42,670
What?

592
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:44,930
Didn't you destroy the Demon Tower?

593
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,540
Why should I destroy it?
