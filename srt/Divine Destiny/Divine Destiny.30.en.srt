[Divine Destiny]

00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,970
[Episode 30]

4
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,180
By the way,

5
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:41,640
what happened to the Demon Tower?

6
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:52,500
What?

7
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,100
Didn't you destroy the Demon Tower?

8
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,430
Why should I destroy it?

9
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,800
Do you know what's in the tower?

10
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,180
I don't want to destroy it now.

11
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,930
I enjoy

12
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,780
the wonderful moment of being the Demon King.

13
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,030
Have you lost control of yourself?

14
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,030
Open the Shenzhou Energy Map.

15
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,870
I want to see the change of the spiritual power.

16
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,329
Oh no.

17
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,150
The Xixuan Mountains.

18
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,710
It was that old bastard Sun Guo.

19
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,860
He still attacked Xixuan Mountains.

20
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,180
Ruochen.

21
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,950
We must go back to save my parents.

22
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,570
You've become the Demon King.

23
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,710
You must be able to bring us to the mortal world, right?

24
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,829
Once the Wuya barrier is broken,

25
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,170
it will be too late.

26
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,940
Have you ever thought

27
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,430
once you leave here,

28
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,829
the passageway connecting Nine Hells and the mortal world

29
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,020
will be closed forever?

30
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,180
You will never come back.

31
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:37,060
And you'll forget me forever.

32
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,250
With my current power,

33
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,950
I can break the barrier of the Nine Hells,

34
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,010
but I don't want you to leave me.

35
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,350
I don't want you to leave.

36
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,329
And I don't want you to forget me.

37
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,040
Ruochen.

38
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,620
But...Ruochen.

39
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,820
If we don't go,

40
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,780
my parents,

41
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:05,960
my master,

42
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,790
and our fellows on the entire Xixuan Mountains

43
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,360
will be killed.

44
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,400
If we don't go,

45
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,420
I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

46
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,120
How can I be happy?

47
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:20,019
Ruochen.

48
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:22,600
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,900
I must go back.

50
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,630
Let go of me!

51
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:44,990
Let go of me!

52
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,909
Don't go anywhere else

53
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,780
except by my side.

54
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,710
Let go of me!

55
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,700
You're not Ji Ruochen anymore.

56
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,050
Let go of me!

57
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,060
Yes.

58
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,970
I'm no longer Ji Ruochen.

59
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,260
I am the monster here.

60
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,660
I am the king here.

61
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:11,990
Of course.

62
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,610
I am also your husband.

63
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,330
Let go of me!

64
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,070
Let go of me!

65
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,330
Let go of me!

66
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,550
Father!

67
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,650
Mother!

68
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,090
I want to go back to save you.

69
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,560
Father!

70
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,920
Mother.

71
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,900
I'm sorry.

72
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,110
I haven't said goodbye to you.

73
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,120
Let me go.

74
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,540
I don't want to never see my parents again.

75
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,770
I beg you.

76
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,340
I beg you.

77
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,650
Let me go back.

78
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:09,770
Okay.

79
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,110
Since you want to leave so badly,

80
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,700
let's go back.

81
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,790
I'll go back with you.

82
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,620
We'll save Xixuan together.

83
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,159
But before we leave,

84
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,820
I want your permission.

85
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,780
And I hope you won't be mad at me anymore.

86
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,770
Why should I be mad at you?

87
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:52,990
Yinyin.

88
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,620
Soon,

89
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,490
I'll return to the Endless Sea

90
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,810
and find a way to suppress Nuwa's Tears.

91
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,740
Nothing can separate us.

92
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,750
God is about to die.

93
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,780
The demon is born.

94
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,430
People are in misery.

95
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,950
Mournful cries spread all over the land.

96
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,409
Young God Ji,

97
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,130
you are the chosen one.

98
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,350
You're the banished god.

99
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,550
How can you leave like that?

100
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:51,360
If you see me in heaven,

101
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,080
show your power.

102
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,790
Answer me.

103
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,360
Maybe I can still

104
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,650
come up with

105
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,860
a way to revive you.

106
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:49,730
Junior Ji,

107
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,250
where are we?

108
00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,700
We...

109
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,670
This is the Qingyuan Holy Land.

110
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,860
I remember now.

111
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,350
Aren't we dead?

112
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,140
How did you become like this?

113
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,020
Young God Ji.

114
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,810
Yinyin.

115
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,250
Mr. Ji.

116
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,580
I thought I was having blurred vision.

117
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,560
You...

118
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,190
You are not dead?

119
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,110
Senior Yinyin and I were lucky.

120
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,290
We walked around the underworld

121
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,820
and were sent back.

122
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,820
Did I forget something important?

123
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,080
I...

124
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:55,520
Young God Ji,

125
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,330
may I have a word with you?

126
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,280
Mr. Ji,

127
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,520
if you have anything to say,

128
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,190
you can say it in front of Senior Yinyin.

129
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,170
You guys continue.

130
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,440
Greetings, Demon King. I'm Ji Tianxia.

131
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,570
It seems that you

132
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,060
already knew my identity

133
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,390
and kept it a secret until now.

134
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,740
Thank you for your hard work.

135
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,520
I...

136
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,460
I have my reasons.

137
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,750
Please understand.

138
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,800
Mr. Ji,

139
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,430
you saved my life.

140
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,100
Just say what you want to say.

141
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:01,580
Demon King,

142
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,020
did you

143
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,750
destroy the tower down there?

144
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:10,820
What tower?

145
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,070
The Demon Tower?

146
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,290
I just went in and took a look.

147
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,040
Then I came out.

148
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:18,770
You...

149
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,180
Ji Ruochen.

150
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,440
You...

151
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,480
I...

152
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,140
I...

153
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,090
The peace of the Three Realms

154
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,770
was destroyed by you.

155
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,160
How pathetic.

156
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:35,900
Mr. Ji,

157
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,270
I didn’t start the disaster

158
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:42,020
of the Three Realms.

159
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,250
Don't slander me.

160
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,880
Demon King.

161
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,350
You should know

162
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,180
only Blue Fire of Nine Hells

163
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,850
can solve the disaster of the Demon Tower.

164
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:57,920
Then...

165
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,460
Then why do you just

166
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,400
watch the people suffer

167
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,170
without showing any concern?

168
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,730
Mr. Ji,

169
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,370
if one day

170
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,400
a chess piece

171
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,280
has become the chess player,

172
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,370
do you think

173
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,940
he will still be manipulated?

174
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:23,610
Fine.

175
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:25,760
Fine.

176
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,340
Even if you are in a bad mood,

177
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,530
you don't want to destroy the tower,

178
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,690
as a disciple of Xixuan Sect,

179
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,970
don't you have to respond to the trouble faced by Xixuan?

180
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,340
What trouble faced by Xixuan?

181
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,840
What happened to Xixuan Sect?

182
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,010
Bad news!

183
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,970
Sun Guo joined forces with the 36 sects

184
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,200
to besiege Xixuan Mountains.

185
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,050
The Demon Emperor of the Netherworld kicked Xixuan when they are down

186
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,000
and gathered 100,000 demons.

187
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,530
I'm afraid they've already assembled together.

188
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,580
Junior, I'm leaving.

189
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,850
Junior, if you still care about our classmate friendship,

190
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:10,700
follow me.

191
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,780
Faster. Faster.

192
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:22,780
The Hierarch has ordered

193
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,480
to set out at full speed. No delay is allowed.

194
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,900
Excuse me,

195
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,810
why did Qingxu send more men?

196
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,380
Greetings, Fairy Gu.

197
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,820
Nice to meet you.

198
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,280
It is said we're going to break through the Wuya Formation of Xixuan

199
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:34,970
today.

200
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,910
Looks like this fierce battle is inevitable.

201
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,070
I shall take my leave.

202
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:56,720
Qing.

203
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,670
I've let it go.

204
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,500
Why can't you let go?

205
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,400
I'm afraid after today,

206
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,950
Xixuan will no longer exist.

207
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:07,940
I see.

208
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,780
So this is the true reason you went to such great lengths

209
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,900
to make me leave the mountain, right?

210
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,200
Yinfeng,

211
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,460
don't you have any compassion?

212
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:21,700
In my opinion,

213
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,760
they are just killing each other.

214
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,370
There's nothing to pity.

215
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,610
Qing.

216
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,300
From now on,

217
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,190
the mundane affairs

218
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,800
have nothing to do with us anymore.

219
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,060
How can it not matter?

220
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,710
My sword is covered with blood.

221
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,890
I can't wash it off no matter how hard I try.

222
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,370
Qing.

223
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,160
It's just a dead person.

224
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,040
Why can't you let go?

225
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,150
We failed again and again

226
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,980
because you are distracted.

227
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,410
You're the one who failed again and again.

228
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,940
You're the one who's distracted.

229
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,490
You're the one who can't let go of, Yinfeng.

230
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,140
I tried my best

231
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,340
and stayed up all nights

232
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,230
and devoted all my heart to find the immortal dharma-laksana for you.

233
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,350
But what have you been doing?

234
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,240
Have you ever done something sincerely?

235
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,840
Have you ever thought about me?

236
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,460
I was all by myself.

237
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,610
All by myself.

238
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,240
Let go of me!

239
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,170
Let me ask you.

240
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,010
All this time,

241
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,350
have I been lying to myself and wishfully thinking?

242
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:29,210
Gu Qing,

243
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,440
I want you to tell me.

244
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,460
Tell me in person.

245
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,570
Is it true?

246
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,090
Fortunately, the bluestone is fine.

247
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,550
Instead of torturing each other

248
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,400
and making each other suffer,

249
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,110
why don't we just end it

250
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,620
and be completely free?

251
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,600
The Wuya barrier is ahead.

252
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,230
Among the ways up the mountains,

253
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,510
this one is the broadest.

254
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,460
The Netherworld Army should pass by.

255
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,030
We made it in time.

256
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:33,980
Your Grace, Imperial Advisor.

257
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,270
The demon clan sent a message.

258
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,530
100,000 soldiers have arrived at the foot of the mountains.

259
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,510
They're ready to fight at any time.

260
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:38,460
OK.

261
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,650
Netherworld Army is camping there,

262
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,550
and there's ambush at the back mountain assisting us,

263
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,590
when the barrier is destroyed,

264
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,680
we can kill all over here.

265
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:51,620
Everyone,

266
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,920
100,000 demon soldiers have arrived at the foot of the mountains.

267
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,990
They will soon join forces with us.

268
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,030
The result of this battle

269
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,870
is determined.

270
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,270
Good.

271
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,200
Attack Xixuan Mountains.

272
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,180
In that case,

273
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,650
our Wugou Manor

274
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,660
will live up to your expectations.

275
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,620
Attack Xixuan Mountains!

276
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,460
Attack Xixuan Mountains!

277
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,610
That should be the camp of the Demon Emperor of the Netherworld.

278
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:22,740
Yes.

279
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,470
What do you plan to do?

280
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,010
To capture the thieves, capture the chief.

281
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,860
We must capture the leader first.

282
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,610
The gang down the mountain will be without a leader.

283
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,940
They must be prepared.

284
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,270
You are alone,

285
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,310
and there are so many of them.

286
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,500
Maybe you're no match for them.

287
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,740
But there's no other way now.

288
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,270
As long as I can save Xixuan,

289
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,460
even if there's only a glimmer of hope,

290
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,300
I want to give it a try.

291
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,820
Throughout history, in face-offs between two armies,

292
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,770
skilled negotiators often prevail over mighty soldiers.

293
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,290
How about

294
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,330
we go and persuade him?

295
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,910
Maybe the Demon Emperor

296
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,350
is a sensible person.

297
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,150
Maybe he can retreat.

298
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,830
I don't have any relationship with the Demon Emperor.

299
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,350
If you are capable,

300
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,070
you can have a try.

301
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:10,700
Let's do our own thing.

302
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,280
Be careful.

303
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,560
Yinyin.

304
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,470
Yinyin, you are still alive.

305
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,120
Yinyin.

306
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,030
I knew good people will be rewarded.

307
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,300
My prayers must have worked.

308
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,220
Qingyi, stop talking.

309
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,740
I was just thinking why it's so noisy.

310
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,710
Turns out there are two little birds flying in.

311
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:02,940
You can no longer survive.

312
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,770
Submit to death obediently.

313
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,940
Yinyin, let’s meet with Ling

314
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,070
and have a good fight with them.

315
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:08,720
Let's go!

316
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:11,720
After them!

317
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,340
Ling, Dragon Elephant, White Tiger.

318
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,350
It's...

319
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,180
Miss Yinyin.

320
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,000
Yes.

321
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,160
Where are you going?

322
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:26,310
Come behind me.

323
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,280
You, the one from the Endless Sea.

324
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,150
Do you want to get involved with the matter of Xixuan?

325
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,230
Don't blame me for not telling you.

326
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,540
Our 100,000 soldiers are at the foot of the mountains.

327
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,240
Those who know their place

328
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,410
might as well join us.

329
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,730
After we wipe out Xixuan,

330
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,050
you'll be rewarded too.

331
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,140
Before I came, my uncle specifically told me

332
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,900
not to let one single demon sneak into Xixuan.

333
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,590
You are such a joke.

334
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,390
You little ants

335
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,540
are trying to stop the demon army?

336
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:07,820
I think

337
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,890
you will be trampled into minced meat

338
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,980
without even a word.

339
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,220
They're just here to cheer us up.

340
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,940
They don't need to fight.

341
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,440
I alone can deal with

342
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:20,930
your entire army.

343
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,680
Let me

344
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,360
deal with you guys first.

345
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,980
How dare they!

346
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,150
They overestimate themselves.

347
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,960
Send my order to Wei Wushang.

348
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,790
Those who block the army will be killed without mercy.

349
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,410
What about those from the Endless Sea?

350
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:45,900
Kill them too!

351
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,160
Got it!

352
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:48,790
Qingyi.

353
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:50,740
I’m sorry for causing you trouble.

354
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,890
Yinyin, don't say that.

355
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,860
It's been a long time since I've been

356
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:57,960
in such a big fight like this.

357
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,570
Just fight.

358
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,600
Cut the crap.

359
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,350
Yinyin, I’m happy

360
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:08,590
that you're back.

361
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,230
What did he say?

362
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,110
He said he was happy.

363
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:31,950
Who?

364
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,100
Demon Emperor, it seems

365
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,140
that you don't want to give yourself a way out.

366
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,300
Ji Ruochen.

367
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,070
Ji Ruochen.

368
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,470
Didn’t you die in Lingxu?

369
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,290
But I was lucky.

370
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,100
I let you down.

371
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:52,900
Ji Ruochen.

372
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,620
Xixuan Sect is in danger.

373
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,560
Instead of finding a way out for yourself,

374
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,710
you came back to die.

375
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,390
I admire your loyalty.

376
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,030
Unfortunately,

377
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,590
you are as foolish as those stubborn old men

378
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,320
on the mountains.

379
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,120
If you said that before,

380
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,490
I would fight with you

381
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:16,830
for the dignity of our sect.

382
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,110
But now,

383
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,830
upon careful consideration,

384
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,500
your words

385
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,700
make sense to me.

386
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,020
Are you

387
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,040
here to surrender?

388
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,310
I'm here to persuade you to retreat.

389
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,750
Retreat?

390
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:43,700
What are you waiting for?

391
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,380
Chop them who're ignorant

392
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,510
into minced meat!

393
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,470
Kill!

394
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,660
I'm afraid your soldiers are in trouble.

395
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,110
As far as I know,

396
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,710
this time,

397
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:13,160
the Endless Sea only sent one general.

398
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,790
Truly, one man guards the pass, and ten thousand cannot force it open.

399
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,500
Wow.

400
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,900
This is much more powerful than our Dragon and Tiger Universal Cannon.

401
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:21,660
Yes.

402
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,020
Your unique skills

403
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,440
are just so-so.

404
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,350
If I were you,

405
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,670
I would definitely consider retreating.

406
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,620
Don't get beaten up

407
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,530
and be laughed at by the people.

408
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,690
The people I killed

409
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,820
can gather into a mountain of corpses.

410
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,220
Who do you think you are?

411
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,600
Today,

412
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,460
I'll make this place

413
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,780
into a demon's arena.

414
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,390
Blue Fire of Nine Hells.

415
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,240
You... You've become a demon.

416
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,790
I'm the Demon King.

417
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,760
I'll show you now

418
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,170
what a real demon's arena is.

419
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,060
Where is this?

420
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,150
Where am I?

421
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:36,850
Where am I?

422
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:20,020
Actually, it's easy to make you

423
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,600
retreat.

424
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,870
As long as I behead you,

425
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,580
the demons down the mountains will lose their leader.

426
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:32,990
They will naturally become scattered soldiers

427
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,910
and will never become a force.

428
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,230
A soldier can be killed but not humiliated.

429
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,930
Ji Ruochen,

430
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,190
just do it.

431
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,950
It's just hateful that our millennium-old foundation

432
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,820
will be ruined by the hands of a monster.

433
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,230
Ji Ruochen,

434
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,260
you can't kill

435
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:54,950
all those who oppose you.

436
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:58,250
You will be punished.

437
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:05,330
You're indeed a warrior who is old but ambitious.

438
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,660
I remember the demons of the Netherworld

439
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,440
were trapped in the Tianxing Mountain

440
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,120
by the so-called upright sects.

441
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:15,420
They fought for more than a month and most of them died.

442
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,250
In the end, it was you

443
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,280
who sacrificed thousands of years of cultivation

444
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,660
and beat the Hierarchs of all sects.

445
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,590
Only in that way were you able to keep the Netherworld.

446
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,310
I can imagine how bold

447
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,180
you were back then.

448
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,260
Why are you bringing this up?

449
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,010
I just want the you to know,

450
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:36,100
among the 36 sects who followed Sun Guo

451
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,750
to besiege the Xixuan Mountains,

452
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,950
21 of them

453
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,010
were involved in the massacre of on Tianxing Mountain.

454
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,040
If you

455
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,310
join hands with your old enemies,

456
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,100
how will you

457
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,010
explain to the demon generals who died

458
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:53,870
at that time?

459
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,600
How will the subordinates of yours

460
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,220
see themselves?

461
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,060
Well...

462
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,750
You don't have to worry about that.

463
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,290
I know you

464
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,840
besieged Xixuan this time

465
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,650
to vent your anger

466
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,220
and take advantage of the chaos.

467
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,930
Your clan members have resolute and unwavering spirits.

468
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,150
How can you collude with a despicable person

469
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,290
like Sun Guo?

470
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,380
If 100,000 warm-blooded warriors

471
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,820
die in a foreign land because of this,

472
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,010
Demon Emperor, how can you bear it?

473
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,830
Besides,

474
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:39,860
if Xixuan's charge

475
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,770
is innocent and Xixuan clears its name one day,

476
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:43,820
the Netherworld

477
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,060
will carry the same accusation as Sun Guo.

478
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,380
You will be despised by others, leaving behind a stench for ten thousand years.

479
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:55,930
We have established enmity

480
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:59,620
with the Endless Sea and the Honghuang Guards.

481
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,780
What's going on?

482
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:12,890
Retreat Call.

483
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,130
You, the one from the Endless Sea.

484
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,710
I'll seek revenge for today.

485
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:23,910
Great, Yinyin.

486
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:24,940
They retreated.

487
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,670
Thank you, Qingyi.

488
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,460
Thank you, Dragon Elephant, White Tiger.

489
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,200
You're welcome.

490
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,040
Thank you, Ling.

491
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,190
Great.

492
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,910
We don't have to be afraid of them this time.

493
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,460
Thank you, Demon Emperor.

494
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,060
Who?

495
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,690
Fellows of Qingxu, don't be nervous.

496
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,200
The Imperial Advisor ordered me

497
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,400
to reward you.

498
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:57,630
These days,

499
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,990
you have worked so hard.

500
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:00,410
Here.

501
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,710
So you're from Zhenwu Temple.

502
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,870
You know manners.

503
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,460
Look at the cold weather.

504
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,270
Guys, have a drink to warm yourselves up.

505
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,810
This is the best wine.

506
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,010
Senior Bingxian, are you okay?

507
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,040
Why are you back?

508
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,320
Qiushui can go and deliver the message alone.

509
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,110
I'm back to save you!

510
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:23,820
Let's go!

511
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,240
Where are you going?

512
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,830
Looks like we can't leave.

513
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,730
We have to buy as much time as we can

514
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,050
until Qiushui and the others arrive.

515
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,500
You and I won't both die.

516
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:50,430
You mean...

517
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:51,210
We should go...

518
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:51,980
Separately.

519
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:57,730
Don't worry, Senior.

520
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,950
I'm the banished god.

521
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,430
As long as I'm here, Xixuan will survive.

522
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,390
Ji Ruochen?

523
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,120
Isn't he dead?

524
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,530
Is he faking his death?

525
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,310
Whether Xixuan will survive or not

526
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,820
depends on this battle.

527
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:46,090
Everyone,

528
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,620
kill the enemy with me.

529
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,320
Defend Xixuan to the death!

530
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,970
Defend Xixuan to the death!

531
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:56,200
Defend Xixuan to the death!

532
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,050
[Xixuan]

533
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,560
Defend Xixuan to the death!

534
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,340
That's right.

535
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,660
It's finally broken.

536
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,410
Everyone,

537
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,670
Xixuan's Wuya Formation has been destroyed.

538
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:30,050
It's time to go up the mountains to get rid of the Xixuan Sect.

539
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,080
Follow Imperial Advisor to go up the mountains

540
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,240
and meet Master.

541
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,060
Yes.

542
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:36,940
Follow me.

543
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,720
Kill!

544
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,950
Kill!

545
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:41,340
Kill!

546
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,460
Senior, news of victory from Zhenwu Temple.

547
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:54,480
The Wuya Formation has been broken.

548
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,340
Sun Guo is leading the 36 sects

549
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,330
to go up the mountains to kill.

550
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,450
Where is Mr. Wangchen?

551
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,660
Who knows

552
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,290
if he turned into a coward

553
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,240
at a critical moment.

554
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,300
But Senior,

555
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,380
if Mr. Wangchen doesn't guide us,

556
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,420
how can we tell the paths on the back mountains?

557
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,010
What are you afraid of?

558
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,690
If there is a mountain, build a road; if there is water, build a bridge.

559
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,690
Can we still be trapped to death?

560
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,410
If we don't hurry up,

561
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,320
the good things on Xixuan Mountains

562
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,170
will fall into Sun Guo's hands.

563
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,320
Listen to my order.

564
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,970
Go up to Xixuan Mountains and set out at full speed.

565
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:25,790
Hurry!

566
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,290
Senior.

567
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,410
Senior.

568
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,710
We're outnumbered.

569
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:43,860
Junior,

570
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,760
even if we try our best to fight,

571
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,590
we won't be able to turn the tide.

572
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,590
Is Xixuan Sect

573
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,120
really doomed?

574
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:09,730
Senior.

575
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:11,739
Why aren't you here yet?

576
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,389
Could it be that

577
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,560
lives of hundreds of disciples

578
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,150
can't compare to

579
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:20,010
your ascension in seclusion?

580
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:23,400
Or have you already

581
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:26,960
set up a solution in this game?

582
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,310
The Wuya barrier is broken after all.

583
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,580
Yinyin, Xixuan seems to be in trouble.

584
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,560
So many of them are working together.

585
00:34:56,989 --> 00:34:58,160
This is outrageous!

586
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:07,630
Ling.

587
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:08,860
That's good.

588
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,930
Ling will go to the front gate.

589
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,050
We'll go to the main hall.

590
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,380
Xixuan bastards!

591
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:16,140
Come and die now!

592
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,260
Who are you, a reckless guy?

593
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,870
You want to die?

594
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,500
God bless Xixuan.

595
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,900
God bless Xixuan.

596
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:02,700
Senior.

597
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,180
Why do I feel this place looks familiar?

598
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:06,730
Have we been here before?

599
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,730
The forest is strange.

600
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,780
We must have walked into a maze.

601
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,010
Everyone.

602
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,310
Since you're here,

603
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,410
how about having a cup of tea with me?

604
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:20,780
Perfect timing.

605
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,460
I was going to look for you.

606
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,980
Xuxuan bastards.

607
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,000
You hurt my husband!

608
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,850
Today is the day of your death.

609
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,240
You guys

610
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:32,670
can't do anything to Qingxu.

611
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,670
They still have me.

612
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,110
All disciples.

613
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,590
Follow me to help Xixuan kill the enemy.

614
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:42,990
Got it.

615
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,320
Darling.

616
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:45,780
You're finally here.

617
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:47,740
Senior.

618
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,500
Judging from the situation today,

619
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,910
we won't be able to take any advantage.

620
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,280
Why don't we leave?

621
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,100
Let's not die here.

622
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:56,200
Jin Shan, you're such a fence-sitter.

623
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:57,810
I'll bear this in mind.

624
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,430
All disciples,

625
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,080
follow me down the mountain and return to Qingxu.

626
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,310
May I ask

627
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:38,520
which sect you're from and what your name is?

628
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:41,600
I'm Death Reaper

629
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,480
from the Xixuan Sect.

630
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:47,100
Elder Reaper, save me!

631
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,380
Xixuan calls itself a righteous sect.

632
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:56,620
How could someone have such an unrefined name?

633
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:01,350
How could there be someone so untidy like you?

634
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:02,890
You ruthless

635
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:05,150
and cruel old pervert.

636
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,160
Stop pretending.

637
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,470
I'll take your life!

638
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,420
The Bowing and Nodding Technique.

639
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,300
The Bowing and Nodding Technique.

640
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,290
When did Xixuan have such skills?

641
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,710
Junior Boyang.

642
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,490
Long time no see.

643
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,260
How did you become

644
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,220
like this?

645
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,660
At least Junior Yuchan

646
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,740
had a crush on you.

647
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:57,500
Back then,

648
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,930
you betrayed our master and mistreated our junior.

649
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,810
If it weren't for you,

650
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,540
Junior Yuchan wouldn't have died with hatred.

651
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:06,810
Now

652
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,020
I will use your blood to sacrifice her spirit.

653
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,530
She willingly chose to be with me.

654
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,830
How can you say that I mistreated her?

655
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,180
As for you,

656
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,530
I think you're jealous

657
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,500
because you can't have her.

658
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,820
Elder! Elder!

659
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:01,940
Fivefold clones?

660
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,430
How could you master the Bowing and Nodding Technique

661
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:12,270
to such a perfect level?

662
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,740
We used to be classmates.

663
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,930
Now you colluded with Sun Guo

664
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,950
to humiliate Xixuan Sect.

665
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,800
You abandoned good and followed evil.

666
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,770
You deserve it.

667
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,560
Junior Yuchan.

668
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,520
I've finally avenged you.

669
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,620
You can

670
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:00,060
rest in peace!

671
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,560
Elder.

672
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:10,040
Elder, are you okay?

673
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:11,420
I'm fine.

674
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,440
I thought I was ugly enough.

675
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,040
I didn't expect

676
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,530
you're even uglier than me.

677
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,260
Who are you calling ugly?

678
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,290
You are ugly.

679
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,760
You are the ugliest freak in the world.

680
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,110
Little loser.

681
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:36,810
Just now,

682
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,100
who did you just say is the world's ugliest freak?

683
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,620
Where are you going?

684
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,420
What are you doing? Let go of me!

685
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,360
Let go!
