[Episode 5]

4
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,210
Could it be him?

5
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,090
Do you remember me?

6
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,889
We haven't even met.

7
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,330
How can I remember you?

8
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,040
I'm Ji Ruochen, a disciple of the Taichang Palace of Xixuan.

9
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,280
Nice to meet you. Fairy.

10
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,640
You from Yun Zhong Ju.

11
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,960
This is your first time to Xixuan, right?

12
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,340
You just met.

13
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,180
That's rude.

14
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,480
Don't think you can do whatever you want just because you're pretty.

15
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:37,280
I was wondering who it was.

16
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,680
Aren't you

17
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,620
the girl who is stubborn

18
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,079
and stole other people's efforts?

19
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,450
You know what?

20
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,960
I didn't recognize you

21
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,320
with this look.

22
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,900
I thought

23
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,260
you were a witch.

24
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,320
You can just scare yourself with your makeup.

25
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,840
If you envy someone else for being beautiful,

26
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,980
you'll be really shameless.

27
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,120
I was wondering who this was.

28
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,350
Does your face still hurt?

29
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,800
Do you want me

30
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,080
to slap you again today?

31
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,340
Listen.

32
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,060
This is my place.

33
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,400
Please show some respect.

34
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,020
You naughty girl.

35
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,500
Did I say anything wrong?

36
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,050
Shi Ji.

37
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:10,870
Don't be rude.

38
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,440
You Yun Zhong Ju...

39
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,110
Calm down.

40
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,460
I thought you came here

41
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,780
for a skill competition.

42
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,500
I didn't expect you came here for a beauty competition.

43
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,020
It seems that Yun Zhong Ju

44
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:21,910
doesn't deserve its reputation.

45
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,640
You are just superficial people.

46
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:24,920
If we had known this,

47
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,470
we wouldn't have wasted time

48
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,620
on welcoming you politely.

49
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,810
Don't waste time.

50
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:29,510
Let's go.

51
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,700
Let's go.

52
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:31,780
By the way,

53
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,120
in terms of beauty,

54
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,130
this lady is not bad.

55
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,880
As for you...

56
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,700
But the most beautiful here

57
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,650
is our senior.

58
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:45,870
Yes.

59
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,500
You said that girl is not bad.

60
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,780
Why?

61
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,260
I was just saying.

62
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,340
Don't take it seriously.

63
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,280
No way.

64
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,579
You said she

65
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:55,250
was beautiful.

66
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,720
Are you angry?

67
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,290
Stop it. I'm angry.

68
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,910
Yinyin, I was just saying.

69
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,680
Then tell me. Who is prettier?

70
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,220
Of course you are prettier.

71
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,670
Ji Ruochen.

72
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,600
Fairy Gu.

73
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,740
It's late.

74
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,170
What can I do for you?

75
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,130
First, I'm here to apologize.

76
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,590
Second, I'm here to catch up.

77
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,040
Catching up?

78
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,850
Why?

79
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,200
Besides,

80
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,640
Senior Qiushui and the others are sleeping.

81
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,770
If you want to know

82
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:21,850
the secret of the bluestone,

83
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,920
come with me.

84
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,500
Ji Ruochen,

85
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,010
you really don't remember me?

86
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,730
I gave you this bluestone.

87
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,060
Thank God.

88
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,140
She just mistook me for someone else.

89
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,300
This stone?

90
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:40,730
There are thousands of

91
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,440
stones like it in this world.

92
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,570
My mother gave it to me.

93
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,360
You must have mistaken me for someone else.

94
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,380
Impossible.

95
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,060
It has connections with me.

96
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,610
Even if it was fate,

97
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,770
it was in my previous life.

98
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,480
Let bygones be bygones.

99
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,820
Why won't you let it go in this life?

100
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:11,810
Ji Ruochen,

101
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,540
you must have lost your consciousness of god.

102
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,210
That's why you said this to me.

103
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,820
Although my consciousness of god is not complete,

104
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:18,980
I remember

105
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,200
we had a deal.

106
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,070
With the Heaven and the Earth as the witness, and the bluestone as the proof,

107
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,800
you promised me you would wait for me.

108
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,970
I've made myself clear.

109
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,970
Why don't you understand?

110
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:30,840
Ji Ruochen,

111
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,310
I will make you remember me again.

112
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,409
You stupid stone.

113
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,000
I would have thrown you away

114
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,520
if you were not useful to me.

115
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:00,980
Senior Qiushui.

116
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,470
Did you see it

117
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,650
last night?

118
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,030
You saw it too?

119
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,140
Is what you saw

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,820
the same as what I saw?

121
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,560
Gu Qing

122
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,560
went to see Ruochen in the middle of the night.

123
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,420
What could they say?

124
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,180
Why didn't they talk about it in the daytime?

125
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,550
And they

126
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,890
left the yard

127
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,510
one after another.

128
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,670
We shouldn't blame Ruochen.

129
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,070
Fairy Gu is from the God Realm.

130
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,490
Ruochen is a banished god.

131
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,030
It is normal that they caught up

132
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,470
when a god met a god, right?

133
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,630
A god met a god?

134
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,560
Could it be that they were dating?

135
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,710
I can't imagine it.

136
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:52,550
What?

137
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,010
Yinyin. Yinyin.

138
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:55,610
When did you come?

139
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,440
Senior Yinyin.

140
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,500
Let me help you.

141
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,420
Why haven't my potatoes been delivered yet?

142
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,380
Let's go.

143
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,760
Aren't you going to cook?

144
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,630
We're going to get some potatoes.

145
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,740
Yes. Let's go.

146
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:19,790
Yinyin.

147
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,020
You're here.

148
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,760
Why didn't you go to my place?

149
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,450
Did you sleep well last night?

150
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,100
Yes.

151
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,660
Did you dream of a fairy?

152
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,300
Fairy?

153
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,260
Why should I dream of a fairy?

154
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,280
Because a fairy is beautiful.

155
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,620
Did you have a dream that

156
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,780
you and a fairy left the yard one after another

157
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,380
and you were dating?

158
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,890
Listen to me.

159
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,100
Gu Qing did come to me.

160
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,170
But she came

161
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,340
to apologize for what happened yesterday.

162
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,130
Apologize?

163
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,460
She offended me yesterday.

164
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,660
Why would she apologize to you?

165
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,800
Maybe

166
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,310
she went to the wrong room?

167
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,450
Wrong room?

168
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,860
Do you think I'm a fool?

169
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,400
Yinyin.

170
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,660
Let me explain, OK?

171
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,060
She really came to apologize to me.

172
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,140
I didn't want to disturb them.

173
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,220
So we went out.

174
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,510
You went out?

175
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,620
You just met her.

176
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,470
What's there to talk about?

177
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,030
Yes.

178
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,590
That's what I told her.

179
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,270
Good for you.

180
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,690
I finally know what kind of person you are.

181
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,060
Men are all the same.

182
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,020
You are easily

183
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,090
attracted by beautiful women.

184
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,000
Didn't you say

185
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,990
you only listen to me?

186
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,550
Yes.

187
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,820
I only listen to you.

188
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,450
You really wronged me.

189
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,670
Do you dare to do anything like that again?

190
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,470
No.

191
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:34,670
Really?

192
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,520
That stone fairy

193
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,320
and that bad woman.

194
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,610
Let's

195
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,730
wait and see.

196
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,340
[God Gathering Pavilion]

197
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,570
They are from Xixuan Sect.

198
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,070
Zhang Yinyin, the eldest disciple of the Taixuan Palace of Xixuan Sect,

199
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,830
is here to challenge.

200
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,140
Where is everyone?

201
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,330
Come out!

202
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:13,860
She's here for our senior.

203
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,920
So noisy early in the morning.

204
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,380
I was wondering who it was.

205
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,820
You are that superstitious girl I saw yesterday, right?

206
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,110
I won't argue with you.

207
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,710
Let's have a fight if you dare.

208
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,880
Who wants to fight with you?

209
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,570
I'm afraid my hands will get dirty.

210
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,910
Shi Ji from Yun Zhong Ju

211
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,090
would like to challenge you.

212
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,010
Please.

213
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,200
Shang Qiushui of the Sikong Palace from Xixuan.

214
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,690
Please.

215
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,400
You don't have a sword.

216
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,850
I'll make it a fair competition.

217
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,260
Please.

218
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,190
Miss Shi Ji.

219
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:25,380
Please.

220
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,690
Disciple of Xixuan.

221
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,290
I'm a girl. How can you be so aggressive?

222
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,180
Since this is a challenge,

223
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,640
I must show what I have learned in my life.

224
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,190
Please try your best.

225
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,370
You are a nerd.

226
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,320
Senior.

227
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,700
Qiushui. That was a good fight.

228
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,580
You played tricks. Shameless!

229
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:17,820
Just admit defeat.

230
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,410
What's use of arguing?

231
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,640
I admit defeat.

232
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,600
You're so evil.

233
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,720
You hurt my friend.

234
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,550
She won.

235
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,930
Why did you start a fight again?

236
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:09,760
Good. You are both here.

237
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,120
I don't need to waste my time on looking for you.

238
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,220
Senior! Senior!

239
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,200
Senior! Senior!

240
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,100
Senior, are you okay?

241
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,960
Senior, are you okay?

242
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,240
It was just a competition.

243
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,780
You should've stopped at where it should.

244
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:00,630
Fairy Gu.

245
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,110
You have divine power.

246
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,720
Mortals are no match for you.

247
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,790
You hit Yinyin so hard.

248
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,260
People are watching.

249
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,720
Aren't you afraid of affecting your reputation?

250
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,120
Ji Ruochen, come with me.

251
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,300
I have something to tell you.

252
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:20,680
I'll be back soon.

253
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,700
Where are they going?

254
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,420
Yes.

255
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,460
What does she want to say to senior?

256
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:34,850
What are you doing?

257
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,170
If I inject more spiritual power into this stone,

258
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,910
maybe it will help you remember.

259
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,610
How many times have I told you?

260
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,530
Let bygones be bygones.

261
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:46,280
Stop doing such things.

262
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,230
It's hot.

263
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,630
Stop it.

264
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,370
Stop it.

265
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,790
You like her,

266
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:11,110
right?

267
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,790
Zhang Yinyin.

268
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,780
I like her.

269
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,740
Everyone knows that.

270
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:24,820
Have you forgotten

271
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,880
we can't break the fate of gods?

272
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,100
You and I

273
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,670
are supposed to be a couple

274
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,080
and return to the God Realm together.

275
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,240
Don't be blinded by this mortal romance

276
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,560
and lose your mind.

277
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:34,900
Fairy Gu.

278
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,980
Zhang Yinyin and I

279
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,810
love each other.

280
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,130
We are soul mates.

281
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,450
We are destined to be together in this life.

282
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,430
Thank you, Fairy Gu. But I can't accept your love.

283
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,860
If there's nothing else,

284
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:46,740
I'll leave.

285
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:47,850
Wait.

286
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,070
Yun Zhong Ju is here

287
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,110
for a skill competition.

288
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,790
I'll challenge you. Is that okay?

289
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,560
Fairy Gu.

290
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,720
You have divine power.

291
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,460
I only know a little

292
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,830
about the ordinary martial arts of Xixuan Sect.

293
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,930
If we fight,

294
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:03,850
it's obvious that

295
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,170
I'll lose.

296
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,060
Why would I want to fight with you?

297
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,250
I'll be waiting for you here

298
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,330
three days from now.

299
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,420
Your Highness.

300
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,380
Li An, the King of Haofang,

301
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,060
is here to welcome the Imperial Advisor.

302
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,670
Don't stand on ceremony.

303
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,270
You traveled all the way

304
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,800
to Haofang to set up an altar and pray for the city.

305
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,590
It's a blessing for the people.

306
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,150
Everything under the sky is the property of the emperor.

307
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,230
When I pray for the people of Haofang,

308
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,470
I pray for His Majesty.

309
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,220
You are right.

310
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,850
What I said was too shallow.

311
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,440
Sir. You traveled a long way and must be tired.

312
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:56,840
Come in and have a rest.

313
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:57,900
Please.

314
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,210
Please.

315
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,349
Sir.

316
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,190
As you can see,

317
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,109
there has been dark demon smoke

318
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:29,190
coming out of the city's well.

319
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,730
The people are in panic.

320
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:33,790
In my opinion,

321
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,050
the strange phenomena in Haofang

322
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,830
are the signs of a demon coming.

323
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,560
A demon?

324
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:41,980
What should we do?

325
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,340
Since it is a demon,

326
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,760
we must get rid of it to ensure peace for the people.

327
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,660
Why don't you take this opportunity

328
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,860
to recruit talented people

329
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,420
to come up with a plan to eliminate the demon.

330
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,150
By doing this,

331
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,220
it'll show your diligence and your love for the people.

332
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,190
Besides,

333
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,690
this will definitely be reported to His Majesty.

334
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,840
It will help you win His Majesty's praise.

335
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,970
You have always been in the capital city.

336
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,510
I think you know

337
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,130
among the nine sons of my father,

338
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,030
I'm the only one who is far away from the capital city.

339
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,580
Now I have no support there.

340
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,210
Sir.

341
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,540
Please be kind to support me

342
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,120
in the future.

343
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,990
Your Highness, you are generous and ambitious.

344
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,020
Although you are trapped here currently,

345
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,450
in the future,

346
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,920
you may make some great achievements.

347
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,410
Trapped here?

348
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,480
Sir. How should I solve the problem?

349
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,170
Although you are a prince,

350
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,830
you lack water according to your horoscope.

351
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,540
Your fate will depend on a woman.

352
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,400
With her help,

353
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:21,250
you'll succeed soon.

354
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,910
What's her name?

355
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,300
Where is she now?

356
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,200
She is

357
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,150
right in front of you.

358
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,060
My name is Luo Xichen.

359
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,320
Your Highness.

360
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:51,940
Your Highness.

361
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,430
Please.

362
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:01,960
Your Highness.

363
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,180
This is the wine I specially brought to you

364
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,830
from the capital city.

365
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,180
Please have a taste.

366
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,560
I'm sorry.

367
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,980
What should I do?

368
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,760
Please punish me.

369
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,680
Calm down.

370
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,180
Don't worry.

371
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,540
It's okay.

372
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,300
It's fine.

373
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:35,980
Master.

374
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:47,570
Master.

375
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,740
As you wish,

376
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,380
Haofang is under my control.

377
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,780
Soon,

378
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,970
a demon will come out of the city's water with a treasure.

379
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,160
This treasure is crucial to my plan.

380
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:04,060
You should take this opportunity to control all sects.

381
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,180
But

382
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,230
Xixuan Sect

383
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,840
may be a hard nut to crack.

384
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,170
The diving dragon stirs up trouble in the deep.

385
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,580
Whether there will be big waves

386
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:31,450
depends on you.

387
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,190
Congratulations.

388
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,580
You have regained all your divine power.

389
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,890
It's perfect.

390
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:03,990
It's far

391
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:05,680
from being perfect.

392
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,300
Although

393
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,700
I have regained my power,

394
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,530
I haven't retrieved my consciousness of god.

395
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,290
My memories before resurrection

396
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,710
are vague.

397
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:20,960
If I want to get my memories back,

398
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,890
I need to start with

399
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,100
that fake banished god in Xixuan Sect.

400
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,330
Isn't this what you've always wanted?

401
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:56,790
Thank you, my friend.

402
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,730
Friend,

403
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,730
why do I think you look familiar?

404
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,290
What's your name?

405
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,920
Yinfeng from Qingxu Sect.

406
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,440
I heard that the hierarch of Xixuan Sect

407
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,830
has taken the Ultimate Banished God

408
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,900
as the last disciple.

409
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,410
I'm here to visit him.

410
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,500
Then you must have got the wrong person.

411
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,640
I'm not a banished god.

412
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,260
He is someone else.

413
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,320
In that case,

414
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,970
you are a fake, right?

415
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,840
In this world,

416
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,790
things can be true or false.

417
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,200
How many people can tell?

418
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,360
Ji Ruochen.

419
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:00,960
Do you recognize me?

420
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,390
According to the book,

421
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,110
a primitive god has infinite power

422
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,150
He is not in the Three Realms

423
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,700
or the Five Elements.

424
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,340
Some people want to die,

425
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,700
but they may not die.

426
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:19,710
It seems

427
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,330
it's true.

428
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:23,770
I'm flattered

429
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,570
if you say that.

430
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,490
I'm not a primitive god.

431
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,710
The Heaven showed mercy

432
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,420
and spared my life

433
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,890
to solve unsolved problems.

434
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,560
Solve unsolved problems?

435
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,610
Are you here to kill me?

436
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,730
I'm thinking about it.

437
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,440
After all, you are still useful to me.

438
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,680
If that's the case,

439
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:55,900
you're a god after all,

440
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,880
and I'm just a fake.

441
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,470
It'll be easy for you to kill me.

442
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,370
Why don't you

443
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:03,320
sit down

444
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,310
and have a chat with me?

445
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:05,770
I'm here anyway.

446
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,560
You can kill me anytime.

447
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:35,960
Senior.

448
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,430
Senior.

449
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,260
How did it go? Did you find anything?

450
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,530
Just as you expected,

451
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,750
Ji Ruochen

452
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,540
went to hide in the library early in the morning.

453
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:49,520
He must be afraid that he can't defeat you

454
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,060
and he'll be ashamed in front of others.

455
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,920
How did you get in?

456
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,960
Didn't the two Evil-Repelling Beasts

457
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,200
spit on you?

458
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,940
Even the Wuya Formation of Xixuan Sect couldn't trap me,

459
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,980
let alone a beast.

460
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,560
Didn't you say that I'm still useful to you?

461
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,180
Tell me.

462
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,150
What's the use of me?

463
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,580
Maybe I can help.

464
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,330
Easy.

465
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:20,880
I want to know

466
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:23,860
how you

467
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,360
managed to kill me that day?

468
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,560
Kill you?

469
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,400
You can kill me.

470
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,310
But I won't be happy

471
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,330
if you say that.

472
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,760
That day, it was you who used power

473
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,060
to make the lamp fall

474
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,540
on your head.

475
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,560
Why did you say that I killed you?

476
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,430
Ridiculous!

477
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:45,750
How ridiculous!

478
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,500
I have divine power to protect me.

479
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:48,890
How can those things in the mortal world

480
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,280
approach me?

481
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,480
I'm telling the truth.

482
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,080
Think about it.

483
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,690
Was it you who wanted to kill Huaniang?

484
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:56,930
Your power

485
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,110
made the lamp fall

486
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,620
on your head.

487
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,420
Did you forget it?

488
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,470
Luckily, you didn't kill me today.

489
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,570
If you killed me,

490
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,600
I would die for nothing.

491
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,320
Who are you?

492
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,810
Why did you pretend to be me?

493
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,460
Didn't you just say that

494
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,580
I'm a banished god?

495
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,950
I am a banished god.

496
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,520
It seems

497
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,380
you still won't admit that you are fake.

498
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,690
Aren't you afraid that I'll expose you?

499
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,240
They've all acknowledged my identity anyway.

500
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,760
I think no one will believe you

501
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,800
no matter what you say.

502
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,470
Shameless!

503
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:46,740
We are in Xixuan Mountains,

504
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,230
not in the desert.

505
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:49,930
They won't let you kill innocent people.

506
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:08,870
By the Wuding River,

507
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,900
you had accompanied me for thousands of years.

508
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,180
How can I just sit by and watch?

509
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:14,760
How can I

510
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,140
let you suffer disasters alone?

511
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,130
Since we were banished to the mortal world,

512
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,880
I had accompanied

513
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,690
and protected you for 99 lifetimes.

514
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,100
And in this life,

515
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,470
I've been looking for you.

516
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:34,700
Qing.

517
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,520
I finally found you.

518
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,280
You're not from Xixuan.

519
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,610
Why do you want to kill him?

520
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:39,350
My apology.

521
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,710
Please forgive me.

522
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,200
Fairy Gu.

523
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,900
You don't know him?

524
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:51,200
I've never seen him before.

525
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,000
You should know him. But you don't.

526
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,170
You shouldn't know me. But you know.

527
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,430
You have much divine power.

528
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,380
May I ask, are you practicing divine skills?

529
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,450
I'm Gu Qing, a fairy from Yun Zhong Ju.

530
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,170
You are also a god?

531
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,300
That's great.

532
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,390
But today

533
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,850
it's between me and him.

534
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,690
Please stay out of it.

535
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,160
Sorry. I can't comply with

536
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,390
your request.

537
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,320
This is unexpected.

538
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,020
Although Ji is not a decent man,

539
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:31,800
a beauty like her

540
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,710
is willing to risk her life to protect you.

541
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:35,930
I'm impressed.

542
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,130
Fairy Gu.

543
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,440
Let me remind you.

544
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,160
The person behind you

545
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,860
is a hypocrite.

546
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:48,110
You love him sincerely.

547
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,740
But

548
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,870
his feelings for you may not be true.

549
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,480
Ji Ruochen,

550
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,290
I won't let you go.

551
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,440
He came uninvited and is so arrogant.

552
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,010
Don't chase him.

553
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:10,300
But today,

554
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,060
I really want to thank you.

555
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,150
I just saw

556
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,020
a male stranger.

557
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,330
He didn't look like one of us.

558
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,830
What male stranger?

559
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,320
It was a fairy.

560
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:27,660
How dare you!

561
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,290
The library is an important place of our sect,

562
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,760
but you two were having a secret date here.

563
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:33,940
What secret date?

564
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,510
-Senior.
-Senior.

565
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,110
Yinyin.

566
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,360
Ruochen.

567
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:46,310
Ruochen was having a secret date with Gu Qing in the library?

568
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,420
Many disciples saw them.

569
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,480
They were destined

570
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,360
to have

571
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,700
an intertwined divine romance.

572
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,180
Wonderful.

573
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,870
This time,

574
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,680
I might as well

575
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:08,370
follow the fate.

576
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,800
Ji Ruochen, you liar!

577
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,060
I don't want to see you again.

578
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:15,510
Go to hell!

579
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,170
I don't want to see you anymore.

580
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:19,930
Yinyin.

581
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,140
What are you doing here?

582
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,780
It's too dangerous here.

583
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:27,580
You came at the right time.

584
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,800
I'll throw you down too.

585
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,770
Help!

586
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,220
Yinyin, let me explain.

587
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:43,930
Senior Yinyin.

588
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,820
Don't call me Senior.

589
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,540
I'm not your senior.

590
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,620
Then let me explain.

591
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,350
Explain what?

592
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,420
I saw it clearly in the library.

593
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,480
Ji Ruochen, I don't want to see you anymore.

594
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:53,300
Don't take it off.

595
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,440
You'll have a headache if you take it off.

596
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,160
It has nothing to do with you

597
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,500
whether I have a headache and turn into a demon or not.

598
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,160
Yinyin.

599
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,220
Yinyin.

600
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,130
Jin.

601
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,450
Jin Shan.

602
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:13,920
Ziyang.

603
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,550
Jin Shan, how have you been?

604
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,310
Ziyang, how have you been?

605
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,580
I've been fine.

606
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,280
You came here today,

607
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,860
not just to fish with me, right?

608
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,890
I'm here to congratulate you.

609
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,680
Thank you.

610
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:33,250
On what?

611
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,680
After you came here,

612
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,140
the schools of Xixuan

613
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,430
have learned

614
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,300
what your disciples are capable of.

615
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,090
Especially Fairy Gu Qing.

616
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,670
Although she is young,

617
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:49,930
her power has become combined with the Heaven and Earth.

618
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,340
With this disciple,

619
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,100
Yun Zhong Ju will be prosperous soon.

620
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,810
Not at all.

621
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:58,580
Qing

622
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:01,100
is from the God Realm.

623
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,220
Of course she is extraordinary.

624
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,330
Right.

625
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,400
Although Gu Qing

626
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,540
is the first time here,

627
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:10,780
she has a deep connection

628
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,550
with my disciple Ruochen.

629
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:14,469
I think they are a perfect match.

630
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,080
You and I

631
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,810
are their masters.

632
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,659
Why don't we take the opportunity to help make them a couple?

633
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:22,520
Of course we should...

634
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:25,840
Who did you say?

635
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,130
Ruochen and Gu Qing.

636
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,820
What about them?

637
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,469
You still don't know?

638
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:36,570
They have been in love with each other

639
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,170
since they met.

640
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,969
They are always together.

641
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,330
Today,

642
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:43,650
they had a secret date in the library.

643
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,670
A secret date?

644
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,510
Nonsense!

645
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,850
I don't believe my disciple has a relationship

646
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,600
with your disciple.

647
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:51,929
How do you know that?

648
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:54,260
They are banished gods.

649
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,020
Of course they will have a divine romance.

650
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,540
Now they have fallen in love with each other.

651
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,660
The two sects are matched.

652
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,210
Why don't we choose an auspicious date

653
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,390
for their marriage?

654
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:04,100
For what?

655
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,180
Their marriage.

656
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,190
How did you come up with

657
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:09,500
such a dirty idea?

658
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,700
They both have feelings for each other.

659
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,680
I'm sure they will get married.

660
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,020
You...

661
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:27,230
Do you want me to die of anger?

662
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,840
Master, you're exaggerating.

663
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:29,900
I'm not drinking it.

664
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:30,920
Let me ask you.

665
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,650
Did you break into

666
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,820
Xixuan's library?

667
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:36,630
Yes.

668
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,020
Absurd!

669
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,360
There are countless secret techniques in Yun Zhong Ju.

670
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,760
Why did you go there?

671
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:44,690
You know what?

672
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,030
Today, Ziyang

673
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:47,990
was arrogant in front of me

674
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:50,140
using it as an excuse.

675
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,120
He even shamelessly

676
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,230
proposed a marriage for his disciple.

677
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,420
Propose a marriage?

678
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,850
for Ji Ruochen?

679
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:58,770
Yes.

680
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,260
If not that arrogant brat,

681
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,260
who else could it be?

682
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:05,770
You

683
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,770
are still inexperienced in this world.

684
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,950
You don't know their tricks.

685
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:14,610
Never mind.

686
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,080
Don't worry too much about this.

687
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,980
I will find a way to protect you.

688
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,030
Since they proposed,

689
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:22,100
you should agree.

690
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:25,140
What did you say?

691
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,510
It's my own marriage.

692
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,440
I'll make the decision for myself.

693
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,410
Do you know what you are doing?

694
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,220
Don't

695
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,550
mention this again.

696
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,250
Leave here tomorrow.

697
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,950
Shi Ji, get prepared.

698
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,130
Yes. Master.

699
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:37,910
Master.

700
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,160
I'm destined to have a romance with Ruochen.

701
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,490
No one can stop it.

702
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:42,550
You...

703
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:43,580
You...

704
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:44,760
You...

705
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,440
Does she really not want to see me?

706
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,310
Ruochen.

707
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:03,600
Master.

708
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:07,800
Master.

709
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,290
Master.

710
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:11,660
It's late.

711
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:12,640
Why did you come here?

712
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,100
Have you found Yinyin?

713
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,010
Well... Master, you already know?

714
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,950
From now on,

715
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,070
don't see her anymore.

716
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,260
Why?

717
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,320
I've made an engagement between you and Fairy Gu Qing

718
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,910
with Yun Zhong Ju.

719
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:34,750
Master.

720
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,310
Let me ask you.

721
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,700
Do you know

722
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,640
about Fairy Gu Qing's background?

723
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,800
I just heard that

724
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,720
she's the most outstanding disciple

725
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,750
since the establishment of Yun Zhong Ju.

726
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,890
She is the Bluestone God left in the mortal world by the God Realm.

727
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,750
Do you know

728
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,620
the Bluestone God

729
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,860
is destined to have a romance

730
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,580
with you in this life?

731
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:00,010
I don't know.

732
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:01,840
I only know that

733
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,300
whether it's a mortal romance

734
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,530
or a divine romance,

735
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,320
we can't force ourselves.

736
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,390
How can you break

737
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,350
a preordained destiny?

738
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,500
Back then, Senior Ziwei

739
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,610
sacrificed his 100-year power and terminated his cultivation in advance

740
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,680
just to take you here.

741
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:19,850
He did it

742
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:22,250
because you are a banished god.

743
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:24,500
Since you are a banished god,

744
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:28,810
you have to follow your divine destiny.

745
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,200
Otherwise,

746
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:34,190
you're not a banished god.

747
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,410
What if I'm not?

748
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,120
Shut up!

749
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,890
You have to be.

750
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:54,230
Do you know what will happen

751
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,360
if Senior Ziwei has mistaken you for a banished god?

752
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,870
People who have suspected you

753
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:01,170
long ago

754
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,720
will kill you immediately.

755
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,310
Besides, the long-lasting reputation of Xixuan Sect

756
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,770
will be ruined.

757
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,590
Those old enemies

758
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,520
will use this as an excuse to embarrass me

759
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,150
and force Xixuan Sect into a catastrophe.

760
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:18,970
Ruochen.

761
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:21,650
Xixuan Sect's foundation,

762

safety,

763
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:24,910
and future

764
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,740
all depend on you.

765
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,300
I've told you

766
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,310
the advantages and disadvantages.

767
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,730
If you understand,

768
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,840
just follow my arrangement

769
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,830
and accept your destiny.

770
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:47,740
I won't.

771
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,510
I won't marry anyone else

772
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,660
except Yinyin.
