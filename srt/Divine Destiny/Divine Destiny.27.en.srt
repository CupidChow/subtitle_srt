[Episode 27]

4
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,900
I... I remember now.

5
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:55,840
The bracelet...

6
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,330
The bracelet is mine.

7
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,350
Who...

8
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,570
Who gave it to me?

9
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,430
No.

10
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,370
Ji Ruochen.

11
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,860
You can't give up halfway.

12
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,460
Yinyin.

13
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,210
Think harder.

14
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,440
Who gave it to me?

15
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:13,510
This bracelet

16
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,630
is made of Demon Subduing Stones.

17
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,610
Don't take it off. Otherwise, you'll have a headache.

18
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,560
It has nothing to do with you

19
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,940
whether I have a headache or turn into a monster.

20
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,640
-Who on earth? -Yinyin.

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,880
Yinyin, think harder.

22
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,290
Wear it well this time.

23
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,290
In the future,

24
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,579
if you make me angry again,

25
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,140
I'll take a look at this bracelet.

26
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:36,980
You gave me this bracelet.

27
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,310
Now I'm giving it back to you.

28
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,329
What you said to me

29
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,000
and your kindness to me.

30
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,230
I'm giving them all back to you.

31
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,620
Think harder, Yinyin.

32
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,170
Yinyin.

33
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,260
Do you remember now?

34
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,820
Beautiful fairy. Thank you

35
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,579
for saving me.

36
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,900
You are asking me to jump

37
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,550
from such a high place.

38
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:23,810
What if I die?

39
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,020
I don't even know

40
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,940
my savior's name.

41
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,020
It'll be a lifelong regret.

42
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:27,910
Listen carefully.

43
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,030
I'm Zhang Yinyin, the chief disciple of the Taixuan Palace of Xixuan Sect.

44
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,660
Zhang Yinyin.

45
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,180
Let's go.

46
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,540
You should hold me tight.

47
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,340
What are you doing?

48
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,300
From now on,

49
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,510
you'll be mine.

50
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,860
If you join Xixuan,

51
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,350
I'll protect you.

52
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,340
It's a deal then.

53
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,840
It was you.

54
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,910
You gave it to me.

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,810
Clerk.

56
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,840
I like you so much.

57
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,270
But I forgot you.

Yinyin, why are you here?

Are you alright?

Where are we?

108
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:49,260
Yinyin, you've had poor memory lately.

109
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,650
Are you too worried about Li Xuanzhen?

110
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,680
Xuanzhen?

111
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,990
Li Xuanzhen was hurt by the divine flame.

112
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,480
Yuxuan Zhenren has suppressed it with the Black Jade.

113
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,700
But it seems the divine flame can reignite.

114
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,890
This time, we came out

115
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,440
to find a way to cure Li Xuanzhen.

116
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,790
Tell me.

117
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,170
How did Xuanzhen get hurt?

118
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,100
And what is the divine flame?

119
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,490
Yinyin.

120
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,010
It's a long story.

121
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:16,720
It's too cold outside.

122
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,040
Let's talk inside.

123
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,550
Li Xuanzhen...

124
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,000
Goodbye.

125
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:32,860
Yinyin.

126
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,090
Yinyin.

127
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:14,920
Do you know this?

128
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,020
The person who treats you the best in this world

129
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,430
is now risking his life alone.

130
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,570
But I can't tell you anything.

131
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,340
If anything happens to Mr. Ji,

132
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,210
I...

133
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,040
No.

134
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,340
Yinyin.

135
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,010
Did you have a nightmare again?

136
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,690
I dreamed of someone.

137
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,480
He kept moving forward.

138
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,590
I chased him and called him,

139
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,120
but he wouldn't stop.

140
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,340
Who was that person?

141
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,020
I don't know.

142
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,970
He turned his back to me.

143
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,260
But I think he's familiar.

144
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,070
He seems important to me.

145
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,250
This is strange.

146
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,720
It's not my parents.

147
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,730
Who could it be?

148
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,240
It's okay. It's just a dream.

149
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,230
But does it hurt when you dream?

150
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,220
I could feel that he was very sad.

151
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,310
It seemed that he lost the most precious thing.

152
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,250
But I couldn't help.

153
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,440
I couldn't even catch up with him.

154
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:25,540
So,

155
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,440
Yinyin,

156
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,630
you can never forget Mr. Ji.

157
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,110
Even in your dream,

158
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,580
you were connected to each other.

159
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,370
How can I be so cruel

160
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:39,960
to be a bad guy?

161
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,100
No.

162
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,770
I need to go back to Xixuan Mountains now.

163
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,590
I think I've forgotten a lot lately.

164
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,540
That must be why

165
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,860
I've forgotten him.

166
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,050
So he ignored me in the dream.

167
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:54,880
Let's go.

168
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,550
Yinyin.

169
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,250
Yinyin.

170
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,290
Why don't you go somewhere with me first?

171
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,850
Then we can go back to Xixuan together.

172
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,070
Where?

173
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,950
To Qingyuan Holy Land.

174
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,100
Why should we go there?

175
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:09,770
To help someone.

176
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,710
He is your junior.

177
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,630
His name is Ji Ruochen.

178
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,750
Xixuan Sect ordered him

179
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,050
to destroy the last spiritual cave.

180
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,150
Destroy the spiritual cave?

181
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,430
How can I be absent from this?

182
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,810
Let's go now.

183
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,700
I'm going to summon the bird now.

184
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,310
Okay.

185
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,410
Sorry, Yinfeng.

186
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,800
It's not Mr. Ji.

187
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,490
It's us.

188
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,030
Brother.

189
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,500
Fairy Gu is not here.

190
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,620
Is she waiting for Mr. Ji at the spiritual cave?

191
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:57,940
It doesn't matter.

192
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,030
Our priority now

193
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,320
is to help Mr. Ji

194
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,530
hold back this cruel man.

195
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,140
You think you can defeat me?

196
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,730
You overestimated yourselves.

197
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,250
Go.

198
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,760
If you really become a demon,

199
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,190
there will be no turning back.

200
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,130
The God Realm won't spare you.

201
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,580
Ruochen,

202
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,060
are you really going to disobey God's will?

203
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,660
Have you ever thought about this?

204
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,540
What if you are wrong?

205
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,740
What if I save the Three Realms

206
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,550
by destroying the spiritual caves?

207
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,120
You still won't listen to me?

208
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,560
Qing.

209
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,110
He has lost his mind.

210
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,510
There is no need to waste time on him.

211
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,470
Yeah.

212
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,460
If you want to fight,

213
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:22,990
just do it.

214
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,740
I don't want to waste my time on you here.

215
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:11,829
Brother.

216
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:13,200
Brother!

217
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,240
Brother, wake up. Brother.

218
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,740
Don't scare me. Brother.

219
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,859
You can't die.

220
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,609
Brother, wake up.

221
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,400
Brother. He left. Wake up.

222
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,280
Brother!

223
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,900
Dragon Elephant. White Tiger.

224
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,420
-What happened to you two? -Qingyi.

225
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:39,980
Yinyin.

226
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,940
I thought you've gone back to...

227
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,770
Dragon Elephant, how is White Tiger's injury?

228
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,040
I checked his pulse.

229
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,660
He's safe for now.

230
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,390
Where is your friend, Mr. Ji?

231
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,920
Where is the spiritual cave?

232
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,940
Yinfeng went to the spiritual cave.

233
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,000
Qingyi. You should go there now.

234
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,150
Go save Mr. Ji.

235
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,020
You stay here and take care of them.

236
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,570
I'm going to help him.

237
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,540
Yinyin.

238
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,910
Mr. Ji. Yinyin.

239
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,110
I hope I'm not wrong.

240
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,640
Two against one. Shameless!

241
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,710
Zhang Yinyin, why haven't you stopped him?

242
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,690
Do you know destroying the spiritual caves

243
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:41,850
is against the world?

244
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:42,820
If we don't destroy the spiritual caves,

245
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,000
the cultivators who want to take shortcuts will come for them.

246
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,340
It will cause a bloodbath.

247
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,230
I don't think what Junior Ji is doing is wrong.

248
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,090
Ruochen refused to marry me

249
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,220
because of you.

250
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,700
But you don't care about him at all.

251
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,240
Zhang Yinyin, you deserve to die!

252
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,220
Ruochen.

253
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,040
Yinyin.

254
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,010
Yinyin.

255
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:06,500
You...

256
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,000
Who on earth are you to me?

257
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,200
Mr. Ji.

258
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,780
Yinyin. Yinyin.

259
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,480
Ruochen.

260
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,530
Yinyin.

261
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,150
Yinyin.

262
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:34,510
Qing.

263
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,880
-Yinyin. -Qing.

264
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,300
Yinyin.

265
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,150
No.

266
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,240
Mr. Ji.

267
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,490
Yinyin.

268
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,560
Ji Ruochen is dead.

269
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,580
Unfortunately, the spiritual cave still has been destroyed.

270
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,500
But it doesn't matter,

271
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,700
as long as Ji Ruochen, who is a demon, is dead.

272
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:07,950
Please keep your promise.

273
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,490
You and Gu Qing

274
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,740
have made great contributions to saving the Three Realms.

275
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,010
How could I break my promise?

276
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,510
Yinfeng,

277
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,690
you should know that

278
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,980
only those who cut off their ties in the mortal world

279
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,480
can generate the dharma-laksana

280
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,050
and stand on the Ascending Platform.

281
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,780
If she has any attachment to the mortal world,

282
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,620
the Soul of Immortal Cloud is also useless.

283
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,370
You must be very careful.

284
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,040
What killed Ji Ruochen

285
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:50,880
was Gu Qing's sword.

286
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,220
It's obvious.

287
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,620
Wish you return to the God Realm as soon as possible.

288
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,940
We will return soon.

289
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,680
Master.

290
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,860
We are about to launch an attack on Xixuan Sect.

291
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,540
Why don't you let Yinfeng and Gu Qing

292
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,060
help us attack Xixuan Sect

293
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,140
before giving this to him?

294
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,100
Don't worry.

295
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,780
He will come back to beg you.

296
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,490
By that time,

297
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:25,780
you can tell him about this.

298
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,500
Master, you mean...

299
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,830
You'll understand by then.

300
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,220
I know

301
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,120
you're not confident about conquering Xixuan.

302
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,900
I'll teach you a divine art today.

303
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,920
You can go without worry.

304
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:44,860
Thank you, Master.

305
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:42,790
Ruochen.

306
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,150
I didn't mean to kill you.

307
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,360
I really didn't.

308
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:00,750
Qing.

309
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,340
I only wanted to eliminate his cultivation.

310
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,660
Why did my sword pierce his body?

311
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,530
It was you.

312
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,120
You used divine arts

313
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,310
to inject power into my sword.

314
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,250
Why did you do that?

315
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,320
Qing.

316
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,120
You saw it too.

317
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,270
Ji Ruochen had become a demon.

318
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,250
There was no other way to save him.

319
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,650
Even if we didn't kill him today,

320
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,700
he will be killed by those righteous sects sooner or later.

321
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:43,940
If so,

322
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,330
he will only die in more pain.

323
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,080
Don't try to make an excuse.

324
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,060
You know I've finished practicing the sixth volume of the Book of Heaven.

325
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,820
I can get rid of the demon flame for him

326
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,890
and make him turn over a new leaf.

327
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:53,940
After that,

328
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,940
with Xixuan supporting him,

329
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,250
no sect can kill him.

330
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,420
You just

331
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:03,220
didn't want to lose the chance to kill him.

332
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,400
But you shouldn't have done it with my sword.

333
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:09,220
Qing.

334
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,160
If he didn't die under your sword,

335
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,010
how would you cut off your ties in the mortal world and return to the God Realm?

336
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,410
In order to return to the God Realm,

337
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:26,170
you can decide other people's fate

338
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,230
and treat others like ants?

339
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,870
Maybe Ruochen was right.

340
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,680
A god like this

341
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,490
is no different from a demon.

342
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:43,470
Qing.

343
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:45,740
So this is what you think of me

344
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,540
in your heart.

345
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,490
Not just you.

346
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,060
Me too.

347
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:03,630
I knew Ji Ruochen didn't want to marry me.

348
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,900
But I allowed Yun Zhong Ju and Xixuan to join hands

349
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,550
to force him to agree.

350
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,740
Me like this

351
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,240
is no different from you.

352
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:15,970
Qing.

353
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,020
I know it's hard for you to accept it now.

354
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,070
But I promise you.

355
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,230
After we return to the God Realm

356
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,670
and achieve Tao,

357
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:26,920
you will understand

358
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,900
the cause and effect

359
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,850
have been predestined.

360
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,890
Even we

361
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,280
can't change it.

362
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,550
You've never tried. How do you know you can't change it?

363
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:37,760
If the God Realm is like this,

364
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,300
I don't want to go back.

365
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,630
I'm tired.

366
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,360
Please go back.

367
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:47,670
Okay.

368
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,340
I know.

369
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,930
You will figure it out.

370
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,220
You just need to know

371
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:56,830
no matter what,

372
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,310
I'll always be by your side.

373
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,810
Can we launch an attack on Xixuan Sect?

374
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,920
It's hard to say.

375
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,190
Let's make the decision

376
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,630
after Imperial Advisor arrives.

377
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,180
You are right.

378
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,350
Let's discuss it together after Imperial Advisor arrives.

379
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,020
Hierarches.

380
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,960
Imperial Advisor. Imperial Advisor.

381
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,430
Mr. Wangchen.

382
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,560
Imperial Advisor.

383
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,820
I'm really grateful that

384
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,460
Mr. Wangchen can come to help us

385
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,340
attack Xixuan Sect.

386
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:56,040
This girl with the Tianquan Ancient Sword

387
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,430
must be Mr. Wangchen's disciple,

388
00:27:58,650 --> 00:27:59,560
Miss Yun.

389
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,530
Imperial Advisor. I'm Yun Wuhua.

390
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,970
Mr. Wangchen. Hierarches. Please sit down.

391
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,380
OK. Please.

392
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,060
Please. Please.

393
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:11,470
Imperial Advisor.

394
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,730
I heard that Ji Ruochen was killed by the two banished gods.

395
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,680
Is it true?

396
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:16,820
Yes.

397
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,530
Ji Ruochen died under Fairy Gu's sword.

398
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:21,940
In that case,

399
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,860
we can launch an attack on Xixuan Mountains, right?

400
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:25,880
Imperial Advisor.

401
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,830
Although we have many people,

402
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:30,260
Xixuan is the top cultivation sect.

403
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,110
I'm afraid...

404
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,130
Mr. Wangchen thinks what I said is wrong?

405
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,060
I've thought about

406
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,340
your concern.

407
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,700
So I contacted Mr. Wangchen long ago.

408
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,060
With Mr. Wangchen's help,

409
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:49,310
we can double the results with half the effort.

410
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:53,500
Imperial Advisor. Mr. Wangchen. Please be more specific.

411
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,680
Mr. Wangchen.

412
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:58,050
Actually, it's nothing.

413
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,610
It's just that

414
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,460
I was a disciple of Xixuan Sect years ago.

415
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:04,290
I know a little about

416
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,440
their weapons, techniques, and formations.

417
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:14,910
Well...

418
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:22,700
Mr. Wangchen has lived in seclusion in the martial arts world

419
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,610
and has always kept a low profile.

420
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,870
We didn't know

421
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,070
you are related to Xixuan Sect.

422
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:35,150
Then why did Mr. Wangchen and Xixuan Sect...

423
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,000
Because Xixuan Sect

424
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,670
is a bunch of hypocrites and cunning people.

425
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:41,530
They wouldn't allow me to stay.

426
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,140
Back then,

427
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:47,850
my junior and I loved each other.

428
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,980
Ziyang and others slandered me.

429
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,300
They said I harassed my junior

430
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,360
and didn't allow us to explain.

431
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,940
So they expelled me from Xixuan.

432
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,350
I was weak and alone at that time.

433
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,930
I was no match for Xixuan.

434
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,790
So I have waited quietly for so many years.

435
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,690
Now,

436
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,900
all the righteous sects in the world want to conquer Xixuan.

437
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:15,110
Of course I should do my best.

438
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,900
Mr. Wangchen should take your revenge this time.

439
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,800
You can't be wronged for nothing.

440
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,730
Mr. Wangchen is very helpful.

441
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,570
If the two banished gods go with us,

442
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,560
we will surely win a great victory.

443
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:35,100
In the battle with Ji Ruochen,

444
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:35,980
Fairy Gu was injured.

445
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,840
She needs some time to recover.

446
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,620
But don't worry.

447
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:42,160
When Fairy Gu gets better,

448
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,970
the two banished gods will go to Xixuan

449
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,310
to meet us.

450
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,530
Imperial Advisor.

451
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,150
Please tell us when we should set off.

452
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:53,210
Please tell us.

453
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,330
Mr. Ji and Yinyin left nothing before they died.

454
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,970
We could only

455
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,460
build a cenotaph there.

456
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,980
Ruochen and Yinyin died

457
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,850
for Xixuan Sect and us old guys.

458
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:17,740
If I knew this would happen,

459
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:20,620
I would have asked her to stay here

460
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,700
even if it would take my life.

461
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,730
Yinyin.

462
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,490
Come back.

463
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,180
Come back!

464
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,840
Ji Ruochen promised me

465
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,290
he would protect Yinyin.

466
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:44,950
No.

467
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,800
It was all my fault.

468
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:50,170
Mr. Ji made Yinyin forget him

469
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,680
and asked me to bring Yinyin back.

470
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,460
I saw Yinyin crying in her dream.

471
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:56,660
I couldn't bear.

472
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,880
So I took her to find Mr. Ji.

473
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:00,850
If you want to blame someone, blame me.

474
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,780
Don't misunderstand Mr. Ji's love for Yinyin.

475
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,530
Everyone knows Ruochen's love

476
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,620
for Yinyin.

477
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,720
Now they are dead.

478
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,260
Xinglan,

479
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,220
don't blame Ruochen anymore.

480
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,190
Besides,

481
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,850
Sun Guo

482
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,900
has gathered a lot of people.

483
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,300
They'll attack Xixuan Mountains soon.

484
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:31,710
In addition, I heard

485
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,150
the Demon Emperor is recruiting men

486
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,850
to take advantage of the situation.

487
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,260
A war is inevitable.

488
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,660
Jingxiao.

489
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,380
Xinglan.

490
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,250
I promise you

491
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,580
after the war,

492
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,360
I will arrange a grand funeral for the two kids.

493
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,880
Thank you.

494
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,230
They killed Yinyin.

495
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,790
I must let them

496
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,980
pay the price.

497
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,420
Mr. Ji's residence is really elegant.

498
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,230
Can I have one of his things

499
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:39,970
as a souvenir?

500
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,110
Sure.

501
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:10,920
Mr. Ji.

502
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:12,370
I'm sorry.

503
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:14,300
I failed to complete the mission you gave me.

504
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,270
Don't worry.

505
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:19,070
After I return to the Endless Sea,

506
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,270
I will practice harder.

507
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:21,780
Even if I have to go to the God Realm,

508
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,270
I will avenge you.

509
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,520
And me.

510
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:27,199
Me too.

511
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,500
Me too.

512
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:43,670
Xuanzhen.

513
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,680
Qing.

514
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,550
Why won't you practice the Book of Heaven?

515
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,860
I've lost my dharma-laksana.

516
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,620
I'm no different from a mortal.

517
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,160
Since I can't go back,

518
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,090
what's the use of practicing divine arts?

519
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,470
Qing,

520
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:16,350
if you give up now,

521
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,580
everything we've been through in the 100 lifetimes

522
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:19,680
will be in vain.

523
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,430
Besides,

524
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,260
I have found a way

525
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,160
to help you regain your dharma-laksana.

526
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:29,030
You got the Soul of Immortal Cloud?

527
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:38,800
I know

528
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,550
in order to use the Soul of Immortal Cloud,

529
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,200
I must cut off my ties with the mortal world.

530
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,060
I know I can't do it now.

531
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,100
Don't waste it.

532
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:49,620
Qing.

533
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,550
I believe your sword

534
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,150
has cut off your love for Ji Ruochen.

535
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,710
If you don't try,

536
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:55,830
how do you know it'll be wasted?

537
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:05,140
Qing.

538
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,800
I know you resent me.

539
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,570
But

540
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,590
I've waited for you for 100 lifetimes.

541
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,250
Please give it a try.

542
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:18,970
Yinfeng.

543
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,660
You are so obsessed.

544
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,150
I don't think you have cut off your ties in the mortal world.

545
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:28,940
Maybe

546
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,230
on the day we go back to the Wuding River together,

547
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:36,500
I can really let it go and end it.

548
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:40,340
Fine.

549
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,730
I'll grant your wish.

550
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,020
I'm Ji Ruochen, a disciple of the Taichang Palace of Xixuan.

551
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,160
Nice to meet you. Fairy.

552
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:00,260
How come?

553
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:03,270
Impossible.

554
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,590
How could this happen?

555
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:05,830
It just...

556
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,140
Do you believe me now?

557
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:15,980
No.

558
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:17,620
No.

559
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,350
I will find another way.

560
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,080
Ruochen is dead.

561
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,770
Tao is

562
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:30,700
meaningless to me.

563
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,210
Master.

564
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:49,720
Your turn.

565
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,500
Forget it.

566
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:00,730
I'm not in the mood for this.

567
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,040
Master.

568
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,810
Are you sad about Ji Ruochen?

569
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,140
I'm sad about the Three Realms.

570
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,860
The sects will attack Xixuan.

571
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,260
The chaos in the Three Realms has begun.

572
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,270
Maybe soon,

573
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,740
I can't guard the Endless Sea

574
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:24,340
that I've been guarding for thousands of years.

575
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,280
Master, it won't happen.

576
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,420
The world

577
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:31,140
is full of constant changes.

578
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:07,170
What should happen will happen.

579
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:12,250
What should go will go.
