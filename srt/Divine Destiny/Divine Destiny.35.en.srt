[Episode 35]

4
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:55,960
Qing.

5
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,910
I will do my best

6
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:00,940
to save the people.

7
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,870
When everything is over,

8
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,270
we'll return to the Wuding River.

9
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,500
The Demon Tower has started to absorb spiritual power.

10
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:46,950
Hierarch.

11
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,310
Hierarch, what's going on?

12
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,010
The Demon Tower has absorbed all the spiritual energy in the world.

13
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,480
From now on,

14
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,810
there will be no more spiritual energy in the world.

15
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,120
In the blink of an eye,

16
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,700
almost all the spiritual energy around here

17
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,640
has been absorbed by the Demon Tower.

18
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,910
If this continues...

19
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,490
No. I have to think of a way.

20
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,690
The Demon Tower has been born.

21
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,630
No one can stop it anymore.

22
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,840
Don't waste your time.

23
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,410
Sun Guo.

24
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,100
What are you doing here?

25
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,930
Master has succeeded.

26
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,560
I can follow him to the God Realm.

27
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,090
Succeeded?

28
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,010
The birth of the Demon Tower

29
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,840
was designed by you?

30
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:49,350
That's right.

31
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,970
Ji Ruochen destroyed the spiritual caves

32
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:56,460
to prevent the Demon Tower from being born.

33
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,980
That's why I incited all sects

34
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,180
to deal with him together.

35
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,630
Yinfeng.

36
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,440
Are you surprised?

37
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:09,910
Tell me.

38
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,790
Who is the shadow on the divine cloud?

39
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,320
It doesn't matter anymore.

40
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,100
What matters is

41
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:22,470
in half an hour,

42
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,880
the Ascending Platform will appear here.

43
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,370
By that time,

44
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,850
I will stand on it

45
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,310
and become an immortal.

46
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,030
You're going to stand on the Ascending Platform?

47
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,460
Master gave me the Soul of Immortal Cloud.

48
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:16,640
I'm no longer a mortal.

49
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,380
You think you can become an immortal?

50
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,680
Senior.

51
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,350
Hierarch.

52
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,780
Congratulations. Hierarch.

53
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:58,830
Hierarch.

54
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,230
Where is Ji Ruochen now?

55
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,130
Ji Ruochen.

56
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,180
I'm going to destroy the Demon Tower.

57
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,280
If you don't want to go with me,

58
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,860
just collect my body later.

59
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,240
If you go,

60
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,110
I will definitely go with you.

61
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:30,650
The spiritual power in the world is at my disposal.

62
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,659
From now on,

63
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,000
I will be the ruler of the God Realm.

64
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,679
If anyone disobeys,

65
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,530
I'll tear him into pieces.

66
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,750
The Blue Fire of the Nine Hells.

67
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,420
My tower!

68
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,260
The tower has been destroyed.

69
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:20,780
Yes.

70
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,620
The tower has been destroyed.

71
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,140
Really.

72
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,900
The tower has been destroyed.

73
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,060
It's been destroyed. Look.

74
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:24,940
Yes.

75
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,500
Look, the tower has been destroyed.

76
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,100
My spiritual power is back.

77
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,820
Great.

78
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,780
Mine too. My spiritual power is back.

79
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,680
It's back.

80
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:34,760
This is...

81
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,610
The Demon Tower has been destroyed.

82
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,470
The Three Realms are safe for now.

83
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,510
So Ji Ruochen...

84
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,630
Brat, he even hid it from us.

85
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,150
Yinyin, look.

86
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,290
The spiritual power is back.

87
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,690
I've been waiting for ten million years.

88
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:08,020
But I still failed.

89
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,310
Ji Ruochen.

90
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,490
What's going on?

91
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,820
Silly girl, don't you understand?

92
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,960
He set a trap

93
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,300
and tricked us.

94
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:28,530
That's right.

95
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,820
When I left the Nine Hells,

96
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,940
I left a wisp of the Blue Fire of the Nine Hells in the tower.

97
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:36,410
Yinyin.

98
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,290
What should I do?

99
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,730
Maybe this time,

100
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,640
our good days will really come.

101
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,390
It's time to end all of this.

102
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,670
Actually,

103
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,420
I have never changed the original intention of destroying the tower.

104
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,670
If I destroyed the tower at that time,

105
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,790
I wouldn't be able to find the one behind this.

106
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,970
That's why you set this trap

107
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,810
to make everyone think you've given up destroying the tower.

108
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,420
The enemy was also fooled by you.

109
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,800
So he absorbed the spiritual energy of the world happily,

110
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,080
until he found the Blue Fire of the Nine Hells.

111
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,330
In this way, the tower has been destroyed.

112
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,220
And the mastermind has been caught.

113
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,040
Kill two birds with one stone.

114
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:45,780
Impressive.

115
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,830
Mr. Ji, don't be too modest.

116
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,870
Although I hid it from every one of them,

117
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,740
I failed to hide it from Mr. Ji.

118
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,930
What do you mean?

119
00:13:58,930 --> 00:13:59,970
In the battle at the Endless Sea,

120
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,150
your uncle didn't do his best to stop me.

121
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,510
That day,

122
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,830
I was just guessing what you were planning.

123
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,610
It was just a counterplot.

124
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,060
Actually,

125
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,520
if we really fight,

126
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,090
I won't be your match.

127
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,500
You're being too modest, Mr. Ji.

128
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,000
Ji Ruochen.

129
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,300
You even lied to me?

130
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,180
I'm sorry, honey.

131
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,020
I had no other choice.

132
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,440
It seems that Ruochen

133
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,890
has hidden something in the Demon Tower.

134
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,290
But Senior,

135
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,050
what do you mean by "safe for now"?

136
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,310
Could something still go wrong?

137
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,700
Ruochen set a trap to destroy the tower.

138
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,340
The ten million years of efforts

139
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,220
of the person who built the tower are in vain.

140
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,920
He must be very angry and he will show up

141
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,700
to take revenge on Ruochen.

142
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,520
I'm afraid there will be another fierce battle.

143
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,130
You mean...

144
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,650
Ruochen is willing to sacrifice his life for the world.

145
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,250
As his master, I can't sit by and watch.

146
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,480
I'm going to help him.

147
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:45,830
Senior.

148
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,040
Everyone,

149
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,980
I'll leave Xixuan Sect to you.

150
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:54,630
Senior.

151
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,020
Farewell, Hierarch.

152
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:01,620
Mr. Ji.

153
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,810
But there's still one thing I don't quite understand.

154
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,960
When did you know the secret of the Demon Tower?

155
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,850
And why did you create the Endless Sea

156
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,760
to stop the Demon Tower from being born?

157
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,390
When the time is right,

158
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,970
you'll know the answers.

159
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,140
Now I can only say

160
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,990
I've done everything I can do.

161
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,100
Mr. Ji has protected the world

162
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,050
for ten million years.

163
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,700
It's time you take a rest

164
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,740
and accompany Master.

165
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,540
Leave the rest

166
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,740
to us.

167
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,910
But it's too dangerous.

168
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:34,830
Yinyin.

169
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,410
Do you want to stay?

170
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,220
You know it's too dangerous.

171
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,620
Why do you push me away

172
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,480
whenever it's dangerous?

173
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,060
I've inherited Master's power

174
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,320
and become a heavenly fox.

175
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,140
Of course I will face these things

176
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,180
with you.

177
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,590
Yinyin has really grown up.

178
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,740
Of course.

179
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,660
Otherwise, I would let you down.

180
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,150
In this case,

181
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,140
don't talk me out of going with you.

182
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,100
Maybe

183
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,380
you need me to save you.

184
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:03,470
Okay.

185
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,990
Remember not to act tough.

186
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,420
I know.

187
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:09,710
So nagging.

188
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,329
We're going to leave now.

189
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,109
Goodbye.

190
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,020
Take care.

191
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,800
Qingyi.

192
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:23,020
Come back.

193
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,579
-Uncle.
-Why do you want to go?

194
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,430
Your power is not strong enough.

195
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,560
Even if you go,

196
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:29,880
you'll only get yourself killed.

197
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,270
Come back.

198
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,290
Every time there is a disaster,

199
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,600
there will be someone born to face the calamity.

200
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,610
They are the chosen ones.

201
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,480
All the hardships

202
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,930
were a test for them.

203
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,630
Let them

204
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,320
shoulder the responsibility of saving the Three Realms.

205
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,260
I see.

206
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,490
What's going on?

207
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,170
Master.

208
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,300
What's going on?

209
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,570
Looks like your master succeeded quickly,

210
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,430
but failed more quickly.

211
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,600
You...

212
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,620
Divine stairs.

213
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:02,990
The Ascending Platform.

214
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,850
I am Sun Guo, a cultivator in the mortal world.

215
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,830
High Immortals.

216
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,580
You are standing on a divine lotus.

217
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,280
You must be a new immortal

218
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,340
who is going to the Ascending Platform.

219
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,090
Yes.

220
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:36,890
Since you are from the mortal world,

221
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,620
do you know why the spiritual power in the mortal world suddenly surged?

222
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,160
Please look.

223
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,910
The surge of the spiritual power in the mortal world

224
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,930
is because of the birth of the Demon Tower.

225
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:49,320
All of this was done by Ji Ruochen, the Demon King.

226
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,410
He destroyed the spiritual caves in the world first,

227
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,580
and then planned the birth of the Demon Tower.

228
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,330
If you don't believe me,

229
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,300
you can go there to check.

230
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:01,000
The Blue Fire of the Nine Hells in the Demon Tower is the evidence.

231
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,410
It really is the Blue Fire of the Nine Hells.

232
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,400
Do you know where Ji Ruochen is?

233
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,260
High Immortals.

234
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,300
Since Ji Ruochen has become the Demon King,

235
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,060
his power is unfathomable.

236
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,110
It's not easy to catch him.

237
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,210
However,

238
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:37,270
the banished god is familiar with Ji Ruochen.

239
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,200
He knows him well.

240
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,730
With his help,

241
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,970
you can yield twice the result with half the effort.

242
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,590
General Hao Ming.

243
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:50,980
General Yu Yun.

244
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,660
Don't stand on ceremony.

245
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,340
You have gone through countless tribulations in the mortal world.

246
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,260
You are here today

247
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,580
to stand on the Ascending Platform

248
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:01,840
to return to the God Realm, right?

249
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,640
High Immortals,

250
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,010
I

251
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,500
don't plan to return to the God Realm.

252
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:11,770
I'm here today

253
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,720
not to stand on the Ascending Platform,

254
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,530
but to stop the Demon Tower from being born.

255
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,020
Although I failed,

256
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,130
fortunately, the Demon Tower was destroyed

257
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,340
as soon as it was born.

258
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,070
That's great.

259
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,920
This is also why

260
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,300
General Yu Yun and I came to the mortal world.

261
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,400
Would you help us

262
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,600
capture Ji Ruochen?

263
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,870
High Immortals.

264
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:36,290
Why do you want to arrest Ji Ruochen?

265
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:38,470
He planned the birth of the Demon Tower

266
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,420
and broke the balance of the spiritual power in the mortal world.

267
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,380
We need to arrest him to the God Realm and punish him.

268
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,140
High Immortals. Please forgive me.

269
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,700
I've decided to stay out of everything in this world.

270
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,560
As for capturing Ji Ruochen,

271
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,500
please find someone else to help.

272
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:58,770
You...

273
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,060
Since the Demon Tower has been destroyed,

274
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,340
I'll take my leave.

275
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,500
You stop right there!

276
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,170
How dare you!

277
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,030
You were exiled to the mortal world

278
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,890
because you violated the heavenly rules for Bluestone God.

279
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,780
Today,

280
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,570
do you want to make the same mistake?

281
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,180
All immortals, listen up.

282
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,500
Border Patrol God despised the God Realm and colluded with demons.

283
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,540
I should punish him on behalf of the Heaven today.

284
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,660
Arrest him immediately.

285
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,350
Yes. Sir.

286
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,130
Qing.

287
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,600
Now I know

288
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:53,600
I was wrong.

289
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,330
Ji Ruochen once asked me

290
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,360
what immortals and demons are.

291
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,100
He scolded me for thinking all demons are evil.

292
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,400
I thought he was so stupid.

293
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,830
Immortals represent justice.

294
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,210
Demons should be despised by the world.

295
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:10,720
This is

296
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,700
a general rule.

297
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,430
But now I finally know

298
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,580
immortals and demons

299
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,860
are just titles.

300
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,960
How dare you

301
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,580
slander the God Realm!

302
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,760
You asked for this.

303
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,240
Yinfeng.

304
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,220
Ji Ruochen, why are you here?

305
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,070
Leave now.

306
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:18,940
What happened?

307
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,540
I was on my way to the Endless Sea

308
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,460
to stop the Demon Tower from being born.

309
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,520
But I met immortal generals, Hao Ming and Yu Yun,

310
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:27,830
who were coming to the mortal world.

311
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,020
They believed what Sun Guo said.

312
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,300
They are trying to catch you.

313
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,500
Leave now.

314
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:33,930
Immortal generals?

315
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,580
Catch me?

316
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,690
Good.

317
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:41,940
I was just going to meet them.

318
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,650
But you are a banished god.

319
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:45,940
Why are you helping me?

320
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:48,660
Because...

321
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,330
Because I was wrong.

322
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,220
You were wrong?

323
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,110
Yes.

324
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:58,960
I was wrong.

325
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,640
I shouldn't have guessed the heavenly secret

326
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,500
and thought I represented righteousness.

327
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,250
The real righteousness

328
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,410
varies from time to time, from places to places,

329
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,090
and from person to person.

330
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,680
There is no definition at all.

331
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,570
Whether it's a demon

332
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,130
or an immortal,

333
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,220
it doesn't matter.

334
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,250
What matters is whether the heart

335
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:32,370
is good or evil.

336
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,510
Back then,

337
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:39,190
I used Qing

338
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,610
to try to kill you.

339
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,250
If anyone was demonized,

340
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:49,170
it should be me,

341
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,270
not you.

342
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,860
Why are you suddenly so clear-minded?

343
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,670
Where is Fairy Gu?

344
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:18,990
Qing.

345
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,950
Qing turned into a bluestone again.

346
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:25,690
This...

347
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,170
How did Gu Qing become like this?

348
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,270
What happened?

349
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:37,620
Let's talk about this later.

350
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,780
We should deal with the trouble first.

351
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,030
High Immortals.

352
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,660
This is Ji Ruochen.

353
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,860
You are Ji Ruochen, the Demon King?

354
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,020
Yes.

355
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,230
I heard that you want to arrest me.

356
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,700
But there should be a reason for everything.

357
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,910
Since you want to arrest me,

358
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,100
you should give me a reason.

359
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,180
Demon King.

360
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,070
You destroyed the spiritual caves first

361
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,170
and then planned the birth of the Demon Tower.

362
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:33,960
The Blue Fire of the Nine Hells above the tower

363
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,540
is the best evidence.

364
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,150
A thief crying "stop thief!"

365
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:44,170
You divine generals in the Heaven,

366
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,820
I want to see

367
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,490
what you are capable of.

368
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,140
Let me show you what a real demon is.

369
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,560
This must be the Ascending Platform that leads straight to the God Realm.

370
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:08,300
Immortals can do whatever they want?

371
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,130
I'm going to eliminate

372
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:14,720
the root of the chaos in the Three Realms.

373
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,140
Ruochen, we don't know what is up there.

374
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:18,940
Come back.

375
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,390
How dare you mortals

376
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,190
climb the heavenly stairs!

377
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:05,790
Master.

378
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:10,830
Master, it's me.

379
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,630
Kill Ji Ruochen now.

380
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,870
Otherwise, he will fight his way to the God Realm.

381
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,760
Stay calm.

382
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,970
I'm going to put out the blue flame

383
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,790
and bring peace to the Three Realms.

384
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:23,490
High Immortal Taiyi, you're finally here.

385
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,260
You're High Immortal Taiyi?

386
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,280
You know me?

387
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,970
Of course I do.

388
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,180
It was you

389
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,250
that killed the people of the Nine Hells and my parents

390
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,530
and built the Demon Tower,

391
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,790
right?

392
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,690
And the flame face in the tower

393
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,080
was you too, right?

394
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:51,460
You're a smart guy.

395
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,590
You actually figured out the heavenly secret.

396
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:00,120
How can I fool you if I'm not smart?

397
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,140
High Immortal Taiyi.

398
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,580
You don't feel good being fooled, do you?

399
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:07,010
Brat.

400
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,640
How dare you mention this!

401
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,220
Back at the Nine Hells,

402
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:13,070
I should have torn you into pieces.

403
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:26,820
Ji Ruochen,

404
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,950
you went against the Heaven.

405
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:32,050
Today, you must die.

406
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,970
Who are you to convict me?

407
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:37,070
I'm in charge of the law and rules in the God Realm.

408
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:39,490
You have the Blue Fire of the Nine Hells

409
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,630
and became the Demon King because of it.

410
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:43,810
How can I sit by?

411
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,080
You can call him

412
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,990
whatever you want.

413
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,900
But who is the real demon?

414
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:52,430
You destroyed the Nine Hells and built the Demon Tower.

415
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,840
You did all those things.

416
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,000
You are the real demon.

417
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,130
You call this rubbish

418
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,650
an ancient divine weapon?

419
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,340
Today, I'll show you

420
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,910
what the grand divine power is.

421
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,440
The Linglong Tower

422
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,620
was specially created to put out your Blue Fire of the Nine Hells.

423
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,460
Ji Ruochen.

424
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:06,850
Die!

425
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,730
Let me send you to hell now.

426
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,110
Master.

427
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,980
They are just two clowns.

428
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,510
No need to get your hands dirty.

429
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:52,650
Leave them to me.

430
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,260
Hierarch Ziwei, you've finished your seclusion?

431
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:43,949
Master.

432
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:47,670
Ruochen,

433
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,600
do you still accept me as your master?

434
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,120
Master.

435
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,370
Master.

436
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,639
I've found the person who built the tower.

437
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,660
I didn't fail you.

438
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,740
High Immortal Taiyi. You are too ambitious.

439
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,180
You caused chaos in the Three Realms.

440
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,160
Surrender now!

441
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,820
Ziwei, you alone

442
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,490
dare to stand against me?

443
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,140
He is not alone.

444
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:28,900
You...

445
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,790
Senior, you love your disciple so much.

446
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,080
But don't forget that

447
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:36,250
Ruochen is also our disciple.

448
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,190
That's right, Senior.

449
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,290
We can't miss this battle.

450
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,350
Ruochen,

451
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,730
we misunderstood you before.

452
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,270
Masters.

453
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,640
Cut the crap.

454
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,150
I'll grant your wish today

455
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,910
and let you die together.

456
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,160
I was in seclusion for a thousand years

457
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,670
just for today's battle.

458
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:53,450
Hierarch.

459
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,190
Master!

460
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:08,820
Master!

461
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:10,310
Master!

462
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,090
Master!

463
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,610
No.

464
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,500
Master.

465
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:36,510
♫With my sword, I face the world, breaking through the swirling sand♫

466
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,120
I've been

467
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,890
the acting hierarch long enough.

468
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:41,530
♫How many high positions were obtained through deceit and trickery♫

469
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,060
Please let me

470
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,740
help my disciple, okay?

471
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,650
Senior.

472
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:49,600
♫Amidst the shifting sands, who will emerge as the winner in the end?♫

473
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,520
That's what I'm thinking.

474
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:49,500
Senior.

475
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:54,780
♫Amidst the chaos and distractions, who can truly let go?♫

476
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:53,100
That's what we are thinking too.

477
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:59,120
♫Not for leaving a mark in history or the glimmer of swords♫

478
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:57,460
Ziyang.

479
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:02,090
♫The turbulent times change in an instant♫

480
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,220
You old man.

481
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:08,010
♫It's all because of you and me, braving obstacles♫

482
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,390
Having a gang fight is very interesting.

483
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,780
Why didn't you tell me?

484
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:13,820
♫I traverse the currents of time to be with you again♫

485
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:14,970
Master!

486
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:20,380
♫I cross endless hills, vowing to stay true to our promises♫

487
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:17,810
Alright, buddy.

488
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,300
Let's go engage in a gang fight.

489
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,110
Let's go. Please.

490
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,010
Go engage in a gang fight.

491
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:27,440
♫The sun and moon witness the eternal enmity and grievances♫

492
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:33,470
♫I only wish to hold your hand and be by your side♫

493
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:40,990
♫As long as I have you by my side, what more could I ask for in this lifetime?♫
