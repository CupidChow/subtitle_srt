[Episode 28]

4
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,140
Who are you?

5
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,960
Just call me Yu Tong.

6
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,240
Who are you?

7
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,130
Are you from the mortal world?

8
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,670
Why didn't you die

9
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,540
after you fell from the sky?

10
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,190
Yu Tong.

11
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,710
Yu Tong.

12
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,950
Have you seen

13
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,340
a girl who is

14
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,490
about my age?

15
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,870
There's no girl who is about your age,

16
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,850
but there's a female fox spirit.

17
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,740
She had a lot of blood on her body,

18
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,860
which looked scary.

19
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,460
She also had several tails that were faintly discernible.

20
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,460
I wonder whether she's the girl you're looking for.

21
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,680
Where is she?

22
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,340
She was badly injured.

23
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,240
I don't know if she's still alive.

24
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,500
The High Priest asked someone

25
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,700
to take her to the stone house by the sea first.

26
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:42,600
Please.

27
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,620
Could you take me to find her?

28
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,230
But I still need to find the mayor of the city

29
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,470
and ask him to come back to deal with this thing.

30
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,540
Please.

31
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,260
Okay.

32
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,290
Wait a moment.

33
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,400
How come it doesn't work?

34
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,820
You're from the mortal world, so you don't know about it.

35
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,660
All the magic in the mortal world

36
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,250
doesn't work here.

37
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,040
What is this place?

38
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,490
Qiyou City of the Nine Hells.

39
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,100
Qiyou City of the Nine Hells?

40
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,770
Let's go now.

41
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:14,830
Okay.

42
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,510
Come on.

43
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,110
Uncle. Uncle. Uncle.

44
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,170
You're finally here.

45
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,470
Calm down.

46
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,840
So this is the fox spirit that fell from the sky?

47
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,070
It's her.

48
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,780
Where is this?

49
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,730
This is Qiyou City of the Nine Hells.

50
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,620
Nine Hells?

51
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,080
Qi...

52
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,140
Are you okay?

53
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:33,480
Sir, this is the place.

54
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:45,070
You're awake.

55
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,560
Are you okay?

56
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:03,860
Ruochen.

57
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,280
Ji Ruochen.

58
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,650
What did you call me just now?

59
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,070
Ruochen.

60
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,320
Ji Ruochen.

61
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,060
I remember it now, Ruochen.

62
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,610
I remember everything.

63
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,860
I took you back to the Xixuan Sect

64
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,240
from the Desert Inn.

65
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,690
I went to Haofang with you to fight against the Bamboo Snake.

66
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,780
Besides, in the Monster Forbidden Zone...

67
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,270
I'm sorry.

68
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,330
I exchanged my memories for Nuwa's Tears.

69
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,500
I'm sorry, Ruochen.

70
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,740
I'm sorry.

71
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,510
You really remember everything now?

72
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,860
You're not lying to me, are you?

73
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,470
I'm sorry.

74
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,090
I'm sorry.

75
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:42,610
I'm sorry, Ruochen.

76
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,500
I'm sorry.

77
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,330
You really remember everything now?

78
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,300
What's wrong with you?

79
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,100
Divine Flames!

80
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,380
Divine Flames appeared in our place!

81
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,260
These are the Divine Flames recorded in the Code of Qiyu City.

82
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:24,700
Yes!

83
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,270
He's an immortal!

84
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,140
How come

85
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,460
my Blue Flames can save myself,

86
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,260
but they can't save her?

87
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,419
Please save Qiyou City of the Nine Hells!

88
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:33,690
Yinyin!

89
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,679
Please save the people of Qiyu City!

90
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,230
Yinyin!

91
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,710
Please save the people!

92
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,669
-Yinyin! -Divine Flames appeared in our place.

93
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,950
Qiyu City will be saved!

94
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,940
Divine Flames appeared in our place.

95
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,270
Qiyu City will be saved!

96
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:03,750
Senior Ziyang.

97
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,660
What should we do?

98
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,300
Senior Ziyang.

99
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,220
Why don't we ask the other Zhenrens to come here

100
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,200
so that we can discuss it?

101
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,120
Just wait for some more time.

102
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,840
What on earth are you waiting for?

103
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,220
Bingxian!

104
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,430
Qiushui!

105
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,520
Hierarch,

106
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,370
all the disciples within the distance of a hundred miles

107
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,840
around the Xixuan Mountains have arrived here.

108
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,370
Besides, we've reinforced the enchantment boundary

109
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,550
of Xixuan's Wuya Formation.

110
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,740
We've also arranged more disciples

111
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,530
to intensify the patrols on the mountains and down the mountains

112
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,370
in order to ensure safety.

113
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,250
Okay.

114
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,660
How are Sun Guo and his men now?

115
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,020
They've reached the foot of Xixuan Mountains.

116
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,820
Is there any news from the Netherworld Mountain?

117
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,170
The disciples who went to the Netherworld Mountain

118
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,470
have sent a message back by the Flying Crane.

119
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,950
There are indeed many monster soldiers gathering on the Netherworld Mountain.

120
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,300
However,

121
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,300
it seems that the Monster Emperor of Netherworld Mountain hasn't decided

122
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,240
whether they'll join the alliance of the 36 sects.

123
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,100
I hope that Monster Emperor Yi Xuan

124
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,010
won't get involved in this turbulence.

125
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,260
Otherwise,

126
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,750
our Xixuan Mountains

127
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,070
will be in danger.

128
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,070
Everyone,

129
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:24,380
Xixuan Sect went against the rules and destroyed the spiritual caves,

130
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,520
which caused a lot disasters.

131
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,740
Both Heaven and the people are angry about it.

132
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,610
As Taoist practitioners,

133
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,400
we should take up the responsibility of saving the Three Realms,

134
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,580
and swear to eliminate the Xixuan Sect.

135
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,730
We're at your disposal, my lord.

136
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,180
However, Xixuan's Wuya Formation

137
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,450
is known as the best enchantment boundary in the world for protecting mountains.

138
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,040
I'm afraid it's not easy to break it.

139
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,580
My lord, is there a way to break it?

140
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,100
Hierarch Xuxuan, there's no need to worry too much.

141
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,370
As long as the Wugou Manor is here,

142
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,850
all the problems will be solved naturally.

143
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,480
Mr. Wang Chen, am I right?

144
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,320
I'm not sure about other formations,

145
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,970
but I'm very familiar with

146
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,110
Xixuan's Wuya Formation.

147
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,330
Wuhua.

148
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:10,880
Yes.

149
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,130
Set up the formation now!

150
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:13,900
Yes!

151
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,920
Set up the formation with me!

152
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:16,620
Yes!

153
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:10,080
[Xixuan]

154
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:16,540
Report!

155
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,260
Everyone,

156
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,610
Sun Guo has invaded the foot of the mountain.

157
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,520
Cracks have appeared

158
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,480
in Xixuan's Wuya Formation.

159
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,230
What?

160
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:24,830
How is that possible?

161
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,630
I didn't expect them to arrive so soon.

162
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,590
Pass my order.

163
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:29,970
From now on,

164
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,190
all disciples of each school

165
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,060
will be incorporated into the Taichang Palace.

166
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,720
They'll only listen to my orders.

167
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:35,640
Yes!

168
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:43,840
Hierarch,

169
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,460
if our sect only defends our place,

170
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,880
I'm afraid it's not a good plan in the long run.

171
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:47,430
How about...

172
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,730
Although flaws of the Wuya Formation have been exposed,

173
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,350
it can still defend against them for a while.

174
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,170
When the enemy's morale is all consumed by this formation,

175
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,700
and the confidence of their troops are shaken,

176
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,070
we can find a chance to attack.

177
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,380
That's the best plan.

178
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,220
Since you have made your decision,

179
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,600
we'll go out and guard the mountains.

180
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,240
We're leaving.

181
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:12,210
Senior Ziyang.

182
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,240
Are we just waiting like this?

183
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,010
I heard that this attack

184
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,710
was led by Wang Chen.

185
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,230
Let's not mention Wang Chen now.

186
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,050
Senior Ziyang,

187
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,960
what on earth are you thinking?

188
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,160
You have to tell us

189
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:23,730
how you're going to

190
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,320
repel the attack of the enemy.

191
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,990
There's a 50% chance for us to win this battle.

192
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,120
I can only take one step at a time.

193
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,330
Senior Ziyang,

194
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,040
we haven't seen each other for a long time.

195
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,940
Mr. Wang Chen, what a good tactic!

196
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,630
It seems that the formation will be broken soon.

197
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,180
I'm flattered, Hierarch Xuxuan.

198
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,480
Wuhua.

199
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,980
I'll entrust the task of breaking

200
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,580
Xixuan's Wuya Formation to you.

201
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,060
I won't let you down.

202
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:36,430
♫In an instant, crossing the finish line and looking back as if it were the first time♫

203
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:41,840
♫Together, we cultivated our love day and night, and were unaware of its depth♫

204
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,750
♫Got one year older after a year passed♫

205
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:50,870
♫This Mortal World is warmer than the God Realm♫

206
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:59,350
♫I've seen the world but my longings remain unclear♫

207
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,560
♫Roll my longings into curves and hold them in my hands tightly♫

208
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,110
♫A glance, a fateful encounter♫

209
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:15,350
♫I wait in memories for your appearance♫

210
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,180
This is probably fate.

211
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,890
Although your amnesia couldn't

212
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,030
be cured previously,

213
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,230
the land of Nine Hells

214
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,130
♫With flowers and leaves in this mortal world♫

215
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,080
is not bound by magic in the mortal world.

216
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,070
The amnesia cast on you by Master Iceberg

217
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:28,780
♫I'm willing to let go but I hate time♫

218
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,340
doesn't work at all here.

219
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,580
If possible,

220
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,380
I hope I'll never have to go back.

221
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:34,010
♫The moon is always full and the sea will dry♫

222
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,800
I just hope to stay here.

223
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:34,220
Sure.

224
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,060
♫I dare not say goodbye♫

225
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,600
I am Ji Ruochen.

226
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,130
I've heard that Zhang Yinyin, the Chief Disciple of Taixuan Palace,

227
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,620
is very beautiful

228
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,980
and is an eligible woman for marriage,

229
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,780
so I'd like to

230
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,080
marry you.

231
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,130
From now on,

232
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,970
we'll live in harmony and love each other as husband and wife.

233
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,820
I wonder if Miss Yinyin will agree.

234
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,920
But it's not enough to only love each other.

235
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,010
You have to listen to me for everything.

236
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,020
Okay.

237
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,770
I'll do whatever you say.

238
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,310
I'll love you, spoil you,

239
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,200
annoy you and pamper you.

240
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,820
I'll do whatever you say.

241
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,590
Okay?

242
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,680
You made this promise yourself.

243
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,070
Of course I did.

244
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,180
This way. This way.

245
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:56,740
Hurry up.

246
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,130
Okay.

247
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,040
This way.

248
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:58,790
Just put them down.

249
00:16:58,810 --> 00:16:59,690
Alright, alright.

250
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,260
Come on. Let me help you.

251
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,100
It's okay like this.

252
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:02,740
Put them down.

253
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:03,860
What a good wedding!

254
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,670
Firstly, bow to heaven and earth.

255
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,980
Secondly, bow to your parents.

256
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,700
Bow to each other.

257
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,990
The ceremony is completed.

258
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,220
As the bride,

259
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,020
why did you come here?

260
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:29,910
Are you not feeling well?

261
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,220
Where's Yu Tong?

262
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,030
Why didn't I see him?

263
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:34,760
Maybe

264
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,150
he has gone somewhere to play.

265
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,220
Let's forget about him now.

266
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,080
Let me give you something.

267
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,780
What is this?

268
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,140
Although I don't have any betrothal gifts for you,

269
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,460
I still have my own body.

270
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,840
From now on,

271
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:52,040
I'll be yours.

272
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,100
If you need me,

273
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,150
blow the whistle.

274
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,420
As long as I hear it,

275
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,560
I'll come to you anytime.

276
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,950
If you ask me to go east,

277
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,910
I won't go west.

278
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:04,870
Give it a try.

279
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,920
You made this promise yourself.

280
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,500
Yinyin.

281
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,040
Yinyin!

282
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,590
Yinyin!

283
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:32,960
Yinyin!

284
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:49,980
Hurry up.

285
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:57,940
You may leave.

286
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,020
What happened?

287
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,460
Didn't you say that Yinyin's injury

288
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,690
was almost healed?

289
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,100
I once said that

290
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,370
it would take some time to dissolve the immortal energy

291
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,280
with the juice of Baijiu Trees.

292
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:11,400
Liar!

293
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,410
The juice of Baijiu Trees

294
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,750
can't dissolve the immortal energy at all!

295
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:15,850
What do you mean?

296
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,010
Sir,

297
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,630
both of us have been deceived by them.

298
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,710
Our mayor always said that

299
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,240
the juice of Baijiu Trees

300
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,000
could dissolve the immortal energy in Miss Zhang's body.

301
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:24,960
In the end,

302
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,360
I eavesdropped on the conversation between our mayor and the High Priest,

303
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:29,770
and knew that the juice of Baijiu Trees didn't have such an effect at all.

304
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,110
Besides, the immortal energy inside Miss Zhang's body

305
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,400
has already hurt her internal organs.

306
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,430
Her life will be in danger at any time.

307
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,580
What?

308
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,580
I was even caught by them

309
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,010
because I eavesdropped on their conversation.

310
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,870
If I had not sneaked out when the guards

311
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:41,750
changed their shifts today,

312
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:42,860
you and Miss Zhang

313
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,060
would have still been kept in the dark.

314
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,260
Who on earth are you?

315
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,880
Why did you hurt Yinyin?

316
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,190
Mr. Ji, please spare us.

317
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,270
We never wanted to hurt anyone.

318
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,100
My uncle intended to

319
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,880
keep you in Qiyu City.

320
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,330
Because only you

321
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,340
can save Qiyu City.

322
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,600
Only I can save Qiyu City?

323
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,560
Yes. It's a long story.

324
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:08,870
Everything

325
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,460
started from the giant tower

326
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,940
in the depths of the Nine Hells

327
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,070
thousands of years ago.

328
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:19,390
Ever since that giant tower appeared,

329
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,870
the people of each city

330
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,240
had felt restless,

331
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,990
and chaos had occurred frequently.

332
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,540
They killed each other.

333
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,940
Later, they were swallowed by those Demon Flames.

334
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:31,970
In the Nine Hells,

335
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,470
only Qiyu City survived as the last city.

336
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,030
But all these years, Qiyu City

337
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,590
has been attacked

338
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,900
by those Demon Flames at regular intervals.

339
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,060
If this continues,

340
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,930
I'm afraid the whole Qiyu City

341
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,950
and the people inside the city

342
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,350
will all be swallowed by those Demon Flames.

343
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,400
Do these things have

344
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,230
anything to do with me?

345
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,840
According to the Code,

346
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,570
the location where that tower was built

347
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,130
was once the place where the Divine Flames grew.

348
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:05,350
Only after the tower was built

349
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,840
did the Divine Flames disappeared.

350
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,620
We've passed this message from generation to generation.

351
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,460
It says that the Divine Flames can conquer this tower.

352
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,220
When the Divine Flames burn again,

353
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,720
it will be the time to destroy the tower.

354
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:21,810
Destroy the tower?

355
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,430
This fire is neither good nor evil.

356
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,940
If you master it,

357
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,720
you will remould yourself thoroughly and rebuild your immortal soul.

358
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,180
Master, please tell me

359
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,100
how to practice this technique.

360
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,700
All the techniques that have appeared according to the will of Heaven

361
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,490
must be comprehended by yourself.

362
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,900
I can only tell you that

363
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,400
it comes from the Nine Hells, a forbidden place in the Three Realms.

364
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,830
There's a tower there,

365
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,450
which is called the Demon Tower.

366
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,820
This tower was built based on the Blue Flames.

367
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,990
Only by destroying this tower

368
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,090
can it return to the right path.

369
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,010
Mayor.

370
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,600
I've been wanting to ask you.

371
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,270
Before I came here,

372
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,220
I was injured by a sword.

373
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,790
But the Blue Flames

374
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:04,550
helped me heal my wounds

375
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,870
and even dissolve the immortal energy in my body.

376
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,430
According to what you said,

377
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:10,340
if I go to that tower,

378
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:11,640
destroy the tower

379
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,850
and master the Blue Flames,

380
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,090
can I use the Blue Flames

381
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,780
to heal Yinyin's wounds?

382
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,430
Whether you can do so or not,

383
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:24,770
I won't agree.

384
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,400
Yinyin, you're awake.

385
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,680
I've heard Yu Tong

386
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,430
talk about that Demon Tower.

387
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,340
It's been so many years.

388
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,930
Qiyu City has sent many people to destroy the tower,

389
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,750
but none of them could come back.

390
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,290
I don't hope after they lied to you that

391
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,340
Blue Flames can dissolve the immortal energy,

392
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,990
you would risk your life by going there.

393
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,380
Yinyin, lie down.

394
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,810
I need to rest.

395
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,300
You two

396
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,230
should go back.

397
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:00,890
Let's go.

398
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:04,560
Have a good rest.

399
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,120
Yinyin.

400
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,910
How are you feeling now?

401
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,910
I'm fine.

402
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,100
I thought Wang Chen was familiar with Xixuan's tricks,

403
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,500
and Xixuan's Wuya Formation

404
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,390
could be broken within a few days.

405
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,320
But after some cracks appeared in the enchantment boundary,

406
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,690
there has been no progress.

407
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,240
How useless.

408
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,630
The sword energy is counter-attacking.

409
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:25,660
Feng!

410
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,480
Feng, you're finally here.

411
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:31,900
Greetings, Your Highness.

412
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,420
Thanks for your help, Banished God.

413
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:36,570
You're welcome.

414
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,250
Yin Feng.

415
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,880
I'm glad you're here.

416
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,230
Let's go. The Imperial Advisor is waiting for you in the tent.

417
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,260
My lord, Yin Feng is here.

418
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:12,690
Banished God, you came at the right time.

419
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,810
I think you must have something important to discuss with Yin Feng.

420
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,010
I'll leave now.

421
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,640
Banished God, please sit down.

422
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,270
Banished God.

423
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,820
Currently, the Wugou Manor

424
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,400
is trying to break Xixuan's Wuya Formation.

425
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,020
If we can get help from you,

426
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,540
we'll be more powerful, won't we?

427
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:42,790
You've misunderstood.

428
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:43,830
I came to you

429
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,930
not to help you attack the Xixuan Sect,

430
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:46,800
but to

431
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,200
meet the man from the Underground Palace of Zhenwu Temple again.

432
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:55,320
In that case, it means the Soul of Immortal Cloud

433
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,340
wasn't effective, right?

434
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,160
It looks like Fairy Gu

435
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,590
can't cut off this worldly emotion.

436
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:05,990
Therefore,

437
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,560
I want to meet that person again

438
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,640
and see if there is any other way

439
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,820
to help Qing regain her immortal dharma-laksana.

440
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,170
Well,

441
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:22,200
please help us invade into the Xixuan Mountains.

442
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,560
Then I will arrange for you to meet him.

443
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,700
Are you threatening me?

444
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,340
I dare not. I dare not.

445
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:36,560
But when you were chasing Ji Ruochen so as to kill him,

446
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,560
you once promised to

447
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,980
maintain the peace of the Three Realms and enforce justice on behalf of Heaven.

448
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,270
But Xixuan Sect

449
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,690
is the culprit of destroying the spiritual caves.

450
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,520
If you only chase Ji Ruochen so as to kill him

451
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,550
without besieging the Xixuan Sect,

452
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,130
people will...

453
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,780
people will accuse you of

454
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,330
doing things for your own selfish desire, right?

455
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:56,670
You...

456
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:57,900
Banished God.

457
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,160
Although these are some harsh words,

458
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,100
what I said

459
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,760
is for your good.

460
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:07,600
Fine.

461
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,160
I'll help you.

462
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,350
You guys are so ambitious.

463
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,600
How dare you threaten the Banished God with the justice of the world?

464
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,140
How despicable!

465
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,420
Qing.

466
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,000
It seems that Fairy Gu

467
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,630
has something to tell Zhexian.

468
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,390
I’ll leave now.

469
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:30,440
Qing.

470
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,910
-Why did you... -If I had not showed up just now,

471
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,340
would you have agreed

472
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,280
to help Sun Guo attack the Xixuan Sect?

473
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,500
Xixuan Sect destroyed all the spiritual caves in the world.

474
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,360
Everyone wants to eliminate them.

475
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,750
Do you believe in

476
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,750
what you've just said?

477
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:52,270
I admit that

478
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,520
I'm going to help Sun Guo attack the Xixuan Sect

479
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,680
because I want to meet that man of the Underground Palace again.

480
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,290
But what's the problem with that?

481
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:03,980
I've told you

482
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,080
I don't want to go back to the God Realm.

483
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,570
Why do you keep forcing me like this?

484
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,190
Keep forcing you?

485
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,190
For you,

486
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,920
I'm going to help Sun Guo

487
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,820
and have to compromise.

488
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:22,910
But in your eyes,

489
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,020
this turns out to be forcing you.

490
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,530
You should know this better than I do.

491
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,300
In my mind,

492
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,370
I still can't forget...

493
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:35,890
Enough!

494
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,020
I don't want to hear it.

495
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:39,580
Yin Feng,

496
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:44,250
how long are you going to keep lying to yourself?

497
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,070
Master,

498
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,260
did you hear me?

499
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,430
Yes, I did.

500
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,370
Didn't I tell you?

501
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,270
The Xixuan Sect dared to go against Heaven's will

502
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,190
and destroyed all the spiritual caves,

503
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:14,670
which made both Heaven and the people angry.

504
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,930
Now they're are in such a situation.

505
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,190
They deserve it.

506
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,860
I didn't follow the 36 sects

507
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,780
to attack the Xixuan Sect,

508
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,940
and I'm kind enough.

509
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,760
It's impossible that I would help the Xixuan Sect.

510
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,300
All of you have said that the Xixuan Sect

511
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,780
obstinately sticks to the wrong course and has done many evil things.

512
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,340
But what I've seen

513
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,660
on the Xixuan Mountains these days

514
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,540
is that Xixuan's disciples

515
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,980
are all righteous,

516
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,660
and they all regard justice of the world as their responsibilities.

517
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,360
Therefore,

518
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:37,180
if people say that they destroyed the spiritual caves

519
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,030
for their own benefit,

520
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,860
I won't believe it.

521
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,770
I also

522
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,120
can't understand it.

523
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,470
Xixuan Sect destroyed the spiritual caves

524
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:47,690
under the risk of being eliminated.

525
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,240
What on earth was the reason?

526
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,410
So,

527
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:54,130
you're willing to help the Xixuan Sect?

528
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,710
When did I say that I was willing to help them?

529
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,680
That's not right.

530
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,600
Why do you side with the Xixuan Sect

531
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,340
in every aspect while you're talking now?

532
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,690
Do you still regard me as your master?

533
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,140
It seems that you are just like them

534
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:07,940
who can't distinguish right from wrong.

535
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:09,480
Forget it if you don't want to send some reinforcements there.

536
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,600
I'm going back to the Xixuan Mountains.

537
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,800
Take care, Master.

538
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:15,640
Master!

539
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:18,320
Master, what are you doing? Master!

540
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,850
Let go of me!

541
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,180
I'm doing this for your own good.

542
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,960
The Xixuan Sect is in trouble now.

543
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,920
What if you're killed again if you go there?

544
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,700
Just stay in the Yunzhong Residence.

545
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:27,280
Go!

546
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,120
Master!

547
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,090
Take her back to her room.

548
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,400
Without my permission,

549
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,320
she's not allowed to go out.

550
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:32,110
Yes.

551
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:33,780
Master!

552
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,430
Master, I beg you!

553
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,410
Let go of me!

554
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,600
-Let's go, Senior. -Master, I have something important to do.

555
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:40,510
Master, let go of me!

556
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,370
Master, I beg you!

557
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,840
Master!

558
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,820
Ziyang,

559
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:50,380
I can't help you this time.

560
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:01,980
The juice of Baijiu Trees is still effective.

561
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,010
Look.

562
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,420
Soon after I used it,

563
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,010
my wounds have almost healed.

564
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,670
But the immortal energy in your body hasn't been removed yet.

565
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:09,780
It will eventually...

566
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:11,070
There will be another way.

567
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,010
What way?

568
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:14,030
Now all the Baijiu Trees have been burned.

569
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,700
There's not much bark left.

570
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,070
The immortal energy in your body

571
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:18,200
will kill you in the end.

572
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,730
After all,

573
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,590
you still want to destroy the tower.

574
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,680
Right?

575
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,620
Ruochen,

576
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,180
when we got married, you promised me that

577
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,040
you would listen to me for everything.

578
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,770
Look at this house.

579
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,210
We're finally able to

580
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,660
live a peaceful life for a few days.

581
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,180
Didn't you say that

582
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,380
you want to plant vegetables and raise chicken in the yard,

583
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:51,470
as well as help me paint my eyebrows and comb my hair every day?

584
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:54,800
We haven't

585
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,330
done these things yet.

586
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,370
I don't want to see you risk your life for me.

587
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:06,600
Fine.

588
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,880
Anyway, I'll do whatever you say.

589
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:12,540
I'm not able to refute whatever you say, either.

590
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:21,580
That's more like it.
