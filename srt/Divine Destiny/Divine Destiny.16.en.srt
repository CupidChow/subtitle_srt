[Divine Destiny]

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,009
[Episode 16]

4
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,300
Mr. Ji.

5
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,470
I didn't expect to see you here again.

6
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,420
The green mountains along the way flourish under the same clouds and rain.

7
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:57,750
We see the same moon, so when have we ever been in two different places?

8
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,910
What's the difference between this place

9
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,630
and the other places?

10
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,420
Mr. Ji, you're right.

11
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,750
I've just gotten a broken book,

12
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,500
and tricked you into buying me a drink.

13
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,870
Now, I'm still taking advantage of you.

14
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,850
I'm..

15
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,140
becoming less and less like a scholar.

16
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,710
However,

17
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:27,930
I like this gift

18
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,220
for our meeting with each other.

19
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,500
Thank you for saving me last time.

20
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,180
If it weren't for your Qianyuan Manual,

21
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,800
I'm afraid I would have died.

22
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,650
If I'm not mistaken,

23
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,100
You, Huaniang and Zhang

24
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,340
must be old acquaintances.

25
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,110
Why do you think so?

26
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,960
You deliberately lured me to the inn last time

27
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,390
and gave me the map of treasures.

28
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,660
When all the sects were fighting fiercely with each other by the river,

29
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,450
you had secretly

30
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,440
gotten the treasures before them.

31
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:18,620
Thanks to you,

32
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,610
now the Shenzhou Energy Map

33
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,370
is possessed by the Xixuan Mountains.

34
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:23,930
Mr. Ji,

35
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,120
a toast to you.

36
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:27,030
Buddy,

37
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,800
why did you say that?

38
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,020
I don't deserve your toast.

39
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,920
What is the Energy Map?

40
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,720
That's the cause of disaters which makes people jealous.

41
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,140
I'm just an unpopular follower of His Highness.

42
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,050
I will try to

43
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,390
stay as far away as possible from this thing.

44
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,230
So, fighting against the Bamboo Snake is just an excuse,

45
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,940
and scrambling for the map of treasures is the real purpose.

46
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,240
I think

47
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,690
everyone is working hard

48
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,030
in performing this play.

49
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,960
A hero like you

50
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,829
is the one on the stage.

51
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,550
I'm just

52
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,240
a freeloader for wine at best.

53
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:05,550
Really?

54
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,850
How come I don't think that

55
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,600
you look like someone off the stage?

56
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,840
Master Ziyang once told me that

57
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,339
the aura of the Shenzhou Energy Map is moving

58
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,540
and is not fixed yet.

59
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,870
We need to wait till the heavenly secret is revealed.

60
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:23,220
But do you know what this heavenly secret

61
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:24,680
refers to?

62
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,790
Do you know the Calamity of the Three Realms?

63
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,660
My master once told me about it.

64
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,909
He said that it's a calamity that concerns the safety of the world.

65
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,390
Good fortune follows upon disasters.

66
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,040
Disasters lurk within good fortune.

67
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,570
But I'm wondering

68
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,820
where I can get

69
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,730
some wine tomorrow.

70
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,030
The Chaotic Energy of the Three Realms

71
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,440
has been out of balance for a long time.

72
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,300
Anyway, there will be chaos.

73
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,310
As the saying goes, after the chaos lasts for a long time, there will be strong governance, and vice versa.

74
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,530
This is a cycle.

75
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,110
It's also the great truth of Heaven.

76
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,630
The Calamity of the Three Realms

77
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,000
is not scary.

78
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,150
The key is

79
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,120
how the person involved in this Calamity

80
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,970
faces it.

81
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:22,840
The person involved in the Calamity?

82
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,400
Instead of caring about the calamity of the world,

83
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:26,410
I think

84
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,370
you should rather care about your own predestined calamity.

85
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,790
Mr. Ji,

86
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,060
I don't know if I should say this.

87
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,970
I think your fate has changed and your date of death is coming.

88
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,470
I'm afraid you won't live long.

89
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:47,100
Mr. Ji, are you saying that the Infortune has fallen into my fate?

90
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,800
I know it's a good thing for you to teach.

91
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:51,930
I also know that

92
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,460
by using the Forbidden Heavenly Magic,

93
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,040
I'll gain something and lose something at the same time.

94
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,820
But I don't care anymore.

95
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,550
I'll leave it to fate.

96
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,430
But Mr. Ji,

97
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,380
why do you care about this thing?

98
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:03,840
Just tell me.

99
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,180
What I'm saying

100
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,840
is a calamity that is greater than the Infortune falling into your fate.

101
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,780
It's a calamity which has been written

102
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,050
in your destiny since you were born.

103
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,370
Mr. Ji,

104
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,630
in your opinion,

105
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,050
how should I deal with this calamity?

106
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,630
The natural law

107
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,570
doesn't always remain unchanged.

108
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,040
Doing whatever you want

109
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,900
is the way to solve this problem.

110
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,250
All we did

111
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,780
is for the purpose of sending you to the path of immortal cultivation.

112
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,980
Only in this way can you truly become the person involved in the calamity.

113
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:54,970
Master.

114
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,760
I'm just a mortal.

115
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,920
Besides, I've attracted the Infortune to fall into my fate,

116
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,990
and my longevity has become shorter.

117
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,080
How could I save the Three Realms?

118
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,970
Just wait till the heavenly secret is revealed again,

119
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,960
and you'll know.

120
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,960
It looks like this is the branch of the Xixuan Sect.

121
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,740
[Xixuan]

122
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,110
We are Xixuan Sect's disciples.

123
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
We want to stay here for a night.

124
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,540
It seems that these disciples left suddenly.

125
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,110
Maybe they didn't just simply leave.

126
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:03,690
-Yunfeng! -Senior Yunfeng!

127
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,670
Ruochen.

128
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:06,800
Yinyin!

129
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,560
Jin Shan lost half of his life's cultivation

130
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,820
to remove the secret poison of Qingxu.

131
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,250
Our Xixuan Sect

132
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,940
kind of owes the Yunzhong Residence a big favor.

133
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,100
How is my father now after he got injured?

134
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,480
Your mother is taking care of him.

135
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,440
Don't worry.

136
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,090
He will recover gradually.

137
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,940
Yunfeng, did you come here

138
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,190
under our master's request this time?

139
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,230
Yes.

140
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,910
Recently, in Xixuan Sect's branch that is nearby the capital,

141
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,789
many disciples have gone missing for no reason.

142
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,900
Our master asked me to investigate it.

143
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,400
Have you found any clues?

144
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,110
Everything was done by the Zhenwu Temple.

145
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,570
Sun Guo not only went around to kill Xixuan Sect's disciples,

146
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,420
but also forced them to slander their own sect

147
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,030
by fabricating the evidence which indicates that our sect has done bad things

148
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,200
and caused chaos to the world.

149
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,180
Sun Guo is so vicious.

150
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,500
Don't let me catch him,

151
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,840
or I won't let him off.

152
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,220
Not only that,

153
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,260
he also ordered his men

154
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,750
to spread the rumor that Ruochen's identity as the Ultimate Banished God was fake,

155
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,320
and the Xixuan Sect colluded with monsters.

156
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,660
Public clamor can confound right and wrong.

157
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,190
If there are many people talking about it,

158
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,010
some poeple will believe it.

159
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,280
What did our master say?

160
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,820
Nonsense!

161
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:21,890
Our master is indeed our master.

162
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,880
He spoke so aggressively.

163
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,550
Now,

164
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,740
all the sects believe that the Shenzhou Energy Map

165
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,520
must be in my hands.

166
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,740
Sun Guo won't give up easily.

167
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,420
I've long expected that he would unite with other sects

168
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,640
to eliminate the Xixuan Sect.

169
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,750
But this time, in the name of the imperial court,

170
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,640
he was even more unscrupulous.

171
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,050
I captured several disciples of the Zhenwu Temple and interrogated them a few days ago.

172
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,380
According to them,

173
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,680
Xu Zekai has been imprisoned in the capital.

174
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,140
We don't know if he's alive or dead.

175
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,070
It looks like

176
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,850
we have to go to the capital.

177
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,410
Let's go there.

178
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,940
I also want to meet Sun Guo.

179
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,320
That's what I was going to do.

180
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,240
With your help,

181
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,160
I would feel much relieved.

182
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,300
Are you

183
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,490
not going back to the Xixuan Mountains?

184
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,630
We don't know yet.

185
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,100
I know your concerns.

186
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,690
After you and Yinyin joined the Xixuan Sect,

187
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,200
both of you will be Xixuan's disciples forever.

188
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,410
You must go back there.

189
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,790
However, it's not the right time now.

190
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,090
Just leave everything to time.

191
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,540
Senior Yunfeng.

192
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,310
Ruochen and I will break into the prison.

193
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,360
You can find a few carriages to wait for us outside.

194
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,170
There can't be only these two people.

195
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,840
There must be other people for the patrol.

196
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,200
Let's hurry up.

197
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,980
Help us!

198
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,650
Let's go!

199
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,000
Are you disciples of the Xixuan Sect?

200
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,420
Who are you?

201
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,100
We are also Xixuan Sect's disciples.

202
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,190
Don't be afraid.

203
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,340
We're here to save you.

204
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,580
Great!

205
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,750
Our sect has sent some people to save us.

206
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,330
Great!

207
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,990
We'll be saved! We'll be saved!

208
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,430
How could they hurt such young children?

209
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,110
How despicable!

210
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,050
Rebels of the Xixuan Sect!

211
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,550
Breaking into the prison and rescue the prisoners is a capital crime.

212
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,980
You should go find Zekai first.

213
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,980
Leave it to me here.

214
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,220
Be careful then.

215
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,380
Zekai.

216
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,400
Senior Ji.

217
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,350
Thank you, Senior Ji.

218
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,550
There are other Xixuan Sect's disciples outside.

219
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,220
Don't worry.

220
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,760
Yinyin has taken them away.

221
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:55,630
Senior Ji.

222
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,340
They want to use the power of the imperial court

223
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,580
to frame the Xixuan Sect this time.

224
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,590
If I leave,

225
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,470
it'll be more difficult to explain the truth, right?

226
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,420
You're so severely injured.

227
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:04,260
Don't think too much.

228
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,000
Let's go.

229
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,770
Yinyin. Ruochen.

230
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,030
Come on. Hurry, kids.

231
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:18,720
Come here.

232
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,490
Be careful.

233
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:21,920
Okay.

234
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,910
Driver, let's go.

235
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:27,900
Zekai.

236
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,340
Do you know where the other disciples

237
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,390
of the Xixuan Sect are locked up?

238
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,220
In the prison to the north of the this place,

239
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,420
there are till 30 disciples of our sect.

240
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,430
In that case,

241
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,240
we'd better save them out as soon as possible.

242
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,220
Although Sun Guo suffered a great loss in Haofang,

243
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,790
as Li An was rewarded for eliminating the demons

244
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,800
and was conferred the title of Crown Prince after going back to the capital,

245
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,020
Sun Guo used Luo Xichen

246
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,450
to win Li An's favor quickly.

247
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,150
Recently,

248
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,960
the influence of Zhenwu Temple has increased greatly.

249
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,330
That's why they had the guts

250
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,320
and money to attack the Xixuan Sect this time.

251
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,960
In your opinion,

252
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,720
how should we solve this problem?

253
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,230
As far as I know,

254
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,450
Li An and Sun Guo are not of the same mind,

255
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,260
and they've been guarding against each other.

256
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,940
Li An was bewitched by them this time.

257
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,410
Senior Ji,

258
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,500
if we can find Li An and tell him the truth,

259
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,050
we can definitely clear our name

260
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,930
and protect our sect's reputation which has lasted for thousands of years.

261
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,110
In that case,

262
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,140
I'll go meet

263
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,660
Li An tonight.

264
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,320
I'll go with you.

265
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,140
You'd better not go.

266
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,480
Zekai

267
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:28,830
and the other disciples

268
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:29,980
need to be looked after.

269
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,230
I'll leave it to you and Senior Yunfeng here.

270
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,020
Then you should be careful.

271
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,460
Don't worry.

272
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,510
I'll be fine.

273
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,680
Let's meet at our sect's branch tomorrow morning.

274
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:45,140
Your Highness.

275
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,430
Though official business is important,

276
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,920
don't get sick by working too hard.

277
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,240
This is the Lily and Lotus Seed Soup

278
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,100
I've specially prepared for you.

279
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,910
Drink some.

280
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,570
Thank you.

281
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:08,880
Is it sweet?

282
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,910
Yes.

283
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,060
Your cooking skill is getting better and better.

284
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,630
Your Highness.

285
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,360
It's late.

286
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,600
Let's go to bed early.

287
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:34,780
Okay.

288
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:38,460
After I handle the official business for some more time, I'll go to bed.

289
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,020
You can go first later.

290
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,850
Immortal Ji.

291
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,410
How have you been?

292
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,360
Thank you for your concern, Miss Luo.

293
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,860
I should call you Your Highness.

294
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,410
I didn't have time to congratulate you.

295
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,660
Please forgive me.

296
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,220
You broke into the Crown Prince's mansion under the risk of

297
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,530
committing a capital crime.

298
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,060
I don't think

299
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,690
you did this just in order to congratulate me, right?

300
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,270
I want to see the Crown Prince,

301
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,200
so I made this bad decision.

302
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,590
Your Highness, can you inform His Highness?

303
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,760
His Highness is tired.

304
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,130
If there's anything you want to say,

305
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,670
just tell me.

306
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,140
I'm afraid I have to

307
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,410
talk to His Highness face to face about this thing.

308
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,420
I know it even if you don't tell me.

309
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,030
The Imperial Advisor told me that

310
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,460
the Xixuan Sect secretly hid the Shenzhou Energy Map,

311
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,000
as they wanted to change their fate and cause chaos to the world.

312
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,670
Are you here to plead guilty?

313
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,690
Your Highness,

314
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,030
Sun Guo made this up

315
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:01,820
to frame the Xixuan Sect.

316
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,480
I hope you can understand.

317
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,430
Don't worry.

318
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,230
Although the Xixuan Sect

319
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,460
once offended the Crown Prince in Haofang,

320
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,600
His Highness has always been scrupulous in separating public interests from private interests.

321
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,740
He'll be discerning enough to perceive the truth,

322
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,360
and will not let the Xixuan Sect be wronged.

323
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,050
Come with me.

324
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,160
His Highness is resting in his bedroom.

325
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:26,670
Thank you, Your Highness.

326
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,940
I'm Ji Ruochen.

327
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,240
Greetings, Your Highness.

328
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,280
I'm Ji Ruochen.

329
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,590
Greetings, Your Highness.

330
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,600
Your Highness.

331
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:45,880
Your Highness!

332
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,590
Immortal Ji is here.

333
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:51,950
Your Highness.

334
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,180
Your Highness!

335
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,910
Your Highness! Your Highness!

336
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,460
Immortal Ji, come and help me!

337
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,020
Your Highness!

338
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,250
Your Highness!

339
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,349
Thank you, Ji.

340
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,440
What are you doing, Your Highness?

341
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,510
I made these three Ecstasy Needles

342
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,920
with the immortal arts.

343
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,500
I specially prepared them for you.

344
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,550
Those who got pricked by these needles

345
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,110
would feel restless

346
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,600
till they die from madness.

347
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,190
Ji Ruochen,

348
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,850
no matter how capable you are,

349
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,410
you won't be able to escape this.

350
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,240
Your Highness,

351
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,640
why did you do this to me?

352
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,180
Because I want to take revenge for my deceased friend

353
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,380
and for myself!

354
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,370
Your Highness, what do you mean?

355
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,460
If it weren't for you,

356
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,970
Luo Feng and I would have

357
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,620
long been together by now.

358
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:06,630
Luo Feng

359
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,270
is Yin Feng.

360
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,700
He's not dead.

361
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,230
He is in Qingxu.

362
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,580
No!

363
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,310
He's dead now!

364
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,770
With his state like that, can he be considered as being alive?

365
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,070
If it weren't for you,

366
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,350
I wouldn't have become someone like this now.

367
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,300
Ji Ruochen.

368
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,670
I'll make you atone for your sin with your own life

369
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,490
and suffer so much that you'll wish to die!

370
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,400
There's an assassin!

371
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:41,590
Catch the assassin!

372
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,130
Your Highness! Your Highness!

373
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,500
-There's an assassin! Over there! Hurry! -Protect His Highness!

374
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,020
Your Highness! Your Highness!

375
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,930
Judging from the situation,

376
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,590
I think Mr. Ji was pricked

377
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,700
by the Ecstasy Needles of Zhenwu Temple.

378
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:28,920
But it seems

379
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,040
these needles were made with the immortal arts.

380
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,470
They're a bit more powerful than the ordinary ones.

381
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,560
Thank you for your help.

382
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,120
Is Ruochen

383
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,050
out of danger now?

384
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,230
I was only able to

385
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,060
pull one of them out of his body in time.

386
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,800
There are still two needles

387
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,550
which have entered his body.

388
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,790
These magical instruments move unstably.

389
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,870
Besides, they're harmful to his blood and pulses directly, and are extremely dangerous.

390
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,400
I’m afraid Mr. Ji

391
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,310
probably won't get recovered this time.

392
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,240
What?

393
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,820
There are another two needles?

394
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,010
So cruel!

395
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,560
She was so cruel!

396
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,610
Yinyin!

397
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,000
What do you want to do?

398
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,490
No debts are without creditors.

399
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,180
Since Ruochen got hurt in the Crown Prince's mansion,

400
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,220
I must ask them

401
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,340
to pay for this.

402
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,610
You can't do that!

403
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,700
How can we break into the Crown Prince's mansion?

404
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,060
If you do this, I'm afraid not only your life will be at risk,

405
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,320
it'll also make our sect get into trouble.

406
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,950
Now Sun Guo just wants to use the power of the imperial court

407
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:33,690
to suppress the Xixuan Sect.

408
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,740
If you go, you will fall into Sun Guo's trap

409
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,520
and let them have an excuse to arrest you, right?

410
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,220
Mr. Ji.

411
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,090
Yinyin.

412
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,110
Please save Ruochen.

413
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:12,650
Seeing you do this,

414
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,000
if I can't save him,

415
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:17,120
I'll feel very embarrassed, won't I?

416
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:18,740
Girl, stand up.

417
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,870
Stand up to talk.

418
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,010
Yinyin.

419
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,370
Stand up.

420
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:28,400
Stand up.

421
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,840
Sir.

422
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,370
Will Ruochen die?

423
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,830
Well,

424
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,180
I need to think about it carefully.

425
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,220
I know you are a very talented man.

426
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,420
I'm sure you'll try your best to save him.

427
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,860
If he didn't want to save him,

428
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,530
he wouldn't have brought Ruochen back.

429
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,180
I merely read a few medical books

430
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,030
and know a little about medical skills.

431
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,460
I'll trying treating him.

432
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,160
Next,

433
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,520
it'll depend on his fate.

434
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:18,990
Thank you, sir.

435
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,330
I've heard that among the eight schools of the Xixuan Sect,

436
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,790
Master Ziyang's Golden Elixir Skill is very good.

437
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,940
Yunfeng, you've been Ziyang's student for many years.

438
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,850
Have you mastered part of the skill?

439
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,850
I've been busy dealing with the affairs of our sect.

440
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,140
I've only learned some superficial knowledge

441
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,900
about the Golden Elixir Skill from my master.

442
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,120
I can't put that into practice.

443
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,550
Yunfeng.

444
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,050
Don't be too modest.

445
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,810
Now it’s time for you to use what you've learnt.

446
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:59,170
Mr. Ji's injury is extremely dangerous.

447
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,520
If it can be treated with elixir,

448
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,860
it'll be timely assistance,

449
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,250
and that'll be great.

450
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:08,020
However,

451
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,550
my cultivation is still weak.

452
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,330
If he takes the elixir made by me,

453
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,920
will there be any problem?

454
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:14,970
Let me put it this way.

455
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,570
Your elixir

456
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,960
can only assist in the treatement.

457
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,600
The key part

458
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,180
still needs to be done by me.

459
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:26,940
Alright.

460
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,150
I'll give it a try.

461
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,510
As long as Ruochen can recover,

462
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,740
as his senior fellow,

463
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,450
I'll do my best.

464
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,160
But

465
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,270
I have a question.

466
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,380
If the Ecstasy Needle

467
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,350
is the secret skill of the Zhenwu Temple,

468
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,640
as you said just now,

469
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:48,030
why is there immortal power on it?

470
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,950
Love and hatred

471
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,870
are entangled together and can't be cut off.

472
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,820
It must be Yin Feng who did it.

473
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,560
He's just like a ghost haunting us.

474
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:27,530
My lord.

475
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,260
Second Master.

476
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,220
We haven't found any traces of Ji Ruochen ahead.

477
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,030
Keep searching.

478
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:31,480
Yes!

479
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,500
Since Ji Ruochen

480
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,910
has been poisoned by my Ecstasy Needles,

481
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:37,890
he won't live long.

482
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,660
Do you need to make such a fuss?

483
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,610
Though your Ecstasy Needles are powerful,

484
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,100
if we want to cut the weeds, we must

485
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,820
remove the roots.

486
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,850
A few days ago, according to our informant,

487
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,220
Yunfeng, the eldest disciple of the Taichang Palace of Xixuan,

488
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,370
once appeared in a Chinese medicine shop in the capital

489
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:56,740
to buy herbs.

490
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:59,450
They were all prescriptions to cure the internal injury of one's heart.

491
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,870
I think Ji Ruochen

492
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,200
is tougher than we thought.

493
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:06,610
Calm down, Your Highness.

494
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,800
When we find the place where those Xixuan brats are staying,

495
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,260
no matter how many people they have,

496
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,820
we'll kill them all.

497
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:15,900
I've dispatched the disciples of Zhenwu Temple.

498
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:18,070
Once they find Ji Ruochen,

499
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,860
they'll kill him on the spot.

500
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:29,740
Yunfeng.

501
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,780
Don't you need a vent

502
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,180
behind the stove?

503
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,310
In that way, the fire inside the furnace will burn fiercely,

504
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,610
and the elixir you make

505
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:38,890
will be pure enough.

506
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,180
Okay.

507
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:46,800
You're back.

508
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,550
Is Ruochen awake?

509
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:50,930
Not yet.

510
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:54,120
Girl.

511
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,010
We'll have chicken tonight?

512
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,180
I'll stew it first.

513
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,680
If Ruochen wakes up later,

514
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,530
he can have some chicken soup.

515
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:02,970
What?

516
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,890
Then I...

517
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,250
Mr. Ji.

518
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,460
We asked you to stay

519
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:11,040
so as to take care of the patient,

520
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,760
but you have to suffer with us because of it instead.

521
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:15,640
By the way,

522
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,060
when I was collecting herbs,

523
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,270
I saw some sophora flowers were in full bloom on the mountain.

524
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:20,960
When Ruochen wakes up,

525
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:23,470
I'll make some sophora flower pancakes for you, okay?

526
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,970
Sure.

527
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,530
It’s my pleasure to taste

528
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,890
such delicious food.

529
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:32,250
Yunfeng,

530
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,790
I didn't expect you

531
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,560
to have such an elegant hobby.

532
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:38,530
You know what?

533
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,930
When I was a kid, my family was poor.

534
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,440
My mother

535
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,220
used this

536
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,780
to make food for her several children.

537
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,050
As I think of that now,

538
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:51,150
I really miss the taste back then.

539
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,570
When you were a kid...

540
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,490
That was really a long time ago.

541
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:34,390
Ruochen.

542
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:35,940
Ruochen!

543
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,100
Ruochen!

544
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:38,770
Ruochen!

545
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:41,710
Ruochen, can you hear me?

546
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:43,770
Yinyin.

547
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:46,220
I'm Yinyin.

548
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,150
Yinyin.

549
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,350
Ruochen, I'm here.

550
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,660
Yinyin.

551
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,240
Ruochen.

552
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:56,620
You're awake.

553
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,730
Ruochen!

554
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,620
Ruochen, what are you doing?

555
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,130
Ruochen!

556
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,350
Ruochen!

557
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:48,530
Ruochen!

558
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:49,820
Ruochen!

559
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:51,900
Ruochen!

560
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,540
Ruochen, what's wrong with you?

561
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,460
Ruochen!

562
00:28:59,260 --> 00:28:59,860
What's wrong?

563
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,740
I don't know. What's that sound?

564
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,340
Ruochen.

565
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,200
Yinyin.

566
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,670
Ruochen, come to your senses!

567
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,820
Ruochen, what are you doing?

568
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,640
Stop looking.

569
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,010
That's not right.

570
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,460
Help me!

571
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,810
What are you waiting for?

572
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:12,500
Help her.

573
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:12,880
Ruochen!

574
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:14,940
What are you doing?

575
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:15,770
Let go.

576
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,090
Let go!

577
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:23,930
Don't move.

578
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,470
Let me check his pulse.

579
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:35,720
Do something.

580
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:41,480
Ruochen!

581
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:45,910
I thought

582
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,990
the word "Ecstasy" in the Ecstasy Needle

583
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,180
referred to reaching the limit.

584
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,620
I didn't expect it to have such a meaning.

585
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,040
It's really...

586
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:58,650
Ruochen.

587
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,290
-Ruochen. -Ruochen.

588
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,900
Ruochen, you're finally awake.

589
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,780
You really scared me just now.

590
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,140
Yinyin.

591
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:09,130
Senior Yunfeng.

592
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,540
Mr. Ji.

593
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,570
How do you feel now?

594
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,940
My chest hurts.

595
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,580
It's like a pot of fire.

596
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,540
It's also like soaking in ice water.

597
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,110
The Ecstasy Needles

598
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,870
have been locked in the Yun and Fu acupoints by me.

599
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,150
You can't move for the time being.

600
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,340
But this is just a temporary measure.

601
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:12,880
We need to figure out a way

602
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,360
to find the other two needles.

603
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,250
-Ruo Chen! -Ruo Chen!

604
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:18,700
Don't move.

605
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:21,220
Senior Yunfeng.

606
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,860
How is Zekai?

607
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:25,850
There's nothing serious about his injury.

608
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,480
I've asked him to go back to the Xixuan Mountains and get reinforcements.

609
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,490
Don't worry.

610
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,540
Our master and the others will find a way

611
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,890
to save those disciples who are imprisoned.

612
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,550
Don't ask about these things anymore.

613
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,190
Just focus on recuperating.

614
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:40,070
Ruochen,

615
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,260
you almost

616
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,620
died this time.

617
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,160
Luckily, Mr. Ji

618
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,260
saved you in time.

619
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,370
Mr. Ji,

620
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,590
thank you for saving my life.

621
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,860
You can thank me when you recover.

622
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,350
Your hands are so cold.

623
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,320
Just warm them up for me, okay?

624
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,760
Alright. Stop looking. Let's go.

625
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,760
-Hurry! Go! -Mr. Ji.

626
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,040
How come I also

627
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,950
have a headache

628
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:22,770
besides the chest pain?

629
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,060
That's because...

630
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,010
I'll go continue to build the stove.

631
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,180
Once you have an attack of

632
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:34,820
this disease,

633
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,650
you'll be like a wild beast.

634
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,650
It'll surely make you have a headache.

635
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,690
Which part of your body is aching?

636
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,750
My head is aching.

637
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,860
Let me massage it for you.

638
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,400
I'm leaving.

639
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,540
I'll come back another day.

640
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:02,870
Yunfeng.

641
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:05,180
You have to hurry up to make the elixir.

642
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:05,730
Don't delay it.

643
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:06,510
Okay.

644
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:07,730
Mr. Ji.

645
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,260
Thank you

646
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,720
for saving Ruochen.

647
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,380
I salute you on behalf of the Xixuan Sect.

648
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:14,080
No need.

649
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,670
We are both scholars.

650
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,820
There's no need to stand on ceremony.

651
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:22,790
Yunfeng.

652
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,430
Mr. Ji has just woken up.

653
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,040
Tonight,

654
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,430
you and Miss Yinyin

655
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,080
should pay more attention.

656
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,390
Pay attention?

657
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,780
I look up at the sky and hate that the raindrops are not as sharp as swords.

658
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,170
Thousands of Qinggan Swords.

659
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,360
Blood will be seen after the cutting.

660
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,460
Be careful. Get up slowly.

661
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:01,980
Do you still have a headache?

662
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,450
No.

663
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:09,050
I thought I would never see you again.

664
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,280
I thought so this time.

665
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,380
I also felt the same at the bank of Hao River last time.

666
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:14,340
What are you talking about?

667
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,380
If you say such inauspicious things again,

668
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:17,290
I'll...

669
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:18,870
What will you do?

670
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:20,420
You'll hit my head, right?

671
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:21,530
I knew it.

672
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:24,810
What are you doing? Let go of me!

673
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,820
Look at you.

674
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,179
When you're scolding me,

675
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,650
I feel comfortable all over at once.

676
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,230
If you go on scolding me,

677
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:32,820
my wound won't hurt anymore.

678
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,040
Why are you still so thick-skinned when you're injured?

679
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:45,100
Ruochen.

680
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:47,389
Were you hurt

681
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,219
by Sun Guo

682
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,199
or Yin Feng?

683
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,650
Anyway, things have come to this.

684
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:57,190
What's the point of

685
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,640
investigating these things now?

686
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,030
What I want the most now

687
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,120
is that you can be safe,

688
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,390
and that I can see you

689
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,180
whenever I want.

690
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:47,060
Senior Yunfeng.

691
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:49,180
What does it mean to pay more attention?

692
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,700
What did Mr. Ji say?

693
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,500
He said we should pay more attention.

694
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,610
He didn't say anything else.

695
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,000
Then he started to recite poems again.

696
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,330
I didn't understand what he meant anyway.

697
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,680
Mr. Ji is a nice guy,

698
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,350
but I always feel that there's something odd about him.

699
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,920
Besides, for some reason,

700
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,640
I always feel that I seemed to see him somewhere.

701
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,320
However, I can't remember where I saw him.

702
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,640
Where else can it be?

703
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,760
Just in Haofang.

704
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:16,690
Yinyin,

705
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,960
you should sleep in the outside room tonight.

706
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:19,940
I'll sleep in the kitchen.

707
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,650
Fortunately, this house

708
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,800
is a suite with two rooms.

709
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,020
It's convenient for us to take care of Ruochen.

710
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,580
So this is how we should pay attention to him.

711
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,130
I have to go.

712
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:44,480
Senior Yunfeng.

713
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,060
Just let me sleep in the kitchen.

714
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,300
But the kitchen is ventilated from all the four sides.

715
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,150
Let me sleep there.

716
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,070
It's okay. It's okay.

717
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,660
I just want to sleep in the kitchen.

718
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,380
When I wake up in the middle of the night,

719
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,540
I can eat something.

720
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,740
Go to bed early.

721
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,330
I have to go.
