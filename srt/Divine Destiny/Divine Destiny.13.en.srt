[Episode 13]

4
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,240
Ji Ruochen.

5
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,390
If you've never loved me,

6
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,539
why did you agree to marry me?

7
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:52,840
Because

8
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,520
you saved my life.

9
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,430
You bastard!

10
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,270
You're still lying to me.

11
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:09,900
From beginning to end,

12
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,180
you did it for Zhang Yinyin.

13
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,440
What do you take me for?

14
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,980
You know everything?

15
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,350
Master told me everything.

16
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,460
I thought

17
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,970
I could pretend that I don't care.

18
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,170
As long as I grow old with you in the end,

19
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:53,920
it's nothing

20
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,980
even if the person in your heart is not me.

21
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,320
Don't touch me.

22
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,670
Ji Ruochen.

23
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,760
Have you...

24
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:25,400
Have you ever

25
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,740
wanted to marry me?

26
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,670
Have you?

27
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,860
Never.

28
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,040
Yes, you have.

29
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,710
You have.

30
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,990
Ji Ruochen.

31
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,210
I'm sorry.

32
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,120
I'll tell Master

33
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,460
to cancel

34
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:38,940
our engagement.

35
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,450
Could it be that Ruochen is back?

36
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,120
Let's go.

37
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:01,620
-Ruochen.
-Ruochen.

38
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:07,850
It was just the wind.

39
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:14,760
Let's go inside.

40
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,690
I wonder if Ruochen

41
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,700
has found Senior Yinyin.

42
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,890
I hope he can.

43
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,590
Qing.

44
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,700
Stone.

45
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,350
It's your fault.

46
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,330
It's all your fault.

47
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,490
We should have been a perfect match.

48
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:20,320
But he's so heartless.

49
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:26,920
Qing.

50
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:29,740
You're drunk.

51
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,760
I'll take you back to Yun Zhong Ju.

52
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,620
Yinyin. Yinyin.

53
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,800
Greetings, High Immortal.

54
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,670
High Immortal,

55
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,710
has Yinyin been here?

56
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,720
Before you came,

57
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,240
I was thinking

58
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,810
if I should kill you.

59
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,170
High Immortal.

60
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,330
Let me see her.

61
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,760
You betrayed her.

62
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,429
It's better not to see her.

63
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:37,659
She's really been here.

64
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,260
I know you care about Yinyin.

65
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,660
I also know I made a mistake.

66
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,920
But please let me see her.

67
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,610
There's something I must tell her face to face.

68
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,960
I can let you see her.

69
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,550
I want your eyes.

70
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,560
As long as I can see her,

71
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,760
you can take anything away.

72
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,740
You said it.

73
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,190
Silly boy.

74
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,200
How can you find her if you're blind?

75
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,800
She did come here.

76
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,000
But she has left.

77
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,480
Yinyin.

78
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,570
Master.

79
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:43,680
I lost.

80
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,500
He told me in Haofang that

81
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,260
he was a fake banished god.

82
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,920
He said it was his biggest secret.

83
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,020
He could only tell me.

84
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,170
He also said that after going back to Xixuan Mountains,

85
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,630
he would go to the Taixuan Palace to propose marriage in front of my parents.

86
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,480
His bride could only be me.

87
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,150
But I know

88
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:09,460
in the end,

89
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,080
he will still marry Gu Qing.

90
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:15,730
Do you regret it?

91
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:21,390
No.

92
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,320
Well.

93
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,620
Since the moment you fell in love with him,

94
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,260
you've lost.

95
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,800
But I'm willing

96
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,040
to lose to him.

97
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,680
But the price of not regretting it

98
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,910
is endless pain.

99
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,960
For the one you love,

100
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,890
you cared about nothing and gave up everything.

101
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,850
But

102
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,140
you ended up just like me.

103
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,120
I can only hide in this dark dungeon

104
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,820
and pretend that

105
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,720
he no longer exists in this world.

106
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,690
Do you regret it?

107
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,090
Master,

108
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,650
I actually envy you.

109
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,770
At least in this world,

110
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,280
you have someone

111
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,950
to think of.

112
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,020
But look at me.

113
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,370
He has become someone else's husband.

114
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,180
I shouldn't

115
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,890
think of him.

116
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,920
I should go.

117
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,280
Where are you going?

118
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,370
I want to see more of this world.

119
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,830
Anywhere is fine.

120
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,000
Go.

121
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,240
Go find her.

122
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,190
No matter where she is,

123
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:19,450
find her.

124
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:00,900
Xichen.

125
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,140
Xichen.

126
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,240
Xiechen.

127
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,600
Good news.

128
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,010
Really good news.

129
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,450
Your Highness. What makes you so happy?

130
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,210
His Majesty has gathered all the ministers

131
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,470
to discuss the appointment of the Crown Prince.

132
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:21,920
According to Eunuch Gao,

133
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,900
among all the princes,

134
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,010
His Majesty is still the most satisfied with me.

135
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,670
Congratulations. Your Highness.

136
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:36,610
No.

137
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,960
Congratulations. Crown Prince.

138
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,380
Xichen,

139
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:46,620
are you happy?

140
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,750
If I become the Crown Prince,

141
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,280
you will be the Crown Princess.

142
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,670
No.

143
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,900
You'll soon become the queen.

144
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,450
I

145
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,030
don't care about being the queen.

146
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,050
What I care about

147
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,650
is that you have me in your heart.

148
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,140
I've practiced for a lifetime.

149
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,990
You've only practiced for half a month.

150
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,220
But you are much better than me.

151
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,500
You know this immortal art?

152
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,340
Not just this immortal art.

153
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:07,150
I also know the real banished god in the Qingxu Mountains.

154
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,470
He is not dead.

155
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,690
Congratulations.

156
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:17,930
On what?

157
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,200
The banished god has regained his consciousness of god.

158
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,520
He doesn't want to see me again.

159
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,990
Li An has been appointed the Crown Prince.

160
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,440
I wonder what your future plan is.

161
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,540
Every wrongdoing has its perpetrator.

162
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,460
If it weren't for Ji Ruochen,

163
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,380
Luo Feng and I

164
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,970
wouldn't have become like strangers.

165
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,640
I must take revenge.

166
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,370
Ji Ruochen

167
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,030
must die.

168
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,300
I just received the news.

169
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,520
Xixuan Sect and Yun Zhong Ju have united by marriage.

170
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,460
The day before yesterday,

171
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,580
they held a wedding ceremony for Ji Ruochen and Gu Qing.

172
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,010
Gu Qing?

173
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,280
Is she Bluestone God?

174
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,320
A hundred lifetimes ago,

175
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,200
Bluestone God had an unfinished romance

176
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,900
with Luo Feng.

177
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,600
But in this life,

178
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,760
she made a mistake.

179
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,850
She has mistaken the fake banished god for her true love.

180
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,900
Even though she is a fairy,

181
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,200
she still doesn't deserve my Luo Feng.

182
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,810
This is good.

183
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,680
A stone fairy

184
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,570
and a fake banished god.

185
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,650
They are a perfect match.

186
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,080
But if that's the case,

187
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,470
it means that

188
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,930
Yun Zhong Ju and Xixuan Sect will be in the same boat.

189
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,290
If you really want to kill Ji Ruochen,

190
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,140
you have to

191
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,230
destroy Xixuan Sect completely.

192
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:29,630
Qingyi.

193
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:31,940
Stop following me.

194
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,850
Yinyin.

195
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,000
How is your headache?

196
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,690
I feel much better.

197
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,010
Thank you.

198
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,800
Yinyin.

199
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,510
Don't stand on ceremony.

200
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,220
You have nowhere to go anyway.

201
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,690
Why don't you go back to the Endless Sea with me?

202
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:02,120
No.

203
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,430
I still want to walk around alone.

204
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,450
Go with me.

205
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,110
The mortal world is full of hardships.

206
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,440
Why do you want to stay?

207
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,410
Just because I don't want to stay,

208
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,710
I want to walk around alone.

209
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,540
Maybe

210
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,030
I can forget him one day.

211
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,900
Miss Zhang.

212
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,450
Can you really forget him?

213
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,190
I don't know.

214
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,200
But I still think

215
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,070
it makes me happier

216
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,390
to care about no one and travel around the world.

217
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,260
All right.

218
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,100
You should hurry back to the Endless Sea.

219
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:49,680
Your uncle is still waiting for you.

220
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:51,960
The world is vast.

221
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:53,920
See you later.

222
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,980
Yinyin may have left the Xixuan Mountains.

223
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:17,960
Based on her personality,

224
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,400
if she has decided to leave,

225
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,180
she will never come back.

226
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:23,950
Ruochen,

227
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,100
you must find Senior Yinyin and come back with her.

228
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,460
It's just a few tails.

229
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,540
It's no big deal.

230
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,580
Is it necessary to push family away?

231
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,700
Master Jingxiao hasn't fully recovered yet.

232
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,380
And Yinyin is not here.

233
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,290
I don't know when I'll be back after I leave.

234
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,950
Please take care of Yinyin's mother.

235
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:45,820
Don't worry.

236
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,120
Give me the bag.

237
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,400
We're going to see you off.

238
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:54,630
Ruochen.

239
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,080
Senior.

240
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,030
About Yinyin,

241
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,060
can't I beg Master?

242
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,560
In my opinion,

243
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,080
it won't be easy.

244
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,770
A thousand years ago,

245
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,430
a war broke out between the human race and the monster clan.

246
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,850
Xixuan Sect took the lead

247
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,340
and killed many demons and monsters.

248
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,700
Thus, Xixuan Sect has been an enemy of monsters since then.

249
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,330
It's not a problem that can be solved easily.

250
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,120
Yinyin

251
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,690
showed her identity as a monster in public.

252
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,450
So Xixuan Sect has to give an explanation

253
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,230
to the righteous sects.

254
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:37,860
But no matter what,

255
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,670
Yinyin is a disciple of Xixuan.

256
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,430
Gossip is a fearful thing.

257
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,440
You know Su He put the Huanyao Root

258
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,810
in Yinyin's body, right?

259
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:52,760
Yes.

260
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,780
Yesterday, Master heard from Huang Xinglan that

261
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,540
what happened to Yinyin is because of the grudge of the senior generation.

262
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,180
It's normal that Master feels guilty.

263
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,550
Ruochen.

264
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,260
Master asked me to send you a message.

265
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,060
The blue mountains never change, and the green water flows forever.

266
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:24,550
Then

267
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,420
what about my engagement with Gu Qing?

268
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,150
Master said

269
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,230
your behavior of running away from the wedding

270
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,690
has disgraced him

271
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:35,570
in front of the righteous sects.

272
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,620
From now on,

273
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,140
he only wants to be with his gourd.

274
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,380
He'll never care about those annoying things.

275
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,790
He just hopes

276
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,260
you will never forget

277
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,750
your mission.

278
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,070
Ruochen,

279
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,420
no matter what situation you are in,

280
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,050
don't forget

281
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,010
you are a disciple of Xixuan Sect.

282
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,140
My sincere gratitude to Master.

283
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,020
Seniors.

284
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,580
Farewell.

285
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:19,580
Go back now.

286
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,700
Be careful.

287
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:22,470
Ji Ruochen.

288
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,490
Stop!

289
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,380
Ji Ruochen, you broke your promise.

290
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,280
You abandoned Gu Qing.

291
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,070
You ruined her reputation.

292
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,010
Don't worry.

293
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,490
I will bring Yinyin back.

294
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,960
I'm going to seek justice for her today.

295
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,200
-Shi Ji.
-Xuanzhen. Hurry!

296
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:33,900
-Okay.
-Get on the horse.

297
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,410
Ruochen.

298
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:35,270
Go now.

299
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:37,790
Hurry.

300
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:40,510
Stop fighting!

301
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,340
-Have a safe trip.
-Go.

302
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,240
Shang Qiushui.

303
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:46,950
Why are you always against me?

304
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,200
A guest should suit the convenience of the host.

305
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,590
It's better for Xixuan Sect

306
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,380
to deal with its own problems.

307
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,250
Don't forget

308
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,520
you were once defeated by me.

309
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,660
How dare you challenge me here?

310
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,720
After three days apart, one should look at each other with new eyes.

311
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,530
If I fight with you today,

312
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,030
I may not lose.

313
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,640
Be careful.

314
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,200
Shi Ji, stop fighting.

315
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,980
Although we can't be relatives,

316
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,780
we are still friends, right?

317
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,840
Don't let misunderstanding

318
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,040
break the harmony.

319
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,020
Senior Yunfeng.

320
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,990
What you said is not right.

321
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,180
In order to achieve clarity or understanding, one must take action or engage in discussion and debate.

322
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:21,720
They slandered Ruochen seriously.

323
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,860
It's not just some misunderstanding.

324
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,660
Stop talking.

325
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:24,610
Senior.

326
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,810
Just let Qiushui dampen their arrogance.

327
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:27,850
Don't worry.

328
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,140
Qiushui knows what to do.

329
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,050
They'll be fine.

330
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,760
You

331
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,380
are just a looker-on. You don't think this is serious.

332
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:32,760
I...

333
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,890
Stop fighting.

334
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:39,980
What are you looking at?

335
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,580
Go after them!

336
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:02,480
Let me go!

337
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,140
Let go of me!

338
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,780
Shi Ji.

339
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,190
I'm sorry about it.

340
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:26,960
Please forgive me.

341
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,780
Oh no.

342
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:55,750
We...

343
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,280
We are going to be in big trouble.

344
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,460
Hurry. Let's go.

345
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,900
The bees are coming at us.

346
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,580
Run!

347
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,330
Let's go.

348
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,070
It should be okay now.

349
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,530
I shouldn't have said that today.

350
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,790
Sorry I made you in trouble.

351
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,610
I apologize to you.

352
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,750
Goodbye.

353
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,590
Did you see it clearly?

354
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:30,980
I was right there.

355
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:35,650
If what you said is true,

356
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:39,130
this will be an unexpected surprise.

357
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,050
Master.

358
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,730
Jin Shan from Yun Zhong Ju wants to see you.

359
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,430
I'm going to meet him.

360
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,790
Invite him to the hall.

361
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:49,580
Yes, Master.

362
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,000
If he

363
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,460
doesn't come to see me,

364
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,980
I have to find a way to beg him.

365
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,000
Master.

366
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,380
Didn't you say

367
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,220
you wouldn't care about these annoying things?

368
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,620
Your Junior Master Jingxiao is still ill abed.

369
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,660
We don't know if he can make it.

370
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:09,200
How can we miss such a good opportunity?

371
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,590
Do as I told you.

372
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,620
I got this.

373
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:15,470
I'll give you instructions.

374
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:15,970
Okay.

375
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,350
I'm late. Sorry to keep you waiting.

376
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,580
I'm really sorry.

377
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,940
Did Ji Ruochen escape?

378
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:21,930
Did he?

379
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,220
Yes. My disciple Ruochen

380
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,420
is not here right now.

381
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,300
I thought you could handle it properly

382
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,500
and give me an explanation.

383
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,340
But look what you did.

384
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,370
You let your treacherous disciple

385
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,460
escape.

386
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,560
Did you let him go on purpose?

387
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,660
No, no.

388
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,900
How could I do that on purpose?

389
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,860
It was indeed Xixuan's fault.

390
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:44,550
I apologize to Yun Zhong Ju on behalf of Xixuan Sect.

391
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,460
Sorry.

392
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,140
Apologize to Jin Shan.

393
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,070
Sorry.

394
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:53,910
That's it?

395
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,690
An apology?

396
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,310
What I'm saying now is

397
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:01,140
the reputation of Yun Zhong Ju has been ruined.

398
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,900
What should we do about it?

399
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:06,400
Xixuan Sect and Yun Zhong Ju

400
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:09,360
are in the same boat.

401
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,580
I'm really sad now.

402
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,440
I'm more worried than you.

403
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:16,170
Stop pretending to be pitiful.

404
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,980
Now Xixuan and Yun Zhong Ju

405
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,740
have become a joke to the rest of the world.

406
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:21,980
What should we do?

407
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,290
What should we do?

408
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,660
What should we do?

409
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:28,940
Yunfeng, what should we do?

410
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,470
We failed to make Ruochen and Gu Qing a couple,

411
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,700
but we can make someone else a couple.

412
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:36,610
What did you just say?

413
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,410
I think

414
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,940
we can make someone else a couple.

415
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,090
That's a good idea.

416
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,160
Make someone else a couple?

417
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,980
You are so cunning.

418
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,790
First, it was Qing.

419
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,620
Now

420
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,500
you're talking about Shi Ji.

421
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,930
What are you thinking?

422
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,060
Bro. Bro.

423
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,450
Bro.

424
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,460
If they get married at this time,

425
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,270
it will be a good way

426
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,800
to solve our problems.

427
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,260
Of course,

428
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,100
Hierarch Jin Shan has the final say.

429
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:23,820
Feng.

430
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,070
Among the young disciples of Xixuan Sect,

431
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:29,520
is there anyone about age for marriage?

432
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,700
Of course there are many young talents

433
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,610
who are not married yet.

434
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,120
But the most outstanding disciple

435
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:39,390
is definitely Junior Qiushui from the Sikong Palace.

436
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,770
Qiushui?

437
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,040
Hierarch Jin Shan.

438
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,650
Shang Qiushui, a disciple of Taiwei Zhenren,

439
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,070
is elegant and handsome.

440
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,440
He is a wonderful person.

441
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:49,790
At the wedding,

442
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,880
I think you have seen him.

443
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,280
If you and Shi Ji agree,

444
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,850
it will be a godsent marriage.

445
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,850
Think about it.

446
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:05,200
Shang Qiushui. I have impression on him.

447
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,720
He is indeed handsome

448
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:09,940
and outstanding.

449
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:14,660
Shi Ji.

450
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,260
Master.

451
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,820
Let me ask you.

452
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,030
Are you willing?

453
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,540
Yes.

454
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:27,700
Really?

455
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,630
Please grant my wish.

456
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,540
Marriage is not a joke.

457
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,100
You must think carefully.

458
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,680
I

459
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:39,850
have made up my mind.

460
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:45,580
You will have another disciple of mine.

461
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,900
But let's make a deal first.

462
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,550
According to the rules of Yun Zhong Ju,

463
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:55,210
Shang Qiushui needs to be

464
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,630
Yun Zhong Ju's live-in son-in-law.

465
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,680
In that case,

466
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,750
Xixuan Sect

467
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,900
will lose another excellent disciple.

468
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,370
-Yeah.
-Don't act innocent.

469
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,560
Yun Zhong Ju always agrees with Xixuan Sect.

470
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,410
Make a compromise

471
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,900
and don't be too greedy.

472
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,120
Okay. Okay.

473
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,360
Bro.

474
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,900
About Jingxiao Zhenren's poison

475
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,380
and your secret technique

476
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:19,980
to detoxicate...

477
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,430
We had a deal.

478
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:22,770
Once we unite by marriage,

479
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,880
I will detoxicate Jingxiao Zhenren.

480
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,430
What?

481
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,660
You think

482
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,820
I will go back on my words?

483
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,700
No.

484
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,280
Jin Shan is very kind.

485
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,780
Youth is short,

486
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,960
and time flies.

487
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,560
You are very lucky

488
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,860
that you've found your soul mate.

489
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,030
That's the charm

490
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,490
of marriage.

491
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,740
Qiushui.

492
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,930
Actually, Master has regretted

493
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,840
about what happened to Ruochen.

494
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,250
He doesn't want to make the same mistake again.

495
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,140
If you have any difficulties

496
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,060
or have fallen in love with someone,

497
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,860
just tell Master.

498
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:13,930
Don't make yourself feel wronged.

499
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:25,820
Junior Master.

500
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:28,780
If Ruochen

501
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,700
is married now,

502
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,200
does that mean

503
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,150
my marriage won't exist?

504
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,860
Marriage is not a joke.

505
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,910
Considering what happened to Ruochen,

506
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,850
I will never sacrifice your happiness

507
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:45,340
for the dignity of the sect again.

508
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,680
So I still

509
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,390
need your permission.

510
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,020
Of course,

511
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,300
you don't need to worry about other things.

512
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,430
OK.

513
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,260
I'll give you an answer tomorrow.

514
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:05,150
Okay.

515
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:18,270
[Taichang Palace]

516
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:25,920
Darling.

517
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:28,840
Darling.

518
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:37,780
Darling.

519
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:40,980
You're finally awake.

520
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:44,460
You're finally awake.

521
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:53,659
Lan.

522
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:04,890
The Taixuan Palace will never forget your kindness.

523
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,180
You're welcome.

524
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,070
You're welcome.

525
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,280
Jin Shan.

526
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,660
Xixuan Sect

527
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:11,980
will never forget your kindness.

528
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,790
Xixuan and Yun Zhong Ju have got along well for generations.

529
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,260
Now we have united by marriage.

530
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:18,170
This is what I should do.

531
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,660
-Boss, a bowl of noodles.
-Let me tell you.

532
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,320
I found a big treasure today.

533
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,240
What treasure?

534
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,820
Let me show you.

535
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,390
Look at them.

536
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,810
Where did you buy them?

537
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:44,750
What do you think?

538
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,480
I thought they were out of stock.

539
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,790
I searched every shop but couldn't buy them.

540
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,700
May I ask

541
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,750
what they are?

542
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:52,860
They are

543
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,300
limited-edition dolls

544
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,200
created to celebrate the marriage between Xixuan Sect and Yun Zhong Ju.

545
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:00,290
I heard that the bride and the bridegroom are gods.

546
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,510
They are a perfect couple.

547
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:07,980
Where did she go?

548
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:16,830
Stop!

549
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:19,980

♫I feel as if I'm distant from this bustling world of crowds♫

572
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,270
Ruochen. Ruo...

573
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,720
♫Frowning, heart aching, love and hate entwined♫

574
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:32,500
♫Your tenderness separated by distance and time♫

575
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:29,740
Never seen her.

576
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:30,570
Thank you.

577
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:39,350
♫And I can only embrace myself in care♫

578
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:45,230
♫As the dim lights fade away, troubles come to a halt♫

579
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,180
Excuse me.

580
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:45,980
Have you...

581
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:49,990
♫Still entangled with many emotional trials♫

582
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,050
Have you seen this person?

583
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,360
No.

584
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,490
Thank you.

585
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:56,190
♫You wrote a letter to make an appointment with me♫

586
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,420
Excuse me. Have you seen this person?

587
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,140
No.

588
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,090
Thank you.

589
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:04,220
♫Leaving a startled glimpse in my heart♫

590
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:57,110
Miss,

591
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,540
have you seen this person?

592
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,190
No.

593
00:37:59,430 --> 00:37:59,950
Thank you.

594
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:02,920
Have you seen this person?

595
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:03,550
No.

596
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:06,700
Never seen her.

597
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,190
Thank you.

598
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:24,710
This is Yinyin's handwriting.

599
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,320
It's Yinyin.

600
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,680
Yinyin.

601
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,700
Yinyin.

602
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:39,880
Yinyin.

603
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,710
Yinyin.
