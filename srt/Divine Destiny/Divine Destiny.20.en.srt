you'll forget it in the blink of an eye.

Of course I want to save him,

Memories are nothing.

148
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,590
Can memories save him?

149
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,670

You don't have to come over.

Be careful.

As a disciple of Xixuan Sect,

Whether it's about saving the Three Realms

165
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,360
or continuing to be a banished god,

166
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,170
I will keep doing these things.

167
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,570
I will walk down

168
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,250
this path.

169
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,440
Have you made up your mind?

170
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,810
If I were you,

171
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,220
I would never waste

172
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,320
the only chance to save him.

173
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,380
I know he has a lot of things to do.

174
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,980
He wants to avenge his senior.

175
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,280
He wants to save Xixuan Sect.

176
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,870
He wants to help those who are about to suffer.

177
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,290
Then you should help him complete these things.

178
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,410
He is the person you love the most.

179
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,860
You should do something for him,

180
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,100
instead of keeping these memories

181
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,470
for your own desires.

182

Take them all.

184

As long as he gets better.

185

-I was so worried.
-Is everything alright?

296
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,550
I remember that I entered the Monster Forbidden Zone.

297
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,750
Why am I here?

298
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,830
I also remember that I entered the Monster Forbidden Zone,

299
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,410
but I forgot everything

300
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,510

301
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,370
Anyone who leaves the Monster Forbidden Zone

302
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,380
will forget what happens inside.

303
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,870
It was the same for me back then.

304
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,060
I see.

305
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,470
Mr. Ji, your hand...

306

307
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,300

312
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,550
Are you kidding me?

313
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,900
Yinyin, can you stop joking?

314
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,030
I’m not kidding.

315
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,710
You look handsome.

316
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:01,790
Why are you acting like a pervert?

317
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:02,650
You're so handsy.

318
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:03,730
What happened?

319
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,990
Stop joking.

320
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,630
What are you doing?

321
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,580
Whose friend is he?

322
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,400
-She seems to have forgotten everything.
-Yinyin.

323
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,800
Don't blame me for being harsh on you if you keep doing this.

324
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:13,610
No way.

325
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,510
What's wrong with you?

326
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,740
What?

327
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,330
Yinyin.

328
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,130
Something is wrong.

Yinyin, do you remember who I am?

330
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,810
You're Ling from Endless Sea.

331
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,400
What about him?

332
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:34,610
Do you know him?

333
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,770
Who wants to know him?

334
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:42,430
Do you remember me?

335
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,720

336
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:44,640

339
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,120
Of course I remember you guys.

340
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,210
I'm not a fool.

341
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,910
That's even worse.

342
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,260
You remember everyone,

343
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,400

344
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,190
-I...
-Yinyin, don’t scare me.

345
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,110
Who are you? Why do I have to remember you?

346
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:07,810
Seriously.

347
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,150
Whose friend is he?

348
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,150
Come on.

349
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:13,600

350
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:15,520
Let me ask you.

351
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,180
Do you remember

352
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,410
why you came here?

353
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,610
I came here

354
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,670
for...

355
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,130
For...

356
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:28,810
For...

357
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,310
For someone's treatment.

358
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,900
Do you remember where you were

359
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,260
before you came here?

360
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,080
I was...

361
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:37,780
I was...

362
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,540
You were in a hut.

363
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,160
You were healing someone.

364
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,060
You decocted medicine for him.

365
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:41,800
Also,

366
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,420
you raised goats and milked them for him.

367
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,300
You also told him

368
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,600
you were going to open an inn outside the city.

369
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,130
Don't you remember?

370
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,610
If you don't remember these,

371
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,740
do you remember Xixuan Mountains?

372
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,490
Do you remember Qiushui and Xuanzhen?

373
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,200
And...

374
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:52,800
Stop it.

375
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,330
When you were locked up back then,

376
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,560
he cooked for you

377
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,600
and brought you food.

378
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,780
You said

379
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,740
it was your favourite food.

380
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,110
Why did you...

381
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:00,900
Yinyin.

382
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,510
Yinyin, don't!

383
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,220
Yinyin.

384
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,780
Yinyin.

385
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,350
Yinyin.

386
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:07,950
Yinyin.

387
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,380
What happened to you, Yinyin?

388
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:10,730
Yinyin.

389
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,620
Yinyin.

390
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,380
Yinyin.

391
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,020
Yinyin.

392
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,250
Yinyin.

393
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:19,860
Yinyin.

394
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,640
Yinyin.

395
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,910
What happened to Yinyin?

396
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,090
What's wrong with her?

397
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,300
She's fine now.

398
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,340
She'll be fine after a sleep.

399
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,490
But...

400
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:38,590
Don't provoke her anymore.

401
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,130
But why?

402
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,080
Ling and I both went to the Monster Forbidden Zone.

403
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,170
We just forgot what happened inside the Monster Forbidden Zone,

404
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,590
but Yinyin forgot me

405
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,020
after she got out of there.

406
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,070
Why?

407
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,650
How would I know?

408
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,620
Anyway, you went to the Monster Forbidden Zone.

409
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,600
No matter what happened,

410
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:54,740
I won't be surprised.

411
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,630
What should we do now?

412
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,960
We can't let my sister forget Mr. Ji.

413
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,060
How about

414
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:03,770
we take Yinyin back to Xixuan Mountains?

415
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,820
Maybe Xu Ziyang and the others

416
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,820
know something.

417
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,050
Okay.

418
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,290
I'll take her back

419
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,690
as soon as she wakes up.

420
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,760
But she doesn't know you now,

421
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,510
and Xixuan Sect has expelled her.

422
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,370
Will she be willing to go with you?

423
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,090
That's not difficult.

424
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,590
Yinyin.

425
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:31,540
Sister.

426
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,110
Sister, you're awake.

427
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:35,810
Sister, have some water.

428
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:41,260
After you finish drinking,

429
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,830
go back to Xixuan Mountains.

430
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,150
Where?

431
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,940
I finally got away with all those sufferings

432
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,000
and left Xixuan Mountains,

433
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,760
of course I have something

434
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,130
to tell Ziyang and the others.

435
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,940
What? You don't want to pass the message for me?

436
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,860
Please go ahead.

437
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,300
Tell Ziyang

438
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,800
we'll meet again.

439
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,330
That's all?

440
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,620
I have my reasons.

441
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,580
Just pass my message.

442
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,220
Besides,

443
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,440
he's also going back to Xixuan Mountains.

444
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,040
Just go with him.

445
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,290
Sister.

446
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,590
His name is Ji Ruochen.

447
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,350
He's a disciple of a division under Xixuan Sect,

448
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,380
so you didn't meet him before.

449
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,390
You almost got trapped in the Monster Forbidden Zone this time.

450
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,860
Luckily, he helped you

451
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,900
get out of there.

452
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,620
I'm Ji Ruochen, form a division under Xixuan Sect.

453
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,700
Nice to meet you, Yinyin.

454
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,750
I mistook you for someone else.

455
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,690
Sorry about that.

456
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,350
I hope you can forgive me.

457
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,010
You mistook me for someone else?

458
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,010
I mistook you for an old friend of mine,

459
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,590
so I hope you can forgive me.

460
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,920
Alright, I’ll forgive you.

461
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,220
I'll spare you this time,

462
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,940
but I don't want to

463
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,710
go back with you.

464
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,300
What are you talking about?

465
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,660
Are you disobeying me even before you finish learning from me?

466
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,280
Go back with him.

467
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,630
Sister.

468
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,040
It's good for you.

469
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,170
You can take care of each other on the way.

470
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,470
That makes sense.

471
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,140
Yinyin, you don’t know.

472
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:17,600
Mr. Ji

473
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,370
is very humorous and kind.

474
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,220
Going back with him,

475
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,860
you won't feel bored all the way.

476
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:23,900
Right.

477
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,910
I have some good liquor.

478
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,380
I'll bring it to you later.

479
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,630
Why don't you come with us?

480
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:31,540
Well,

481
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,910
Our Dragon and Tiger Universal Cannon

482
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,740
can only be fixed with the magic tool in the Endless Sea.

483
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,310
That's right.

484
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,240
So...

485
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,620
So after we fix the Dragon and Tiger Universal Cannon,

486
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,870
we'll go to Xixuan Mountains.

487
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:43,970
That makes sense.

488
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,690
Sister,

489
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:48,530
Ling and I have some other things to do.

490
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,270
We won't go back to Xixuan with you.

491
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,800
Take care.

492
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:54,120
Why are you all so weird?

493
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,250
Yinyin, get ready and set out.

494
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,170
Master.

495
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:01,600
Come.

496
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:02,780
Go.

497
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:04,400
Please, Yinyin.

498
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,240
Sister, take care.

499
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:11,680
Take care.

500
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:13,450
Take care.

501
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,590
I wonder

502
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,180
if Yinyin will remember Ji Ruochen.

503
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,260
What are you doing?

504
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,060
Heavenly Fox, Endless Sea is inviting you to Hanging Island.

505
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,170
Does it mean

506
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,350
Heavenly Fox is going to meet Master at the Endless Sea?

507
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,340
Who said I'm going to meet him?

508
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,400
Heavenly Fox.

509
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,730
Since you're here,

510
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,280
go and see uncle.

511
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,420
Actually, we all know that

512
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,980
although he doesn't say it,

513
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,020
he still cares about you.

514
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,050
He cares about me?

515
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,030
Tell me.

516
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:47,860
How does he care about me?

517
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:49,370
Master said

518
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,960
he's not afraid of anything in  his life

519
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,220
except you.

520
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,170
Master also said

521
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,120
anyone can come to the Endless Sea

522
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,720
except you.

523
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,020
If you come,

524
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,340
he's afraid you would fill the Endless Sea.

525
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,220
Who would want to fill his Endless Sea?

526
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,180
Heavenly Fox.

527
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,990
Although uncle said that,

528
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,690
he mustn't think it that way.

529
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,750
Otherwise, he wouldn't

530
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,200
always mention you in front of us.

531
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,590
I think

532
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,680
he's just stubborn.

533
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,060
Just like how sister treats Mr. Ji.

534
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:17,950
Right.

535
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,610
What did you learn

536
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,910
in the mortal world?

537
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,300
Heavenly Fox, please.

538
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:25,930
Please.

539
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,250
Let's go.

540
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:37,260
If it weren't for the demons

541
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,270
who came out of nowhere and saved Ji Ruochen,

542
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,840
I would have killed him.

543
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:41,950
It seems that

544
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,560
Xixuan Sect cooperated with  demons

545
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,450
to protect themselves.

546
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:49,020
Of course it's possible.

547
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,920
If we attack Xixuan Sect,

548
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:55,490
the banished god and Fairy Gu must stand up

549
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,320
and fight enemies with us.

550
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,480
Only in this way can we be sure of victory.

551
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:04,040
This is why we came to Qingxu this time.

552
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,120
After Yinfeng and Gu Qing returned to Qingxu,

553
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,710
I've been persuading him.

554
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,530
But he only cares about Gu Qing.

555
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,430
He focuses on helping her study the Book of Heaven.

556
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,400
I can do nothing about him.

557
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,210
And that day,

558
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,390
I wanted to discuss something with Gu Qing,

559
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,870
but Yinfeng got furious.

560
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,800
He didn't respect me at all,

561
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,700
which was really irritating.

562
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,190
It seems

563
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,850
not only has Fairy Gu fallen into the mortal world,

564
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,740
even the banished god

565
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,570
has fallen in love.

566
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,070
Yeah.

567
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,400
Otherwise, the banished god wouldn't have let Ji Ruochen go

568
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,310
and let him bring disaster to the mortal world.

569
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,020
It's a good thing

570
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,530
that the banished god and Fairy Gu have fallen in love with each other.

571
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,150
What are you upset about?

572
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,290
Good thing?

573
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,860
What good thing?

574
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,710
Immortals are heartless.

575
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,100
The banished god and Fairy Gu

576
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,470
have fallen into the mortal world.

577
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:06,830
They'll become more and more like humans.

578
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,150
Humans have many weaknesses,

579
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:15,700
so they can help us achieve success.

580
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,560
You're right.

581
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,310
But what should we do now?

582
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,190
Your Highness.

583
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,820
The banished god asked me to tell you

584
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,260
he has said everything he should.

585
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:46,900
What should be ended has long been settled.

586
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:48,700
He suggested you two not see each other anymore.

587
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,040
Your Highness, please don’t.

588
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,310
The banished god said

589
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,140
no one

590
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,870
can disturb Fairy Gu.

591
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,740
-Otherwise...
-He really doesn’t want to see me?

592
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,530
Give this letter to Yinfeng.

593
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:13,540
Tell him

594
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,170
this letter is a matter of life and death for him and Gu Qing.

595
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,490
If he doesn't read it, he will regret it for the rest of his life.

596
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:22,890
Yes.

597
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:31,810
Sir, here's a letter for you.

598
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,380
Burn it.

599
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,740
But Her Highness said...

600
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,700
[To Feng]

601
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,070
This letter is a matter of life and death for you and Fairy Gu.

602
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,280
You may leave.

603
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:57,310
Ji...

604
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:58,980
Ji...

605
00:29:59,150 --> 00:29:59,750
Ji Ruochen.

606
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,770
Ji Ruo...

607
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,060
Why is your name so vulgar and twisted?

608
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,600
A friend of mine

609
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:08,890
said the same thing before.

610
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:09,660
Who?

611
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,220
Just a friend of mine.

612
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,570
She is like you.

613
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,560
She's independent, ambitious,

614
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,340
honest, but cute.

615
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,500
We went through a lot together,

616
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,360
but one day, somehow,

617
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,560
I lost her.

618
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,620
I see.

619
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,700
You must mistake me

620
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,660
for that friend before,

621
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:28,930
but what do you mean

622
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,400
by you lost her?

623
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:31,750
Where is she now?

624
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,270
Hurry up.

625
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,020
The Best Chicken in the World

626
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:33,740
opens today.

627
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,700
We'll miss it if we're late.

628
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,940
What is the Best Chicken in the World?

629
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,200
You must be new here.

630
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:38,880
There's a Li's Shop

631
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,140
selling roast chicken.

632
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,110
Even His Majesty

633
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,710
likes his roast chicken.

634
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,780
I have to go.

635
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,740
There won't be any more left if I'm late.

636
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:49,300
Speaking of which,

637
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,580
I haven't had roast chicken for a long time.

638
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:54,970
Let's go have a look.

639
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:55,680
Let's go.

640
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:59,820
[Best Chicken in the World]

641
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,450
He's not lying.

642
00:30:59,060 --> 00:30:59,980
Do you want to try one?

643
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,000
I'd like to.

644
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,670
Don't you see how many people are lining up here?

645
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,010
I wonder how long it'll take.

646
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,240
Besides, that man just said

647
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,990
nothing will be left if we're late.

648
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,560
Even if we are willing to line up,

649
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,230
there won't be any chicken left for us.

650
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,720
Maybe there'll be some.

651
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,210
Everyone can have it.

652
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:23,440
Boss.

653
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,620
All the chickens are sold out today.

654
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,240
I asked the staff to close the stall.

655
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:27,880
Okay. You may leave.

656
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:28,420
Okay.

657
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:39,500
Who is it?

658
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,310
Who's inside?

659
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,580
How dare you, Doggie Li!

660
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,850
Why don't you kneel before the God of Wealth?

661
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,260
God of Wealth!

662
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,660
God of Wealth! God of Wealth!

663
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,260
God of Wealth, bless me.

664
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,240
Hurry up.

665
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,180
God of Wealth has shown himself.

666
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,580
God of Wealth has shown himself?

667
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,260
Yes.

668
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,600
Did the God of Wealth say

669
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,670
when Young Master will win the first place in the highest imperial examination?

670
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,870
No.

671
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,820
Did he tell you

672
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,100
when Her Lady will find her husband?

673
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,130
No.

674
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,530
Then will Madam...

675
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,540
Why did you focus on

676
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:11,900
my wife and kids?

677
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:12,870
No.

678
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,100
What did the God of Wealth say?

679
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,360
He wants to eat chicken.

680
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,700
Ask the servants to prepare.

681
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,100
Apart from roast chicken,

682
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,310
prepare a crispy roast three-yellow chicken,

683
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:25,100
fried chicken liver, fried chicken pops,

684
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,690
and chicken stew with caterpillar fungus.

685
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:33,850
I find

686
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,660
you are quite interesting.

687
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,860
It's a bit like what Dragon Elephant White Tiger said.

688
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,750
How could you think of buying chicken in this way?

689
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,340
I learned it from you.

690
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:46,980
Nothing.

691
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:48,590
Come on.

692
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:49,860
Cheers.

693
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,070
Cheers.

694
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,860
For the sake of your contribution in buying chicken,

695
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,670
I'll take you as my bro.

696
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,390
Can I give you a suggestion?

697
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,230
Just throw away your fake Chiying Sword.

698
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,520
Don't you feel shameful

699
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,750
carrying a fake sword as a disciple of Xixuan?

700
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,880
How do you know I'm carrying a fake sword?

701
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,790
Of course it is fake.

702
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:18,900
The real one has already been given to...

703
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:21,880
Given to...

704
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,020
Forget it.

705
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,910
It's a nice day today.

706
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,090
Let's not think about other things or people.

707
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,630
Let's just get drunk.

708
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:41,680
Cheers.

709
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,370
Since I've taken you as my bro,

710
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:50,580
tell me the truth.

711
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,300
Did Qingyi arrange our trip

712
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:54,610
back to Xixuan Mountains on purpose?

713
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,930
Why do you think so?

714
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,390
I knew it even if you didn't tell me.

715
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,280
I forgot a lot of things

716
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,350
after I got out of the Monster Forbidden Zone.

717
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,640
Did Qingyi and others

718
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,350
ask you to send me back to Xixuan Mountains for treatment?

719
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:08,790
Am I right?

720
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,530
Well, I don't know

721
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,639
in what identity

722
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,150
I should go back to Xixuan Mountains this time.

723
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,100
Comes to think of it,

724
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:19,070
I'm no longer a disciple of Xixuan.

725
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,770
Didn't we agree

726
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,610
not to think about other things and people anymore?

727
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:25,650
Here.

728
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:27,600
Chicken.

729
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:29,739
How do you know

730
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:31,940
I don't like chicken feet but chicken wings?

731
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,409
You even know I don't eat orange pith.

732
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,150
Actually, I know more about you.

733
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,090
I know you get up at 6.30 every morning

734
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:56,199
and start practicing martial arts.

735
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,580
What you hate the most

736
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,240
is bathing the Evil-Repelling Beasts.

737
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,100
What you feel happiest about

738
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,660
is winning the first place in the exam every year.

739
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,040
Your favourite colour is pink.

740
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,920
Your favorite food

741
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,070
is mung bean cake.

742
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,550
How do you know these?

743
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,840
Of course Qingyi told me.

744
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,800
So it’s Qingyi.

745
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:24,850
But...

746
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,400
Have I ever told Qingyi

747
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,360
that I don’t like bathing the Evil-Repelling Beasts?

748
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:35,640
Young man,

749
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,380
let me give you another suggestion.

750
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,100
Can you stop pulling a long face every day?

751
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,910
What makes you so depressed?

752
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:45,840
What could it be?

753
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:47,770
I told you last time.

754
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,070
I don't know if my friend

755
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,230
would think of me again.

756
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,550
Let's pick up where we left off.

757
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,610
Where is your friend now?

758
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,220
I'm going back

759
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:01,650
to see her this time,

760
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,400
but I don't know

761
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,280
if I can see her again.

762
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,170
As the saying goes,

763
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,700
ss long as you are sincere,

764
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,860
you will find her.

765
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,740
That's right. You should smile more.

766
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:19,670
Cheers.

767
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,830
Bottoms up.

768
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,510
Where are you going this late?

769
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:40,710
Zhenwu Temple?

770
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,900
How did you know?

771
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,370
You've been distracted after reading the letter.

772
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,930
How could I not have known

773
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:47,040
when I see you like this?

774
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,690
What was said in the letter?

775
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,180
Sun Guo told me

776
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,170
he has a way

777
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,790
to help you recover your immortal dharma-laksana.

778
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,650
I see.

779
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,190
I didn't tell you

780
00:36:58,570 --> 00:36:59,390
because I thought it might be a trap.

781
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:01,530
How can I not go

782
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:02,910
since it's about me?

783
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:03,850
Let's go.
