00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,009
[Episode 2]

4
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,150
You...

5
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,620
Don't come over!

6
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,470
So disgusting.

7
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,310
Stay away from me!

8
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,150
Senior Yinyin, help me!

9
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,300
Senior Yinyin!

10
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,380
You naughty boys.

11
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,110
I just left you alone for several days and you forgot your place.

12
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,100
Go back on the pedestals.

13
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,670
Senior Yinyin, you finally came.

14
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,840
I was so scared just now.

15
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,290
It stinks.

16
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,740
What are those things?

17
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,400
Evil-Repelling Beasts.

18
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,620
They guard the library against intruders.

19
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,010
Wipe your hands.

20
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,950
Thank you.

21
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,870
Have you

22
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,680
collected your wits?

23
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,190
Well,

24
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,610
I was scared out of my crap just now,

25
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,860
but I calmed down once I saw you.

26
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,030
Let's go.

27
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,660
It's so big.

28
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,070
Only the one who wins first place

29
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:05,800
in the Annual Exam can enter the library.

30
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,860
I didn't get a chance to come here

31
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,430
until I reached Taiqing Realm

32
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,070
and finally won first place.

33
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,870
You're so lucky to be allowed

34
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,980
to fetch books here soon after you were admitted into the sect.

35
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,040
But

36
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,590
you have me to thank for that.

37
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,070
When can I finish reading so many books?

38
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,030
Knowledge has no limit but your life has.

39
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,500
Don't be discouraged.

40
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:26,420
Take your time.

41
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,910
Although I recruited you,

42
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,510
you have to study hard.

43
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:31,910
As long as you're not one of the three disciples

44
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,430
who hit the bottom of the next Qingyun List,

45
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,260
I'll forgive you.

46
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,040
What list?

47
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,350
What is Qingyun List?

48
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,590
Qingyun List

49
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,829
is a cultivation ranking

50
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:43,070
updated every month

51
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,710
through voting by all the Xixuan disciples.

52
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,340
You're new here.

53
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,980
It's understandable if you rank low.

54
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,900
These two books are too difficult for you.

55
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:52,910
Let me recommend one to you.

56
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:58,640
Take it.

57
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,230
This book

58
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,120
was compiled by all the sect Hierarchs

59
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,030
and revised after three thousand years.

60
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,380
It contains not only the elaboration of various martial arts,

61
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,800
but also the history of different sects.

62
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,990
It contains everything you need to know about cultivation.

63
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,670
With this book, cultivation will be easy for you.

64
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,110
How do you like it?

65
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,170
Let me see.

66
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:19,459
This is the Book of Cultivation?

67
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,990
I've read it before.

68
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,110
Really?

69
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,540
This is different from the version I read before.

70
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,990
What you read must be a pirate version.

71
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,750
A pirate version?

72
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:35,650
I advise you not to do that.

73
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,710
I once returned the book two days late

74
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,790
and was punished to wash Evil-Repelling Beasts

75
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,750
for a month.

76
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:41,350
Okay.

77
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,510
Can you recommend me

78
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,580
an abstruse book?

79
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,600
Abstruse?

80
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,100
Shangqing Mantra! Come out now!

81
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,590
Are you kidding me?

82
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,910
It's so thin.

83
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,910
I can finish reading it in an hour.

84
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,320
You're so ignorant.

85
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,150
The thinner the book, the harder it is to understand.

86
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,360
Read it carefully after you go back.

87
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,810
Search

88
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,230
every room carefully.

89
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,480
Miss,

90
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,090
all three bodies have been moved out.

91
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,350
We've searched the whole building

92
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,150
but found no one.

93
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,070
Miss,

94
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,890
someone did see Young Master.

95
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,230
Keep looking.

96
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:33,830
Yes.

97
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,840
-Go. -Yes.

98
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,000
Don't leave out

99
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,420
any room

100
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,080
and any corner.

101
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,400
Hurry up.

102
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,670
Yes.

103
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,030
Miss, to be honest,

104
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,909
if Young Master has once been here,

105
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,260
it's unlikely that he's still alive.

106
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,980
I don't believe Feng is gone.

107
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,500
There must be something wrong.

108
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,770
Butler Tong,

109
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,400
you are knowledgeable.

110
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,470
Can you tell me what to do?

111
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,580
If you want to find out the truth,

112
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,400
I'm afraid you'll need the help of the cultivation sects.

113
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,730
I heard that Sun Guo, the Imperial Advisor

114
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,760
can see the past and foresee the future.

115
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,070
If we can get his help,

116
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,860
we may be able to find out what happened.

117
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:29,660
Senior,

118
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,350
that banished god has been taken in by Xixuan Sect.

119
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,780
What are we doing here?

120
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,020
Xixuan Sect can fool those small sects,

121
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:37,990
but they can not fool my compass.

122
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,560
That banished god is still here.

123
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,120
It's him.

124
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,950
It looks like he's been dead for days.

125
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,470
What's the use of finding him?

126
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,490
Although he's dead,

127
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,140
his spirit hasn't dissipated completely.

128
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,020
There's still hope.

129
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,540
[Shangqing Mantra]

130
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,560
Why are the words disappearing?

131
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,150
Wait. Don't disappear.

132
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,920
Please don't disappear.

133
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,510
Yinyin.

134
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:38,790
Yinyin.

135
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,510
What's wrong, Zhen?

136
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,250
Y-You dropped…

137
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,670
I didn't drop anything.

138
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,700
That's not what I mean.

139
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,470
Your ranking on Qingyun List dropped.

140
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,360
What?

141
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,590
The list is out!

142
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,270
Her ranking dropped.

143
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,020
Not on the list again.

144
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,990
Senior Yinyin.

145
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,160
[No.1 Ji Ruochen]

146
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,160
[No.2 Zhang Yinyin]

147
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,280
I brought him back that day

148
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,050
and thought he could grace our sect.

149
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,940
I didn't expect him to be so ungrateful.

150
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,080
He took my Chiying Sword away

151
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:10,950
and surpassed me to top the list.

152
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,240
He's just a banished god.

153
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,830
He can't steal the show in everything.

154
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,270
I hate you, Ji Clerk.

155
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,500
Ji Clerk!

156
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,240
Don't.

157
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,310
Don't disappear.

158
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,550
What was that line?

159
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,480
I worked so hard for so many years to top the list,

160
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,090
but he just arrived and won first place without effort.

161
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,830
I must make him feel ashamed,

162
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,350
rueful, and mortified.

163
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:37,530
It's hard.

164
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,770
Who would give up

165
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,640
the glory he already won?

166
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,270
I'm going to get my Qingmu Sword back.

167
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,090
Although it's not as good as Chiying Sword,

168
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,020
it's sharp enough to teach him a lesson.

169
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:51,670
Yinyin.

170
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,170
Xuanzhen.

171
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:53,480
Wait for me.

172
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:54,600
Senior Yunfeng.

173
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:55,850
Take this.

174
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:56,790
It's good that I ran into you.

175
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,190
This is Ji Ruochen's textbooks and uniform.

176
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,600
Give them to him for me.

177
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:01,950
-Thank you.
-Senior.

178
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,510
why are you in such a hurry?

179
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,550
Did something happen?

180
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,650
Two newbies

181
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,240
came to blows just for a bed.

182
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,510
Both of them were injured.

183
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,410
Gosh.

184
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,390
It's so improper to fight with

185
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,320
one's fellow disciple.

186
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,380
If Master knows about it,

187
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,450
I'm afraid I'll be punished too.

188
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:19,760
Senior!

189
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,020
I told you to practice harder.

190
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,730
Don't spend so much time gardening.

191
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,360
I have no choice.

192
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,310
Coming.

193
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,680
Coming.

194
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,110
Zhang Yinyin, you…

195
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,040
What did you call me?

196
00:09:59,280 --> 00:09:59,940
Senior Yinyin.

197
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,290
That's more like it.

198
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,690
You're a rookie. You can live anywhere.

199
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,690
Why do you have to live somewhere so high?

200
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,100
I'm exhausted from climbing all the way up here.

201
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,150
I'd rather be exhausted every day.

202
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:10,850
Put it on.

203
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,160
I get up at dawn and go to bed at midnight every day.

204
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,300
When Master's Buddha's hand bore fruits,

205
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,260
I didn't sleep for three days and three nights.

206
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,310
Besides,

207
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,800
I also need to collect feces in the toilet and compost them.

208
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,950
Even so,

209
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,560
Master only allows me

210
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,280
to live in a small penthouse.

211
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,350
Senior Yinyin,

212
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,550
we're both disciples of Xixuan Sect,

213
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,470
but look around.

214
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,430
We're treated so differently.

215
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,590
This is not fair.

216
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,150
Senior Yinyin.

217
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,160
Good.

218
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,910
It's time to settle the score with him.

219
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,950
Zhang Yinyin, collect yourself!

220
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,710
Yinyin, are you having a headache?

221
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,830
Like you care!

222
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,660
Listen.

223
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,920
You're in big trouble now.

224
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,670
From now on,

225
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,490
you and I are implacable enemies.

226
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,800
I, Zhang Yinyin, the chief disciple of Taixuan Palace,

227
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,550
issue a challenge to you today.

228
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,140
This challenge concerns the dignity of all Xixuan disciples.

229
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,910
You'd better show me what you've got.

230
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,220
Otherwise, don't blame me for showing no mercy on you.

231
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,900
What are you talking about?

232
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,130
What did I do to offend you?

233
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,580
Stop pretending.

234
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,180
I shouldn't have taken you as a friend.

235
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,000
What do you mean?

236
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,640
Didn't we agree

237
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,990
that I'd be under your wings?

238
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:05,530
I take it back.

239
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,510
You don't need my protection.

240
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:08,710
Yinyin.

241
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:09,950
Ruochen,

242
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,950
I'm Li Xuanzhen, the last disciple of Xuanming Palace.

243
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,110
I'm well-behaved

244
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,230
and thrifty.

245
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,840
I'm social and good at doing chores.

246
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,390
If you want to find

247
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,510
a considerate roommate…

248
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,070
We're leaving.

249
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:19,490
You can...

250
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,340
Ruochen, I also know a little bit about needlework.

251
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,630
Give me a chance!

252
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,720
Zhang Yinyin.

253
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,390
You're so embarrassing.

254
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,150
How?

255
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,870
Gosh.

256
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,500
What did I do to offend her?

257
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,590
There's nothing inside and outside.

258
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,880
Shangqing Mantra.

259
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,670
Senior Yunfeng.

260
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:47,260
Ruochen.

261
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,150
Senior brothers and sisters,

262
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,150
good morning.

263
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,590
Good Morning.

264
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,710
An hour in the morning is worth two in the evening.

265
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,230
Today, the disciples of all eight schools will train together.

266
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,540
Ruochen arrived so early.

267
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,270
His diligence

268
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,700
is quite commendable.

269
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,740
That's right.

270
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,310
Look, what is that?

271
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:02,940
What else can it be?

272
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,170
An early bird.

273
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:07,870
An early bird.

274
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,510
Quiet.

275
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,660
It's getting late. Let's get started.

276
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,290
Let's go.

277
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,070
Where are we going?

278
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,870
To the training ground.

279
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,630
-Yeah, the training ground. -The training ground?

280
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,430
Doesn't he know that?

281
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,310
Isn't this the training ground?

282
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,970
This is not the training ground.

283
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,270
What are you waiting for?

284
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:49,950
Go over there.

285
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,600
Well, I can't do it.

286
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,270
Seriously? You're a banished god,

287
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,790
but you don't know how to cross an iron chain?

288
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,140
Are you pretending?

289
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,620
Do you plan to let Senior Yinyin

290
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,470
carry you over?

291
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,500
Senior brothers,

292
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,490
is there any other way

293
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,390
to reach the training ground?

294
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,370
Of course.

295
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,950
You can fly over there.

296
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,990
Yeah, you can fly.

297
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,870
Fly. Fly.

298
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:18,830
Yeah.

299
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,990
Enough. Let's go.

300
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,220
Let's go.

301
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,580
You can do it.

302
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,410
Senior Yinyin,

303
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,490
I don't know why you suddenly hate me,

304
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:37,960
but at this moment,

305
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,970
you can't leave me behind.

306
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,860
Aren't you a genius in cultivation?

307
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,660
Show us what you've got

308
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,340
so that no one will belittle you again.

309
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:47,220
Fine.

310
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,230
I have no family

311
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,210
in the world anyway.

312
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,750
Nobody cares whether I'll fall and die.

313
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,620
Death is nothing to be afraid of.

314
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,880
I'll just go back to the void I came from.

315
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,350
Don't worry about me.

316
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,550
I won't embarrass you.

317
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,600
Will you try to escape?

318
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,550
Are you kidding me?

319
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,320
You recommended me this cultivation book.

320
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,450
Just give me some time to understand what it says.

321
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,900
I don't think you dare to play tricks.

322
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,250
Why isn't Ji Ruochen here yet?

323
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,200
Did he fall?

324
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,040
Nonsense.

325
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,670
Something like that

326
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,060
wouldn't happen to a banished god.

327
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,740
He must be studying a special method,

328
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,670
so it took him some time.

329
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,320
Just wait for a while.

330
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,240
There's no need to wait for him.

331
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,660
He must be too scared

332
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,810
to come here.

333
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,240
Look.

334
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,870
Isn't that Ji Ruochen?

335
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,520
That banished god doesn't know how to use his sword to fly!

336
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,270
Is he crawling?

337
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,710
He's crawling over?

338
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,230
Yeah. Can he make it?

339
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,670
I'm Zhang Yinyin from Xixuan Sect.

340
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,630
You can't defeat me.

341
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,160
Cultivation has been so hard for me

342
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,850
because of Huanyao Root.

343
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,990
He wouldn't give up easily

344
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,650
just like me back then.

345
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,370
Do you think he can make it here before lunch?

346
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:01,490
I doubt it.

347
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,110
All you know is eating.

348
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,500
Having lunch a little bit late won't make you starve to death.

349
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,750
Do you think today

350
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,160
is just a trial for Ruochen?

351
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,710
This situation

352
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,450
is also a trial for you guys.

353
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,100
Anyone who wants to be achieved in the future

354
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,230
has to go through hardships.

355
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,670
There's no exception

356
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,550
in this world.

357
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,320
Senior Yunfeng!

358
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,880
We didn't drink any water the whole morning.

359
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,230
Aren't you afraid of choking?

360
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,590
He has water!

361
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,870
This is too much, Senior Yunfeng.

362
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,220
That's right. This is too much.

363
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,220
Ji Ruochen,

364
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,590
crawl faster!

365
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,730
Stop dawdling!

366
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,790
Yeah.

367
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,590
We need to have lunch.

368
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,030
Ji Ruochen, hurry up.

369
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,150
We are starving.

370
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,990
Yeah, we're starving.

371
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,390
We're all hungry.

372
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:58,960
Hurry up.

373
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,800
We need to eat. Hurry.

374
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,430
Everyone is waiting for you.

375
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,900
What time is it?

376
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,910
Where is he now?

377
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,510
Is he really a banished god?

378
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,990
I'm dying.

379
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:16,600
Look over there.

380
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,470
Is Ji Ruochen crawling faster?

381
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,070
Ji Ruochen.

382
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,310
You can make it!

383
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,310
Come on!

384
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:36,070
Ruochen, come on!

385
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,110
You can do it.

386
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,670
I believe you can make it.

387
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,540
Hang in there, Ruochen.

388
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,270
Come on!

389
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:40,950
Ruochen, come on.

390
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,900
Come on. We're waiting for you.

391
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,630
Ruochen.

392
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,530
Ruochen, give me your hand.

393
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:46,810
Ruochen,

394
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:47,880
be careful.

395
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,010
Hold my hand.

396
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:50,350
Come.

397
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,070
You're finally here, Ruochen.

398
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,580
Great, Ji Ruochen!

399
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,430
Great!

400
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,390
He made it!

401
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,110
Yes, that's great.

402
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,230
He finally arrived.

403
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:06,590
Come.

404
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,710
Good job, Ji Ruochen.

405
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,460
Well done.

406
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,140
Senior Yinyin,

407
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,420
it took me a long time to get here,

408
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,350
but I didn't embarrass you,

409
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:18,850
did I?

410
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,440
Where are you going?

411
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,910
Can't you say something to encourage me?

412
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,970
I wonder whether we can make it for dinner

413
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,220
if we set off now.

414
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:29,630
Yes, it's time for dinner.

415
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,310
Time for dinner.

416
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,230
Let's go back for dinner.

417
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,110
Let's go.

418
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,880
Ruochen,

419
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,160
I'll wait for you on the other side after having dinner.

420
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,440
S-Sorry.

421
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,720
They all left me behind again.

422
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,560
None of them cares

423
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,750
to carry me over.

424
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,060
This Ji Clerk

425
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,500
occupied my Chiying Sword and took away my Qingyun List.

426
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,870
It's too easy for him to let it go.

427
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:21,880
Rise.

428
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:27,930
Ruochen,

429
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,480
the Grand Five-Element Swordsmanship of our sect

430
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,910
is ruled by the Five Elements of the heaven and earth,

431
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,550
which are mutually reinforced and restricted.

432
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,560
Yin integrates with Yang, with Water and Fire reinforced with each other.

433
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,490
Changes are countless.

434
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,760
Don't be anxious.

435
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,900
You need to be down-to-earth,

436
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,220
and start from the most basic training.

437
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:47,910
Understand?

438
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,330
Understand.

439
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,510
Thank you, Master Jingxiao.

440
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,960
I'll keep that in mind.

441
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,240
Yunfeng.

442
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:54,900
Yes.

443
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,790
You will be needed

444
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,640
to urge Ruochen to process future cultivation.

445
00:22:59,310 --> 00:22:59,640
Yes.

446
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,590
Amazing!

447
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,160
Go on with your cultivation.

448
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,290
It dropped.

449
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,770
It's amazing!

450
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,220
I've never seen any beginner who learns the swordsmanship

451
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,750
can gain such great insight.

452
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,590
You're indeed the chosen one.

453
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,270
Ruochen,

454
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,190
if you train hard,

455
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,560
you will become a great man given some time.

456
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,890
It doesn't make any sense.

457
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,160
A fast learner?

458
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:21,250
Ruochen.

459
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,580
Not bad.

460
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,420
To think, when I first controlled my sword,

461
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,700
I was one year older than you.

462
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,870
So, Ruochen,

463
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,270
you are indeed a once-in-a-millennium talented cultivator.

464
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:37,710
Well,

465
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,620
I started cultivation at the age of 15.

466
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,850
After a decade,

467
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,400
I finally succeeded in having a good command of swordsmanship.

468
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,290
You learned too fast.

469
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:47,760
Master,

470
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,390
to be honest,

471
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,010
I have no idea

472
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,520
how the sword flew.

473
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,060
Well, Ruochen,

474
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,710
why don't you practice the Swordsmanship Mantra again?

475
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,530
I believe, with Master's guidance,

476
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,310
you will make further progress.

477
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,640
I really don't know how to make the sword fly.

478
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:11,890
Come on. You can do it.

479
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:13,270
You can!

480
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:14,960
Just show Master how you do it.

481
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,790
I said I can't.

482
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,710
Amass your Qi into Spirit and turn it into Qi.

483
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,310
I've told you that you could do it.

484
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:50,920
Master, look.

485
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,190
Weird.

486
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,190
I didn't fly it.

487
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,760
Can he really control the sword?

488
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,590
Amazing.

489
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:22,230
Ruochen,

490
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,330
you can take back your sword now.

491
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:25,630
Take it back!

492
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,650
Take it back!

493
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,530
I can't control it!

494
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,170
What's going on?

495
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,260
Did I draw the Connection Talisman wrong?

496
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:45,890
I can't control it!

497
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:46,490
You can do it.

498
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,210
Take it back now!

499
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:57,610
Ji Clerk, you're stupid.

500
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,280
A nemesis.

501
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,530
Where did you get the spirit talisman on the Chiying Sword?

502
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,610
I don't expect that he's practicing secretly.

503
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:30,880
Who is it?

504
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,100
Why are you hiding there?

505
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,150
I heard you cut Sect Leader's treasured gourd into halves

506
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,530
when you used the sword.

507
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,660
It's such a waste

508
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,450
to give you the Chiying Sword.

509
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,890
Someone put a talisman on it.

510
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,540
Stop making any excuses.

511
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,240
You seem to be practicing hard.

512
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,590
Let me see how well you've done.

513
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,680
I'm not ready.

514
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,290
I can't get the key points.

515
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:59,010
I would appreciate your guidance.

516
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,270
Give me the sword.

517
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:03,260
Take it.

518
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,270
What a good sword.

519
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,020
Look carefully.

520
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,450
Such great swordsmanship.

521
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,690
Are you having a relapse of headaches?

522
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,930
You look so pale now.

523
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,390
I wasn't feeling well just now.

524
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,880
I'm fine now.

525
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,820
I'll return it to you.

526
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:44,890
Your hand.

527
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,760
This?

528
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,580
It's just the sword practice.

529
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,730
I'm more worried about your headache.

530
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,990
Don't worry about me, Senior.

531
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,640
Go pick up the sword.

532
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,760
I'll teach you a few more moves.

533
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:56,710
Sure.

534
00:28:59,310 --> 00:28:59,750
Hand.

535
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:00,970
Join the two fingers.

536
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,380
Amass Qi into Spirit.

537
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,310
Do you know the spirit talisman

538
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,790
on the Chiying Sword?

539
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:32,890
Who cares?

540
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,380
At this moment, I just want to practice my swordsmanship,

541
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,510
and keep practicing it.

542
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,270
He is still breathing.

543
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,770
We're protecting his consciousness of god.

544
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,950
We only need to increase some spiritual power.

545
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,640
I have already arranged it.

546
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,750
What we need to do is to keep the banished god alive,

547
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,790
and wait until the fake imposter in Xixuan Sect

548
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,660
shows his true form.

549
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,070
When the god's fury is offended,

550
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,830
Xixuan Sect will be implicated.

551
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,270
Come in.

552
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,360
Sect Leader.

553
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:38,840
Master.

554
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,570
How long have you been in Qingxu?

555
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,230
More than seven years.

556
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:54,490
Seven years.

557
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,620
You're still a low-level disciple.

558
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,090
How long will you spend on cultivation to obtain achievements?

559
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:03,040
I have a crash method.

560
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:03,920
Do you want to learn?

561
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,630
Yes.

562
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:06,490
Go.

563
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,070
Bring it here.

564
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,380
I'll tell you the secret of the precious.

565
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:30,950
Come on!

566
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,320
Master,

567
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,190
it doesn't seem to be an ordinary true spirit.

568
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,670
You dare defy me?

569
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:44,950
I dare not.

570
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,730
Master, I just want to focus on cultivation.

571
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,200
I don't want any crash method.

572
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,210
You released the Great Heavenly Demon without authorization,

573
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:25,870
having committed a serious crime.

574
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,220
You will be banished to the mortal world

575
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,030
and suffer enormous doomed pain.

576
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,280
Turns out you're a cultivator.

577
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,510
Where is this place?

578
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:02,750
Who are you?

579
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,860
Here is Qingxu Sect of Qingcheng Mountain.

580
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,650
I am Xuxuan, Sect Leader.

581
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:09,060
This is my junior, Xuwang.

582
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,390
Qingxu Sect?

583
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,700
Why am I here?

584
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:15,170
You were killed and ended up here.

585
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,180
We saved you.

586
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:19,840
Banished god.

587
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,990
Who are you?

588
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:21,950
What are you up to?

589
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,460
Do you know who I am?

590
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:24,950
Who am I?

591
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,050
Who am I?

592
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,230
You were dying.

593
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,780
My junior and I injected spiritual power into your consciousness of god

594
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,850
at the cost of our cultivation, which makes you survive.

595
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,720
But your divine power and memory

596
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,660
need some time

597
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,030
to recuperate.

598
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:39,770
My divine power.

599
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,780
My divine power.

600
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:44,990
My divine power.

601
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,650
You're an Ultimate Banished God.

602
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,030
Unfortunately, you were assassinated.

603
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:49,760
The imposter took your name

604
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,670
and became the last disciple of Hierarch of Xixuan Sect.

605
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,650
Rob the fat sheep.

606
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,280
Why did he kill me?

607
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,750
The imposter deceived the world,

608
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,510
who is a scheming scumbag

609
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,020
that harms the people.

610
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:07,550
If you are willing,

611
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,600
you can join Qingxu Sect.

612
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,060
Qingxu Sect will help you regain your divine power

613
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,030
to take revenge.

614
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:16,520
Thank you for not abandoning me.

615
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,739
I really appreciate

616
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,659
you two saved me at the cost of the loss of your cultivation.

617
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,820
As a half-way disciple of Qingxu,

618
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:28,090
I will process cultivation in your sect for a period of time.

619
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,699
That's great.

620
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,190
It's a blessing to Qingxu.

621
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:36,320
Senior Xuanzhen,

622
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,290
now that Senior Qiushui you mentioned is so powerful,

623
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,610
is he easy to get along with?

624
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:42,679
Don't worry. My brother is also yours.

625
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,409
What happened to him?

626
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:47,290
Only on Frost's Descent, the important event takes place once in a year.

627
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:48,940
Senior Qiushui.

628
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:50,260
Nice to meet you, Senior Qiushui.

629
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,670
This is Junior Ruochen, the banished god?

630
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,710
I'm Shang Qiushui, a disciple of Taiwei Zhenren of Sikong Palace.

631
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,400
Nice to meet you.

632
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:58,960
Senior Qiushui,

633
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,990
is dignity more important than your life?

634
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,550
No matter how embarrassing it is,

635
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,430
someone has to look out for you by the side.

636
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,230
She's not here yet?

637
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:09,500
She's here.

638
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,850
Why is it so chilly?

639
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,520
It'll be interesting soon.

640
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,540
Who is she?

641
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:26,110
Why is the chill so strong?

642
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:28,950
She is the sole last disciple of the Hierarch of Zi Wei,

643
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,070
Ji Bingxian, Senior Ji.

644
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,590
Since Hierarch was in seclusion,

645
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,990
on this day of Frost's Descent every year,

646
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,720
Senior Qiushui has promised to challenge her in a round.

647
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,720
Unfortunately, he never won.

648
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,900
You don't want to know he was beaten badly every time.

649
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,700
Then why did he come?

650
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,920
What is love in the world?

651
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:48,430
It only teaches people not to care about death.

652
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:50,860
Senior Bingxian.

653
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,690
I would like to learn from you.

654
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:58,400
Please.

655
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,500
Come. Come here.

656
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,560
I think, in this situation,

657
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,110
Senior Qiushui won't be at a disadvantage.

658
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:21,070
Senior Qiushui and I cultivated Taiqing Spiritual Saint Mantra

659
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,270
for seven months.

660
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,350
Senior Ji, only for three months.

661
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,220
Think about it yourself.

662
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,250
That's amazing!

663
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,630
Senior Qiushui!

664
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,120
Senior Qiushui!

665
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,250
-Qiushui! -Get up. Come on.

666
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,670
The older you are,

667
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:57,740
the grumpier you are.

668
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:06,660
I don't know

669
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,410
when I will see you again.

670
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,340
Will you keep your appointment next year?

671
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:29,650
Yes.

672
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:31,730
In my opinion,

673
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,990
Senior Ji has improved a lot this time.

674
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,230
If you keep your appointment next year,

675
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,620
the matter is whether you can save your life or not.

676
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,980
It looks like the Annual Exam this year

677
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,360
will stir up a bloody storm again.

678
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,030
The Annual Exam?

679
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,220
What's the Annual Exam?

680
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,240
What is the Annual Exam?

681
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,820
It is the final exam at the end of the year of the sect.

682
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,290
I don't want to participate anyway.

683
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,630
I don't know whether there's a way I can escape.

684
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,920
Is there a way?

685
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:58,940
I'd like to, too.

686
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:00,510
Stop kidding.

687
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,250
How can you escape?

688
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,570
You are now the last disciple of Sect Leader.

689
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,640
You're the hope of Xixuan Sect.

690
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:07,530
I dare say that everyone in the mountains

691
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,210
is waiting for your performance.

692
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,760
If you don't rank the top

693
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:13,420
in the Annual Exam,

694
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,720
who would believe you are the banished god?

695
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:20,060
Although I am,

696
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:23,120
I fell from the Heaven.

697
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,010
Since I have fallen,

698
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,250
it must be different from the real gods.

699
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,840
Besides, I just became a disciple.

700
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,310
I haven't figured out Shangqing Mantra yet.

701
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,270
If I should compete with others

702
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,990
and I'm supposed to obtain a good place,

703
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,360
doesn't that go too far?

704
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:39,690
That makes sense.

705
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,870
But you are a banished god.

706
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,880
You must prove yourself to everyone.

707
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,820
How about this? I'll show you a good idea.

708
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:49,970
Okay.

709
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:51,120
Come here.

710
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,120
You should make a mistake,

711
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:55,460
as Yinyin did, who was punished to introspect herself in Tianxin Cave.

712
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,360
Yinyin was in Tianxin Cave?

713
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,290
Don't you know?

714
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:01,630
Hierarch has found out that

715
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:02,870
it's she who put a spirit talisman in your Chiying Sword.

716
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,640
I must have had too much porridge and steamed corn bread.

717
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,700
Why am I hallucinating?

718
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:16,590
Dao produces One; One produces Two; Two produces Three;

719
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:19,900
Three produces all things; the two modes produce the four images;

720
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,520
the four images produce the eight trigrams;

721
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:22,970
the eight trigrams produce...

722
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,430
produce...

723
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:26,790
sliced beef in hot chili oil,

724
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,290
West Lake fish in vinegar gravy,

725
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:29,760
and tofu crab roe soup.
