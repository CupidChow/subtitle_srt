[Divine Destiny]

3
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,020
[Episode 33]

4
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:39,910
So finally,

5
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,210
we meet.

6
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,259
So, who on earth are you?

7
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,220
Me?

8
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,140
I was a heavenly monster

9
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,390
in the wilderness of the God Realm.

10
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,580
I fled to the mortal world

11
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,270
and created the Endless Sea here.

12
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,100
It's been ten million years.

13
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,510
The Endless Sea is vast and boring.

14
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,390
Even you can't leave the bodhi tree.

15
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,070
And these Honghuang Guards

16
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,800
are just illusions

17
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,020
created by your power.

18
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,790
The truth is,

19
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,640
you're the only one guarding the Endless Sea

20
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,450
and keeping secrets that you don't want others to know, right?

21
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,420
Why am I alone?

22
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,140
Master Iceberg lives at the Sky Mending Cliff of the Endless Sea.

23
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,190
Demon King, didn't you go to see her just now?

24
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:54,020
Yes. After I went to see her,

25
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,190
I found out all your secrets.

26
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,780
I know why you lent the Sky Mending Cliff

27
00:02:58,810 --> 00:02:59,800
to Master Iceberg.

28
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,030
After I returned to the Monster Forbidden Zone,

29
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,560
I found out

30
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,110
Master Iceberg

31
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,110
has earned so many people's tears.

32
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,920
And the tears have all flowed into the Endless Sea.

33
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,490
The sea water is actually the tears of so many lovers.

34
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,550
It contains the purest thoughts of love in the mortal world.

35
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,920
That's why the Endless Sea

36
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,450
has the strongest power in the world.

37
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,980
So only it

38
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,280
can suppress the Demon Tower for ten million years.

39
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,780
Since you've figured out the secret of the Endless Sea,

40
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,870
do you still want to dry up the sea?

41
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,450
I don't have a benevolent heart like you.

42
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:54,140
Since you've been here for ten million years

43
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,460
and wanted to suppress the Demon Tower,

44
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,200
that means you've figured it out.

45
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,710
So

46
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,450
you must have been involved

47
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,130
in planning my life

48
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:13,790
from the Nine Hells to the mortal world and Xixuan,

49
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,160
apart from Zhang Wancai, Jin Hua, and Hierarch Ziwei, right?

50
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,140
Yes.

51
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,830
I asked the Double Saints to take you out of the border.

52
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,240
I also gave you

53
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,170
the Book of Immortality Cultivation when you were young.

54
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,050
I was sure

55
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,310
the banished god would rest at Longmen Inn.

56
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,100
It was also an appointment between me and Ziwei

57
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,210
to let you join Xixuan in the name of a banished god.

58
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,580
Everything you did

59
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,310
is just to send me back to the Nine Hells

60
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,250
and destroy the Demon Tower.

61
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,450
It's just that

62
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,390
you didn't expect

63
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,260
after I went back to the Nine Hells,

64
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,610
I would become like this

65
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,010
and return to the mortal world, right?

66
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,290
The Nine Hells is at a place of space-time dislocation.

67
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,110
I can't figure it out.

68
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,560
Still, it was out of my control.

69
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,400
I just didn't expect

70
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,960
you would come to me so soon.

71
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,890
Since we know each other's background,

72
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,940
will you retreat or fight with me?

73
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,680
If I retreat,

74
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,000
my ten-million-year efforts

75
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,090
will be meaningless.

76
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,250
Besides, I'm a heavenly monster.

77
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,560
If I do my best,

78
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,720
you may not be able to defeat me.

79
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,070
Uncle. I'm with you.

80
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,000
Mr. Ji. Sorry.

81
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,520
He really wants to destroy the Endless Sea.

82
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:28,540
No.

83
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:29,710
No.

84
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,409
Uncle.

85
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,150
Uncle.

86
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,600
Even if you don't retreat,

87
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,770
they will still die in my hands.

88
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,210
And they'll be tortured by the blue flames.

89
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,530
As their master,

90
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,500
why won't you help them?

91
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,620
Qingyi, stop.

92
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,130
Uncle.

93
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,159
Uncle, we can't retreat.

94
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,170
I, Ling, and Honghuang Guards,

95
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,020
we can't retreat.

96
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,140
No matter what decision Master makes,

97
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,350
Ling trusts Master.

98
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,620
Master, we can't retreat.

99
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,020
Master, if the Endless Sea is destroyed,

100
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,180
where can we survive?

101
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,460
Master, we can't retreat.

102
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,180
Uncle.

103
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,450
Master, we can't retreat.

104
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,180
Uncle, we can't retreat.

105
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,410
Stop!

106
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,990
How could you be so cruel?

107
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,730
Ji Ruochen.

108
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,520
Did you really dry up the Endless Sea?

109
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,490
Ling.

110
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,550
Sorry.

111
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,620
I'm sorry.

112
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,330
I'm sorry.

113
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,280
I'm sorry.

114
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,890
I think I understand

115
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,960
love in the mortal world.

116
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,260
But it's too late.

117
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,800
Mr. Ji,

118
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,610
please

119
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,600
take good care of Yinyin.

120
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,520
Please.

121
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,580
Ling.

122
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,210
Ling.

123
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,640
Ling. Ling. Ling.

124
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,500
Ling. Ling.

125
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,820
Ling.

126
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,220
Ling.

127
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:11,740
Yinyin.

128
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,920
Yin... Yinyin.

129
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,320
Ruochen.

130
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,010
Yinyin.

131
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,820
Do you remember me?

132
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,130
It's because of me.

133
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,460
Because of me,

134
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,770
the Endless Sea was dried up,

135
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,820
and Ling turned into ashes.

136
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,000
Why me?

137
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,000
Although you look the same,

138
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,160
I think

139
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,340
you're no longer the Ji Ruochen I love.

140
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,320
I feel like we are strangers.

141
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:25,180
Yinyin, I'm Ji Ruochen.

142
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,500
I'm sorry.

143
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,350
The Endless Sea became like this

144
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:41,790
because of me.

145
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,140
It's fate. I don't blame you.

146
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,240
I don't know how to redeem it.

147
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,630
And I'm too ashamed to face you.

148
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,410
I'm sorry.

149
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:05,920
Yinyin.

150
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,980
The birth of the Demon Tower can't be stopped.

151
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,460
I hope that when the Three Realms are destroyed,

152
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,220
you won't regret it.

153
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,720
The thing I regret the most

154
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,340
is letting Yinyin go to the Monster Forbidden Zone

155
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,170
to get Nuwa's tear to restore my cultivation.

156
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,860
I made her suffer.

157
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,420
Priests.

158
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,640
What are your plans for the future?

159
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,220
Master.

160
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,490
The two of us

161
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,000
have always focused on making weapons.

162
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,820
Now that the warehouse of the Endless Sea has been destroyed,

163
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,900
we can't continue to improve the Universal Cannon.

164
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,190
We heard that there are many treasures in the South Sea.

165
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,530
So we've decided to go south.

166
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:58,670
From now on,

167
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,720
we can't always stay by your side.

168
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,880
Please forgive us.

169
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,610
Go.

170
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,250
People must have something they desire

171
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,980
in life.

172
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,040
Master.

173
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,120
Go.

174
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,090
See you.

175
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,140
See you.

176
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,440
Let's go.

177
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,130
Uncle.

178
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,290
Why didn't I disappear with Ling and the others?

179
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,440
Qingyi, you were created with the blood of the ancient Monster King.

180
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:49,900
You are his last descendant

181
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,920
in the world.

182
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,010
Even if I disappear,

183
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,660
you won't disappear.

184
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,160
The last descendant?

185
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,050
I know you're mad at me.

186
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,240
But I had no other way.

187
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,610
That was my only choice.

188
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,470
You know I would be angry.

189
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,030
Why did you have to do that?

190
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,220
What do you mean by saying there was no other way?

191
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,080
Explain to me.

192
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,560
Why did you have to destroy the Endless Sea?

193
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,450
Even if I didn't destroy the Endless Sea,

194
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,680
soon,

195
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,130
the Demon Tower will destroy it too.

196
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,220
It's only a matter of time.

197
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,260
No one knows about the future.

198
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,600
Why was it you who destroyed it?

199
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,870
Why did you let those Honghuang Guards and Ling

200
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,260
die in front of me?

201
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:47,990
Why?

202
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:53,880
No reasons.

203
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,410
I don't know how to explain it to you.

204
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,330
Yinyin,

205
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,580
will you trust me again?

206
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,440
Just like you trusted me when I destroyed the spiritual caves.

207
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:09,990
Trust you?

208
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,400
But you were Ji Ruochen

209
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,490
who would protect the people.

210
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,450
But now?

211
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,750
You're the Demon King who kills people without blinking.

212
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,540
How can I trust you?

213
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,950
The Endless Sea has been destroyed.

214
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,190
The Three Realms will be in chaos.

215
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,970
And the people will be in misery.

216
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,720
Are you happy now?

217
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,890
The Three Realms?

218
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,780
The Three Realms again.

219
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,000
Why do you all want me to care about the Three Realms?

220
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,710
My life has been arranged since I was born.

221
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,550
Cultivation, eliminating demons, and destroying spiritual caves.

222
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,110
I was in danger so many times.

223
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,550
Who saved me?

224
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,560
At the Nine Hells,

225
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,210
if my father

226
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,560
hadn't sealed his spirit in the throne

227
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,850
and guided me to become the Demon King,

228
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,859
we would have died at the Nine Hells long ago.

229
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,170
Even if I destroy the tower and die,

230
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:17,380
my name is the only thing that will be left.

231
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,520
Only you, Yinyin.

232
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,060
You don't care about my fake identity.

233
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:27,160
In order not to make me become a loser,

234
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,410
you used something as precious as your life

235
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,640
to trade with them.

236
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,670
I can also destroy the world for you.

237
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,770
What did I do wrong?

238
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,690
Don't make excuses.

239
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,690
You didn't do it for me.

240
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,330
You just want to take advantage of the chaos

241
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,970
to become the ruler of the Three Realms.

242
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,380
Am I this kind of person

243
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,200
in your eyes?

244
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,110
If I knew you would become like this,

245
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,130
I would rather not regain my memory.

246
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,270
No.

247
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,100
I'd rather I never met you.

248
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,790
From now on,

249
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,900
we have nothing to do with each other.

250
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,620
You can't leave.

251
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,780
We can't break up.

252
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:13,820
Ji...

253
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,920
Ji Ruochen.

254
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,450
Ji Ruochen.

255
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,580
What did I do?

256
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,010
See?

257
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,580
You're no longer the Ji Ruochen I knew.

258
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,500
The Ji Ruochen I knew

259
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,460
would never do this to me.

260
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:05,930
Yinyin.

261
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,620
Yinyin.

262
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,730
It seems that you are quite gifted

263
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,020
in practicing the Bowing and Nodding Technique.

264
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,080
But you lack the desire to kill.

265
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,490
Without the desire to kill,

266
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,580
you can never master

267
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,050
the Bowing and Nodding Technique.

268
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,010
I'm not you.

269
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,260
If it requires me to kill multiple people

270
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,540
to master this stupid technique,

271
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,030
I'd rather be a loser.

272
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,920
You ungrateful little loser!

273
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,350
You can't regret.

274
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,070
Let go.

275
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,130
These disciples of Xixuan.

276
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,580
Ziyang clearly warned them not to come here.

277
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,080
But she is still trespassing.

278
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,400
Today, I'll make this a one-way trip to her.

279
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,410
Is it Senior Bingxian or Qiushui?

280
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,960
I won't let you hurt them.

281
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,140
It's too late.

282
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,350
Xuanzhen.

283
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:35,790
Xuanzhen.

284
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:36,940
Pretty.

285
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:37,710
Who?

286
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:48,770
Since she's a beauty,

287
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,510
I'll spare her life.

288
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,270
Let her accompany me.

289
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,140
What are you doing?

290
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,000
Let her go!

291
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,130
You loser!

292
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:58,050
How dare you yell at me?

293
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,740
I remember she's your senior.

294
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,460
You want her?

295
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,790
Sure.

296
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,840
As long as you can defeat me with your skills.

297
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:11,370
Otherwise,

298
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,700
you'll call her Madam.

299
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,800
Don't push me.

300
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,280
Don't touch her!

301
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:25,460
Loser!

302
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,170
You can't even hit me like this.

303
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:28,620
Look at you.

304
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,360
Don't tell anyone you are my disciple.

305
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,940
I don't want to be laughed at.

306
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,820
If I were this beauty,

307
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,340
I wouldn't like a coward like you.

308
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:44,740
Stop!

309
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:51,870
Senior.

310
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,260
Senior.

311
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:56,610
You...

312
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,430
How did you get hurt so badly?

313
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,480
Who told you to be soft-hearted?

314
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,670
Just one last step is needed.

315
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,370
You need to kill to master the Bowing and Nodding Technique.

316
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,770
I don't want to learn it.

317
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,020
I don't want to be a monster like you.

318
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,530
You've learned it.

319
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,780
The last move of the Bowing and Nodding Technique

320
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,630
is to let go of hatred.

321
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:36,710
Come, help me go into the cave to take a rest.

322
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:42,910
Wait for me.

323
00:23:59,180 --> 00:23:59,740
Are you okay?

324
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:01,430
Come on.

325
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:03,170
Be careful.

326
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,160
How are you?

327
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,100
What are you doing?

328
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,240
Are you crazy?

329
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,580
You'll die without the true spirit.

330
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:15,810
Back then, in order to expel Wangchen from Xixuan Mountains,

331
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,190
we were both injured.

332
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,230
I lost all my cultivation.

333
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,940
That's why I practiced the Bowing and Nodding Technique.

334
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,410
When I fought with him again that time,

335
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,230
I was still careless

336
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,640
and was seriously injured.

337
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:32,210
Fine.

338
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,580
Since this is fate,

339
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:35,960
I won't force it.

340
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:37,780
I accept it even if I'll die.

341
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:40,300
Junior Master Yuxuan.

342
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,480
Maybe she can save you.

343
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,650
Forget it.

344
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,490
I think the Danyuan Palace

345
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,530
is the most useless in Xixuan Sect.

346
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,660
They can't even cure your wound caused by the divine flames.

347
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,760
If I count on her,

348
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,420
I may have to prepare a coffin for myself very early.

349
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,200
Li Xuanzhen.

350
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:03,690
From now on, the forbidden area will be yours.

351
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,660
Li Xuanzhen, you have to understand that

352
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,530
there are many skeletons in the closet.

353
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,930
Someone has to deal with them.

354
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:32,390
Actually, the forbidden area is not that bad.

355
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:36,120
It's just that there is no one talking with you.

356
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,420
But I've lived a comfortable and free life.

357
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,970
Unlike Ziyang and the others,

358
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,880
in order to keep the sect's reputation,

359
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,530
they can't do anything.

360
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:47,990
Boring.

361
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:53,410
You'll understand sooner or later.

362
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:02,180
Xuanzhen, I'm going to leave.

363
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:07,050
You should at least call me Master.

364
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,020
Master.

365
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,500
I'm kowtowing to you.

366
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:37,770
Spineless.

367
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,600
I asked you to call me, but I didn't ask you to kneel.

368
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,540
Remember.

369
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:49,740
As the master of the forbidden area, you don't even need to kneel before the hierarch.

370
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,680
I don't need this anymore.

371
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:00,340
Xuanzhen. It's up to you.

372
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:02,750
I'm leaving.

373
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,460
I want to enjoy the beautiful scenery of Xixuan Mountains

374
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,780
before I die.

375
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,220
Where is Xuanzhen?

376
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,260
If you don't release him,

377
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,540
I won't leave today.

378
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:36,930
Senior Bingxian.

379
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,600
I've mastered Xixuan's secret technique.

380
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,850
I've decided to guard the forbidden area.

381
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,930
Don't worry about me anymore.

382
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,360
Did he force you?

383
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,960
-I will beg... -I did it willingly.

384
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,950
I can never raise my head in Xixuan Mountains.

385
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:03,500
I feel more at ease in the forbidden area.

386
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,290
Now Xixuan has been severely damaged.

387
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:12,700
The future depends on you.

388
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,500
But don't worry.

389
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:18,040
I will protect Xixuan secretly.

390
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:20,190
-Xuanzhen.
-Senior Bingxian.

391
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:23,780
Please leave.

392
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:35,650
In the annual exam of Xixuan Sect,

393
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:40,500
Ji Bingxian from the Changyang Palace vs. Li Xuanzhen from the Xuanming Palace.

394
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:44,100
I can't believe this.

395
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,900
I won't fight that iceberg.

396
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,370
I want to live a few more years.

397
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,040
Cover me.

398
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:49,840
Cover me a little.

399
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,600
Bing... Senior Bingxian.

400
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,450
Senior.

401
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,800
Wait for me to come back.

402
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,200
You shouldn't be such heartless, Xuanzhen.

403
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,080
You shouldn't be.

404
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,420
What is going on?

405
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,120
Calm down.

406
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,580
We'll know.

407
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,090
Senior.

408
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,540
I can't believe the master of the Endless Sea

409
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,460
was defeated by the Demon King.

410
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:09,240
Ruochen.

411
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:10,390
Ruochen?

412
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:11,480
Really?

413
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,080
Looks like the Endless Sea

414
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:21,460
can't suppress the Demon Tower anymore.

415
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,740
That monster has been there

416
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,260
for ten million years.

417
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,410
Why did he retreat at this time?

418
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,480
After you go to Xixuan Mountains,

419
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,510
I'll be your senior.

420
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:54,450
You'll be my junior.

421
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,590
You have to listen to me no matter what I say.

422
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:57,390
Understand?

423
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,270
Yes.

424
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,830
I'll listen to whatever you say.

425
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,440
Look. What is that?

426
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,590
What else could it be?

427
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,830
A stupid bird.

428
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:08,740
We had a deal.

429
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,260
We'll compete using our real skills.

430
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,510
Don't break your promise.

431
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,280
Since you asked me to do my best,

432
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,470
I will do my best.

433
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,820
Do you dare to do that again?

434
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:21,730
No.

435
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:25,540
-Really?
-Really.

436
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,430
You said you would listen to whatever I say.

437
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,180
If I knew this would happen,

438
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,470
I shouldn't have taken you to Xixuan Mountains.

439
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,480
Yinyin.

440
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,370
Yinyin.

441
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,140
Why are you back alone?

442
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,170
Where is Ruochen?

443
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,130
Yinyin.

444
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,610
Was it really Ruochen who dried up the Endless Sea?

445
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,350
Stand up.

446
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,560
Why are you doing this?

447
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,630
Hierarch.

448
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:19,580
The Endless Sea was dried up because of me.

449
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,490
Yinyin, don't talk nonsense.

450
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,650
Although you've practiced the secret technique of Heavenly Fox,

451
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,960
with your power,

452
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,480
you're no match for the master of the Endless Sea.

453
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:31,490
That's right, Yinyin.

454
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:32,920
What happened?

455
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,490
Ruochen learned from Master Iceberg that

456
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,620
as long as the Endless Sea is destroyed,

457
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:42,280
Nuwa's tear will have nothing to rely on, and the amnesia will be cured.

458
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,870
In order to make me remember again,

459
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:46,910
he destroyed the Endless Sea.

460
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,990
Hierarch, it was all because of me.

461
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:57,370
The Blue Fire of the Nine Hells really captured his mind.

462
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,010
If we had known this,

463
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,510
we should have kept him here

464
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,270
when he came to save Xixuan last time,

465
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,370
lest people say

466
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,840
Xixuan cultivated a demon who will destroy the world.

467
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:10,280
Easier said than done.

468
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:11,940
Who can keep him?

469
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,150
After Xixuan was surrounded that day,

470
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,430
Ruochen had a private talk with Hierarch.

471
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,370
Didn't he

472
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,400
give a sign?

473
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:27,930
He said

474
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:32,060
he has paid off Xixuan's kindness to him,

475
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,780
and we would go our separate ways in the future.

476
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,400
Yinyin.

477
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,560
He came to save Xixuan for you.

478
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:44,020
And he dried up the Endless Sea for you.

479
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,450
Then you and he...

480
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:53,700
I have nothing to do with him anymore.

481
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:58,550
He dried up the Endless Sea in front of me.

482
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,360
The Honghuang Guards and Ling who saved my life

483
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,470
turned into ashes.

484
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:08,100
He's so bloodthirsty and cruel.

485
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,060
He is no longer

486
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,510
the Ji Ruochen I knew.

487
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:20,100
Yinyin, you had a tough trip. You must be tired.

488
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,590
Go back and take a rest.

489
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,920
Hierarch. Excuse me.

490
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:34,290
Will Ruochen come to Xixuan and ask for her?

491
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,090
What should we do then?

492
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,219
Back then,

493
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,600
he killed Bamboo Snake and destroyed the spiritual caves.

494
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:48,860
I really thought he was the one who will face the calamity.

495
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,820
But unexpectedly,

496
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:55,630
Senior and I were wrong about him.

497
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,550
Now he has dried up the Endless Sea

498
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:02,950
to help the Demon Tower be born,

499
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,830
in order to destroy the mortal world and the Three Realms

500
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,510
to become the ruler of the Three Realms.

501
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,530
Even Yinyin is disappointed in him.

502
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,170
Then we don't need to

503
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,940
have faith in him either.

504
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,900
If he comes,

505
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:22,860
there will be no other way.

506
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:27,720
Senior. We taught him.

507
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:31,440
Can you do it?

508
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:34,490
Even the master of the Endless Sea is no match for him.

509
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,770
Even if we fight together,

510
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:37,770
we might not be able to defeat him.

511
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,190
Then put up a desperate fight.

512
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,970
Did someone bully you?

513
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,140
Tell me.

514
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,880
Let me see who dares to bully my disciple.

515
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:55,670
Well.

516
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,400
With your personality,

517
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,660
no one can bully you.

518
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,530
If you were not bullied,

519
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:06,200
someone must have broken your heart.

520
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:07,440
Right?

521
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:12,780
You remember?

522
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:17,620
Master.

523
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,800
He has changed.

524
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,600
Tell me.

525
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,430
Back then in Xixuan Mountains...

526
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,830
When I created the Endless Sea,

527
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,320
I knew it would be destroyed someday.

528
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,790
Ling and the Honghuang Guards

529
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,250
are destined to end up like this.

530
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,300
I can only blame myself

531
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:53,140
for not thinking it through.

532
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:01,090
Uncle, where should we go?

533
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:06,830
Back then, I left the monster clan and created the Endless Sea

534
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:10,060
for eternal peace in this world.

535
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,360
Now that the Endless Sea has been destroyed,

536
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,550
I can only risk my life to protect the Three Realms.

537
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,200
Qingyi, your bloodline is different from mine.

538
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,190
Even if you leave me,

539
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:24,120
you can still live well.

540
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:26,120
From now on,

541
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,340
go live the life

542
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:30,930
you want.

543
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,430
No.

544
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,800
Uncle, I'm not going anywhere.

545
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,880
I'll go wherever you go.

546
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,330
Uncle, are you waiting for someone?

547
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,430
That's what happened.

548
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,230
Master.

549
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,220
Can the blue flames really change someone?

550
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,000
When you were young,

551
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,120
I put the Huanyao Root in you.

552
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,870
Then you became my disciple and learned monster arts.

553
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,330
I didn't see any change in your state of mind.

554
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,680
So you mean

555
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,760
there's something I don't know?
