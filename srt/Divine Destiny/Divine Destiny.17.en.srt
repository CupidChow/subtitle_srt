00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,660
Ruochen.

5
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:02,770
Ruochen.

6
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:04,850
Ruochen, what's wrong?

7
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:35,560
Ruochen.

8
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,320
Let go!

9
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,070
Let go!

10
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,750
Ruochen.

11
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,030
Ji Clerk.

12
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,800
I'm Zhang Yinyin.

13
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,310
Ji Clerk.

14
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,020
Wake up!

15
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,680
Wake up.

16
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:19,930
Ruochen.

17
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:20,910
Ruochen.

18
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,430
Ruochen.

19
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:22,520
How are you?

20
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,650
Don't make me worried, Ruochen.

21
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,780
How are you?

22
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,450
Senior.

23
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,800
What happened to Ruochen just now?

24
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,659
He has never been like this before.

25
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,159
What is the blue true spirit?

26
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,909
Xixuan Sect doesn't have such techniques.

27
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:40,460
I'm afraid it's not an ordinary  technique.

28
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,760
Then what is it?

29
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:44,990
Was it because of the Ecstasy Needle?

30
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,820
Yes. Or no.

31
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,870
Yinyin.

32
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,070
No matter what,

33
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,659
we can't let Ruochen know what happened tonight.

34
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:56,290
Understand?

35
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,159
Yes.

36
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,130
We're the only ones

37
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,310
he can rely on now.

38
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:02,720
Don't worry.

39
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,740
We'll find a way together.

40
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,610
Ruochen will be fine.

41
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,470
Feng, it's really you.

42
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,020
Why are you here?

43
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,820
Are you here for me?

44
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:48,040
Did you find traces of Ji Ruochen?

45
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,740
So you're here for him.

46
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,100
We didn't find anything.

47
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,409
However,

48
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,970
he was shot by the Ecstasy Needle I made with divine power.

49
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,120
He has lost his mind.

50
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,130
He won't go far.

51
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,540
Why did you deliberately set a trap

52
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,230
to kill him?

53
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,920
Did Sun Guo ask you to do that?

54
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,730
Because he killed you

55
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,760
outside the city back then.

56
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,360
Because he stole your identity as a banished god.

57
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:16,610
Feng,

58
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,140
I want to avenge you.

59
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,460
This is between me and him.

60
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,680
I'll put an end to it myself.

61
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,920
You should stay out of this.

62
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:22,920
No.

63
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,340
I must let him die in front of me,

64
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:26,800
so that it will

65
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,780
be equal to

66
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,350
my sacrifice all these years.

67
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,580
If it weren't for him,

68
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,940
I wouldn't have ended up in Haofang.

69
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,770
And I wouldn't have been with Li An.

70
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,450
I taught you immortal arts,

71
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,550
because I wanted you to learn to protect yourself,

72
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,070
not to become a toy.

73
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,040
I don't want you to end up like me,

74
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,170
deeply troubled by love and hate

75
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,270
and unable to escape.

76
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,140
I want to help you.

77
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,400
Xixuan Sect is hypocritical

78
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,250
and helped Ji Ruochen bully you.

79
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,450
It doesn't deserve the title of the number one sect in the world.

80
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,810
If Qingxu Sect can replace it,

81
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,040
all sects

82
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,000
will be at your command.

83
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,170
-By that time, I…
-Do you really want to help me?

84
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,090
Or do you want to use the power of Qingxu Sect and me

85
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,870
to fulfill your desires?

86
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,040
Feng.

87
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,570
You don't trust me?

88
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,760
After I kill Ji Ruochen,

89
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,120
you should go back and be your Crown Princess.

90
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,650
Don't be troubled by love or hate in this mortal world.

91
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,990
But you are troubled

92
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,690
more deeply than me.

93
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,940
With your current power,

94
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,360
can you really kill Ji Ruochen?

95
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:46,460
Feng.

96
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:48,940
Luo Feng!

97
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,450
Ruochen.

98
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:01,500
Ruochen.

99
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:02,290
Hurry.

100
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,010
The first elixir

101
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,370
Get up.

102
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,150
has finally been completed.

103
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:06,590
Here.

104
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:08,920
I made it just now.

105
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:13,820
Senior.

106
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,820
Why do I think this medicine

107
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,200
smells differently

108
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,110
from the medicine made by Master?

109
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,140
Of course.

110
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:23,550
The formula is different.

111
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:24,620
Besides,

112
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,970
I made this with my own furnace.

113
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,700
It's obviously not as good as Master's Golden Elixir Furnace.

114
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,549
I think it smells not bad.

115
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,690
Eat it.

116
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:37,140
It took Senior Yunfeng

117
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:37,880
two days and two nights to make this.

118
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,020
How does it taste?

119
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,310
Senior.

120
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,020
I also learned elixir making techniques.

121
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,350
I still don't think the taste is right.

122
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,520
Why?

123
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,570
Normally,

124
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,140
this medicine should be made

125
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,290
in a furnace.

126
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,470
Why does this pill

127
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,790
have a foul smell?

128
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:25,540
It smells like

129
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,860
mouse droppings.

130
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:32,980
Oh no.

131
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,790
It's the trogopterus dung.

132
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,970
After I took it back from the mountain,

133
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,440
I forgot to dry it and fry it.

134
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:41,900
Please forgive me.

135
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,700
I'll make another one.

136
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,210
I'm going to make another one.

137
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,330
What is the trogopterus dung?

138
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,290
The trogopterus dung

139
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,120
is the droppings

140
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,150
of mountain rats

141
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,280
that can fly.

142
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,490
So you were right.

143
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,950
Will you get poisoned after eating it?

144
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,250
No.

145
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,900
But it might cause complications

146
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,370
if it's efficacy is not strong enough.

147
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,280
It will make my illness worse.

148
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,390
You'd better spit it out now.

149
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,480
Spit it all out.

150
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,600
How are you feeling?

151
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,110
Is the elixir ready?

152
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,130
Mr. Ji, you're here.

153
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,190
What happened to your neck?

154
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,480
Mr. Ji, that night...

155
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,790
Thank you for your warning.

156
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:55,770
Mr. Ji.

157
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,670
Do you know anything

158
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,090
about what's inside Ruochen?

159
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,280
I don't know anything more than you do.

160
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,140
This time, Ji Ruochen

161
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,480
will face a great calamity.

162
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:05,990
However,

163
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,550
he is very lucky

164
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,860
to have a senior like you.

165
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,940
Mr. Ji. That day...

166
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,550
Did he eat the elixir?

167
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,220
Yes.

168
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,560
It's just I used a wrong ingredient.

169
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,490
It doesn't matter.

170
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:21,880
You continue.

171
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:22,890
I'm going in to check on him.

172
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,570
Senior.

173
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,570
Senior.

174
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,050
Yinyin.

175
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:25,910
What happened?

176
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,210
Ruochen lost his mind again.

177
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,730
It's fine.

178
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,160
Let me take a look inside.

179
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,540
Zekai.

180
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,140
It's good that you came back safely this time.

181
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,850
I've asked Taixuan and Taiwei

182
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,760
to go to the capital

183
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,710
to save those imprisoned disciples.

184
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,390
Don't worry.

185
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,210
Sun Guo plotted against Xixuan this time.

186
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,890
I won't let it go.

187
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,420
Once the time is right,

188
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,950
I will avenge you.

189
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,000
Thank you, Master.

190
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,980
Did you see Yinyin and Ruochen?

191
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,300
Yes.

192
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,400
They fought their way to the dungeon

193
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,240
and saved me.

194
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,390
If it weren't for them,

195
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,040
I wouldn't be standing here today.

196
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,330
That's great.

197
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,110
You stay here for several days

198
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,290
to recover your body.

199
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,200
Thank you, Master.

200
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,120
How are you, Ruochen?

201
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,550
I feel much better.

202
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,990
It's done.

203
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,020
It's done.

204
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,050
Ruochen. Ruochen.

205
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,400
Today, you have a new piece of elixir to eat.

206
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,100
Here.

207
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,230
Eat.

208
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,110
What's that smell outside?

209
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,510
I am making

210
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,990
sophora flower pancakes on the stove

211
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,150
for Ruochen and you.

212
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,550
It smells so good.

213
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,140
Do you want some?

214
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,700
Senior, let me help you.

215
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,720
Okay, let's go.

216
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,580
I'll be waiting for you.

217
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,750
Mr. Ji.

218
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,140
To be honest,

219
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,520
I feel that Senior Yunfeng's medicine

220
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,550
is not very effective.

221
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,460
Do you have a better way?

222
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,230
If Yunfeng's elixir doesn't work,

223
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,190
there's another way.

224
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,110
What is it?

225
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,890
Yourself.

226
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,100
Myself?

227
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,790
What kind of method is this?

228
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,160
Do you remember the calamity

229
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,570
I told you a few days ago?

230
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,270
The God's will

231
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,950
keeps changing.

232
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,350
Doing things as we wish

233
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,960
is the way to solve the problem.

234
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,600
Maybe

235
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,500
the solution

236
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,980
is up to you.

237
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,100
I'm going to eat pancakes.

238
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,000
Why am I here again?

239
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,540
Maybe the solution to this problem

240
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,400
is up to me.

241
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,310
No matter what you are,

242
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,010
I'll give it a try.

243
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,550
Why are you here?

244
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,510
I heard that

245
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,000
you broke into the jail in the capital to save people

246
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:15,980
and were badly injured.

247
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,270
And Zhenwu Temple is tracking you down.

248
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:20,520
I didn't thank you

249
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,619
for saving me last time in Luoran School.

250
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,410
I'm sorry you had a wasted journey this time.

251
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,099
As you can see,

252
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,520
they tried to murder me.

253
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:29,880
But they failed.

254
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,580
If my guess is right,

255
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,690
this is the Ecstasy Needle of Zhenwu Temple, right?

256
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
I didn't expect that

257
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,080
Yinfeng has a little sister either.

258
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,130
Her name is Luo Xichen.

259
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,710
She's now a disciple of Zhenwu Temple.

260
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,070
All these years,

261
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,170
she has been looking for a chance to avenge her brother.

262
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,480
I was too careless.

263
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,980
I fell into her trap.

264
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,170
The blue flame that appeared when you used your power

265
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,890
doesn't look like Xixuan Sect's techniques.

266
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:57,700
Where did you learn it?

267
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,830
I don't know.

268
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,540
I think I've had it since I was born.

269
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,340
I used to use it on the inn's guests.

270
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,990
But I don't know how to use it.

271
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,420
Now it seems

272
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,550
very mysterious.

273
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,030
Demon.

274
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,040
He is a demon.

275
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,110
Ji Ruochen is a demon.

276
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,310
I saw it with my own eyes.

277
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,590
He has the energy of the Nine Hells.

278
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,350
Ji Ruochen must be a demon.

279
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,200
Qing, you must trust me.

280
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,560
I see.

281
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,820
Do you know this technique?

282
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,020
Why are you crying?

283
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,840
I don't know it.

284
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:47,930
I was just asking.

285
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,880
Since you're fine,

286
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,190
I should go.

287
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,760
I still want to ask

288
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,500
why you chose Zhang Yinyin

289
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,860
instead of me.

290
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,630
I don't know.

291
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,000
I just want no one else

292
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:17,860
except her.

293
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:25,760
Ruochen.

294
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,020
Take care.

295
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:53,730
Come out.

296
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,370
Are you satisfied now?

297
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,850
You should know

298
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,860
what is in his body.

299
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,180
According to the Book of Heaven,

300
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,370
that is the demon flame

301
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,620
left in the mortal world by the Demon Lord in ancient times.

302
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,900
If it keeps growing,

303
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,900
it can destroy the world.

304
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,820
It's a demonic object

305
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,580
that should be eliminated by everyone in the Three Realms.

306
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,540
Since it's a demonic object,

307
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,650
it's not tolerated by God's will.

308
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,220
God's will?

309
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,080
You value God's will so much.

310
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,840
But have you really understood it?

311
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:36,600
Let me ask you.

312
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,070
I just saw that on the Ecstasy Needle,

313
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,660
besides the demon flame,

314
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,860
there was still divine power left.

315
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,480
Did you do that?

316
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,460
Luo Xichen, a disciple of Zhenwu Temple

317
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,730
and the current Crown Princess,

318
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,600
is my cousin in this life

319
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,990
in the mortal world.

320
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,360
I gave her a volume of the Book of Heaven

321
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:56,250
to make us

322
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,800
even.

323
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,750
How could he be a demon?

324
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,400
Qing.

325
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,290
The flame

326
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,050
can bewitch people.

327
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,260
Even a deity will lose his mind

328
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,840
if he touches it,

329
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,770
not to mention Ji Ruochen.

330
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,920
If he's not a demon,

331
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,170
why did he kill me outside the city?

332
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,290
And why did he steal my identity as a banished god

333
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:26,510
to bewitch people?

334
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,370
Qing.

335
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,310
Since you've known this,

336
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,500
you should eliminate the flame with me.

337
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,150
Otherwise,

338
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,200
when he really turns into a demon,

339
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,930
it'll be too late.

340
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,390
I can't do it.

341
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,870
But we are gods.

342
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,910
You can ignore our 100-lifetime promise.

343
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,250
But you have the responsibility

344
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,780
to follow God's will with me.

345
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:57,660
Ji Ruochen

346
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,730
teamed up with the Nine Hells and gave up himself.

347
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:01,710
Gods and demons are different.

348
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,780
How can you let him go?

349
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,470
But even if he is a demon,

350
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,530
he was the one I loved.

351
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,260
Qing,

352
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,680
why are you so muddle-headed?

353
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,610
You should know

354
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,770
he is a demon.

355
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,090
We are gods.

356
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,460
Gods and demons are irreconcilable.

357
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,130
Either he dies

358
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:27,760
or I die.

359
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,630
You have chosen to abandon God's will.

360
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,400
I will uphold it.

361
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,310
Yinfeng.

362
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,630
Am I really wrong?

363
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,430
What is supposed to happen will happen sooner or later.

364
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:27,610
Yinfeng,

365
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,220
it's time for us to put an end to it.

366
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:54,820
Today,

367
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:56,920
it's not about our grudges.

368
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,430
It's only about God's will.

369
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,830
There is karma in the vast universe.

370
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,070
Ji Ruochen.

371
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,030
Killing you is an act of justice.

372
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,880
It may sound a bit harsh.

373
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,310
But I don't want you to die without knowing why.

374
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,940
What a joke.

375
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,630
What did I do wrong?

376
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,510
Who are you to convict me?

377
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,060
You're just here to avenge yourself.

378
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,070
Why did you make such an excuse?

379
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,130
Don't you think it's tiring?

380
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,340
Do you know

381
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,560
what is burning in your hands?

382
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,470
Tell me.

383
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:40,940
This is the Blue Fire of the Nine Hells.

384
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:42,810
It's from the Nine Hells.

385
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,760
I don't care where it comes from,

386
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,050
as long as it's easy-to-use.

387
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,740
You are so arrogant.

388
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,690
Let's make a deal.

389
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,860
If I win,

390
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,080
you'll die without anything to regret.

391
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,720
If you lose,

392
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,370
I hope you can rest in peace.

393
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:30,090
Ji Ruochen,

394
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,080
take this and die.

395
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:13,240
Knock on the fat sheep.

396
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,970
So much

397
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:06,860
for so-called divine power.

398
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,900
You're dying.

399
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,720
Do you know why?

400
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,870
If I had known you gods were like this,

401
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,610
I shouldn't have stolen your identity.

402
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,070
Listen carefully.

403
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,320
The blue fire you have

404
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,510
is called the Blue Fire of the Nine Hells.

405
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,380
It's the demon flame

406
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,560
left in the mortal world by the Demon King in ancient times.

407
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:36,150
It can destroy the world and kill all living things,

408
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,310
so that there will be no light in the Three Realms.

409
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,390
You were born

410
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,050
with the demon flame.

411
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,270
If you're not a demon,

412
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:47,910
what else could you be?

413
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,100
What's with that look?

414
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,000
Even if others have never told you,

415
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,380
don't you know that?

416
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,700
You are a demon.

417
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,750
You're a demon that everyone should kill.

418
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:18,120
So, you have a name.

419
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,100
The Blue Fire of the Nine Hells.

420
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,990
But why me?

421
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:23,710
An orphan

422
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,050
and a clerk of an inn.

423
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,540
Everyone says I'm the one who will face the calamity.

424
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:32,280
It's my responsibility to save the Three Realms.

425
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,650
But why am I a demon?

426
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,340
The so-called demon

427
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,070
is just like this.

428
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,300
It's not too late to know this now.

429
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:15,770
At least you know I didn't wrong you.

430
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,020
I know.

431
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,230
It's justice.

432
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:23,780
That's right.

433
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:28,170
You are a deity, and I am a demon.

434
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,140
It's natural for you to kill me.

435
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,030
But that's just your idea.

436
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,940
What is immortality? What is a demon? What is God's will?

437
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,930
How can you decide them alone?

438
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,250
It's what the people say.

439
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,650
Am I one of the people?

440
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,140
The so-called people you mentioned

441
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,590
are just

442
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,110
sheep without a shepherd.

443
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,060
Fine.

444
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,730
At this moment,

445
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:02,880
no one will plead guilty after all.

446
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:04,570
Ji Ruochen.

447
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,370
Arguing about this with you

448
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,840
is a waste of time.

449
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,580
You can use whatever techniques

450
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:10,800
you've learned.

451
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,770
I'm giving you a chance.

452
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:17,590
Okay.

453
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:20,500
Let me see

454
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,550
how powerful this demon is.

455
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,980
The smallest may hold the largest.

456
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,740
The Heaven and the Earth can be moved.

457
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:14,760
As expected,

458
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:16,980
a demon is a demon.

459
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:18,830
My name is Ji

460
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,000
Clerk.

461
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,220
Back then outside the city,

462
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,390
if you had destroyed my body,

463
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:29,620
now

464
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,930
you wouldn't have suffered so much.

465
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,340
This time,

466
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,530
don't be merciful.

467
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:58,710
What?

468
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,740
You remember the sand and wind in the desert?

469
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:04,360
You remember what you did?

470
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:26,940
Leave.

471
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,710
I'm going to spare you

472
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,400
from this stick.

473
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,570
I'm surprised that you still have a sense of shame.

474
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:36,750
From now on,

475
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:40,320
there are no grudges between us.

476
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,490
We are even.

477
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,550
Is this what a banished god does?

478
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,030
I let you go.

479
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,900
But you attacked me behind my back.

480
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,460
You forgot to clear

481
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,469
the divine power on the Ecstasy Needle.

482
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,770
Otherwise, I wouldn't have had the chance

483
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,330
to use it

484
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,130
to disturb your demonic energy.

485
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:18,719
But your behavior

486
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,620
is really nasty.

487
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:22,409
Nasty?

488
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,239
I'm a deity.

489
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,520
It's my duty to kill demons.

490
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,719
Methods don't matter.

491
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:36,920
It's useless.

492
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:39,780
The divine power has disturbed your soul and spirit.

493
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,520
You can no longer summon the demon flame.

494
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,570
Everything has its rules.

495
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:45,909
What goes around comes around.

496
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,210
Ji Ruochen.

497
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:48,449
Just die.
