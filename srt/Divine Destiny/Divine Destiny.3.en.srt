00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:39,570
The two modes produce the four images.

5
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,250
The four images produce the eight trigrams.

6
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,729
The eight trigrams produce...

7
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,170
produce...

8
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,539
sliced beef in hot chili oil.

9
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,979
West Lake fish in vinegar gravy.

10
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,539
Tofu crab roe soup.

11
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,240
What are you looking at?

12
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,510
Are you stunned?

13
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,620
Why are you here?

14
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,340
You are receiving punishment here because of me.

15
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,280
Do you think I can feel at ease?

16
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,430
You must be starving.

17
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,380
Here.

18
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,330
Xixuan's rules are really strict.

19
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,579
The punishment is too heavy.

20
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,840
It's not your fault.

21
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,970
I'll just think of it as cultivation in seclusion.

22
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,100
Don't hide anything from me anymore.

23
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,410
Senior Qiushui made these for you.

24
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,630
They are your favorites.

25
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,220
After I eat them,

26
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,530
I'll reluctantly forgive you.

27
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,740
-Eat slowly.
-So delicious.

28
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,940
Tofu, this is my favorite.

29
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,340
Your mouth...

30
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,840
You eat. I'll go find something.

31
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:47,790
What are you looking for?

32
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:50,500
I'm looking for a treasure painting.

33
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:51,630
A treasure painting?

34
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,200
Yes.

35
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,680
According to Senior Xuanzhen,

36
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,220
there is a painting of the secret techniques of the eight schools.

37
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,670
It can help me pass the Annual Exam.

38
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,820
I want to see where it is.

39
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,480
That painting.

40
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,210
Stop looking for it.

41
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,970
It's over there.

42
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:01,250
Over there.

43
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,240
What is this?

44
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,480
A treasure painting.

45
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,370
It's a masterpiece drew by Xuanzhen last year.

46
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,010
I think I won't pass the Annual Exam this year.

47
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,020
Since you didn't let me down,

48
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,550
I'll tell you this.

49
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,210
The painting is about the unique skills of Zhenren of the eight schools.

50
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,710
Ziyun Zhenren

51
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,620
is the best at making pills

52
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,610
and moral swordsmanship.

53
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,020
Taiwei Zhenren is the best at the tactical deployment of troops.

54
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,110
Yuxuan Zhenren is the best

55
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,980
at inner cultivation methods.

56
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,260
She is also a healer.

57
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,740
You can go to her if you're hurt.

58
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:42,480
Of course,

59
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,410
my father's Grand Five-Element Swordsmanship

60
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,540
is the most powerful.

61
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,780
And...

62
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,540
Stop.

63
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,079
You're so sincere to help me.

64
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,820
Aren't you afraid that I'll get the first place in the Annual Exam

65
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,020
and steal the limelight?

66
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,620
The stronger you become,

67
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,810
the fairer and squarer I win.

68
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,380
And it will be more interesting.

69
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,340
Do you remember

70
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,130
what I just told you?

71
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,800
Then do you know among Zhenren of the eight schools,

72
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,060
who look down on each other,

73
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,290
who are jealous of each other,

74
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,620
and who are friends to each other?

75
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,130
I don't know.

76
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,780
According to you,

77
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,180
there is still hope, right?

78
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:11,800
Listen.

79
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,050
Taiwei Zhenren

80
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,850
hates Ziyun Zhenren the most.

81
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,660
They are always against each other.

82
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,620
They intrigue against each other.

83
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,459
They are jealous of each other.

84
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:18,459
And they compete for everything.

85
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,610
In the eyes of Ziyang Zhenren,

86
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,140
Taiwei Zhenren and Yuxuan Zhenren...

87
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,270
Finally I'm done talking.

88
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,930
I don't have to worry about the Annual Exam anymore.

89
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,480
What are these?

90
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,550
Tianxin Cave was formed by fluorite rocks.

91
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,830
There are plenty of fluorites.

92
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,410
As long as we power the true spirit,

93
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,420
it can illuminate the cave.

94
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,470
Very beautiful.

95
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:09,840
Really?

96
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,130
It's so beautiful.

97
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,400
Hold me tight.

98
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,600
This place is so beautiful.

99
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,300
It's like

100
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,740
the starry sky in the desert.

101
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,100
You lived in a desert when you were young?

102
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:57,700
Yes.

103
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,550
I am an orphan.

104
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,560
Back then,

105
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,300
I was wandering outside.

106
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,570
I was almost eaten by a group of wild wolves.

107
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,220
Fortunately, Boss saved me.

108
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,740
Then I became a clerk.

109
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,170
Until I met you.

110
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,640
Were they good to you?

111
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,560
Although they often scolded and beat me,

112
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:20,690
they

113
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,710
treated me like their own child.

114
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,230
They taught me to read, write,

115
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,430
and knock sheep.

116
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,780
I don't know

117
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,340
how they are doing now.

118
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,850
I don't know whether they are alive or dead.

119
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,550
I miss them so much.

120
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,450
Don't be too sad.

121
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,510
Didn't I just teach you the secret techniques of the eight schools?

122
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,380
As long as you get good results

123
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,159
in the Annual Exam,

124
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,830
I think they will be happy for you.

125
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,400
Thank you.

126
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:51,960
You're so nice.

127
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,690
This guy is so shameless.

128
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,430
You are pushing your luck.

129
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,890
Let me see what you want to do.

130
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,090
Right.

131
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,650
Tell Shui

132
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,420
that he needs to put more crab roe

133
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,480
in the tofu crab roe soup.

134
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,350
And the tofu was too soft.

135
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,300
It was hard for me to pick it up.

136
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,260
And when I leave this cave,

137
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,350
you must be here for me together.

138
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,280
Has Ruochen made any progress in cultivation recently?

139
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:44,990
Master.

140
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,350
In the past 15 days,

141
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,900
Ruochen seems to have known the temperament of Zhenrens.

142
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,040
He learned how to deal with different sects.

143
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,370
He also obtained secret books of Zhenrens

144
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,960
and got many weapons.

145
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,260
His cultivation has improved a lot.

146
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,680
It looks like he is smart.

147
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,080
He's so impatient.

148
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,470
He must be preparing for the Annual Exam.

149
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,890
All disciples of Xixuan Mountains

150
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,530
are waiting to see what this banished god is capable of.

151
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,890
It's understandable that he's impatient.

152
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:17,850
Yes.

153
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,090
His ability is not good enough.

154
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,830
Many people here

155
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,240
are talking gossip.

156
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,720
If he can't get good results in the Annual Exam,

157
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,270
I'm afraid it'll be hard to shut their mouths.

158
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,400
Morning, Ruochen.

159
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,780
Senior Qiushui, morning.

160
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:45,230
Morning.

161
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,590
You lazy bug.

162
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,740
Put on your clothes.

163
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:53,930
Have you forgotten

164
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,520
our senior will leave Tianxin Cave today?

165
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,610
I forgot.

166
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,240
Wait for me.

167
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,290
He is dilatory.

168
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:07,730
Ji.

169
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,720
Yuxuan Zhenren of the Danyuan Palace wants to see you.

170
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,890
The Danyuan Palace?

171
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,860
Sorry.

172
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,520
I have other things to do today.

173
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,240
Can I take a rain check?

174
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,600
Before I came here, Master repeatedly told me

175
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,910
I had to take you there.

176
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,750
Please don't refuse,

177
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,010
so that I won't fail Master.

178
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,250
I'll go with you.

179
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,200
Please.

180
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,520
We are going to pick up Senior Yinyin.

181
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:41,600
[Danyuan Palace]

182
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,200
Master Yuxuan.

183
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,750
Master told me

184
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,700
that the unique inner cultivation methods of the Danyuan Palace

185
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,970
are the most effective in recuperating the true spirit.

186
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,950
I hope you can teach me

187
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,410
so that I can improve as soon as possible.

188
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,160
I asked you here today

189
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,070
to explain the Eight Elements Manual to you.

190
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,550
This is the key to learning the inner cultivation methods.

191
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,590
You must learn it carefully.

192
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,120
Thank you, Master.

193
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,090
Hanyan.

194
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,030
This is my disciple, Hanyan.

195
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,660
Today, you'll study the manual with her.

196
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,060
Ruochen. I'm Hanyan, a disciple of the Danyuan Palace.

197
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,030
Senior Hanyan, don't stand on ceremony.

198
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,410
Take Ruochen to the Sutra Pavilion.

199
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,400
I'll be right there.

200
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:19,760
Yes, Master.

201
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:21,970
Please come with me.

202
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,240
The schools are competing.

203
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,430
It's not up to you with the Fantasy Incense.

204
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,900
Yinyin. Senior Yinyin.

205
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,280
Why are you two here?

206
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,940
It's time.

207
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,790
Have you forgotten?

208
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,980
Senior Qiushui and I are here to take you out of the cave.

209
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,410
Right.

210
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,020
I forgot.

211
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,200
-Zhen. You're finally here.
-Yinyin.

212
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,000
Come on.

213
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,620
You haven't visited me for days.

214
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:43,910
Shui is nice.

215
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,450
You made so many delicious dishes for me.

216
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:45,880
Look.

217
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,900
My belly is bulging.

218
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,640
Yes.

219
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,070
Where is Ji Clerk? Why didn't he come?

220
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,660
He was called away by the Danyuan Palace

221
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,930
early in the morning.

222
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:58,980
He hasn't come back yet.

223
00:11:59,010 --> 00:11:59,800
The Danyuan Palace?

224
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,270
Why?

225
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,160
He knows I'll leave Tianxin Cave today.

226
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,130
Besides, the Danyuan Palace only has female disciples.

227
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,460
Why did they ask him to go there?

228
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,730
He asked me to tell you something before we came.

229
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,400
-What?
-Let's go.

230
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,190
We are supposed to go to the Sutra Pavilion.

231
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,060
This place is isolated.

232
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,680
What exactly does the Danyuan Palace

233
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,180
want to do?

234
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,590
Snake!

235
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,480
Senior Hanyan.

236
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,020
Did you mistake grass leaves for snakes?

237
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,740
There are no snakes here.

238
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,110
Let's just go.

239
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,660
Otherwise, Master Yuxuan will be angry.

240
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,650
You were lying.

241
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,880
I think you know

242
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,630
whether I lied to you or not.

243
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,990
I'm here for the inner cultivation methods.

244
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,290
Look at us now.

245
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,580
We are holding each other.

246
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,390
It's inappropriate.

247
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,390
Ruochen, it hurts so much.

248
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,570
It really hurts.

249
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,660
It hurts!

250
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,730
It hurts!

251
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,360
Help me.

252
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:23,740
Are you okay?

253
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:30,730
I wanted to help you.

254
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,360
Why did you do that?

255
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,210
Ruochen.

256
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,360
You can't wrong a good person.

257
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,730
When did I ever hurt you?

258
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,770
Since the first time I met you,

259
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,270
I've fallen for you.

260
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,220
Why would I hurt you?

261
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,870
But I don't understand

262
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,570
why you refused me.

263
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,670
Is it because

264
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,250
I'm not good-looking?

265
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,080
Why can't I understand that?

266
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,340
I'll teach you later.

267
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:28,930
Okay.

268
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,530
After today's cultivation,

269
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,410
I'll visit you.

270
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:33,880
OK.

271
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,170
Let's go.

272
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,360
No!

273
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,950
Help! Help!

274
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,520
Let's go.

275
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,780
-Senior, help me!
-How dare you!

276
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:44,770
How dare you do such an immoral thing

277
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,030
in broad daylight?

278
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,760
Senior, help!

279
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:49,740
Ziyang.

280
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:52,700
Don't be afraid.

281
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,020
Master will seek justice for you.

282
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,490
All right, take a rest.

283
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,540
Master.

284
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,120
Junior.

285
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,130
Senior.

286
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,460
I wanted to teach him

287
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,340
the secret inner cultivation methods of the Danyuan Palace.

288
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,700
I didn't expect Ji Ruochen

289
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,330
took the chance to molest my disciple.

290
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,670
As the acting hierarch, you should give me an explanation.

291
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,340
Please calm down.

292
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,760
Ruochen, what happened?

293
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,200
Master, the road is dangerous.

294
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,610
Senior Hanyan accidentally fell.

295
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,980
I just went to help her.

296
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,450
But she...

297
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,070
Don't cry. Hanyan.

298
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,020
I wanted to take the main road.

299
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:33,650
But...

300
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,550
But he insisted on

301
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,990
taking that less-traveled road.

302
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,150
Then...

303
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,750
Then he...

304
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,060
You...

305
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,270
Ji Ruochen. You dare not admit what you did.

306
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,350
Is this what your master taught you?

307
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,140
We don't know the truth yet.

308
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,140
What she said is unfair.

309
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,900
Ruochen, now tell us

310
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,020
what happened today,

311
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,900
so that Master can seek justice for you.

312
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:56,420
Okay.

313
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,410
I wanted to take the less-traveled road.

314
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,370
I just wanted to go on a date with someone.

315
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,310
What did I do wrong?

316
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,300
It's good that you admit it.

317
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,440
Ruochen.

318
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,560
At your age,

319
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,440
it's normal for you to think about love.

320
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,620
Considering what you did to Hanyan,

321
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:19,850
you have to marry her so that they won't gossip.

322
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,330
Master Yuxuan.

323
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,190
The person I wanted to go on a date with

324
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,530
is not Senior Hanyan.

325
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,480
Why should I marry her?

326
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,800
The person I was waiting for is my lover.

327
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:38,150
Then who is your lover?

328
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,680
She...

329
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,860
Ji Clerk.

330
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,010
Senior, what are you doing?

331
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,630
Yinyin. Senior Yinyin.

332
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,370
Stop running.

333
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,540
Why are you beating us too?

334
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,770
Senior. Senior.

335
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:53,690
Stop running.

336
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:57,510
Get out of my way.

337
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,030
Senior, stop!

338
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,980
Help!

339
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,240
You are smart.

340
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:05,130
Yinyin.

341
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,710
Don't chase them.

342
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:07,960
It's done.

343
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,310
Done? What do you mean?

344
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:13,420
How come young people nowadays

345
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,050
are frivolous in love?

346
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,339
That's the end of it.

347
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:21,690
Don't mention it again.

348
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:24,890
We're leaving?

349
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,780
She just left like this?

350
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,020
It looks like nothing happened between Ji and Hanyan.

351
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:29,730
Forget it.

352
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,620
Ji Ruochen!

353
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,710
Ji Ruochen, come out!

354
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,580
Ji Clerk, come out!

355
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,870
Ji Clerk, what are you doing?

356
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:44,990
Senior,

357
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,090
don't you think you overacted?

358
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,560
I just asked you to save me.

359
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,210
I didn't ask you to beat me.

360
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,230
How dare you say that?

361
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,340
On my way here,

362
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,380
I heard from people of the Danyuan Palace

363
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,520
that you secretly dated Hanyan.

364
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,820
In the name of the inn's boss

365
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,120
and boss lady,

366
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,270
I really didn't.

367
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,680
They drugged me.

368
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,350
I just feel uncomfortable.

369
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,180
I feel

370
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,680
uncomfortable.

371
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,930
They drugged you?

372
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:14,900
Let me see.

373
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,470
Let me see if you're okay.

374
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,650
Why is your face so hot?

375
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,310
What are you doing?

376
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,650
I really want to kiss you.

377
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:27,830
How dare you!

378
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,140
Ji... Ji Clerk.

379
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:46,770
I dare not.

380
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:49,940
You are bad.

381
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,220
Why are you always flirtatious?

382
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,610
What are you doing?

383
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,810
Let go of me!

384
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:56,790
No.

385
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,260
You'll hit me again if I let you go.

386
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,080
I won't.

387
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,740
Since you won't hit me,

388
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,830
let me hold you a little longer.

389
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,550
Since you took me to Xixuan,

390
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,340
I've dreamed of you every night.

391
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,790
I think of you day and night.

392
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,270
I...

393
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,010
It's been a long time

394
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,540
since there were lovebirds here.

395
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,030
Finally, I saw a pair today.

396
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,810
Are you crazy?

397
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:26,930
You're so ugly.

398
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,300
You are definitely not one of Xixuan's members.

399
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:32,290
Let's go.

400
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,080
Aren't you a banished god?

401
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,410
It's embarrassing that you are running away.

402
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,180
Are you okay?

403
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,090
Are you okay?

404
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,080
I'm fine.

405
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:08,990
Get up.

406
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:13,930
Be careful.

407
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,790
Why is there

408
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,290
a bronze tripod here?

409
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,470
Could this be Xixuan's secret technique?

410
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,640
Ji Clerk.

411
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,380
Clerk.

412
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,220
Dissociation Mantra.

413
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,090
Sink your breath to the lower belly.

414
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,980
Fortunately, I read the Shangqing Mantra

415
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,720
so that I can memorize whatever I see.

416
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,150
I didn't expect

417
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,130
to use it here.

418
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,010
Clerk.

419
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,220
Clerk. Be careful.

420
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:11,530
Clerk.

421
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,630
Clerk.

422
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:13,730
Clerk. Are you OK?

423
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:14,930
Clerk.

424
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,930
Clerk, wake up!

425
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,440
Clerk!

426
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,640
Ji Ruochen, you're finally awake.

427
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,100
Master.

428
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,730
His injury is temporarily under control.

429
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,500
But he still needs several months to recover with the help of medicine.

430
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,440
Ruochen.

431
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,310
You are very lucky

432
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,530
that it didn't kill you.

433
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,910
Be careful.

434
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,470
Master, I'm sorry

435
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,480
for making you worried.

436
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,030
Ruochen.

437
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,370
The demons you saw

438
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,550
have black cloaks and disfigured faces, right?

439
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,020
How did you know?

440
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,410
That faceless man

441
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,150
is my junior.

442
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,370
His name is Shen Boyang.

443
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:17,340
He was a rare martial arts genius.

444
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,830
But due to the death of Yu Chan,

445
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,610
his lover,

446
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,560
he went off the deep end during cultivation

447
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,440
and ended up like this.

448
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,020
His existence

449
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,240
is a secret of Xixuan Sect.

450
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,800
So from now on,

451
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,280
don't tell anyone about this.

452
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,270
Master, in the mountain...

453
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,050
I know.

454
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,140
Yinyin told me everything.

455
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,140
I didn't expect him

456
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,610
to destroy the sect's important weapon.

457
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,630
He is really unreasonable.

458
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,480
Ruochen,

459
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,510
have a good rest.

460
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,980
Don't tell anyone about what happened today.

461
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,090
Yes, Master.

462
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,020
You told Master

463
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:13,530
the bronze tripod was destroyed by the faceless man?

464
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,370
Do you want me to tell him you destroyed it?

465
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,170
Don't.

466
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,020
I don't want any more trouble.

467
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,590
What are you looking at?

468
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,850
I saw it in the cave that day.

469
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,130
What did you learn

470
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,520
through the tripod?

471
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,050
Well...

472
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,750
I don't know.

473
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,310
I just read the mantra in the illusion.

474
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,920
And my true spirit got more powerful.

475
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,090
Are you a genius immortality cultivator they mentioned?

476
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,340
Just by reading some mantras,

477
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,370
you can improve your true spirit.

478
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,670
Unlike me.

479
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,710
It's useless no matter how hard I try.

480
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,510
And I have the Huanyao Root in my body.

481
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,190
Are you thinking about your headache disease?

482
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,870
Maybe it can be cured.

483
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,080
What are you doing?

484
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,690
I'm giving you my power.

485
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,300
You are so unhappy.

486
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,160
What's the use of keeping it?

487
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,180
What are you talking about?

488
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,350
Didn't you say

489
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,850
you are mine?

490
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,960
Then what's the difference between yours and mine?

491
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,630
You are right.

492
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,500
You are really nice to me.

493
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,080
Don't move.

494
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:36,210
Let me feed you.

495
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,150
It's hot.

496
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,050
Try again. Is it still hot?

497
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:23,750
No.

498
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,590
And it's very sweet.

499
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,020
This is a blessing in disguise.

500
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:32,800
Did you hurt your brain?

501
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,080
You almost died.

502
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:34,960
What kind of blessing is it?

503
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:35,750
Drink it.

504
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,090
Is the medicine sweet?

505
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:45,760
Yes.

506
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,420
Why haven't I drunk sweet medicine before?

507
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:49,760
You don't need it.

508
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,510
Senior.

509
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,620
I heard that Ji Ruochen

510
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,000
was in trouble in the back mountain.

511
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,150
Don't you know?

512
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,670
Ruochen is a banished god.

513
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,210
Don't worry.

514
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:03,910
He's fine now.

515
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,220
A banished god?

516
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,060
When he came here, he was chosen by the magical stone.

517
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:12,040
The Psychic Mirror illuminated.

518
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:15,230
That's why we accepted him as a banished god.

519
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,520
Someone in Xixuan Sect has suspected his identity long ago.

520
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,210
Can't you tell?

521
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,810
He had been in the mortal world for too long.

522
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,460
He just started cultivation.

523
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,430
Of course it will take some time.

524
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,980
In the long history of Xixuan Sect,

525
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,920
there were people ascending too.

526
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,980
All of them were better than ordinary disciples.

527
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,760
I don't know anyone

528
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,900
as ordinary as Ji Ruochen.

529
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,380
Taiwei.

530
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,120
The banished god is the last disciple

531
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,930
selected by the hierarch.

532
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,900
What are you still suspecting?

533
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,900
Don't pressure me with the hierarch.

534
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,850
Since you said he just started cultivation,

535
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,610
I'll give him some more time.

536
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,070
In the Annual Exam,

537
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,700
if he still can't prove his strength,

538
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,740
he must be a fake banished god.

539
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,210
Senior.

540
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,920
I'm afraid by that time, I won't need to do anything,

541
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:26,110
because Zhenren of all schools will punish him severely.

542
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,070
Ji Ruochen is getting more arrogant.

543
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,070
Let's teach him a lesson.

544
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:39,060
Ming Xin and Ming Yun.

545
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,160
Nice to meet you.

546
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:43,280
Ruochen.

547
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,940
You went to the Taixuan Palace

548
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,280
for the Grand Five-Element Swordsmanship.

549
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,520
But now you're in the Xuanming Palace.

550
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:50,680
Junior.

551
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,310
I hate to say this,

552
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,240
but you are ungrateful.

553
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:55,810
You are not loyal.

554
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,210
I heard

555
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,500
you said the Moral Swordsmanship of the Xuanming Palace

556
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,190
is the best in the world.

557
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:02,580
Does that mean

558
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,660
the Grand Five-Element Swordsmanship of the Taixuan Palace

559
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,050
is not as good as the Moral Swordsmanship?

560
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,390
I never said that.

561
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,710
I have other things to do.

562
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:11,990
Let's talk another day.

563
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:12,990
Wait.

564
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:15,010
Let's have a competition.

565
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,790
Let me show you

566
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,630
what the Grand Five-Element Swordsmanship really is.

567
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,510
Junior.

568
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,530
Just admit defeat.

569
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,040
You're being very polite

570
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,260
to kneel.

571
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,320
They are having a conflict.

572
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,290
You're so weak.

573
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,620
How about this?

574
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,960
Apologize to me in front of everyone.

575
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,500
And I won't make things difficult for you.

576
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:48,250
People say dogs don't bite when they bark.

577
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,440
Why are you two barking so fiercely?

578
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,120
Ji Ruochen.

579
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,480
You asked for it.

580
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,540
Senior.

581
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:02,640
Are you okay?

582
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,140
I'm fine.

583
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,800
Senior, get out of my way.

584
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,070
It is none of your business.

585
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,380
Ming Xin.

586
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,800
This is the Xuanming Palace.

587
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:12,020
Ruochen is practicing the Moral Swordsmanship.

588
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:12,970
Of course it is my business.

589
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,220
Besides,

590
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,920
your master Jingxiao Zhenren

591
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,550
was once defeated

592
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:19,030
by my master, Taiwei Zhenren.

593
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,640
As disciples of the Taixuan Palace,

594
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,190
it's fine that you are not ambitious.

595
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,450
But you want to hurt people in the Xuanming Palace.

596
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:27,840
Why?

597
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:30,990
Ji Ruochen.

598
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,460
You're lucky today.

599
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,640
Let's wait and see.

600
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:35,880
Goodbye.

601
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,350
Let's go.

602
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:39,800
Ruochen.

603
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,320
Is your hand all right?

604
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,010
I'm fine.

605
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:46,830
Why didn't you

606
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,790
draw your sword?

607
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:51,860
We are fellow disciples.

608
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,660
If we fight against each other,

609
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,470
how do we face each other in the future?

610
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:00,030
I hope they can understand your kindness.

611
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,200
Senior.

612
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:03,530
-Senior!
-Senior!

613
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:04,480
Senior.

614
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,440
What happened?

615
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,640
Senior. You must take revenge for us.

616
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,760
Who is bold enough to bully

617
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,060
the people of the Taixuan Palace?

618
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,250
Who else could it be?

619
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,160
With his identity as a banished god,

620
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,080
he has looked down

621
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,390
on the Taixuan Palace and you.

622
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,650
Who else could it be

623
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,420
except Ji Ruochen?

624
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,620
Senior, you can't ignore this.

625
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:24,860
Why did he hit you?

626
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,240
Because we heard

627
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,660
he said the Grand Five-Element Swordsmanship of the Taixuan Palace

628
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,540
was nothing.

629
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,120
He also said...

630
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,180
He also said that Taiwei Zhenren

631
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,170
beat the crap out of our master.

632
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,140
We were angry

633
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,260
and quarreled with him.

634
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,540
And he beat us.

635
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,730
Ji Clerk is really ungrateful.

636
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,020
I was kind enough to teach him the Sword Flying Mantra.

637
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,390
I can't believe he said our swordsmanship was nothing.

638
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,020
I think he is nothing.

639
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:45,930
Senior.

640
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,450
You can't judge a book by its cover.

641
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,820
He was just pretending to be good-tempered

642
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:49,710
in front of you.

643
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,620
In fact, he is despicable and shameless.

644
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,340
Fine.

645
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,530
I'll show him what I'm capable of.

646
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:56,920
-Senior, calm down.
-Senior.

647
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,360
We need a reason.

648
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,640
Otherwise, it will be a private fight.

649
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,570
People will gossip about it.

650
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,170
How about we challenge him first?

651
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,210
So that we can find a place

652
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,650
to teach him a lesson with a proper reason.

653
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:06,340
Do as you say.

654
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,110
This

655
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,700
is my new technique.

656
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,610
A plate of braised eggplants?

657
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:16,660
Vulgar.

658
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:18,680
It has a beautiful name.

659
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:19,330
It's called

660
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,870
Jinxin eggplants.

661
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,590
Jin...

662
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:26,170
So much for your cultivation in seclusion.

663
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,560
You just went to learn cooking.

664
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:29,850
You don't understand.

665
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,460
You will gradually understand

666
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,860
it is more important

667
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,390
to learn to cook

668
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,980
than to be admitted into a sect

669
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,100
or practicing

670
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,680
powerful swordsmanships.

671
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,730
This is so delicious.

672
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,880
Ruochen, taste it.

673
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:56,800
Ming Xin.

674
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,510
Senior.

675
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,890
Didn't you say you made an appointment with Ji Ruochen

676
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,240
to compete here from 5 a.m. to 7 a.m.?

677
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:02,560
It's been two hours.

678
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,080
Where is he?

679
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,660
He must be delayed by something.

680
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:08,870
I'll teach him a lesson when he comes.

681
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,120
Senior, let's wait a little longer.

682
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,940
He doesn't have the guts to fool us.

683
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,060
One more.

684
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:31,690
Don't touch me.

685
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,160
Don't touch me.

686
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:34,580
Keep drinking.

687
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:35,920
Drink.

688
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,430
To be honest,

689
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,040
it's my honor

690
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,410
to be friends with you and Xuanzhen.

691
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,300
Senior Qiushui.

692
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,510
One day,

693
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:50,050
if I give up my immortality identity and become a mortal,

694
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,480
or

695
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,760
I am a mortal,

696
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,310
will we still sit together

697
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:59,010
drinking like this?

698
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,370
It has nothing to do with immortality cultivation.

699
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,630
Immortality

700
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:04,410
and mortality

701
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,740
both have

702
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,240
their own benefits.

703
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,020
But what matters most

704
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,230
is your own choice.

705
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,330
But

706
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,880
you will

707
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,510
always be my friend.

708
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:19,340
Yes.

709
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,820
Why are you laughing?

710
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:28,489
Nothing.

711
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:32,110
I feel relieved

712
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,429
because of what you said just now.

713
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,389
Now I feel relaxed.

714
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:36,980
Come on.

715
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:37,860
Drink.

716
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,630
Drink.

717
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,850
Drink.

718
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,469
Put it down.

719
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:48,870
Bad luck.

720
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,270
It never rains but it pours.

721
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,350
Will we freeze to death here?

722
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:58,200
What?

723
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,590
You can't stand it so soon?

724
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,270
I'm still here, right?

725
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:05,950
The sun shines after the rain.

726
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,040
Senior, did you draw it in a wrong way again?

727
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:22,020
Senior, let's find a shelter.

728
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:22,500
-Let's go.
-That's right.

729
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:23,440
Let's go.

730
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,150
That's strange.

731
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,590
Why does it

732
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,300
look like Senior Yinyin's Sunlight and Rain Charm

733
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,370
on the Sword Forging Mountain?

734
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:41,530
The charm can summon wind and rain

735
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,460
and clear the mist and rain.

736
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,750
But it's late.

737
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,530
Why did she go up there?

738
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,250
Ji Ruochen!

739
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,020
Ji Ruochen, come back.

740
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,910
Eat these dishes together.

741
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,300
Ming Yun. Ming Xin.

742
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,540
There's a cave here.

743
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:02,500
We can take shelter from rain there.

744
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,360
Senior, we can't go in.

745
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,220
I heard there's a forbidden area on the Sword Forging Mountain.

746
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,350
People will be punished for trespassing.

747
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,510
Maybe this is it.

748
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,570
We are just here to take shelter from rain.

749
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,320
What are you afraid of?

750
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:09,730
Let's go.

751
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,130
-Yeah. What's there to be afraid of?
-Senior.

752
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,010
Senior.

753
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:21,850
Isn't this just an ordinary cave?

754
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:22,880
Where does it look like a forbidden area?

755
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,000
But

756
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:27,320
don't you think it's very cold here?

757
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,020
This is my fault.

758
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:35,670
With spotted nine tails,

759
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,750
I jump over the Nanshan Mountain.

760
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:38,880
Do you hear anything?

761
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,560
When the Big Dipper appears above the Nanshan Mountain,

762
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:44,740
the dead water ripples.

763
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,220
Senior, how about

764
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,680
we go somewhere else to take shelter?

765
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:50,950
That's right. Senior.

766
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,310
Let's go somewhere else.

767
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,180
It's too dark. Don't go there.

768
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,690
Who is inside?

769
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,830
-Senior.
-Senior!

770
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:00,360
Senior, come back!

771
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:02,150
Senior. Don't go inside!

772
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:05,290
The dead water ripples.

773
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,340
I see nothing every day.

774
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,130
I am heartbroken.

775
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,250
On the full-moon night,

776
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:22,320
the Big Dipper moves.

777
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,270
The gate of hell is open,

778
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,640
and the yin energy is the strongest.

779
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:44,700
I didn't expect to see you again today.
