[Divine Destiny]

3
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,990
[Episode 23]

4
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,240
Why should I listen to you?

5
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:44,340
I'm the Demon Emperor. Who do you take me for?

6
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,360
Don't act tough.

7
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,970
You know me.

8
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,539
I don't want to be rude.

9
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,330
Yi Xuan, don't force me to fight.

10
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:56,539
Demon Emperor.

11
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,990
I heard that the owner of the Endless Sea is very powerful.

12
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,850
He has already reached the level of gods.

13
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,940
If we fight,

14
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,260
I'm afraid...

15
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,430
Don't call me Uncle.

16
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,620
I don't have a nephew as old as you.

17
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,340
Besides,

18
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,540
you are capable of saving yourself.

19
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,130
Why did you ask me to save you?

20
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,300
How can I escape

21
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,100
like this?

22
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,460
They cast a spell on these canes.

23
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,340
You had been sitting under the bodhi tree on the Endless Sea

24
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,240
for hundreds of years.

25
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,660
Why did you bother

26
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,100
to come to the Zijin Palace?

27
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,579
Is

28
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,579
what I'm seeing today just an illusion?

29
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,470
Are you sure you've used all the methods?

30
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,300
You mean...

31
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:51,790
Yes.

32
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,560
The stronger the Blue Fire is,

33
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,700
the more you'll know yourself.

34
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,240
If you're sure I'm an illusion,

35
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,790
just do it.

36
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,340
Don't think I dare not.

37
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,600
Let me see who dares to touch me.

38
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,700
Yi Xuan.

39
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,420
You only care about those mountains in the Netherworld

40
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,420
and sand piles in the Sand Sea.

41
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,040
How pathetic.

42
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,570
I knew he was stalling us.

43
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,510
Oh no! Come with me!

44
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,530
Boy. You want to escape?

45
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,820
It's not that easy.

46
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,870
I'm afraid you don't know

47
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,700
the power of the Sand Sea is  against gods.

48
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,290
Today, I'm going to show you

49
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,380
the power of the Netherworld.

50
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:18,660
Chase after him!

51
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,020
Ji Ruochen.

52
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,000
This is your fate.

53
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,340
You can't blame others.

54
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:08,800
The Blue Fire.

55
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,500
The ancient divine weapon, the Demon Spear.

56
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,760
How is that possible?

57
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,050
I can't believe the Demon Spear chose you as its master.

58
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,460
A divine weapon.

59
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,580
It seems that this is a gift from God.

60
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,340
Kid.

61
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,820
Even though you have a divine weapon,

62
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,330
I will still kill you.

63
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:44,690
Yinyin.

64
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,670
Let's get out of here first.

65
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,490
The wind is weird.

66
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,980
Old God. My name is Ji Ruochen.

67
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,730
Thank you for saving me and Yinyin.

68
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,820
Not really.

69
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,440
It's just that I bumped into you two when I was collecting herbs.

70
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,900
So I just

71
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,680
took you back.

72
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:38,720
Thank you.

73
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:42,730
Old God, may I know your name?

74
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,390
My name is Jia Geng.

75
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,080
Mr. Jia Geng.

76
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,159
Mr. Ji.

77
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,180
You are quite capable.

78
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,100
You obtained the Demon Spear, the divine weapon of the Sand Sea.

79
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,690
Actually, it came to me by itself.

80
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,280
But thanks to the wind you summoned,

81
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,040
I got rid of the Demon Emperor.

82
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,730
He is so annoying.

83
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,600
Since you are here now,

84
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,930
you don't need to worry anymore.

85
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,750
Within 50km from here,

86
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,330
I have used my divine power to disturb the spiritual power of the Sand Sea.

87
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,700
The Demon Emperor can't find this place

88
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,130
in a short time.

89
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:27,970
I see.

90
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,580
Old God.

91
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,760
There is still one thing I don't understand.

92
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,049
I was injured before I came here.

93
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,700
Why did my wound heal

94
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,610
after I came here?

95
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,320
Mr. Ji. Let me tell you.

96
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,710
Look.

97
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:48,120
This place is close to the spiritual cave in the Zijin Palace.

98
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,430
When people are soaked in the source of the spiritual power of the Heaven and Earth,

99
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,550
of course their wounds

100
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,930
can heal faster.

101
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,440
So these sand pits are spiritual caves.

102
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,130
Yes.

103
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,630
No wonder since I came in,

104
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,580
the locations of the spiritual caves on the Shenzhou Energy Map

105
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,640
have never changed.

106
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,740
They were actually hidden by Mr. Jia Geng.

107
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,670
-Old God. What's happening?
-Don't be naughty. Don't be naughty.

108
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,450
Go to sleep.

109
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,710
Go to sleep.

110
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,680
Be good.

111
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,650
Be good.

112
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,780
Old God.

113
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:33,930
What is it?

114
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,020
Don't panic.

115
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,660
This tortoise

116
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,390
is my disappointing son.

117
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,190
It doesn't hurt people.

118
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,660
It's just a little grumpy.

119
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,680
It's okay.

120
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,720
So it is a spiritual beast that has cultivated for a thousand years.

121
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,500
Yes.

122
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,870
May I ask why you are here?

123
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,820
Old God. To be honest,

124
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,940
we are here to destroy the spiritual caves.

125
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,710
If you want to destroy the spiritual caves,

126
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,530
I shouldn't stop you.

127
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,030
But

128
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,450
for my unfilial son,

129
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,480
I can only ask you and Miss Yinyin

130
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,160
to show mercy.

131
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,590
Old God, can you tell me why?

132
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,970
My unfilial son

133
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:40,850
was badly injured by the Demon Emperor

134
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,370
after it caused chaos in the Zijin Palace

135
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,690
and showed its true form.

136
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,410
I've been living here with it all these years

137
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,030
to focus on the medical skills of the monster clan,

138
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,680
and I have been using spiritual caves to heal its wounds.

139
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,490
It's been over a hundred years.

140
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,700
Its wounds are about to heal.

141
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,590
Healing wounds with spiritual caves?

142
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,630
Don't worry, Mr. Ji.

143
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,840
Since I hid here in the Sand Sea,

144
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,830
I've never cared about the grudges in the Three Realms.

145
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,710
Whether you are here

146
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,330
to destroy or protect spiritual caves,

147
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,450
I don't care.

148
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,600
But my son

149
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,370
needs more time to recover.

150
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,010
Mr. Ji and Miss Yinyin,

151
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,710
can you do me a favor

152
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,760
and wait a little longer?

153
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,200
Of course I will

154
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,970
give you time to save your son.

155
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,440
Consider it my way of thanking you for saving Yinyin's life.

156
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,610
When I first saw Miss Yinyin,

157
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,430
I was wondering

158
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,620
what kind of person deserves

159
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,520
her sacrifice of exchanging her most precious memories

160
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,080
for Nuwa's tear.

161
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,410
Now it seems that

162
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,460
she has sharp eyes.

163
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,010
Miss Yinyin lost her memories,

164
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,080
but Mr. Ji is still with her.

165
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:18,570
Old God.

166
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,210
How do you know about Nuwa's tear?

167
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,260
Did Yinyin tell you?

168
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,410
Miss Yinyin has completely forgotten the past.

169
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,350
How can she still know about Nuwa's tear?

170
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,350
I found out when I was healing her wounds.

171
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,470
Besides,

172
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:42,630
it seems your meridians were broken.

173
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,200
In that case,

174
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,850
I guessed it.

175
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:48,890
Old God.

176
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,890
Is there any cure for her amnesia?

177
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,560
Is there any way to let her remember me again?

178
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,520
You should know

179
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,660
the amnesia caused by Nuwa's tear is incurable.

180
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,400
I know.

181
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,310
But I just can't accept it.

182
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,810
Although I can't cure

183
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,630
Miss Yinyin's amnesia,

184
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,990
the monster poison in her body

185
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,400
can be eliminated.

186
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,530
Old God.

187
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,580
It's strange.

188
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,490
Yinyin hasn't suffered from the monster poison

189
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,150
since she practiced monster techniques.

190
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,500
But before she came to the Zijin Palace,

191
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,170
she started to suffer from it again.

192
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,790
That's because

193
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,510
after Miss Yinyin's memories were taken away

194
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,820
by Master Iceberg,

195
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,850
the spiritual power in her body became a mess.

196
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,370
Thus, the Huanyao Root was awakened again

197
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:43,020
and made her suffer.

198
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,060
So

199
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,620
it was my fault again.

200
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,260
It's nothing serious.

201
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,520
I'll make some pills

202
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,170
for Miss Yinyin.

203
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,980
The Huanyao Root will be sunk in sleep again.

204
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,290
As for the amnesia,

205
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:08,930
Mr. Ji,

206
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,200
no offense.

207
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,850
Everything between you and Miss Yinyin

208
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,860
will come to nothing.

209
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,330
The more unwilling you are to let it go,

210
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,470
the more painful you will be in the future.

211
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,020
What is happening?

212
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,800
Oh no. The spiritual power of the spiritual cave suddenly increased.

213
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,740
My son is being attracted by the spiritual power and is out of control.

214
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,510
Jia Xuan, stop!

215
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,030
If you are swallowed by the spiritual cave, you will die.

216
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,380
Don't worry. Old God.

217
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,670
I'm going to stop it now.

218
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,360
Ji Ruochen.

219
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,230
How dare you hurt my son!

220
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,700
He won't hurt your son.

221
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,510
Stop!

222
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,030
Stop!

223
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,400
Otherwise, don't blame me for being merciless.

224
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,130
Jia Xuan has gone crazy.

225
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,770
I must destroy the spiritual cave.

226
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:19,150
What's wrong?

227
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,830
Oh no, the spiritual cave has been destroyed.

228
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,060
The Demon Emperor of the Netherworld is really useless.

229
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,390
At the sacred place of the monster clan,

230
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,210
I can't believe he let Ji Ruochen succeed.

231
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,030
Good job, Ruochen.

232
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,800
If you keep laughing,

233
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,360
I'll offer you as a sacrifice to the destroyed spiritual cave.

234
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,690
Ji Ruochen really destroyed the spiritual cave in the Sand Sea.

235
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,180
Qing,

236
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,130
you can't be merciful anymore.

237
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,610
Has he really become a demon?

238
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:25,990
Qing,

239
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,030
come with me to stop him.

240
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:42,940
It's done.

241
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,160
This is God's will.

242
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,760
This is really God's will.

243
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:53,680
I kept this spiritual cave to save your life.

244
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:01,290
But you were greedy and anxious for success.

245
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,550
You hurt yourself instead.

246
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,780
This is God's will.

247
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,970
This is really God's will.

248
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,030
Mr. Ji, no!

249
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,790
Please show mercy.

250
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,100
This is the Chaos Thunder Dragon

251
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,500
transformed from my son's soul.

252
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,660
Why don't you take it

253
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,740
as your own primordial weapon

254
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,780
so that it won't be homeless?

255
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,740
Okay.

256
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,160
Xuan.

257
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,380
Xuan.

258
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,320
Hurry!

259
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,930
Yinyin, the Demon Emperor is here.

260
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,890
Hide now.

261
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,660
Don't look down on me

262
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,880
just because you are powerful.

263
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,530
I'm capable of dealing with the Demon Emperor.

264
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,940
Ji Ruochen,

265
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,030
I won't spare you.

266
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,720
The moon is not yet full.

267
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,400
Ji Ruochen must still be here.

268
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,790
Listen up.

269
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,210
Find him no matter what.

270
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,060
Got it.

271
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,510
If Ruochen succeeds,

272
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,600
the monster clan will be furious.

273
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,500
They won't hesitate to kill all men of Xixuan Sect.

274
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,210
They won't show mercy to Qiushui.

275
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,780
We can only take the risk to save him.

276
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,540
But if we can't

277
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,580
handle Sun Guo's trap,

278
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,660
we'll all be captured.

279
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,290
Impossible. I'm going to save him.

280
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:51,670
Xuanzhen.

281
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,340
Sister-in-law. Why did you come here?

282
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,550
If I don't come,

283
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,890
my husband will be killed.

284
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,180
We are outnumbered.

285
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,640
We are waiting for a chance.

286
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,370
That's right.

287
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,350
We just decided we are going to break in

288
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,130
to save Qiushui.

289
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,120
What chance?

290
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,220
If you really care,

291
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,180
you wouldn't have waited until now, right?

292
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:08,780
Stop wasting time.

293
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,260
You distract him.

294
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:11,420
I'll save my husband.

295
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,520
Then we'll get together

296
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,450
and fight our way out.

297
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,070
OK.

298
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,380
Xuanzhen.

299
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:43,650
Honey.

300
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:47,950
Xuanzhen.

301
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,020
They left us behind.

302
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,710
Didn't we agree to leave together after saving him?

303
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,960
Stop chasing.

304
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,070
Imperial Advisor, why?

305
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,120
I can catch up with them.

306
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,540
The spiritual cave has been destroyed.

307
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,060
We can't threaten Ji Ruochen

308
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,620
with them.

309
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:28,320
Go back to the capital.

310
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,860
Ask Yinfeng and Gu Qing

311
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,250
to take Ji Ruochen's life.

312
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,470
That's the right way.

313
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:36,590
Old God.

314
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,150
I didn't break my promise

315
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,810
by destroying the spiritual cave.

316
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,690
Considering what happened to Jia Xuan,

317
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,690
I had no choice.

318
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,800
I have noticed long ago that

319
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,160
although the spiritual cave can heal wounds,

320
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,280
the more spiritual energy you absorb,

321
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,030
the more easily you will lose your mind.

322
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,810
That's what happened to Xuan.

323
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,720
He had almost become a different person.

324
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,160
That's why

325
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:06,100
I forbade him to be too close to the spiritual cave.

326
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,290
Yes.

327
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,310
I finally understand

328
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,870
why Hierarch asked me to destroy spiritual caves.

329
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,400
Any kind of strong power

330
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,150
is extremely tempting.

331
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,950
Instead of saying the spiritual power enchants people,

332
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:23,100
we should say people lose their mind by themselves.

333
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:26,090
Mortals

334
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:29,500
only know absorbing the spiritual energy

335
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,130
to become gods.

336
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:35,040
They don't know once the spiritual power is out of control,

337
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,840
the Three Realms will lose balance too.

338
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,040
This is why Master Ziyang

339
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,780
made this decision

340
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,190
to maintain the balance of the Three Realms.

341
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,230
Old God.

342
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,260
You never planned to stop me from destroying the spiritual cave

343
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,230
from the beginning, right?

344
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,500
I hope Mr. Ji

345
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,860
can destroy all the spiritual caves in the world.

346
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,010
So my son won't die in vain.

347
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,790
After I turn it into my primordial weapon,

348
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,310
it will still have a chance to appear in the mortal world.

349
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,300
The moon is full.

350
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,090
It's time.

351
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,830
Leave now.

352
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,500
Thank you. Old God.

353
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,270
Take care.

354
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,380
Goodbye, sir.

355
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,380
OK. Just go.

356
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,370
Mr. Ji, please wait.

357
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:45,380
When I was young, I heard from the dragon clan in the West Sea that

358
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:49,790
on the night of a full moon, Seven-Star Combination,

359
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:52,500
and space-time dislocation,

360
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,840
people who are in it will have a chance to go back in time.

361
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:01,890
However, this is a rare opportunity.

362
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,700
If you miss it,

363
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,460
you have to wait another 100 years.

364
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,960
I don't know if it's true.

365
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,230
Mr. Ji,

366
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,300
you can give it a try if you have the chance.

367
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,570
Maybe it's a turning point.

368
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,950
Thank you, Old God. I'll keep that in mind.

369
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,490
Okay. Go.

370
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,450
How dare you destroy the spiritual cave!

371
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,260
Kill them!

372
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,450
Kill them!

373
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,540
Yinyin.

374
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:12,530
I can't believe he has his own primordial weapon.

375
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:38,850
Let's go.

376
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:39,310
Let's go.

377
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,170
Honey.

378
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:07,710
Darling.

379
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,220
Are you feeling better?

380
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:11,530
I'm fine.

381
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,290
Qiushui.

382
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:14,710
Qiushui.

383
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,360
Xuanzhen.

384
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:16,330
Senior.

385
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,030
Despicable.

386
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,890
We agreed to split up and get together again.

387
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:19,810
But you ran away first.

388
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,050
You did it on purpose.

389
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:21,930
So what?

390
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:22,430
Dear.

391
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:23,380
What are you arguing about here?

392
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,550
Yinyin. Ruochen.

393
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,860
Let's get out of here first.

394
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,180
Qingyi, you are slow again.

395
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,020
No.

396
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,380
It's because you're too fast today.

397
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,340
I heard

398
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,100
you went to see the Dragon and Tiger Universal Cannon

399
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,820
early this morning.

400
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,770
Then you asked me to play Go with you.

401
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,790
Uncle, what's wrong?

402
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,820
Are you finally tired of sitting

403
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,480
under the bodhi tree?

404
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,970
You had much fun outside.

405
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,700
I was afraid you would be bored here.

406
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,080
So I asked you here.

407
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,450
What? Do you want to go out again?

408
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,060
No.

409
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,620
I have to recultivate every time I come back.

410
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,430
I don't want to go to the Ice Prison anymore.

411
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,440
You've been to the mortal world just several times.

412
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,670
You're getting bolder.

413
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,190
You even know how to talk back.

414
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,270
I know.

415
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,840
Since you came back,

416
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,940
you've been worried

417
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,550
about Ji Ruochen and Zhang Yinyin.

418
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,300
Now they are really in danger.

419
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:48,150
Do you want to help them?

420
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:52,800
No?

421
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,550
OK. Let's continue.

422
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,520
We want to go.

423
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,150
Stop.

424
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,370
We have to finish this first.

425
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,740
How can you give up halfway?

426
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:06,700
Fine.

427
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,530
You're so impatient.

428
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,100
Fine. Go.

429
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:20,280
Ling.

430
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,880
Take Dragon Elephant and White Tiger with you.

431
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:23,920
OK.

432
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,640
Great. Ling will go with me.

433
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,370
Remember.

434
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:31,130
Your main task this time is to protect Qingyi.

435
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,890
The destruction of spiritual caves

436
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,360
has nothing to do with the Endless Sea.

437
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:35,440
Stay out of it.

438
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,780
Even if Qingyi gets impulsive,

439
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,590
remember, you must stop her.

440
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:42,770
Got it.

441
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:56,960
Daran.

442
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:58,680
Sit down.

443
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,240
Imperial Advisor. Are you hurt?

444
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,310
Gods.

445
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,830
Like you said,

446
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,500
even with the help of the Demon Emperor,

447
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,210
we still failed to stop Ji Ruochen

448
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,170
from destroying the spiritual cave.

449
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:37,630
Really?

450
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:38,570
Of course...

451
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:42,030
it's true.

452
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,540
Ji Ruochen has mastered the Blue Fire of the Nine Hells.

453
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,540
He has become a demon.

454
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,730
He has already become a demon.

455
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,870
Otherwise, with our cultivation, how could we end up...

456
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,040
like this?

457
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,210
We could only come back because we couldn't defeat him.

458
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,990
If anyone in this world can stop him,

459
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,360
it must be you two.

460
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:02,720
Qing.

461
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,100
If we let Ji Ruochen

462
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:06,820
destroy other spiritual caves,

463
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,060
there will be no spiritual power in the world.

464
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,670
By that time, the fate of the Heaven and Earth will reverse.

465
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,500
There will be endless disasters in the Three Realms.

466
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,150
-I know.
-By that time...

467
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,220
No need to say more.

468
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,220
But

469
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,570
I don't believe Ji Ruochen would do such a thing.

470
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,800
If you don't believe me,

471
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,050
you can go meet Ji Ruochen.

472
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,240
If he hasn't become a demon,

473
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,510
maybe you can stop him.

474
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:37,710
And there won't be another demon in this world.

475
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,840
Please. Gods.

476
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,790
What Imperial Advisor said is right.

477
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,720
To protect the peace of the Three Realms,

478
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,610
we must guard the spiritual caves.

479
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:54,480
Fairy Gu. Please pity the living things in this world.

480
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,060
Qing,

481
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,340
we are from the God Realm.

482
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:00,810
Publicly,

483
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,740
it's our duty to kill demons.

484
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,010
Privately,

485
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,180
it will be a good thing

486
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,949
if Ji Ruochen can turn back.

487
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:15,540
In that case,

488
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,050
let's go.

489
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:19,630
Okay.

490
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:21,340
I'm going to send my troops

491
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,840
to follow you.

492
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:27,690
Imperial Advisor.

493
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,199
Keep your voice down.

494
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,560
Even Yinfeng failed to persuade Bluestone God.

495
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,800
Imperial Advisor is really awesome.

496
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:42,429
Fairy Gu still can't forget her mortal destiny.

497
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,409
She took the bait right away.

498
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,820
But I think

499
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,460
she still loves Ji Ruochen.

500
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,219
What if she can't do it?

501
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:59,220
It's not up to her then.

502
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,060
What? She forgot you again?

503
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,160
In the past,

504
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,630
I despised Zhang Yinyin for her insolence.

505
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,810
I was even angry with her because she competed with my senior for a man.

506
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:25,740
But now,

507
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,310
even just a thought of

508
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,090
possibly being separated from my husband

509
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:31,230
makes me want to kill someone.

510
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:32,990
Sister-in-law,

511
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,950
don't add insult to injury for Ruochen.

512
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,580
Yinyin has forgotten me.

513
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,990
I've been thinking all the way.

514
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,580
I'm willing to suffer any hardship.

515
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,600
But for Yinyin,

516
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,510
she fell in love again and again

517
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,280
and forgot me again and again.

518
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:54,450
Although she doesn't know,

519
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,730
I really can't bear it.

520
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,620
If I were you,

521
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,570
I couldn't bear it either.

522
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,600
Yinyin is supposed to live happily like this.

523
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,210
How can I be so selfish to trap her?

524
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,220
I have something to do.

525
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:24,950
I can't leave.

526
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,680
But I hope

527
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,950
Yinyin can be sent back to Xixuan Mountains.

528
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,590
But

529
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,010
Zhang Yinyin is stubborn.

530
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,320
It's not that easy

531
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:35,520
to let her leave.

532
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:36,910
Yes.

533
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,400
I'll find a way.

534
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,010
Junior, what are you doing?

535
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:04,890
Nothing.

536
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,800
I just came out to get some air.

537
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:08,330
Get some air?

538
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,730
When should we set off?

539
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,290
I'm planning to send you back to Xixuan Mountains.

540
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,230
Why?

541
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,500
Do you want to destroy spiritual caves alone

542
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,390
and get the credit alone?

543
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:17,940
No way.

544
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,270
It's not what you think.

545
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,270
If spiritual caves are destroyed,

546
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:24,650
all the sects will go after me.

547
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,220
They will hunt me down.

548
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,470
Isn't it too dangerous for you to be with me?

549
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,580
Didn't you say

550
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,890
Master gave you the mission

551
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:32,920
because of me?

552
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,090
Am I a selfish person

553
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,100
who leaves someone behind?

554
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,040
But...

555
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:36,870
But what?

556
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,710
They can go with you to destroy spiritual caves.

557
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:39,630
Why can't I?

558
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:40,810
Junior,

559
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,470
do you have a problem with me?

560
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,940
They will go back to Xixuan Mountains with you.

561
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,520
I'll walk the path ahead on my own.

562
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,500
You want to get rid of me?

563
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:56,010
No way.

564
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,080
It was not easy for me to come out.

565
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,860
Ruochen, don't try to drive me back.

566
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:06,330
See? No one wants to go back.

567
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,190
If we go back, it means we are cowards.

568
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:10,590
Alone?

569
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,110
Isn't that a one-way trip?

570
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,750
If it weren't for us

571
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,120
in the Sand Sea that day,

572
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,070
you would have been captured by the Demon Emperor.

573
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,180
And you wouldn't have had a chance

574
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,460
to enter the Zijin Palace.

575
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,200
That's right.

576
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,490
We cooperated well in that battle,

577
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:25,220
although Qiushui was injured.

578
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,310
It's okay. I've recovered.

579
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,230
I won't leave anyway.

580
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,470
I can't leave my husband either.

581
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,380
So I won't leave either.

582
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,420
I can only follow my husband.

583
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,390
See? No one wants to leave.

584
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,800
Fine. It's okay if you don't want to leave.

585
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,170
I won't leave either.

586
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,510
We all stay here.

587
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,180
Let's see who can't put up with it first.

588
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:47,930
Why are you so stubborn?

589
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:48,980
Ruochen,

590
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,230
think about it.

591
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:51,900
You can't complete the mission

592
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,830
on your own.

593
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:53,710
Maybe

594
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,170
you'll get yourself killed.

595
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,480
The five of us will watch you.

596
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,670
You can't escape.

597
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,600
Just stay here.

598
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:00,670
Right.

599
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,140
I forgot to tell you.

600
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,660
I have my own primordial weapon now.

601
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,090
I'm more powerful than any of you.

602
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,680
If I really want to leave,

603
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,580
do you think you can stop me?

604
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,500
How arrogant!

605
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,240
Don't come back if you leave.

606
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,370
I'm really mad.

607
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,770
But I can't defeat him.

608
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,740
-I feel the same.
-So arrogant.

609
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,720
Who brought the Deity Binding Rope?

610
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,730
Let's tie him up and hit the road.

611
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,100
Yinyin.

612
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,610
Please don't say "hit the road" in the future.

613
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,400
It sounds creepy.

614
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,880
If you are not afraid of death

615
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,250
and insist on going,

616
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,700
there is a way.

617
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:34,910
What is it?
