[Divine Destiny]

3
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,979
[Episode 1]

4
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,630
Where all gods live,

5
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,200
in the extremes of the Heavenly Realm,

6
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,720
the god who patrolled the Heavenly River

7
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,410
read the Book of Heaven on the bank of the Heavenly River.

8
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,990
At the end of the river, he transformed a bluestone into a god.

9
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,310
Then, the Bluestone God mistakenly set the Great Heavenly Demon free

10
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,890
and violated the heavenly rules.

11
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,390
The Border Patrol God was willing to be punished with her,

12
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,780
so they were demoted to the mortal world.

13
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,230
The Bluestone God promised to meet the Border Patrol God

14
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,270
and to never leave each other, by faith of the bluestone.

15
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,310
They agreed to live out a hundred lifetimes and return to the God Realm together.

16
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,060
After being together for 99 lifetimes,

17
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,920
in his last life, the Border Patrol God

18
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,030
recalled how he chanted the scriptures on the banks of the boundless river.

19
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,940
Remembering those green pupils,

20
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,790
he went to Kunlun immediately

21
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,390
to look for the Bluestone God

22
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,540
to fulfill their promise.

23
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,590
At this moment,

24
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,870
due to the weakening of the Chaotic Energy

25
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,630
that maintains the balance of the three realms,

26
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,040
an unprecedented disaster is approaching.

27
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:53,240
According to the oracle,

28
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,650
only the banished god, who is born with blue stone,

29
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,180
can overcome this calamity.

30
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,820
All sects in the world

31
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,630
are hence sniffing around

32
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,480
and searching everywhere for the magical stone.

33
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,950
According to the book,

34
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,120
when the banished god is born,

35
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,350
those who obtain it will prosper and those lose it will die.

36
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,560
But those demons don't know a god when they see one.

37
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,410
They treated the banished god as a mortal.

38
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,680
[the Book of Cultivation]

39
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,150
This is how the banished god

40
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,670
killed spirits and demons in the past.

41
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,590
One day, I will cultivate the Tao

42
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,590
and help people

43
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,690
just like the banished god.

44
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,720
How can you be so bold to say you want to be like the banished god?

45
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,540
Let me ask you.

46
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,430
Do you know what the banished god looks like?

47
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,090
Why do you ask?

48
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,640
Of course he looks like me.

49
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,590
You...

50
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,510
Aren't you just a waiter?

51
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,300
And you're talking about a banished god?

52
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:31,960
I think

53
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,640
you don't even deserve to carry shoes for a banished god.

54
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,830
Yes.

55
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,700
-Fall. -Yeah.

56
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,440
Don't blame me.

57
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:55,420
This was Huaniang's task.

58
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,300
She asked me to do this.

59
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,100
And you.

60
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,980
Do remember that it was Huaniang.

61
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:04,980
Huaniang.

62
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,150
It hurts.

63
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,360
No wonder there are fewer customers lately.

64
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,520
It turns out you and your mouth

65
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,970
have been scaring them away.

66
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,230
What's so good about

67
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,560
this stupid tale about gods?

68
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,100
You've read it 100 times.

69
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,060
Are you not tired of it?

70
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,130
I'll confiscate it.

71
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,910
No, Huaniang.

72
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:23,620
This...

73
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:28,920
Huaniang.

74
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,780
What have you eaten lately?

75
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,990
Why is your skin so fair?

76
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,240
And your eyes

77
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,520
are getting brighter too.

78
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,159
You've become so pretty,

79
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,720
even when you're angry.

80
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,820
Brat.

81
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,810
You silver-tongued devil.

82
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,760
Zhang Wancai.

83
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,870
Where have you been?

84
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,950
Come out and rob those sheep.

85
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,420
Hua!

86
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,380
Idiot, get back to work.

87
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,110
It'll be troublesome if they wake up.

88
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:29,820
Okay.

89
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:36,820
Zhang,

90
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,800
have you done what I asked?

91
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,280
Yes.

92
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,790
I almost got beaten to death by Huaniang.

93
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,620
Ask her yourself.

94
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,080
You have no conscience.

95
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,620
If it weren't for us in the desert,

96
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,420
you would have died.

97
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,350
Now, you're all grown up,

98
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,940
and you want to abandon us?

99
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,409
And you want to cultivate Tao and go around swashbuckling?

100
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,870
You should give up now.

101
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,540
If you have so much time to daydream,

102
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,030
why don't you use it to rob people for me?

103
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:09,980
Don't tear it!

104
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,920
My Book of Cultivation!

105
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,550
My Book of Cultivation!

106
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:18,310
Huaniang.

107
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,750
Why did you tear my Book of Cultivation?

108
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,210
My Book of Cultivation.

109
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,050
Have you seen a black alien beast

110
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,230
pass by here?

111
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,060
I... I saw it.

112
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,990
It rushed out just now.

113
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,659
Right?

114
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,720
Look.

115
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,300
Right.

116
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,440
He hurt these two too.

117
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,920
If you run in that direction now,

118
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,950
you can catch up with it.

119
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,430
Yes, it didn't go far.

120
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,490
There's something fishy here.

121
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,080
Could it be an illusion created by the alien beast?

122
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,580
I'm thirsty.

123
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,240
Do you have anything to quench my thirst?

124
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,390
Sir, don't say that.

125
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,210
If we didn't even have that,

126
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,130
then why are we opening an inn?

127
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,390
Why are you still standing there?

128
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,060
Bring the best rice wine.

129
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,830
Okay.

130
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:20,770
Forget the wine.

131
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,420
Just some tea will do.

132
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,650
Sure.

133
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,500
Sir, your tea is here.

134
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,580
Sir, do you think

135
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,040
our tea is not good enough?

136
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:48,660
No.

137
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,990
I'm afraid you put sleeping potion in it.

138
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,110
So that's what you're afraid of.

139
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,630
Look.

140
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,250
This is a cup of tea.

141
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,940
You can be assured now.

142
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,410
I was just kidding.

143
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,390
You didn't have to take it so seriously.

144
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,440
I didn't take it seriously.

145
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:13,290
Sir,

146
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,650
it's windy and dusty outside today.

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,920
Be careful not to stain your clothes.

148
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:19,650
Come on.

149
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,600
I have divine power to protect me.

150
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,030
How could a mortal like him

151
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,580
get close to me?

152
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,870
Ouch!

153
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,590
Brazen thieves! How dare you run a scam shop

154
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,430
and murder people for money?

155
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,010
If I hadn't passed by,

156
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,750
I wonder how many innocents would have died in vain.

157
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,400
We only want money, we don't kill them.

158
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,300
Let go of me!

159
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,650
Zhang!

160
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,140
Huaniang!

161
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,000
Let go of my mother!

162
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,120
You bandits!

163
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,830
Because of people like you,

164
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,280
the mortal world is so filthy.

165
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,320
Today, I will enforce justice

166
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,990
and clean up this world.

167
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,010
So you're a immortality cultivator.

168
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,610
Let go of my mother!

169
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,710
Help! Clerk!

170
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,010
Mother!

171
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,230
Help!

172
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,230
Rob the sheep!

173
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,400
What's happening?

174
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,470
What's happening?

175
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:38,750
I'm so tired.

176
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,710
This way.

177
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,950
Stop.

178
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,650
Master,

179
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,840
please don't blame me.

180
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,440
Just reincarnate

181
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,900
and be a good human in your next life.

182
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,590
Come on, put it on.

183
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,550
No.

184
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,560
Why are you giving it to me?

185
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:02,610
It's a pity to throw it away.

186
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,950
Take it as a gift from me.

187
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:04,630
No, Mother.

188
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,200
-Put it on. -I…

189
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,000
Stand still!

190
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,370
Hurry up.

191
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,040
Alright, let's go.

192
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,190
[Longmen Inn]

193
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,180
Come on.

194
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,570
Let's drink.

195
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,920
Ladies and gentlemen,

196
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,520
did you see

197
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,040
someone lying over there just now?

198
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,520
He was very noisy after he woke up.

199
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,080
He disturbed my knife.

200
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,950
He must be holding his tongue

201
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,370
and looking everywhere for a doctor to put it back now.

202
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,550
Are they just stopping here

203
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,610
or are you staying?

204
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,620
We're looking for him.

205
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,430
Why are you looking for me?

206
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,750
I don't know you.

207
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:08,730
We don't know each other.

208
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,710
He is indeed far from

209
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,670
what you mentioned.

210
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,750
Since he can withstand my Soul-Breaking Smoke,

211
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,450
he must be the banished god we're looking for.

212
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,450
Kid, come with me.

213
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,510
-Come with us! -Come with us!

214
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,750
You look so handsome.

215
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:44,800
Don't be afraid.

216
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,820
I'll take you to a nice place.

217
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,760
It's beautiful and fun,

218
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,340
way better than this shabby place.

219
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,730
Thank you for favoring me.

220
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,580
But I'm an unlucky person.

221
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,790
I'll just stay here

222
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:01,670
in this place.

223
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,640
Ungrateful.

224
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,550
The Ancient Sword of Tianquan.

225
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,060
I have my eyes on him.

226
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,270
If he wants to leave,

227
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,530
he's leaving with me.

228
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,370
Thank you for your love.

229
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,550
I'm really flattered.

230
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,120
Why don't you two discuss this first?

231
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,460
Yun Wuhua.

232
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,810
First come, first served.

233
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,450
Zhang! Huaniang!

234
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,910
Help me!

235
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:55,950
[Longmen Inn]

236
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,470
Zhang, help me!

237
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:03,880
You bitch!

238
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,870
If you take another step forward,

239
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:06,950
I'll kill him.

240
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,130
Master only asked for the person.

241
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,540
He didn't specify if he had to be alive or dead.

242
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:11,620
If you want to kill him,

243
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,730
just do it.

244
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,510
He's not interested,

245
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,390
but you guys insist on forcing yourselves onto him.

246
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:26,470
Bah!

247
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:27,570
Shameless!

248
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,350
Where did you come from?

249
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,270
Tell me your name.

250
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:32,450
What?

251
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,600
You don't know

252
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,390
the famous Greenwood Immortal Sword?

253
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,190
Greenwood Immortal Sword?

254
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,800
It seems like the Xixuan Sect is here to join in the fun too.

255
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:55,800
Xixuan Sect?

256
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,670
I remember the Book of Cultivation said

257
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,510
Xixuan is the greatest immortality cultivating sect in the world.

258
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,360
They're after me too?

259
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,250
What's going on?

260
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,240
How dare you steal him from me?

261
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:29,290
Thank you for saving me, pretty fairy.

262
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,550
Move away if you want to live.

263
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:02,700
Let's go.

264
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,420
Are you from Xixuan?

265
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,819
Why did you save me?

266
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:05,569
Let's go.

267
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,829
There is always a way out.

268
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,000
Hold me tight when I count to three.

269
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,410
Wait.

270
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,950
What's your name?

271
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,150
You'll die if you wait any longer.

272
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,550
Don't be so polite.

273
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,310
I don't want to.

274
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,510
I don't want to be polite with you either.

275
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,870
I'm just a mortal.

276
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,670
You're asking me to jump

277
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,390
from such a high place?

278
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,660
What if I die?

279
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,830
I wouldn't even know

280
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,790
the name of my savior.

281
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,910
It'll be a lifetime regret.

282
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:36,810
Listen.

283
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,810
I'm Zhang Yinyin, the chief disciple of the Taixuan Palace of Xixuan Sect.

284
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,390
Zhang Yinyin.

285
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,220
-I'll remember... -Come with me!

286
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,140
Why don't you hold me instead?

287
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,420
What are you doing?

288
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,750
Who told you to jump?

289
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,570
Didn't you say

290
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,270
to start jumping in 1, 2, 3?

291
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,060
I mean on the count of three, hold on to me.

292
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,370
I'll help you fly with my spiritual power.

293
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,430
Fly?

294
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,110
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

295
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,560
What the Ultimate Banished God?

296
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,570
I think you're an idiot.

297
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,950
I, Zhang Yinyin, am the Chief Disciple of Xixuan Sect.

298
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,390
I've never cut such a sorry figure.

299
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,880
I was unlucky today.

300
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,620
I deserve it.

301
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:28,330
I...

302
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,230
Hand him over.

303
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,270
No way.

304
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,500
He's destined to be my sect's disciple.

305
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,490
If you want him,

306
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,600
grab him with your skills.

307
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,480
Young god,

308
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,630
come back to Nanhai Temple with me.

309
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,990
Now, you really can't leave.

310
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:01,750
Listen.

311
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,470
You have to help me to the end.

312
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,310
You can’t leave me alone, Zhang Yinyin.

313
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,750
In that case,

314
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,630
we have a deal.

315
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,870
From now on, you are mine.

316
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,050
Enter Xixuan sect

317
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,450
and I'll protect you.

318
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:14,880
It's a deal then.

319
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,850
What are you talking about?

320
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,570
You're being lovey-dovey already?

321
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,340
Mother.

322
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,580
I've found the person who will help us tide through the disaster.

323
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:46,990
Shut up!

324
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,690
How dare you go down the mountain and snatch people without permission?

325
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,250
With the three of you here,

326
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:55,250
this desolate place has become a treasure land.

327
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:56,860
I'm Huihai.

328
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,270
Greetings, Zhenren.

329
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,510
I've long heard that Ziwei Zhenren has been in seclusion

330
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,460
for more than 30 years.

331
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,020
You made an exception today.

332
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,820
Are you here for this young man?

333
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,050
Hierarch came out

334
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,180
to find a fated person to inherit his position.

335
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:15,240
This is my only wish before I ascend.

336
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,010
Please bear with me.

337
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,590
So this old man is here to select a successor.

338
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,670
If I can join Xixuan in this life,

339
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:25,010
my dream of becoming a god will come true.

340
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,880
Zhenren has such great ambition.

341
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,530
But we have difficulties too.

342
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,830
Why don't you take a step back

343
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,340
and let us have this young man?

344
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,180
Master Huihai is right.

345
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,600
All sects and clans have difficulties.

346
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,820
Although our Xixuan Sect is prosperous,

347
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,020
we never oppress others with our power.

348
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,280
How about this?

349
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,430
Let's ask this young man

350
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,380
which sect he's willing to join.

351
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,930
Is that fair?

352
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,770
You can just say it.

353
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,510
We will testify for you.

354
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:01,470
I...

355
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,540
They are my people.

356
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,290
Of course, I'm willing to be a disciple of Xixuan Sect.

357
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,360
Master, please accept my kotow.

358
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,550
According to the Book of Cultivation,

359
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,470
one can ride the divine bird.

360
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,860
This is really amazing.

361
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,540
We're just riding a bird.

362
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,930
Why are you acting so enthusiastic?

363
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,610
Of course, I am.

364
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,350
Is that the inn?

365
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,470
Fairy Yinyin.

366
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,190
Can you make this divine bird stop for a while?

367
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,430
I want to say goodbye to Huaniang and Zhang.

368
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,820
After I join the Xixuan Sect,

369
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:44,900
I don't know when

370
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,120
I can see them again.

371
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,960
The divine bird is flying. How can we stop just like that?

372
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,660
Besides,

373
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,150
our masters are waiting for you to attend the apprentice ceremony.

374
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:51,930
We can't afford to be late.

375
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,120
If it's fated,

376
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,510
your paths will cross again.

377
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,310
After you join our Xixuan,

378
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,300
I'll be your senior sister,

379
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,170
and you'll be my junior brother.

380
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,490
You have to listen to me, no matter what I say.

381
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,300
Got it?

382
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,050
Yes.

383
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,670
I'll listen to you.

384
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,660
You really can't do anything

385
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:12,950
but be a chicken.

386
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,560
If anyone dares to bully you in the future,

387
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:16,930
just say my name.

388
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,780
I'll protect you.

389
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:19,630
OK!

390
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,190
I can also cultivate myself and become a god!

391
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,630
I can fly too!

392
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,430
Look at you.

393
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,290
This is the Xixuan Mountains?

394
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,750
So beautiful!

395
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,550
What's your name?

396
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,840
I only remember that I was an orphan.

397
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:44,760
My surname is Ji.

398
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:46,410
I have no name.

399
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,550
After I was adopted by my boss,

400
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,350
he gave me the name

401
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,560
"Clerk."

402
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,390
In that case,

403
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,670
let me give you a name.

404
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,620
Although you have been through a lot,

405
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:01,190
you still have to go through many hardships.

406
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:04,110
Tao is vast, and all beings are like dust.

407
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,450
So you are Ruochen now.

408
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,780
Thank you for giving me a name.

409
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,910
I don't think it's as good as Clerk.

410
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:13,690
Dear.

411
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,390
Why do I feel this boy

412
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,420
is not the banished god we are looking for?

413
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,590
Could Yinyin catch the wrong person?

414
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,220
Honey, calm down.

415
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,400
Let's see how Hierarch decides.

416
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,690
where do you get that blue stone on your neck?

417
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,300
I can't really remember.

418
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,310
I think I've been wearing it since I was a kid.

419
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,920
Can I have a look?

420
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,660
I...

421
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:48,960
Master.

422
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,680
Ruochen.

423
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,700
Come here.

424
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,700
Ziyang is more suspicious than us.

425
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,120
He actually uses the Psychic Mirror to test him.

426
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:44,760
You stand here.

427
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,160
This mirror can tell whether one is a mortal, a spirit, a god, or a demon.

428
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,910
Mortals look in the mirror and the mirror won't change.

429
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,030
Gods, the mirror will turn red.

430
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,570
If spirits and demons look into the mirror,

431
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,510
it will turn black with foul air.

432
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,950
I think this is getting interesting.

433
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,820
Senior, why is the Psychic Mirror not responding?

434
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,400
Is the mirror supposed to change?

435
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,870
If this idiot is fake,

436
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,780
people will laugh at me.

437
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,370
Of course, you stand so far away.

438
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,340
Come closer.

439
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,000
Yinyin.

440
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:49,830
Yinyin.

441
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,550
-Yinyin. -Yinyin.

442
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,510
-Yinyin. -Senior Yinyin.

443
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,220
Hierarch, everyone.

444
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,700
I'm sorry that my daughter had a relapse

445
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,340
of her headache.

446
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:01,750
It doesn't matter.

447
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:05,160
We have to thank Yinyin for what happened today.

448
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,040
As you can see,

449
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:10,620
the Psychic Mirror turned red because of his immortal body.

450
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,490
You should believe that

451
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,800
Ruochen is the Ultimate Banished God.

452
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,770
The Ultimate Banished God?

453
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,310
Could he be the banished god?

454
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,100
Because of the bluestone,

455
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,390
they mistook me for him.

456
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,780
But the mirror didn't react at all just now.

457
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,350
The universe is unpredictable.

458
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:31,430
It is not something that we can understand overnight.

459
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,470
Let alone the Psychic Mirror,

460
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:37,270
even the bluestone pendant on his neck is spiritual.

461
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,600
It will recognize its own master.

462
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,180
Ruochen is definitely not a mortal.

463
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,390
No more discussions.

464
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:46,960
Now it's time to decide which school he will join.

465
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,440
Since you value him so much

466
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,870
and my Taixuan Palace has the longest cultivation,

467
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:57,150
it's natural that I should be the one to teach Ruochen.

468
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,100
Jingxiao Zhenren,

469
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,930
your Grand Five-Element Swordsmanship is indeed amazing.

470
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,670
But as for the Golden Core Cultivation and Sanqing Practice,

471
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:07,070
Ziyang is at the top.

472
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:10,350
My school is ideal for young disciples who are just starting out.

473
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,670
Although Ruochen is a banished god,

474
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,280
his foundation is weak now.

475
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,770
It is most appropriate for me to discipline him.

476
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,780
I think you're the most inappropriate.

477
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,770
You have many female disciples.

478
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:24,380
And Ji Ruochen has a pair of amorous eyes.

479
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,100
It's really dangerous.

480
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,710
There are 26 disciples in your Jingxiao school.

481
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,410
Are there no girls among them?

482
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,440
The banished god will ascend to the God Realm sooner or later.

483
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,450
Isn't it ridiculous for Taiwei Zhenren

484
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,590
to say that.

485
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:35,970
You...

486
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:36,640
You...

487
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,590
I don't think he's suitable for your school.

488
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,020
Am I right?

489
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,260
Everyone!

490
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,780
You all have a point.

491
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,770
No matter which school Ji Ruochen goes to,

492
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:53,100
there are good sides and bad sides.

493
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,350
Since helping him return to the God Realm

494
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:59,110
is the top priority of our Xixuan Sect.

495
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,470
We can't take it lightly.

496
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,070
How about this?

497
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,240
Let Ruochen be the disciple of Ziyang's Taichang Palace first.

498
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:11,250
The other schools will take turns teaching him two days per month.

499
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,800
After the great exam three years later,

500
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,270
let him decide which school he will join.

501
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,440
That's good.

502
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,980
Instead of fighting,

503
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,760
why don't we teach him together?

504
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,690
Ruochen, what do you think?

505
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,400
Masters, please accept my kowtow.

506
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:48,800
The divine Chiying Sword?

507
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:52,700
Although this Chiying Sword is not the strongest divine sword,

508
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,290
it's my favorite.

509
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,240
I'll give it to you today.

510
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,980
Thank you, Master.

511
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,590
This Chiying Sword should belong to me.

512
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,190
How can the Hierarch give it to him?

513
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:05,710
Yinyin.

514
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,140
Alright, Yinyin.

515
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:14,400
Let's go.

516
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,530
By the way, Senior Yunfeng,

517
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,950
this place is much better than

518
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,770
what is written in the Book of Cultivation.

519
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:23,820
There are many good scenes in the Xixuan Mountains.

520
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,640
You'll discover them in the future

521
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,750
and understand them gradually.

522
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,270
By the way, Senior Yunfeng,

523
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,200
Yinyin had a recurrence of an old headache

524
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,410
in the hall just now.

525
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,770
Is her illness

526
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,740
a very dangerous disease?

527
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:40,140
Yinyin has been suffering from the invasion of coldness since childhood.

528
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,290
So she gets headaches and dizziness as the disease strikes occasionally.

529
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,990
But luckily, Jingxiao and his wife are protecting her with their true spirits.

530
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,900
So she is fine.

531
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,040
This way.

532
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,160
The two sides are the wing rooms.

533
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,530
This is our yard.

534
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,770
This place is so big.

535
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:09,870
Ruochen.

536
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:10,710
Come.

537
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:18,080
Ruochen.

538
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,870
This is your place.

539
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,580
If you need anything,

540
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:22,980
just let me know.

541
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,430
Such a big place.

542
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,150
I'm the only one who lives here?

543
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,490
Yes, only you.

544
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,700
Your Xixuan Sect is really the best sect in the world.

545
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,870
You're really rich and generous.

546
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:36,770
You have so many disciples.

547
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:38,520
How many rooms and yards do you need?

548
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,090
Not really.

549
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,080
Most of the disciples are sleeping together in one big room.

550
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,690
You are the banished god,

551
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,200
and the key to reviving our sect.

552
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,630
Of course, our status can't compare with yours.

553
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,080
No wonder.

554
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,270
Are you all waiting for me

555
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,520
to ascend to the God Realm?

556
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,050
But don't worry.

557
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,600
I'll always remember

558
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,740
what you have done for me.

559
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,660
If I become a god one day,

560
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,040
I will never forget you.

561
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,340
You must be tired.

562
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,240
Rest early.

563
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,000
Okay.

564
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,290
Goodbye.

565
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,550
Weird.

566
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,810
It was so hot just now.

567
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,400
Why are you cold now?

568
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,550
You stupid stone.

569
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,310
Stop playing the trick

570
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,630
of recognizing your own master.

571
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,880
From now on, I am your master!

572
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:39,630
Do you hear me?

573
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,170
Listen.

574
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,700
Reflect on yourself inside!

575
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:01,470
I figured out the secret of the universe and came out early.

576
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,020
Fortunately, that banished god chose our sect.

577
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,610
It's a result of fate as well as a calamity.

578
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,100
He will help our Xixuan overcome the difficulties.

579
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,840
Senior is right.

580
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,170
Senior!

581
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,170
Since you were in seclusion,

582
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,090
you've asked me to act as the Hierarch.

583
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,510
But it's been decades.

584
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,290
My cultivation has been delayed.

585
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,660
Our sect is not getting any better either.

586
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,390
Why don't you let Jinxiao do it?

587
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,150
I'm really afraid that I'll let you down.

588
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,790
Junior,

589
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:35,100
don't belittle yourself.

590
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:38,130
Now Ji Ruochen has become your disciple.

591
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,020
No matter the good or the evil.

592
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,550
Whether they wish to destroy our Xixuan,

593
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,220
or dominate the three realms,

594
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,620
they will try their best to harm him.

595
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:49,580
Junior, you must be very careful from now on.

596
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,310
Don't let anything happen

597
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:54,040
to the banished god in our sect.

598
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,440
Yes, Hierarch.

599
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:04,180
I can finally go to retreat without worrying.

600
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,050
But the affairs in the sect

601
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:11,060
rely on you again.

602
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:48,830
Yinyin.

603
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:49,840
-My daughter. -Yinyin.

604
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,310
-My daughter. -Are you okay?

605
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:52,910
Are you feeling better?

606
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:55,800
Here, Yinyin.

607
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,290
I feel much better.

608
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,200
But it's not a full moon night today.

609
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:07,310
Why do I have such a violent attack of my evil disease?

610
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,360
It's your fault.

611
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:11,590
You knew you had the Huanyao Root in your body,

612
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:14,489
but you still went close to the Psychic Mirror.

613
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:18,159
That mirror can distinguish humans, spirits, gods, and demons.

614
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,380
It must have detected the evil spirit's aura in your body.

615
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,639
That's why your blood and qi went in opposite directions.

616
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:26,310
I was worried about Ji Clerk.

617
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:28,790
So I didn't think much.

618
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:29,690
You...

619
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:31,710
Don't you know that, if not

620
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,020
for his divine power,

621
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:35,690
I'm afraid you'll show your demon form on the spot.

622
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:39,790
So what!

623
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,750
All these years,

624
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:44,469
I have been hiding and afraid.

625
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,870
I had enough!

626
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,580
If it's just the pain in my body,

627
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,070
I can endure it.

628
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,900
But we all practice together.

629
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:55,600
Others can make progress by practicing for a month,

630
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,210
but I have to practice much longer than them

631
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,910
because of the evil spirit's toxin.

632
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,840
I'd rather

633
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:04,650
become a evil spirit.

634
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,790
No.

635
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,430
Please don't!

636
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:08,760
You know

637
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,670
our Xixuan has always been the enemy of the evil spirits.

638
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:12,820
If you became one,

639
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,780
it's better that you would just be expelled.

640
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,650
Otherwise, you could be executed on the spot.

641
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,920
How are we going to live!

642
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,520
It's all that thousand-year-old fox's fault.

643
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:27,920
My girl, you've suffered.

644
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,780
We failed to protect you.

645
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:32,440
Mom.

646
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,590
Don't be sad.

647
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,810
I'm just saying it to vent my anger.

648
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,750
Don't be sad for me anymore.

649
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:43,980
How about this?

650
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,170
I promise you.

651
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,600
I will practice hard,

652
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,580
abide by the rules,

653
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,410
and try to defend the top spot on the Qingyun list.

654
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,090
Okay.

655
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,430
Okay.

656
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,550
Are you still in pain?

657
00:35:58,950 --> 00:35:59,870
Do you feel better?

658
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:02,160
Much better.

659
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:10,560
Good day, seniors.

660
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,100
Greetings, seniors.

661
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,230
Who are you?

662
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,110
You can just call us that.

663
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,540
You don't know yet, do you?

664
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,440
He is that once-in-a-lifetime genius.

665
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,240
The banished god.

666
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,110
Ji what?

667
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:28,770
Ji Ruochen.

668
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,230
How could he be the banished god?

669
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,320
He looks just like a clerk.

670
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:38,620
I think I'm just more blessed than others.

671
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,320
This is the Library.

672
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,430
The most important place for our sect.

673
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:44,510
What are you doing here?

674
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,260
I'm just looking around.

675
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,980
Then you can just go in and look around.

676
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:50,500
I don't think so.

677
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,960
I'm waiting for Senior Yunfeng to give me a pass.

678
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:53,560
No need.

679
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:54,630
These rules

680
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,220
are only for ordinary disciples like us.

681
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,260
You have extraordinary status.

682
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,210
You don't have to follow the rules.

683
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,260
You can just go in.

684
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:00,650
Really?

685
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:02,360
Thank you!

686
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,330
[Library]

687
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,400
What are they?

688
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:19,150
You...

689
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,140
Don't come over.

690
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,070
So disgusting!

691
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,930
Don't come any closer!

692
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,970
Senior Yinyin, come and save me!

693
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,670
Senior sister!
