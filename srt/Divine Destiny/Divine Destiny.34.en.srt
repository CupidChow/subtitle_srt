[Divine Destiny]

00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,020
[Episode 34]

4
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:38,920
Master.

5
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,990
Will the Blue Fire really change a person?

6
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:45,840
When you were a kid,

7
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,020
I planted the Huanyao Root in your body.

8
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,759
After that, you took me as your master and learned Monster's Art.

9
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,140
I didn't see you change your disposition.

10
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,420
So you mean

11
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,509
there's still some information being hidden in this thing?

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,160
But I asked Ji Ruochen.

13
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,470
He said the Endless Sea would be destroyed by the Demon Tower sooner or later.

14
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,630
He merely did it in advance.

15
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,590
Ji Ruochen has gone too far.

16
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,010
He not only destroyed the sea,

17
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,940
but also hurt the owner of the Endless Sea.

18
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,430
On what ground could he do that?

19
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,270
Master,

20
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,130
what's the story

21
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,170
between you and the owner of the Endless Sea?

22
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,079
Tens of millions of years ago,

23
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,730
human beings and monsters had a war with each other.

24
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,790
Originally, they were neck and neck.

25
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,850
But he withdrew before the battle started.

26
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,829
He also refused to tell me the reason.

27
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,430
I was furious and couldn't think clearly.

28
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,540
I was badly injured in that battle.

29
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:45,950
I was so angry that

30
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,030
I went to the Endless Sea to question him.

31
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,960
It was the critical moment

32
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,950
for the war between the two clans.

33
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,240
You suddenly left.

34
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,520
Do you know the consequences?

35
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,850
Yes, I do.

36
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,300
But I can't leave here.

37
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,100
You can't leave?

38
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,630
What if I destroy this place?

39
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,150
Will you still refuse to leave?

40
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:09,440
Su He.

41
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:13,860
You can't destroy this place.

42
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,180
Nor can I leave here.

43
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,760
Maybe I have to guard this place for thousands of years.

44
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,480
I can't explain it to you clearly now.

45
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,930
But I hope one day you will understand.

46
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,430
Good. Good for you.

47
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,550
I was so blind.

48
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,829
I was wrong about you.

49
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,390
Just stay here.

50
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,560
I will never show up in front of you again.

51
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,550
Go find Master Iceberg.

52
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,170
She can cure your wounds

53
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,670
and help you regain your power.

54
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,220
After that, I went to the Monster Forbidden Zone.

55
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,720
Master, you still remember everything.

56
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,440
I guess you didn't exchange your memories for Nuwa's Tears.

57
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,980
I've stayed in this Peace Hall for tens of millions of years.

58
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,510
I held grudges every day.

59
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,330
Later, I regretted it.

60
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,120
I should have forgotten him

61
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,600
with Nuwa's Tears.

62
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:19,620
Yinyin,

63
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,390
though I don't know

64
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,170
why Ji Ruochen has become someone like this,

65
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,640
I know

66
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,560
his feelings for you have never changed.

67
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,650
That's enough.

68
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,270
But he hurt so many people for me.

69
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,490
I can't get over this.

70
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,870
In his heart, you're more important than the world.

71
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,550
What else do you want?

72
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,600
I've suffered a lot.

73
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,160
I don't want you to go round and round, either.

74
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,560
Think about what you really want before making a decision.

75
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,320
Got it.

76
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,110
The Qingxu Sect is so bleak now,

77
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,370
but Xuwang still insists on holding such a grand ceremony for his inauguration.

78
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,960
I've heard that he also wants to revive Qingxu.

79
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,130
That's easier said than done.

80
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,080
Though Xuwang's cultivation is mediocre,

81
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,460
there's no gifted man among all the disciples.

82
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,180
If he wants to revive the sect, it's harder than ascending to Heaven.

83
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,420
I think it's just a bluff from Xuwang.

84
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:38,800
This man with no talent wants to be the leader.

85
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:43,909
It's easy to deceive ourselves but hard to deceive others,

86
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,560
but the common people always take things too hard.

87
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,200
So,

88
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,790
this hypocritical world

89
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,530
is not suitable for you.

90
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,670
You should return to the God Realm

91
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,240
and seek for the great truth.

92
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,960
I told you I wouldn't leave you behind.

93
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,660
Qing, I'm doing this for your own good.

94
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,070
Dear immortals,

95
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,390
our Hierarch asked you to go down the mountain for a get-together.

96
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,700
Have you recovered after you were

97
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:34,770
injured that day?

98
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,950
If you have anything to tell me, just say it.

99
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,430
There's no need to be so hypocritical and courteous.

100
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,700
Since you're so straightforward,

101
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,340
I'll tell you my request frankly.

102
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,180
As you know,

103
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,970
after our sect attacked Xixuan,

104
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,340
more than half of our disciples died, and our vitality was greatly damaged.

105
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,880
And that devil was so cruel that

106
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,550
he even killed Senior Xuxuan.

107
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,870
There are not many disciples in our Qingxu Sect now.

108
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:57,780
It’s really hard

109
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,920
to revive my sect.

110
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,890
So?

111
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,470
Since you've chosen to stay in Qingxu,

112
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,380
it means you'll share honor and shame, as well as live and die with Qingxu.

113
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,330
Can you pass those seven rolls of Book of Heaven

114
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,110
to our Qingxu's disciples?

115
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,680
After all,

116
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,840
you're coveting our Book of Heaven.

117
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,920
You misunderstood me, Fairy Gu.

118
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,340
Do you two know that

119
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,790
after Devil Ji slaughtered our sect's disciples,

120
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,440
he went to destroy the Monster Forbidden Zone

121
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,250
and dried up the Endless Sea?

122
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:30,890
Dried up the Endless Sea?

123
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,409
Then the the Demon Tower...

124
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:34,909
That's right.

125
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,560
It's said that the Demon Tower is about to appear,

126
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,180
and the Three Realms will be destroyed.

127
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,870
If our Qingxu's disciples

128
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,850
can get the Book of Heaven from you,

129
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,490
we might be able to stop that devil.

130
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,440
Whatever Ji Ruochen did,

131
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,460
Fairy Gu and I don't want to interfere anymore.

132
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,320
We won't give you the seven rolls of Book of Heaven, either.

133
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,780
You don't want to interfere or you can't interfere?

134
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,060
That day, Devil Ji attacked Qingxu.

135
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,400
Although I was seriously injured,

136
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,380
I still saw that

137
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,420
you were suppressed by that devil and couldn't fight back.

138
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,790
Banished God, don't forget that

139
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,740
when your life was at stake,

140
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,410
our Qingxu Sect saved you.

141
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,020
Now, you should return the favor, right?

142
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,930
You know quite well why you

143
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:14,910
saved me at that time.

144
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,300
There's no need to justify your action.

145
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,500
Even if Ji Ruochen hurt me badly,

146
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,960
I'm quite capable of dealing with you.

147
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,630
Banished God, calm down.

148
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,760
Devil Ji is our common enemy.

149
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,340
You and Qingxu are in the same boat.

150
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,350
We shouldn't suspect each other.

151
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,690
We should fight against our common enemy instead.

152
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,820
Who is on the same boat with you?

153
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,000
Gu Qing, Yin Feng,

154
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,510
how dare you disrespect me?

155
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,020
How arrogant you are!

156
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:39,409
It's you who are an ambitious villain

157
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,530
and want to trick us into giving you the Book of Heaven with a poor excuse.

158
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,300
Qing, don't waste time talking to him.

159
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,960
We can't stay in Qingxu anymore.

160
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,540
You... How ridiculous!

161
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,470
The Hierarch has ordered that

162
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,440
no one can enter unless invited.

163
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,510
Please don't go inside.

164
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,350
It's okay for me not to go inside.

165
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,100
You just need to ask Zhang Yinyin to come out,

166
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:10,740
and that'll be fine.

167
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,810
We used to be fellows in the same sect.

168
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,080
Don't make it difficult for us.

169
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,530
Then I can only go inside and find her myself.

170
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,300
Our Hierarch has said that you can't go inside.

171
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,210
It seems that love

172
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,900
is a barrair neither you nor I can overcome.

173
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,260
I shouldn't have

174
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,610
exchanged my memories for Nuwa's Tears.

175
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,530
Even though he lost all his cultivation,

176
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,240
as long as I took him back to the Xixuan Mountains,

177
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,620
we could still

178
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,280
be an ordinary couple.

179
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,180
He wouldn't have become a devil like this,

180
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,820
who is hated by everybody.

181
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:01,780
You're so sincere in love,

182
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:03,880
just like me.

183
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,200
I know I shouldn't go,

184
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,010
but seeing that he's tortured by the Demon King so badly,

185
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,530
I still can't help going there to help him.

186
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:13,790
Master,

187
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
are you leaving here?

188
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,610
The Three Realms are about to be destroyed.

189
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,340
The owner of the Endless Sea and I can't stop it.

190
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,020
Perhaps

191
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,780
only you can stop the Demon King.

192
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,040
So,

193
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,490
I've decided to pass all my cultivation

194
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,000
to you at a time.

195
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,010
Master, please don’t.

196
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,350
As the disciple of the Heavenly Fox,

197
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,650
how can you hesitate?

198
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,110
Master!

199
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,570
No! Master!

200
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,580
Master!

201
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:46,670
Master!

202
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,530
Master, are you alright?

203
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,230
Master.

204
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,180
You're truly the Heavenly Fox now.

205
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,910
You can't cry so randomly

206
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,450
like a little girl.

207
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,690
I have to go.

208
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:12,770
Take care.

209
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,700
Got it, Master.

210
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,800
I can't see you off.

211
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,840
Please take care, too.

212
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,720
I'm just here to see my wife.

213
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,240
I don't want to fight with you all like this.

214
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,180
[Taichang Palace]

215
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,110
Ruochen!

216
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,150
Are you really not going to turn back?

217
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,650
Ruochen!

218
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,680
You can let go of your responsibility of facing the calamity.

219
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,020
But if you want to become our Xixuan Sect's enemy,

220
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,600
don't think that you can leave Xixuan today.

221
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,300
I won't agree.

222
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,770
I already made it very clear to the Hierarch last time.

223
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,130
I don't owe Xixuan anything.

224
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,990
It's also impossible for me to stay in Xixuan.

225
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:12,640
You can't keep me even if you want to.

226
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,820
Ji Ruochen!

227
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,280
Do you hate our Xixuan Sect that much?

228
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,350
It's not about whether I hate you or not.

229
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,930
I've become the Demon King now.

230
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:24,800
Why should I

231
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,590
condescend to be a disciple of the Xixuan Sect?

232
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,000
Where on earth is Zhang Yinyin?

233
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,620
Yinyin won't go with you.

234
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,520
If you want to take her away forcibly,

235
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,330
you have to defeat me first.

236
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,890
Ji Ruochen!

237
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,650
Yinyin.

238
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,400
It was my fault last time.

239
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,230
It's okay for you to hit me

240
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,610
or scold me,

241
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,870
as long as you don't leave me.

242
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,590
Ji Ruochen.

243
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,100
In the Endless Sea,

244
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,620
I already made it very clear to you.

245
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,140
From now on,

246
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,280
I'll have nothing to do with the Demon King.

247
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,860
But when we were in the Nine Hells,

248
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,190
we already got married.

249
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,650
Husband and wife are intergrated together.

250
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,950
We can never cut off the ties with each other all our lives.

251
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,990
Even though it was my fault in the Endless Sea last time,

252
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,510
as long as you go with me,

253
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,690
I'll do whatever you say.

254
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,730
Let's say it's your fault.

255
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,420
But you don't even know what you did wrong.

256
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,420
Ji Ruochen,

257
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,570
I won't go with you.

258
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,370
I was born in Xixuan and grew up in Xixuan.

259
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,910
I've known I should uphold justice of the world since I was a kid.

260
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,150
That was what I used to do,

261
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,470
and I'll even do so in the future.

262
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,010
Ruochen.

263
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,930
Turn back for Yinyin's sake.

264
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,490
Stop!

265
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,620
Xuanzhen?

266
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,350
Ruochen, turn back.

267
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,560
I'm afraid I'll let you down.

268
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,090
-Xuanzhen! -Xuanzhen!

269
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,410
Xuanzhen!

270
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:16,900
Senior Ziyang.

271
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,150
How about

272
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,819
we ask Hierarch Ziwei to come out at once?

273
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,020
This is an important matter.

274
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,140
It looks like we need to ask Senior Ziwei to come out.

275
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:26,460
Qiushui!

276
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:26,849
Yes.

277
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,140
Take some men to re-deploy the formation.

278
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,350
Yes, Hierarch.

279
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,230
Xuanzhen.

280
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,090
Xuanzhen.

281
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:39,980
Xuanzhen!

282
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,810
Senior Bingxian, what's the matter?

283
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:44,790
I have something to tell you.

284
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,730
Don't interrupt. Let me finish first.

285
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,750
Don't avoid me, okay?

286
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:50,870
Xuanzhen.

287
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,050
I think I have a crush on you.

288
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,230
As you know,

289
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:00,940
I've been obsessed with my cultivation.

290
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,780
I thought I wouldn't fall in love with any man.

291
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,450
But after being with you for so long,

292
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,720
when I saw you wearing a mask,

293
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,400
my heart suddenly ached so much.

294
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,100
It ached so much that it was like killing me.

295
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,180
I don't know if you understand this feeling.

296
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,580
Xuanzhen.

297
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,150
I want to tell you that

298
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,310
as long as you want it,

299
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,010
I'll go beg the Hierarch...

300
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:33,840
Senior Bingxian.

301
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,840
I only regard you as my senior fellow.

302
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:41,930
Xuanzhen.

303
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,060
I'm telling the truth.

304
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,470
Besides, later,

305
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,170
I'll focus on guarding the forbidden area

306
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,830
without thinking about other things.

307
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,340
For something like this,

308
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,370
don't ever say that again!

309
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,080
Uncle.

310
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,490
The fire is getting bigger.

311
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,720
It seems to spray out soon.

312
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,090
Should we still go on waiting?

313
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,710
Maybe she won't come.

314
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:39,770
Nonsense!

315
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,780
You were the one who made a mistake,

316
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,290
but you're acting as if you were wronged.

317
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,290
Who are you showing it to?

318
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,210
Why are you still here?

319
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,940
Are you waiting to turn into ashes here?

320
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,260
Little monster,

321
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,480
don't trust your uncle.

322
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,460
He's just a liar.

323
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,440
He tricked me into waiting there for tens of millions of years.

324
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,910
Now he's still pretending to be wronged.

325
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,620
Heavenly Fox.

326
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,010
Uncle, say something.

327
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,210
Now,

328
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,690
I can't guard this sea anymore.

329
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,300
Nor can I go to see you shamelessly.

330
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,080
I can only wait for you here.

331
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,070
I hope you can pity me.

332
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,350
Who pities you?

333
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,820
Yinyin told me that you were punished by the Demon King.

334
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,360
It was helpful to vent my anger.

335
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,570
I'm here to see how miserable you are.

336
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,450
What's wrong with your cultivation?

337
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,580
I gave it to Yinyin.

338
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,230
That's good.

339
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,860
From now on,

340
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,250
I'll never be apart from you again.

341
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:00,670
I'll protect you,

342
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,620
and you don't need your cultivation.

343
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,530
Ji Tianxia?

344
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,900
No, no. Mr. Ji.

345
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,140
No, no, no.

346
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,930
Uncle, how come it's you?

347
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,720
I disguised myself as Ji Tianxia,

348
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,500
because I just didn't want the people to know that

349
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,620
I wandered around the mortal world.

350
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,970
Now I'm finally free.

351
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,150
Speaking of this, it's quite funny.

352
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,950
I have to thank that Demon King.

353
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:50,230
Uncle.

354
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,070
He destroyed the Endless Sea.

355
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,020
Don't you hate him?

356
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,170
This is all fate.

357
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,380
But this matter

358
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,290
is not over yet.

359
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,260
What do you mean?

360
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,010
What do you want to do now?

361
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,420
This calamity with power to destroy Heaven and Earth

362
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,720
is not to be settled by a monster like you.

363
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,090
Let me tell you.

364
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:13,500
If you leave,

365
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,160
you'll never have a chance to see me again.

366
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,450
Don't worry.

367
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,180
No matter what I do,

368
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,600
we will never be apart again.

369
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:38,950
Let's get out of here at once.

370
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,870
The Three Realms will be destroyed soon.

371
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,940
If we're late, we won't be able to drink good wine.

372
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,580
It's getting late.

373
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,290
Let's rest here.

374
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,370
Okay.

375
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,170
When I was a green stone,

376
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,270
I often saw such sunset scenery

377
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,700
by the Wuding River.

378
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,570
Day after day, I got tired of it gradually.

379
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,440
My only hope at that time was that

380
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,670
when you patrolled the border here

381
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,900
every 500 years, I could see you.

382
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,170
Qing, you still remember that?

383
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,820
I patrolled the borders for tens of thousands of years.

384
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,740
This bank of Wuding River was the place where I stayed most frequently.

385
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:40,560
At first, I just thought that

386
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,470
the sunset scenery

387
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,850
by the long Wuding River was very beautiful.

388
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,550
But later I found that

389
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,290
you were gradually enlightened to be an immortal.

390
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,290
In this case, I often thought about

391
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,390
what this little green stone

392
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,990
would turn into in the end.

393
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,740
I've let you down after you accompanied me for tens of thousands of years,

394
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,600
and I don't deserve the wrong fate between us in this life.

395
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,600
I'm sorry, Yin Feng.

396
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:35,990
Qing.

397
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,230
I still remember that every time we met,

398
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,550
you liked to hold my hand like this.

399
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:52,840
Qing,

400
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,120
you don't need to blame yourself.

401
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,390
You kept our promise

402
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,350
and recognized that green stone.

403
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,700
It was my fault.

404
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,220
I failed to protect it well,

405
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,760
which made you mistake someone else for me.

406
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,260
You don't have to find an excuse for me.

407
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,830
I'm the one who made you lose your immortal dharma-laksana.

408
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,610
You can't go back to the God Realm you've been longing for anymore.

409
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,150
I've been longing for it,

410
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,820
because I wanted to go back with you at first.

411
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,230
But now,

412
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,870
even if I can't be with you,

413
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,990
it'll be enough to have these hundreds of lives'

414
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,260
memories with you.

415
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,300
For those who are disrespectful for Qing,

416
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,520
no matter who it is,

417
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,720
don't blame me for being rude.

418
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,230
I'm here,

419
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,300
and you can never hurt her.

420
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,510
Why did you do all these things for me?

421
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:24,380
♫With a single thought, I descended into the mortal world and experienced countless cycles of day and night♫

I don't want to seek for the great truth, either.

535

539
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,310

I haven't figured it out yet.

541
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,190
But I think this matter is very important.

542
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,310
We should report it to the Heavenly Emperor right away.

543
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,780
The Heavenly Emperor is in seclusion.

544
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,810
Besides, we haven't found out about the truth yet.

545
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,670
If the Heavenly Emperor asks about it,

546
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,630
what will you say?

547
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,350
How about this?

548
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,780
You should leave for the Ascending Platform immediately,

549
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,970
and go to the mortal world with Yu Yun

550
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,340
in order to investigate why the spiritual power increased so much suddenly.

551
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,770
The you can report it to me.

552
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:26,710
-Yes. -Yes.

553
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,820
Before Hao Ming figures it out,

554
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,610
all of you shouldn't act rashly.

555
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:38,730
Yes!

556
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:49,670
Look.

557
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:50,940
Look.

558
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,280
-What's wrong with tthe Demon Tower? -Look.

559
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,400
It's really arising.

560
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,160
So scary.

561
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,650
Stop looking.

562
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:58,830
Go!

563
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,870
Run!

564
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,470
Demon King!

565
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,150
Qiyu City will be wiped out soon.

566
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,870
Are you satisfied now?

567
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,830
Satisfied?

568
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,159
Go, go. Let's go.

569
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:36,330
Run!

570
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,070
It'll be too late if we don't go now.

571
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:39,690
Make way. Make way.

572
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,400
Hurry up! Hurry up! Run!

573
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,340
Go. Let's escape from here.

574
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,490
Qingyi.

575
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:06,330
Master.

576
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,380
Miss Yinyin, why are you here?

577
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:09,280
This detestable man...

578
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,310
I've brought Yinyin here to see the appearance of the Demon Tower.

579
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,870
It's a rare sight that only happens once in tens of millions of years.

580
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,520
How can we miss it?

581
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,650
Sir.

582
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,970
No, Demon King.

583
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,980
You coerced Miss Yinyin into coming here, didn't you?

584
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,030
I like her so much.

585
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,680
How could I coerce her?

586
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:32,970
Should I call you Mr. Ji

587
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:34,900
or the owner of Endless Sea?

588
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,180
The Endless Sea has been destroyed by you.

589
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,560
There is no owner of Endless Sea.

590
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,840
Yinyin always thinks that I destroyed the Endless Sea,

591
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,070
and it was my fault.

592
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,110
Should I apologize to you?

593
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:57,340
Do you know among the wild fields of the God Realm,

594
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,150
there is another tower?

595
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,890
If the Demon Tower enters the God Realm,

596
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,410
the person who built it

597
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,760
will take the opportunity of both towers integrating together

598
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,580
and possess all the spiritual power of the Three Realms.

599
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,480
Then he'll become the Supreme Lord of the Three Realms.

600
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:15,990
Despite the fact that you're the Demon King,

601
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,370
even if we gather all the talented immortals

602
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,240
of the God Realm together,

603
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,880
we'll be no match for him.

604
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,050
In this case,

605
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:25,620
tens of thousands of years ago,

606
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,560
when this tower was built in the Nine Hells,

607
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:29,910
that person had already planned it.

608
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:31,810
Judging from your tone,

609
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:34,460
you seem to know who built the tower.

610
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:39,160
Did you see him in the Nine Hells?

611
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,030
No, I didn't.

612
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,790
I always feel that

613
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,390
there must be a reason for you

614
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,410
to be so composed.

615
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,110
What does it have to do with me

616
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,910
if the Three Realms are destroyed?

617
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:56,940
Mr. Ji.

618
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:59,300
Aren't you very composed as well?

619
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:01,220
My uncle is not composed.

620
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,590
He just doesn't know what to do.

621
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,380
Demon King,

622
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,890
only the person who built the tower will become the Supreme Lord of the Three Realms.

623
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,940
You destroyed the Endless Sea,

624
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,180
and you just helped someone else achieve his goal.

625
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,070
Do you regret it?

626
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,050
Yinyin has regained her memories.

627
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,310
Why should I regret it?

628
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,730
The Demon Tower has appeared.

629
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:20,970
Mr. Ji,

630
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,760
won't you figure out a solution?

631
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,220
What solution can I have?

632
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,100
I could only watch

633
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:36,330
the Endless Sea dry up and the Demon Tower appear.

634
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,010
This is a calamity.

635
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:43,090
There's nothing we can do.

636
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,220
I've guarded the Endless Sea for tens of millions of years.

637
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,230
Just let me take another look.
