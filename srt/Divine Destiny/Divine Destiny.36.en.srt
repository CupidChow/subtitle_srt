I won't let you return to the God Realm and harm the mortal world.

00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,780

It's useless.

If we let him escape today,

48
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:37,350
the Three Realms will be in misery.

49
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,450

00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,400
I don't want any demon core.

If you force the Blue Fire of Nine Hells out of your body,

180
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,240
the living person will suffer more.

00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:22,660

00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,590
Ruochen.

190
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,270
If you keep pressing me like this,

191
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,070
I'll really die.

192
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,520
Ruochen.

193
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,300
Ruochen.

194
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,220
Ruochen.

195
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,010
I'm fine.

196
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,310
Don't cry.

197
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,500
Finally, everything is over.

198
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,220
Now the Three Realms are finally peaceful.

199
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,460
We can also take those Zhenren

200
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:17,670
back to the Xixuan Mountains.

201
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,820
After we depart this time,

202
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,100
I don't know when we can meet again.

203
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:27,070
Qing and I were obsessed with deity fate.

204
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,180
We thought a hundred lifetime deity fate is the righteous and universal love.

205
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,250
But fate made a fool of us.

206
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,450
When it came to the hundredth lifetime,

207
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,910
we got it wrong.

208
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,520
Although the mortal fate is short,

209
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:42,930
you truly love each other.

210
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,850
One glance lasts ten thousand years.

211
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,330
Although the deity fate is long,

212
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,400
it's just a mirage.

213
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:55,750
Since you have mortal fate, you don't need deity fate.

214
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,190
Ruochen, Yinyin.

215
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,960
I wish you happiness.

216
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,580
Banished god, your thought is precious.

217
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,100
I’m happy

218
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:08,920
to receive your blessings.

219
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,580
I believe Qing

220
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,240
will also bless you.

221
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,820
Returning to the mortal world,

222
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,820
with mortal fate accompanying with us,

223
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,080
it's a lucky thing in life.

224
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,230
Yinyin and I have to rush back to the Xixuan Mountains.

225
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,100
Yinfeng.

226
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,020
Take care.

227
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:40,220
Take care.

228
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,140
Great Heavenly Demon.

229
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:17,880
Don’t.

230
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:00,130
Boundary Patroller. Congratulations on becoming a deity again.

231
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:02,990
So

232
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,540
you are the Great Heavenly Demon then.

233
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:07,670
Yes.

234
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,550
I came here today

235
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,730
to apologize to you.

236
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,020
Back then, my Heavenly Demon clan

237
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,030
originally lived in an endless barren world.

238
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,670
High Immortal Taiyi destroyed our land,

239
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,220
built the Spirit Mirror Tower there

240
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,580
and trapped me in the Deity Prison.

241
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,980
To go to the mortal world to find the Blue Fire of Nine Hells

242
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,340
and to find a way to kill High Immortal Taiyi,

243
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,000
I had to get the Bluestone God to remove for me

244
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,570
the Purifying Immortal Chain.

245
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,220
That's why I was able to go to the Mortal Realm.

246
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,380
But unexpectedly, I got you two involved

247
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,530
and put you into the mortal world.

248
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,210
Looks like this calamity was destined.

249
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,340
Although we won today,

250
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:15,880
we still need to thank you two

251
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,980
when it comes to the root cause.

252
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:21,730
I heard that you're returning to the God Realm.

253
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:22,970
So I came to see you off.

254
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,180
Who said I will return to the God Realm?

255
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:31,690
Well...

256
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,620
The God Realm is no different from the mortal world.

257
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,920
It's also full of greed and obsession.

258
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:03,310
I won't be able to comprehend the Heavenly Path there.

259
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,320
But that barren land

260
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,700
can train you to be so powerful.

261
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:23,190
I think it must be different.

262
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,740
Congratulations, Boundary Patroller.

263
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,830
You finally got the Tao.

264
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:49,130
[Hierarch Ziwei's Memorial Tablet]

265
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:49,130
[Ziyang Zhenren's Memorial Tablet]

266
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:49,130
[Ziyun Zhenren's Memorial Tablet]

267
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,910
The Hierarch and all Zhenren have been buried.

268
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,060
It's a relief for everyone.

269
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,550
After burning incense for Master and all of the Zhenren,

270
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,940
Shi Ji and I should go back to Yun Zhong Ju.

271
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,140
It's a big deal for the Zhenren to return.

272
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,500
We won't keep you here.

273
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:15,800
See you.

274
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,130
See you.

275
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,840
Junior Ruochen, from now on,

276
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:22,260
it will be your responsibility

277
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,860
to rejuvenate Xixuan Sect.

278
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,700
Don't let us down.

279
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,010
I'm a mortal now.

280
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:31,400
How can I bear such a heavy task?

281
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:32,850
Besides,

282
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:35,050
shouldn't the Hierarch be responsible for

283
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,260
rejuvenating Xixuan Sect?

284
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,300
How could it be my responsibility?

285
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,400
You...

286
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,950
You won't be the Hierarch?

287
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,180
When did I say I want to be the Hierarch?

288
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,820
Senior Bingxian told me that

289
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:55,330
Master Ziyang left a secret scroll

290
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,700
when he left.

291
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,820
It should be written in the secret scroll

292
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,900
that who will be the next Hierarch.

293
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:02,940
In this scroll,

294
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,960
there's the name of our next Hierarch.

295
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,500
When the time is right,

296
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,040
open it.

297
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,020
-But, we also want to...
-Enough.

298
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:12,120
This battle is different.

299
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,660
With your cultivation,

300
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,240
you can't help even if you go there.

301
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:16,810
Stay on the mountains

302
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,660
to protect Xixuan.

303
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:20,780
Senior Bingxian.

304
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:22,760
Would you like to open it

305
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,650
and see who it is?

306
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,660
[Ji Bingxian]

307
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,060
Why did Ziyang Master choose me?

308
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:42,310
Senior Ji is brave and resourceful.

309
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,780
When she led us to go down the mountains to stop Sun Guo,

310
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,030
she was also resourceful and decisive.

311
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,440
She is indeed the best candidate for Hierarch.

312
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,080
Yes.

313
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,780
Senior Bingxian, you are much more suitable than me.

314
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,890
I'm more suitable

315
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,640
to open an inn in the desert

316
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,480
and live freely,

317
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,740
without anyone restricting me.

318
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,070
Honey, what do you think?

319
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,120
What else can I say

320
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,050
since you say so?

321
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:07,400
I can only follow you.

322
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,620
Do you have the final say on this?

323
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,889
Father, Mother.

324
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,480
Silly kid.

325
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,050
Even if you want to leave,

326
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:23,350
you have to bring the dowry your mother gave you.

327
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,250
The dowry?

328
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:26,980
Bring it in.

329
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,600
Put it down.

330
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:37,540
Your mother has prepared it for you long ago.

331
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:40,020
Other than tacky precious metal,

332
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,460
there's also your mother's embroidered work.

333
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,540
The blankets, pillows...

334
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:46,820
She even secretly made

335
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,480
several bellybands, cotton hat and cotton clothes

336
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,670
for future grandchildren.

337
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,580
For both boys and girls.

338
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:56,219
Your mother stayed up late to embroider.

339
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,530
She cries while embroidering.

340
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,220
Shut up!

341
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,800
Who said I cry while embroidering?

342
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,770
Okay.

343
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:06,810
Mother.

344
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:09,900
Father-in-law, Mother-in-law.

345
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:10,920
Don't worry.

346
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:14,000
I will take good care of Yinyin.

347
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:21,060
Alright, get up.

348
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,450
-Get up.
-Get up.

349
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,540
I'm not blaming you.

350
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,760
I'm not mad at you.

351
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,500
If I was really mad at you,

352
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,900
I wouldn't have prepared so many dowries for you.

353
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,070
You

354
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,380
are just a little heartless girl.

355
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,180
When you were in the land of Nine Hells,

356
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,220
without sufficient conditions,

357
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,460
you got married in a hurry without parental orders

358
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,840
and the matchmaker's words.

359
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,090
I don't blame you.

360
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,900
But you're back now.

361
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,130
You should

362
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,650
respectfully offer me and your father tea.

363
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:58,900
Yes, Mother-in-law.

364
00:35:59,070 --> 00:35:59,910
To be honest, I wanted to

365
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,380
offer you tea and call you Mother a long time ago.

366
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,900
But Yinyin

367
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,460
refused to admit me.

368
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,680
That's why I didn't change my way of addressing you.

369
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,690
Why are you blaming me?

370
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:07,350
Am I not right?

371
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,860
Ms. Huang is right.

372
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:10,860
Not only you need to kowtow and serve tea,

373
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:11,900
we should also have

374
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,220
wedding chamber antics.

375
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,320
Yes, Hierarch.

376
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,620
We'll prepare the wedding chamber

377
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:20,750
for you two.

378
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:21,880
OK, Honey?

379
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:22,780
Sure, Honey.

380
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,070
We'll return to Yun Zhong Ju after we finish

381
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,390
-the wedding cahmber antics.
-Okay.

382
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,200
Ming Xin, Ming Yun, juniors.

383
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,230
Let's prepare the wedding chamber for the bride and groom.

384
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,600
Are you serious?

385
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,740
Let's go.

386
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:35,800
Father, Mother.

387
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,310
Won't you restrain them?

388
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:39,460
Well, we'll restrain them.

389
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:44,490
I said you're stupid, but you don't admit it.

390
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,130
Teach me, Senior.

391
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,130
You think by yourself.

392
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,210
Wait for me, Senior.

393
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,300
Senior, wait for me!

394
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:52,880
No.

395
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,050
Teach me which is medicine and which is grass.

396
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,140
Take your time and learn.

397
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,540
Why are you afraid of seeing people?

398
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,230
Xuanzhen.

399
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,770
You protected the mountains and Xixuan Sect several times.

400
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,990
You are a true disciple of Xixuan Sect.

401
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,140
There's nothing shameful.

402
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,500
Xuanzhen.

403
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,970
You don't have to hide at the back mountain.

404
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,260
Since I'm a new generation of Faceless Man,

405
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,710
I should stay here.

406
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:29,370
But...

407
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,680
There is both sunshine

408
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,070
and darkness on Xixuan Mountains.

409
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,410
Hierarch, you don’t need to persuade me anymore.

410
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,110
If you have any dirty work to do,

411
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,100
you can come find me

412
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,500
at the back mountain.

413
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:44,930
Are you really willing

414
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,640
to stay here forever?

415
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,530
Being able to protect the Xixuan Mountains

416
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,460
and you

417
00:37:58,770 --> 00:37:59,620
in this way,

418
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,330
I'm already satisfied in this life.

419
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:03,820
Xuanzhen.

420
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:12,980
See you.

421
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:47,860
♫With my sword, I face the world, breaking through the swirling sand♫

422
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:52,880
♫How many high positions were obtained through deceit and trickery♫

423
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:00,950
♫Amidst the shifting sands, who will emerge as the winner in the end?♫

424
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:06,130
♫Amidst the chaos and distractions, who can truly let go?♫

425
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,520
Greetings, Hierarch.

426
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:10,480
♫Not for leaving a mark in history or the glimmer of swords♫

427
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,450
♫The turbulent times change in an instant♫

428
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:19,360
♫It's all because of you and me, braving obstacles♫

429
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:25,180
♫I traverse the currents of time to be with you again♫

430
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:31,740
♫I cross endless hills, vowing to stay true to our promises♫

431
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:38,790
♫The sun and moon witness the eternal enmity and grievances♫

432
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:44,820
♫I only wish to hold your hand and be by your side♫

433
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:52,370
♫As long as I have you by my side, what more could I ask for in this lifetime?♫

434
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,080
Be careful.

435
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,480
Ruochen, what's wrong?

436
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,390
Nothing.

437
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,140
I just think

438
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:31,290
we'll be able to see Zhang and Huaniang soon.

439
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:32,900
How did you know?

440
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,520
How did I know?

441
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:37,110
Of course I can smell it from my nose.

442
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,340
Are you a dog?

443
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:40,680
Do you dare to make a bet with me?

444
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,110
Fine, I'll bet.

445
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,250
Anyway, if you win,

446
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:47,050
I'll make you kneel for four hours less.

447
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,800
Kneel for four hours?

448
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,490
Why is that?

449
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,610
You kept the destruction of the Demon Tower a secret from me.

450
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,390
I haven't even settled the score with you.

451
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,300
According to the family rules,

452
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:59,260
you have to kneel for at least three days and nights.

453
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:04,310
When did our family have this rule?

454
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,980
I said so.

455
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,580
Fine, whatever you say.

456
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:17,240
See?

457
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:18,500
That is the inn.

458
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:19,830
Four hours.

459
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:20,550
Let's go.

460
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:21,890
Let's hurry.

461
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,140
I'm back.

462
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,340
Huaniang.

463
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,210
Zhang.

464
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:29,720
Senior Bingxian became the Hierarch of Xixuan Sect.

465
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,310
She protects Xixuan Sect with Xuanzhen

466
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,790
who lives in seclusion in the back mountain.

467
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:34,660
Come on, let dad hug you.

468
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,420
Senior Qiushui and Shi Ji

469
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,070
have a harmonious relationship.

470
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,200
The gave birth to two kids in three years.

471
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,600
It's enviable.

472
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:43,180
Do you want some?

473
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,930
Young Master and Yinyin opened an inn

474
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,490
as promised.

475
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,680
My uncle often went to ask for wine.

476
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,180
Come on.

477
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:57,740
More.

478
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:58,780
More.

479
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,300
Bottoms up.

480
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,060
Come on.

481
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:01,980
Come on. Bottoms up.

482
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:02,860
Come on.

483
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,040
Don't mention it.

484
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,340
In the past,

485
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,560
once we opened an inn,

486
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,320
we would burn it down in a while.

487
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:16,420
Then we found a new place and opened another one.

488
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:19,300
It was suffering to keep hiding.

489
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,150
Look at now.

490
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:21,250
It's good.

491
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,580
We can finally

492
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:24,890
do business in peace.

493
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,700
But look, the business is not as good as before.

494
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,360
Look at this barren place.

495
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:30,970
You are a money-grubber.

496
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,900
Learn from me. Look how carefree I am.

497
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,440
Stop bragging.

498
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,230
If you're really carefree,

499
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:39,800
you should pay for the drinks you owe me.

500
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:40,470
Right.

501
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,890
He's afraid of his wife finding out when he drinks.

502
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,930
He's a coward who sneaks and drinks in secret.

503
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,140
-How dare he talk about being carefree here?
-That’s right.

504
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,680
Here, Mother.

505
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:52,310
Come on.

506
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:53,310
Cheers.

507
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,450
Cheers.

508
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:57,880
By the way, Mr. Ji,

509
00:43:58,250 --> 00:43:59,380
how is Qingyi recently?

510
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:05,880
After that battle,

511
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:07,400
Qingyi finally realized the Tao.

512
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,690
She transformed into a snake again and is cultivating the Tao.

513
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,770
Now is the most critical time

514
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:13,750
of her cultivation.

515
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,520
She's been meditating these days.

516
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:19,410
Qingyi.

517
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:20,990
It’s been a while.

518
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,460
You've grown up.

519
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,410
Continue your cultivation then.

520
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,460
We'll drink.

521
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:30,940
Yinyin.

522
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:32,880
Mr. Ji has been here for a long time.

523
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:33,950
Why aren't you coming out?

524
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:35,620
Yinyin, come out.

525
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,510
The dishes are cold.

526
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:49,530
Daddy is here.

527
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:51,010
Baby, look who's here.

528
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:53,180
Are you awake?

529
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:56,630
Greetings, Mr. Ji.

530
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,140
Don't be polite. It's important to coax the baby.

531
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:00,720
Good baby.

532
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,640
He looks like her mother.

533
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:03,730
He has big eyes.

534
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:05,920
Nonsense. Of course he looks like me.

535
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:06,950
What are you talking about?

536
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:08,180
Let me hug him.

537
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:09,450
You're afraid of your wife.

538
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,430
Same to you.

539
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:12,940
We're both in the same boat.

540
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:14,680
Come on, let's drink.

541
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:15,450
Come on.

542
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:16,070
Come on.

543
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:16,740
Drink.

544
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,510
Come on.

545
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:19,090
Bottoms up.

546
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,620
Don't drink too much. You're afraid of your wife, too.

547
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:21,180
It's okay.

548
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:21,820
Bottoms up.

549
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:22,540
Come on. Cheers.

550
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:23,180
It's okay.

551
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:23,900
Come on.

552
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:25,860
Don't feed him wine.

553
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,600
Let's drink.

554
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:29,430
Boss.

555
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:31,430
Get me some food and a room.

556
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:32,780
I need to hit the road tomorrow morning.

557
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,360
Sir, where are you going?

558
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:38,170
The majestic Xixuan.
