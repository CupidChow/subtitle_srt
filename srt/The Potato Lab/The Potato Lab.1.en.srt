00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:47,965
THE POTATO LAB

2
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:14,616
<i>What do potatoes mean to you?</i>

3
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:16,910
I think…

4
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,538
there is beauty in potatoes.

5
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,170
Potatoes are youth!

6
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:30,340
They're our passion.

7
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:36,054
SUNNYEO FOOD HAS DEDICATED

8
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,557
33 YEARS TO POTATOES

9
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:45,689
Potatoes

10
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,108
- are science.
- Are science.

11
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,776
Potatoes…

12
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,278
POTATOES - FARMING'S FUTURE

13
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,863
…are the future…

14
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,951
of Korean farming.

15
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:00,829
Furthermore,

16
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:05,542
they're humanity's future!

17
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:11,465
POTATOES - HUMANITY'S FUTURE

18
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:15,218
The taste of heaven, Sunnyeo Food!

19
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:18,013
- Let's all eat…
- Let's all eat…

20
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:21,892
- potatoes!
- potatoes!

21
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,853
THE TASTE OF HEAVEN
SUNNYEO FOOD!

22
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,439
- Have some potatoes!
- Potato!

23
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:30,400
SUNNYEO FOOD
THE TASTE OF HEAVEN, SUNNYEO FOOD!

24
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:33,904
That was our lab's introduction video.

25
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,947
Next up

26
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,325
is the pride and joy
of Sunnyeo Food's potato lab.

27
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,911
We'll be introducing
a new variety of potatoes.

28
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,913
Let's hear a big round of applause.

29
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,790
JANGSAENG

30
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:54,633
Hello, everyone!

31
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,427
I'm potato researcher Kim Mi-kyung.

32
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:01,139
To all members
of the Joongchan-ri Potato Crop Team,

33
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:02,808
I wish you health and longevity!

34
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,768
Wishing you health and longevity!

35
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,895
What is this, some sort of pyramid scheme?

36
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,188
What are you doing?

37
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,191
JANGSAENG PRESENTATION

38
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,112
Ladies and gentlemen.

39
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,947
What does "health and longevity" mean?

40
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,617
It means living a long life
without getting sick.

41
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,786
Would you believe me if I told you

42
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,706
there is a variety of potato
that's sturdy enough to do that?

43
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:26,915
Introducing…

44
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,417
Ta-da!

45
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,418
JANGSAENG

46
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,420
What? Wait a second!

47
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,422
Jangsaeng.

48
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,590
That's that troublesome potato
from last year.

49
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,092
- It is.
- That's right.

50
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,010
I heard people in the next town over

51
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,470
planted it and lost everything.

52
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,055
- Right.
- How could you do this to us?

53
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,141
Ladies and gentlemen,
that was only because

54
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,102
the rainy season was so long last year.

55
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,645
The fault wasn't in the variety.

56
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,273
- It was the weather--
- But if those potatoes are really sturdy,

57
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,191
they should thrive
even during thunderstorms.

58
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,986
You call it "long-lived"
when it can't even survive the rain?

59
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,279
I see what you're saying.

60
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:00,407
We named this variety
Jangsaeng for a reason.

61
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,617
Let's take a look at this graph.

62
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,244
Ta-da!

63
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:06,413
Our Jangsaeng

64
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,915
is more resistant to disease and insects
than any other variety.

65
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,500
It's resistant to scab.

66
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,086
PVY, PVX viruses--

67
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,045
Excuse me!

68
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,010
<i>Seems like you're</i>
<i>the one in charge around here.</i>

69
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,810
Yes, do you have a question?

70
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:32,314
It looks like you know your potatoes.

71
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,941
Let's not drag this out.
We're all pros here.

72
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,568
You're doing all of this

73
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,612
just so you can make a deal with us.

74
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,156
- That's right.
- Yeah.

75
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:44,785
So…

76
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,662
how much are you willing to pay?

77
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,670
All right. Sunnyeo Food will pay you…

78
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,717
- Eight hundred…
- Hey!

79
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,261
- …and ninety?
- Come on.

80
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,096
- That's crazy.
- Total nonsense.

81
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,307
Nine hundred.
We'll pay 900 won per kilogram.

82
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,309
Nine hundred and fifty won.

83
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,477
Come on, sir.

84
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,853
I saw on the potato forum

85
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,814
that Kimjungmi Food is paying 930 won,

86
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,899
and Sojung Baking Company is paying 940.

87
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:16,858
That's right.

88
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:19,528
Sunnyeo Food will need
to match that price.

89
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:23,323
We'll pay 910 won, but we can give you
the seed potatoes for the sturdy Jangsaeng

90
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,158
with a 10% discount.

91
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,369
Nine hundred and fifty won!

92
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:29,079
Okay, then.

93
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,832
On top of the seed potato discount,
we'll pay you 920 won.

94
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,458
We have to make a profit too.

95
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,168
Nine hundred and fifty won!

96
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,170
Okay, 930 won.

97
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,423
That's it, that's where I draw the line.

98
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,175
Nine hundred and fifty won!

99
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,262
- Come on, just pay us 950.
- Pay us 950.

100
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,431
Come on, what's wrong
with you young people?

101
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,474
All right.

102
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,979
Maybe 940 won?

103
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,897
- Come on!
- Don't be ridiculous.

104
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,191
That's enough. You don't need to do that.

105
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,572
What are we supposed to live on?

106
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,168
Damn it.

107
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,629
Ten won, ten won!

108
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,548
It's just freaking ten won.

109
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,886
This damn company.

110
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,722
Sunnyeo Food

111
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,308
is number one in the potato chip market,

112
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,352
but they're so damn stingy
when it comes to paying for potatoes.

113
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:37,147
I told the higher-ups
that farmers know their stuff nowadays,

114
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,150
and they have to pay more
if they want to beat other companies.

115
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,736
I've told them a million times already,

116
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,654
but the potato budget stays tiny.

117
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,072
Here.

118
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,075
- What's this?
- The section chief

119
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:52,537
gave me a nicotine patch
to give you when you're agitated.

120
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,124
You think I'm mad
because I'm trying to quit smoking?

121
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:57,876
I'm making a valid point here.

122
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,461
He also said you'd say that.

123
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,462
I'm supposed to

124
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,089
put it on you myself, just to be safe.

125
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,262
Do you feel better?

126
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,058
Why don't you just exorcise me?

127
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,935
I'm a Buddhist. Shall we go?

128
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,394
To Daeseolryeong.

129
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:26,571
Jeez.

130
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:29,574
I'm not getting anything
out of this damn company.

131
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,624
I hope Sunnyeo Food goes under!

132
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,881
<i>I hope Sunnyeo Food goes under!</i>

133
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:48,593
<i>Goes under! Under!</i>

134
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:57,310
EPISODE 1
THAT WONHAN BASTARD

135
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:07,195
THE TASTE OF HEAVEN! SUNNYEO FOOD

136
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,626
TASTE!

137
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,846
- Over here.
- We're back!

138
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,557
- Hi.
- Hey, come sit.

139
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,766
- Come and sit.
- Yo, MK!

140
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:37,892
WELCOME TO THE COMPANY

141
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,811
Is this all for me?

142
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:43,064
Of course. It's not every day
we get a new employee.

143
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,066
Wow, thank you. I'll do my best!

144
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,193
All right.

145
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,194
- Let's toast.
- Okay.

146
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,698
- We are…
- Potatoes, potatoes, potatoes!

147
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,789
Hey, did you land the contract?

148
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,332
No, we got screwed over.

149
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,918
Apparently, Sojung bid 940 won.

150
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,254
Nine hundred and forty?
Since when can they afford that?

151
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,215
Their condensed milk-flavored chips
were a hit last year.

152
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,175
Stocks went way up.

153
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,428
Wow, they must've gotten huge bonuses.

154
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,057
Hey, you guys are researchers.

155
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,100
You can't be focused
on material things.

156
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,435
Listen to me.

157
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,480
We're not just employees
at a food company.

158
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,566
We're scientists studying
a humble life-form called the potato.

159
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:31,071
What matters more than money
is the pride of contributing to humanity.

160
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,280
Have pride--

161
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,741
There goes Mr. Bu with his speech.

162
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,076
Let me start the timer.

163
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,577
She won't let me say anything.

164
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,704
Stop talking about work
at a welcome party.

165
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,372
Tonight is all about this guy.

166
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,208
Okay, this is the perfect time for me

167
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,376
to get up and sing a song for you guys.

168
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,213
All right!

169
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,380
Yeah.

170
00:09:51,296 --> 00:09:53,009
INVESTMENT AGREEMENT

171
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,719
CEO OF SUNNYEO FOOD
CHOI SUN-NYEO

172
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,225
Mr. So, what brings you here?

173
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,811
You can start criticizing my rudeness
in ten minutes.

174
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,647
I'm assuming you're Michael Lee,
CEO of Mores Company?

175
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,734
I'm So Baek-ho from Wonhan Retail's
Strategic Planning Department.

176
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:12,070
I couldn't stand by
while you robbed them blind,

177
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,822
so I had to come, though it's late.

178
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,698
Wow, what does that even…

179
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,867
Looks like you've forgotten
your mother tongue.

180
00:10:19,942 --> 00:10:22,539
According to my research,
you grew up in Chungcheongnam-do.

181
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,040
Chungcheongnam-do?

182
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,416
Aren't you from overseas?

183
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,961
Excuse me, what do you think you're doing?

184
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,420
You can't just burst in here.

185
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:32,632
As I've said before,
I'll take the criticism in ten minutes.

186
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,676
Almost two weeks ago, Sunnyeo Food

187
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,846
was negotiating an M&A
with us at Wonhan Retail.

188
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,765
As the lead advisor in preparing
and executing the M&A,

189
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,560
I tried my best to meet Mr. Choi's needs.

190
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:47,772
But he had a sudden change of heart
and nullified the plan.

191
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,567
Was that just because you fell

192
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,652
for these corporate vultures?

193
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,821
Corporate vultures?

194
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,330
Michael Lee-- I mean Lee Moon-su

195
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,250
invested in these companies
over the last seven years.

196
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,918
Funneling funds to a paper company,

197
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,879
and manipulating stocks
via false disclosures.

198
00:11:10,966 --> 00:11:13,548
He did everything
a fraudulent corporate vulture would do,

199
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,884
and those companies all met the same fate.

200
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,552
- Bankruptcy.
- Michael!

201
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,180
No, I'm just

202
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,891
a kind, wealthy investor.

203
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,145
This type of slander
makes me uncomfortable.

204
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,522
Maybe you're uncomfortable
because of your posture.

205
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:30,940
You have tech neck syndrome

206
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,984
- and rounded shoulders.
- What the…

207
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,695
Before this important
investment agreement,

208
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,780
you didn't even do
a simple background check.

209
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,324
I won't get into that right now.

210
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,118
After all, if you had
that kind of judgment,

211
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,328
you wouldn't have driven

212
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,372
one of the top three food companies
into the ground.

213
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:51,044
However, the final choice
is yours, Mr. Choi.

214
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,338
You could merge with Wonhan Retail

215
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,090
and save the company in a moderate way

216
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,175
or…

217
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,803
you could follow
this man with bad intentions,

218
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,972
and end up at rock bottom.

219
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,518
Just so you know,
you don't really have a choice.

220
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,155
Mr. Kim.

221
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,328
Speak up.

222
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:29,624
Sunnyeo Food is going under?

223
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,210
<i>Very nice</i>

224
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,712
Will our company be dissolved?

225
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,339
<i>Very nice</i>

226
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,674
What?

227
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,759
- An M&A?
<i>- Very nice</i>

228
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,637
Guys, stop!

229
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,305
<i>Very nice</i>

230
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,435
What is it? Why so serious?

231
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,980
An M&A?

232
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,232
What do you mean? How did that happen?

233
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,901
Who are we merging with?

234
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:06,744
Wonhan.

235
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,914
Wonhan Retail.

236
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,009
TALENT SHOW PRIZE
KIM MI-KYUNG, WONHAN RETAIL

237
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,103
SORRY, TRY AGAIN!

238
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:41,279
<i>You're a fantastic singer! I'm impressed!</i>

239
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:01,674
Oh, hey.

240
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,052
Look who it is.

241
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,179
The famous Director So Baek-ho.

242
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,430
Sunnyeo Food.

243
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,433
I heard you snatched it away
from some foreign company.

244
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,603
The chairman wouldn't stop praising you.

245
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,319
When we wanted to start a drugstore,

246
00:14:15,394 --> 00:14:17,269
you got the top three cosmetic factories.

247
00:14:17,369 --> 00:14:20,735
And now that we're focusing on F&B,
you get the top potato chip company.

248
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:24,489
No wonder Ms. Wang says there's no need
for a whole Strategic Planning Department.

249
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,200
We just need So Baek-ho
to keep things rolling.

250
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,036
Anyway, great job.

251
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,500
Let's get a drink to celebrate.

252
00:14:31,575 --> 00:14:33,581
- There's a--
- Why would I do that?

253
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:34,624
Sorry?

254
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,250
It was part of my job.

255
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,878
A celebration is entirely unnecessary.

256
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,298
Mr. So!

257
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,841
Mr. So!

258
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,269
Sir, you need to calm down.

259
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,521
Calm down?

260
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,731
I'll calm down when you get me So Baek-ho.

261
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,192
- Get So Baek-ho right now!
- Who's that lunatic?

262
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,944
- Does he work here?
- Bring him to me!

263
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:06,572
He's the IR team's general manager
that got canned last week.

264
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,366
Mr. Cho!

265
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,869
Come on!

266
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,664
So Baek-ho.

267
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,333
You stay right there.

268
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,709
Get out of the way!

269
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,586
You come here, So Baek-ho.

270
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,255
Run.

271
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,798
Quick.

272
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,591
Aren't you going to run away?

273
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:41,941
Hey!

274
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,401
Baek-ho, open the door!

275
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,904
Calm down!

276
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:49,157
- Mr. Cho, calm down!
- You can act like a hooligan

277
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,575
all you want.

278
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,661
But why should
other people have to suffer?

279
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,580
They could've gotten hurt.

280
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,999
What are you talking about?

281
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,626
All right.

282
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,088
You're going to die,
right here, right now.

283
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:05,423
Baek-ho!

284
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,175
- This is insane.
- Hold on.

285
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,385
Why won't this open?

286
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,305
I'll kill you!

287
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,059
So Baek-ho!

288
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,103
Are you ready to pay for this?

289
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:20,897
- What?
- If I die,

290
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:25,234
you'll have to pay my family
to compensate for the damage.

291
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,820
Will you be able to cover that?

292
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,573
Money isn't the problem here.

293
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,826
You've insulted me--

294
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,245
It should be around 2.1 billion won.

295
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:39,957
Two…

296
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,419
Two point…

297
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,172
- Two point one billion?
- Yes.

298
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,966
My lost profits would be
two-thirds of my yearly salary

299
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,010
times thirty years
until my retirement age.

300
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,429
Even if you manage
to get a job after prison,

301
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,348
if you're earning minimum wage…

302
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,768
you'd have to work until you're 138.

303
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,229
And I don't believe it's very probable

304
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:02,855
that you'd live that long.

305
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,274
Wait, I can't do that.

306
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,611
Hey, shut up.

307
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:12,740
You ruined my life
as my family's provider.

308
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,367
I'm going to make you pay--

309
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,536
The head of a family should be cautious.

310
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,747
As soon as it's ruled that you're liable,
all of your savings,

311
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,000
including insurance, your car,
and your family's residence,

312
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,752
will be repossessed.

313
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:27,213
Repossessed?

314
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,965
I'm sure you know
what opportunity cost is.

315
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,497
Sure, you'd blow off some steam.

316
00:17:30,572 --> 00:17:32,426
But you'd also lose everything
and go to jail.

317
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,680
There's also the incalculable pain
that your family would go through.

318
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,349
Is killing me really worth all of that?

319
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,747
Tell me, what did I do wrong?

320
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,585
I gave 20 years of my life to this place.

321
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:10,047
All I ever did was work my ass off.

322
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,511
"Work your ass off"?

323
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,602
It seems like you're incapable
of evaluating yourself objectively.

324
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,854
I'll explain every reason
why you were fired,

325
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:25,978
so listen carefully.

326
00:18:26,353 --> 00:18:29,817
One, your antiquated mindset
that couldn't go with the flow.

327
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,570
- Two--
- Okay, I get it, you jerk!

328
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,738
Hey!

329
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,283
- Hey, you bastard!
- Come on.

330
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,785
Hurry up and open it.
He's going to kill him.

331
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:40,786
Here!

332
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,787
The master key.

333
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,372
- The master key.
- Finally.

334
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,418
Hey, let go!

335
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,794
- Baek-ho!
- Hey!

336
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,379
Mr. So, are you okay?

337
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,339
Hey!

338
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,342
- It hurts.
- Mr. Cho, are you okay?

339
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,802
Who should I ask if they're okay?

340
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,639
I forgot that he used to be
in the special forces.

341
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,932
Hey, CEO! Executive director!

342
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,768
Do you think
you're going to be here forever?

343
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:04,977
- Do you?
- Take him.

344
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,229
I hope you get fired tomorrow, assholes.

345
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:08,773
Okay? Hey.

346
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,817
You think you security guys are any safer?

347
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,903
I hope all of you get fired!

348
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,031
That'll be all.

349
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,035
Thank you.

350
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,706
- Are you hurt?
- No.

351
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,249
That's a relief.

352
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,461
Look, I get that you're not scared,
but he was crazy.

353
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,546
What if he was hiding a weapon?

354
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,052
You can't help
but draw attention, can you?

355
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,596
People are going to bug you
for at least two weeks.

356
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,391
They'll be talking about
how So Baek-ho beat up Mr. Cho.

357
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,685
- It'll be a mess.
- I'm used to it.

358
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,853
People are always talking about me.

359
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,066
You should go home. It's getting late.

360
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,359
What about you?

361
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,902
I can call a chauffeur for you.

362
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,029
No, I have somewhere to be.

363
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,656
Where…

364
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:01,409
Hey.

365
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,120
It's late. Where are you going?

366
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,706
THE TASTE OF HEAVEN! SUNNYEO FOOD

367
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,879
Come here. Come on.

368
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,883
Hi.

369
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,526
What?

370
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,746
Elizabeth, you're here.

371
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,248
I've been waiting for you.

372
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:36,295
This is from that gentleman over there.

373
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:38,380
Let's drink.

374
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:42,092
It's non-alcoholic, for your rotten liver.

375
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:44,762
Jeez.

376
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:48,140
You're both in your thirties
and this is how you drink barley tea?

377
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:49,934
Which movie inspired you this time?

378
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,685
Did you just say barley tea?

379
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:54,688
It's burdock root tea. Not from a tea bag.

380
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,233
I don't care about tea.

381
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,819
It's Elizabeth's bedtime.

382
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,530
Come on, go along with it.

383
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,281
We're trying to cheer you up.

384
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:05,699
That's right.

385
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:08,994
Why go to bed early
when your company's going under?

386
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:13,582
Who cares about work tomorrow?
Let's dance all night.

387
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:20,923
Wait.

388
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,686
How do you know my company's going under?

389
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,145
Nobody knows yet.

390
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:36,230
What?

391
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:38,858
Well…

392
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,361
Actually, he saw it

393
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,238
on the Wonhan stockholders' forum.

394
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,574
He bought their stocks.

395
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:49,201
- Ong-ju.
- Ungrateful prick.

396
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:52,329
We swore to boycott Wonhan until we die.

397
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:55,332
How could he give his money
to our family's enemy?

398
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:58,043
What family?
You're not even part of our family.

399
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,088
My beloved big sister.

400
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,925
I'm Kim Hwang-kyung. Every stock
I touch turns to stone.

401
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,428
You know how every stock I buy crashes.

402
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,305
Buying Wonhan's stocks

403
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,723
is a form of revenge!

404
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,141
Now that I've bought their stocks,

405
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,727
they'll have to watch
as their prices plummet!

406
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,649
I want to flip out on you,

407
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,360
but I don't have the energy for it.

408
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,117
I don't care.

409
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,871
My poor Mi-kyung.

410
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,706
How could something like this happen?

411
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:36,999
You barely made it out

412
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,585
when you ran away
from that crap show at Wonhan Retail.

413
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,670
Who says I ran away?

414
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,589
I quit with confidence.

415
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,633
That's right.

416
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,927
My little Mi-kyung was so confident.

417
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,511
Do you plan to stay there?

418
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:50,512
What do you think?

419
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:54,183
She'd have to sacrifice her pride
to work for Wonhan again.

420
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:59,063
Your amazing writer friend
can help you with your cover letter.

421
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,522
I won't charge much.

422
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,149
Just 600,000 won apiece.

423
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,568
You should just quit now.

424
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:07,821
You have bad manners and a short temper,

425
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:10,741
but you have no problem
doing whatever you're told.

426
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:11,951
That's right.

427
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:14,203
Who else would accept
a tiny salary like yours

428
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,413
while working like a dog?

429
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:17,581
So true.

430
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:20,167
You're the perfect cog
in the capitalistic machine.

431
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,169
Mi-kyung, don't be afraid to jump

432
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,963
into the world of job-hunting!

433
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,798
Into the world of job-hunting!

434
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:26,924
Pow!

435
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,593
Hey, come on!

436
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:33,305
Jeez, you're so annoying.

437
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,266
Turn the lights off!

438
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,938
She was nicer when she was smoking.

439
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,164
Okay, thanks.

440
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,672
They're completely taking over.

441
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,298
Sunnyeo Food will cease to exist.

442
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:11,135
We'll just be
a part of Wonhan's F&B department.

443
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,722
This is good news for you guys.

444
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,807
It's better to work for a bigger company.

445
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,101
Wonhan is way more stable
than Sunnyeo Food,

446
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,477
and they should have more benefits.

447
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,271
So no one is getting laid off?

448
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:26,150
They're buying out the employees,
so we'll just have to see.

449
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,571
Will you be okay?

450
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,490
I heard about the scene
when you left Wonhan.

451
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:34,533
Well…

452
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,619
No big deal.

453
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:37,054
It's fine.

454
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:40,015
I don't care about those Wonhan jerks.

455
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:43,185
I'm going to have a potato
named after me before I die.

456
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,684
SUNNYEO FOOD TECHNOLOGY LAB
NEW PRODUCT RESEARCH TEAM 2

457
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,060
POTATO LAB

458
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,736
Potato Lab?

459
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,285
They need a lab for potatoes?

460
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:48,125
THREE WEEKS LATER

461
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,020
Whoa, MK.

462
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,272
Are you sure this is a good idea?

463
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,316
Why? What's so wrong
with what we're doing?

464
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,775
Well, I mean…

465
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,446
we're just here
for a meeting with the HR team.

466
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,864
We're kinda overdressed.

467
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,533
I told you we should've just
put on our big event suits,

468
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,243
and not look too flashy.

469
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,122
Guys, quit being so damn naive.

470
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,957
My fellow Potato Lab workers.

471
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,627
You need to get it together.

472
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,878
In our modern society

473
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,671
and fast-paced nation,

474
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:37,841
it takes two days for express mail
to reach any part of the country.

475
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:40,427
They just had to drag us
all the way from Gangwon-do

476
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,179
to Wonhan's head office in Seoul,

477
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,348
just so we can fill out HR forms.
Why is that?

478
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,266
It's because they look down on our lab.

479
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,269
No, this isn't just a simple visit.

480
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:51,188
This is a prelude to war.

481
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:54,441
We have to win this one,
so that they won't look down on us.

482
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,361
Okay, just shut up, please.

483
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,364
You've been yapping the entire trip.

484
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,783
In a way, she's right.

485
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,494
I've heard from former colleagues
who now work for Wonhan

486
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,497
that they're looked down upon
because they're from Sunnyeo Food.

487
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,582
- Really?
- Telling us to come all the way here

488
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,459
is just another power move.

489
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,795
Now that we're on the same page,
let's get started.

490
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,172
My toes are being
squished to death as we speak.

491
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,091
Okay? Let's go.

492
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,551
With the spirit of Daeseolryeong!

493
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:26,223

You can't park here.

517
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,023
Move your car right now.

518
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:37,062
What is this? It's like a five-star hotel.

519
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,438
It smells nice, too.

520
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,733
Look at how much money
they put into this place.

521
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:44,194
What's Wonhan's net worth again?

522
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,779
8.5 trillion won.

523
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,656
Are you serious? That's crazy.

524
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,075
Anyway, where are we supposed to go?

525
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,121
Are you from the Potato Lab?

526
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,206
Yes, we are.

527
00:31:56,873 --> 00:32:00,001
It must've been a while
since you were in Seoul.

528
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:02,546
I was in Yeongdeungpo last week.

529
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:03,839
For a wedding.

530
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,801
I see. Okay, then.

531
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,845
I'm Choi Ji-hyun,
the HR Assistant Manager.

532
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,012
- Follow me.
- Sure.

533
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:13,890
Let's go.

534
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,538
Thank you for coming all this way.

535
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,874
Wonhan is a big company,

536
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:41,168
so HR is always buried in work.

537
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:42,461
Yes, of course.

538
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,963
- Have a seat.
- Yes.

539
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:53,930
Get up.

540
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:59,186
By the way, I didn't know
there was a Potato Lab.

541
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,438
What do you guys do?

542
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:04,065
Do you guys research the best way

543
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,776
to boil potatoes or something?

544
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,861
Excuse me.

545
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,489
Was that a joke?

546
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:13,241
That's what they do
in restaurant kitchens,

547
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,160
not in a laboratory.

548
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,458
Here's what we do at the Potato Lab.

549
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:25,587
<i>We study potatoes, the most important</i>
<i>vegetable in human history.</i>

550
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,047
<i>We develop new varieties,</i>

551
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:30,967
<i>and monitor seed potatoes,</i>
<i>which are the precious assets</i>

552
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:33,136
<i>of thousands of farms</i>
<i>all over the country.</i>

553
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,262
Hello, ladies!

554
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:35,931
<i>We communicate with farmers</i>

555
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,558
<i>to improve farming quality</i>
<i>and productivity.</i>

556
00:33:39,558 --> 00:33:42,521
We're a cutting-edge organization
in the Korean agricultural--

557
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:43,772
- Mi-kyung!
- Yes?

558
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:46,066
Your nails.

559
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,443
- What is this?
- That's dirt.

560
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:50,695
Did you not wash your hands?

561
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:51,696
I did.

562
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:58,286
Anyway,

563
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,997
what we do is strictly scientific.

564
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:04,042
I could go on and on,
but you wouldn't get it.

565
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,507
I'm sure you're right. Ms. Choi?

566
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,466
Yes.

567
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:15,345
These are personnel forms.

568
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:19,140
They're supposed to be handwritten,
so make sure your writing is recognizable

569
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:22,143
and there are no errors.

570
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:25,772
Turn in your photos,
so I can give you your ID badges today.

571
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,899
We didn't hear anything about photos.

572
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,944
Well, I told you. Maybe you just forgot.

573
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,779
Excuse me, you told us--

574
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,531
You can just take them right now.

575
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,284
The cameras on your phones
should be good enough.

576
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,327
They're our ID photos, we can't--

577
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,746
We're in HR and we're saying it's okay.

578
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,707
I hope you'll cooperate.

579
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:47,627
Let's do it then.

580
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:50,255
Get up.

581
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,342
She never told me about the photos.

582
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,469
She really didn't.

583
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:13,695
Sorry.

584
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:16,072
Could you not frown so much?

585
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:18,908
This is just how I look.

586
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,829
Go on, take it.

587
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:24,497
Okay.

588
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,177
Assistant Manager Kim Mi-kyung.

589
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,638
You worked at the Wonhan
SSM HQ for six years.

590
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:41,681
Maybe that's…

591
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,893
why you seem familiar to me.

592
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:52,275
My looks are too good to forget.

593
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,694
I was infamous back then

594
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,863
as the Scarlett Johansson of Planning.

595
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:59,199
- Okay.
- Look here, please.

596
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:11,503
POTATO LAB

597
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:18,468
That tiny truck is no good.

598
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:21,429
We need at least
a five-ton truck to carry potatoes.

599
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:24,015
Yes, look into that.

600
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:25,850
Give me a second.

601
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:27,519
Excuse me!

602
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,145
Hello!

603
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:32,941
What brings you here?

604
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:43,201
- This looks like a wanted poster.
- Do I look like this?

605
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,453
That looks good. Take a look at mine.

606
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,580
Excuse me.

607
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:53,545
Now that we have our employee IDs,

608
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:57,841
does this mean our lab is safe
from restructuring or lay-offs?

609
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,845
That's not up to us.

610
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,139
The company will make a decision.

611
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,766
- Have a safe trip back.
- Thank you.

612
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:14,190
"The company will make a decision"?

613
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:15,859
What does that mean?

614
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:17,444
Does it mean

615
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:20,071
they'll get rid of our lab?

616
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:21,072
What nonsense.

617
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:24,367
If there's no potato lab
at a potato chip company,

618
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:26,619
how would it even function?

619
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:29,038
- Okay, I got it.
- Be careful what you say.

620
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:30,123
Hey.

621
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,002
Mr. Park.

622
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:38,840
What's going on?

623
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:43,011
Who, not what! Someone from Wonhan
is here to do an inspection.

624
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,555
He does organizational innovation,
whatever that means!

625
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:46,890
Inspection…

626
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,937
Are they crazy?
Who does a surprise inspection like this?

627
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,397
Without making an appointment.

628
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,566
What did I tell you? This is what they do.

629
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:59,360
If two demons had a baby,
that would be Wonhan.

630
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,988
Shut up, Mi-kyung.
My ears are bleeding!

631
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,992
That way! Hello.

632
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,621
- Why won't this work?
- Yeah, why?

633
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,873
- Excuse me!
- There's no time. Just jump over.

634
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,750
- Jump over.
- How am I supposed to do that?

635
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,211
They're not watching us.
Come on, Chung-hyun!

636
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,295
I'm Hee-dong.

637
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,963
Be careful.

638
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,840
Be careful, Mr. Bu!

639
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:22,759
- Come on.
- My goodness.

640
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,052
One, two, three!

641
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,014
Whatever.

642
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:31,351
Try to squeeze through.

643
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,561
You've had enough kids already.

644
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,190
What? Oh, yes.

645
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:08,346
What's going on here?
Excuse me, are you okay?

646
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,806
- Gosh.
- Excuse me.

647
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:13,226
I'm good.

648
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:17,230
Shall we, Mr. Park?

649
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,398
Yes.

650
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,983
I think someone should help her.

651
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,150
- We will.
- Yes.

652
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:26,614
You can't stay there, please move.

653
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:27,866
I will, sorry.

654
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:31,703
Ms. Kim!

655
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:35,331
Assistant Manager Kim Mi-kyung, follow me.

656
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,793
Why did he have to use my full name?

657
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:50,638
Kim Mi-kyung?

658
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:37,268
Mr. Park, we have to go.

659
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:51,449
Did that woman just flip us off?

660
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:54,744
Let's go.

661
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,537
Jeez.

662
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,456
What was that?

663
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,876
What a strange person.

664
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:03,878
Do you know her?

665
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,090
We went to the same school.

666
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,091
Sorry?

667
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,134
That girl's always been trouble.

668
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:13,471
It's been a while.
I should buy her a drink.

669
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,474
So you're friends with her.

670
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,148
Give me one second.

671
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:26,943
Sir, what about the meeting?

672
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,656
Sorry, excuse me.

673
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,825
The woman that was lying there just now.

674
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,785
Could you tell me where she's from?

675
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,787
- Her name is Kim Mi-kyung.
- Yes, of course.

676
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,790
I'd have to look it up.

677
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,375
Just a moment, please.

678
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,918
You know what? Forget it.

679
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,878
It's fine. Thank you so much!

680
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,812
Where did she go?

681
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,150
- Hee-dong, start the car.
- Yes, sir!

682
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:11,279
Oh my.

683
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:13,740
What the--

684
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:15,992
What is she doing?

685
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,872
MK, what are you doing? Get in the car!

686
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,832
- Oh, yes.
- Come on!

687
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:23,791
Yes, sorry.

688
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:27,295
Hold on.

689
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,921
Why is it so packed in here?

690
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:31,466
- Chung-hyun, go!
- I told you, I'm Hee-dong.

691
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,015
POTATO LAB

692
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,355
- Quick, hurry.
- Let's go.

693
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:49,609
Hurry, quickly.

694
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,197
Yes, but--

695
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,575
You're not supposed to open
the office door for anyone.

696
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,035
You…

697
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:01,996
POTATOES, THE FUTURE OF FARMING
AND HUMANITY

698
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:29,148
Oh wow.

699
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,110
Oh, damn.

700
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:33,694
Is he an actor?

701
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:35,780
Excuse me…

702
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:40,159
Does anyone like chamomile tea?

703
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:42,537
Sorry?

704
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:44,747
What…

705
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,125
No one?

706
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:49,502
Then…

707
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,965
if nobody likes chamomile tea,

708
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:57,677
why buy two, four, six, eight, ten,

709
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:00,221
twelve boxes of it?

710
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,810
They've been sitting here untouched,
they expired months ago.

711
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:09,730
This is a textbook waste
of the employee benefits budget.

712
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:30,293
Do you use a lot of copier paper?

713
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:34,005
Well, we are a laboratory.

714
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,090
So, we read a lot of research papers.

715
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:38,801
Do you need 90-gram paper for that?

716
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,554
I think 75-gram would be enough.

717
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:45,474
I'd have to review
the budget for supplies as well.

718
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:46,559
Excuse me.

719
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,103
I get that you're from corporate.

720
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:51,689
- But you can't just go through--
- I didn't.

721
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,649
I just checked the supplies.

722
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:54,942
And for the record,

723
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,236
this office is the property
of Wonhan Retail,

724
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,989
and I represent Wonhan Retail.

725
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:03,451
Therefore, legally,
morally, and ethically,

726
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:04,911
there are no problems.

727
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:11,876
Any more questions?

728
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,252
It is morally problematic.

729
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:16,255
You can't just
ambush us with an inspection--

730
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:17,548
Are you saying

731
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:20,968
that I should've given you
enough time to cover up your flaws?

732
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:24,722
That wouldn't be an inspection.

733
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:29,101
It would be
a carefully coordinated meeting.

734
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:35,650
Assistant Manager Kim Mi-kyung?

735
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:44,742
Right…

736
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,120
I haven't introduced myself.

737
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:56,128
I'm Director So Baek-ho from Wonhan
Retail's Strategic Planning Department.

738
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:57,588
- Yes, of course.
- Hello.

739
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,277
That man seems to be made
of stainless steel.

740
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:20,695
God.

741
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,989
What I wouldn't give
to punch him in the mouth.

742
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:23,990
I shouldn't, right?

743
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:26,158
That's what adulthood is all about.

744
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,577
If I'd beaten up whoever I wanted,

745
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:30,413
I would be in jail for life.

746
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:33,791
It makes me lose faith
in humanity a little.

747
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,751
He has such a beautiful exterior,

748
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:37,378
but an asshole interior.

749
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,797
It's like some sort of cruel joke.

750
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,675
What do you mean by "beautiful exterior"?

751
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,135
He just has nice skin

752
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,012
and he's tall.

753
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:47,471
He also smells nice.

754
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:49,890
Whatever.

755
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,101
That Wonhan bastard.

756
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,104
I hope something hits you in the head!

757
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,485
<i>Hits you in the head!</i>

758
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,654
<i>In the head!</i>

759
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:08,701
I'll see you soon, then.

760
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:10,911
Have a safe trip back.

761
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:40,649
What was that?

762
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,364
SUNNYEO, MAGPIE
POWER UNKNOWN

763
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:47,990
LAB RANKING NO.1
SAVED BY MI-KYUNG

764
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:49,909
WAS ON "WHAT ON EARTH"
LOOK IT UP

765
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:59,043
Whoa, hey! Go away.

766
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,252
Go away!

767
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:16,143
Look at that.

768
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:18,270
- Hey.
- Oh my god.

769
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:21,023
Sunnyeo! Oh my gosh.

770
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:31,242
Good grief!

771
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,411
Hey! Go away.

772
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:35,329
No, he can't go that way.

773
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:36,414
- What do we do?
- Gosh.

774
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:38,374
You've got to be kidding.

775
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:39,667
Be careful!

776
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,752
- Watch out!
- Mi-kyung!

777
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:43,170
You're going to get hurt!

778
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,466
Sunnyeo!

779
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:50,052
Wait up! Sunnyeo!

780
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:52,930
Sunnyeo!

781
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:55,433
What? Oh, wait!

782
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,518
Hold on.

783
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,603
Where are you going?

784
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,313
Hey, no!

785
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:03,441
Jeez.

786
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:06,318
What are you doing?

787
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,490
Jesus.

788
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:28,048
Hey, wait!

789
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:30,426
He won't stop rolling away.

790
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:38,893
Try to stop! Where are you going?

791
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:45,483
Jeez!

792
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:47,860
NEW EMPLOYEES

793
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,286
Ms. Jjeon, he's rolling downhill!

794
00:49:57,912 --> 00:49:58,996
- Stop him!
- What's that?

795
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,956
- Oh gosh.
- Ms. Jjeon! Quick!

796
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,625
- Stop him, please!
- Oh my goodness.

797
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,919
God, what is happening?

798
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,379
- Oh, no.
- Like this!

799
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:09,298
Where's he going?

800
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:11,425
Oh my goodness.

801
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:13,219
What's this all about?

802
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:15,763
He just rolled all the way down.

803
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:16,931
Oh, no.

804
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:21,852
- Are you okay?
- He's hurt.

805
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:24,855
- Hello?
- He's bleeding.

806
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:27,107
- How did this happen?
- Wait, hold on.

807
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:29,193
- Sunnyeo.
- What? Sunnyeo?

808
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:30,694
Hey.

809
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:33,072
- Are you hurt?
- Look at his face.

810
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:37,451
GANGWON-DO PYEONGWON HOSPITAL

811
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,664
Your test results are normal.

812
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:45,459
If you find yourself
feeling dizzy or nauseous,

813
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:46,544
please come back.

814
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:47,753
- Okay.
- That's all.

815
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:58,931
Consider yourself lucky.

816
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:01,976
I thought this was going to make the news.

817
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,269
It was expected.

818
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:05,521
I made sure to keep the injuries minimal.

819
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:08,315
Sorry?

820
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,364
You must be startled.

821
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:18,450
That bird is named Sunnyeo.

822
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:21,120
It's an azure-winged magpie
that hangs out around the lab.

823
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:23,330
They're known
to attack people sometimes.

824
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:25,499
Especially during breeding season.

825
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,418
They tend to attack more often.

826
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,295
Sounds like a dangerous animal.

827
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:31,171
For the safety of lab employees,

828
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:32,798
there needs to be a solution.

829
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:35,843
What solution?

830
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:39,513
You can just use a book
or an umbrella to cover your head.

831
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:42,516
And Sunnyeo doesn't just attack anyone.

832
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,018
They only attack when I…

833
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:53,193
This isn't my fault, you know.

834
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:56,822
It's not like I made a wish
so that the bird would attack you.

835
00:51:57,448 --> 00:51:58,407
No.

836
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:01,619
Thank you for bringing me to the hospital.

837
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:02,745
You can leave now.

838
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:07,499
Okay. That's what I was going to do.

839
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,753
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

840
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:12,588
Here.

841
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:21,680
Shoot.

842
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:26,769
So what are you going to do?

843
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:29,313
With our lab.

844
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,732
I don't think you visited out of boredom.

845
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:34,891
I know what it means for someone
in Wonhan's Planning Department

846
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:35,866
to come inspect us.

847
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:38,656
I'm telling you this for your information.

848
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:40,240
Studying potato varieties

849
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:43,702
is more complicated
and time-consuming than you might think.

850
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:45,245
I know that from the numbers,

851
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:47,956
it seems like
we're just draining the budget.

852
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,877
I mean, we have been
having issues with output.

853
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:54,421
But we're trying our best

854
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:56,090
and we're getting closer to success.

855
00:52:56,173 --> 00:53:00,594
Anyway, I hope you'll be able
to see the big picture.

856
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:05,933
"Draining the budget."

857
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:10,312
You're perfectly aware
of your position in the company.

858
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:11,271
What…

859
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:14,733
Hey.

860
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:18,737
I can speak about my company
in a self-deprecating way.

861
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:20,864
- But you can't--
- I'm aware.

862
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:22,825
The lab is doing its best.

863
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:27,079
Maroo K-2001.

864
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:29,790
How do you know that name?

865
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:32,056
I saw it at the lab earlier.

866
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,711
MAROO K-2001
KO, KIM

867
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:35,295
<i>The number 2001</i>

868
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:38,549
<i>means that there were</i>
<i>2000 versions before that one.</i>

869
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:39,883
MAROO K-2399
KO, KIM

870
00:53:39,964 --> 00:53:41,343
<i>Even if they all look the same,</i>

871
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:44,471
<i>it would mean that</i>
<i>all of those samples are different.</i>

872
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:45,931
<i>Every single potato.</i>

873
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:48,767
It was impressive.

874
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:50,310
That's my personal impression.

875
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:52,438
But the Potato Lab is an R&D department,

876
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:55,149
so it's difficult to apply a general KPI.

877
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,817
In order to examine the HPPG

878
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,944
and convert the performance
into financial terms,

879
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,904
we'd need the quantitative,
qualitative data--

880
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,448
Hold on.

881
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:04,199
K, H, what?

882
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:07,286
We're both Korean.
Let's speak in our language.

883
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:08,871
I won't be quick to judge.

884
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:11,165
We'll keep the lab for now.

885
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,459
Don't worry and focus on your work.

886
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:16,587
Okay.

887
00:54:19,298 --> 00:54:20,382
That's fine.

888
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,761
We worked hard as a team.

889
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:27,222
Before Maroo K,
there were also Maroo J and I.

890
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:29,558
There were tens of thousands of samples.

891
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,935
Anyway, I really have to go now.

892
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:34,646
I'll see you soon.

893
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:45,532
Sunnyeo?

894
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,270
Hey!

895
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:18,982
Sunnyeo Food's final remnant,

896
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:20,526
Kim Mi-kyung!

897
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:23,070
How was it?
Did you kick Wonhan's butt?

898
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:24,196
Did you?

899
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:29,993
Jeez, how rude.

900
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:32,830
Hey!

901
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:35,874
Kim Mi-kyung!

902
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,392
Assistant Manager Kim Mi-kyung.

903
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:56,353
You worked at the Wonhan
SSM HQ for six years.

904
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:06,363
- Yes, sir.
- Mr. Lee…

905
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:07,739
The HR team has to…

906
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,381
Hey, Mi-kyung.

907
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:27,593
You should just go back to smoking.

908
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:31,054
You'll die young,
but you'll be happier while you're alive.

909
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,351
What's wrong?

910
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:38,937
Did something happen?

911
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:47,446
Mi-kyung.

912
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,074
I saw Ki-se.

913
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:52,910
What?

914
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:54,953
He's doing good.

915
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:59,625
He's already an executive director.

916
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:01,376
He's doing well for himself.

917
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,796
After everything he's done to me,

918
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:07,466
he's doing fine.

919
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:12,930
It's so unfair.

920
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:19,561
Every birthday,
I wish that he'd just drop dead.

921
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,899
Or at the very least, be castrated.

922
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,944
That's what I wished for every year.

923
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:29,571
But he's doing fine.

924
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,369
My life is so insignificant.

925
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:39,957
At Wonhan,

926
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:42,751
I felt like a pariah all day…

927
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:47,130
constantly afraid of being recognized.

928
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:50,092
But he's…

929
00:57:54,346 --> 00:57:55,597
Mi-kyung.

930
00:57:57,057 --> 00:57:59,434
I'm not crying. My eyes are just dry.

931
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,037
Mi-kyung.

932
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,331
It's not too late.

933
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:27,504
Just say the word,
and I'll take care of him.

934
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:31,133
After that,
I'll immediately flee the country,

935
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:34,511
living a dangerous life
as a fugitive from Interpol.

936
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:37,514
Maybe I'll meet a CIA agent
with amnesia along the way

937
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:38,557
and fall in love.

938
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:42,102
Are you seriously
writing a novel right now?

939
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,895
It's not a novel, it's a movie.

940
00:58:43,979 --> 00:58:46,356
I rewatched <i>The Bourne Identity</i> earlier.

941
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,070
That's right.

942
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:54,656
Don't keep it bottled up. Let it all out.

943
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:57,075
And who knows?

944
00:58:57,826 --> 00:58:59,953
The "drop dead" wish
might not have come true,

945
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:02,289
but maybe the other one did.

946
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:05,667
Just imagine.

947
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:08,879
Sports cars
in all the colors of the rainbow.

948
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:12,257
A huge apartment
overlooking the Han River.

949
00:59:12,841 --> 00:59:13,717
But…

950
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,637
his life has no meaning.
He spends his nights alone.

951
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:22,100
He looks down at the city in tears.

952
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:25,937
"Oh god."

953
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:28,940
"I can't believe…

954
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,069
that I'm a eunuch!"

955
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,988
<i>I'm a eunuch.</i>

956
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:41,244
Hey.

957
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:44,247
Are you laughing?

958
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:48,919
You are! You're laughing.

959
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,962
You're so annoying, Ong-ju.

960
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,507
- Hey.
- I can hear your butt growing hair.

961
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,633
Elizabeth.

962
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:56,426
What is wrong with you?

963
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:57,844
If you laugh while crying,

964
00:59:57,928 --> 00:59:59,429
- your butt grows hair.
- Stop it!

965
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:01,932
- Let's see if it's growing!
- I said stop!

966
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:07,104
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR PARK KI-SE

967
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:09,856
This is So Baek-ho.

968
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,196
Could you say that again?

969
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:40,595
What is this?

970
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,143
Looks like you guys
are cleaning up a crime scene.

971
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:47,727
Why are you working so hard?

972
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:49,521
Of course we're working hard.

973
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:52,107
When was the last time we had a customer?

974
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,651
I’ll give every ounce of myself

975
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:56,862
to make sure our guest is satisfied.

976
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:59,364
Stop talking like that.

977
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:01,116
You sound like a creep.

978
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:02,075
I am a creep.

979
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:04,452
All right, see you.

980
01:01:04,536 --> 01:01:05,745
Bye, breadwinner.

981
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:07,789
- Bye!
- Bye.

982
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,584
POTATO LAB

THE POTATO'S JOURNEY

984
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:14,588
You're going to Goryeong today, right?

985
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,840
- Could you--
- Come with me.

986
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:17,883
Me?

987
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:20,969
Why?

988
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:27,350
Where are you going?

989
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:31,771
POTATO LAB CHIEF HONG SOON-IK

990
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,276
Jung-hae, you're here.

991
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,403
Could you carry this down
to the parking lot?

992
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:41,698
I can't break my back on my last day.

993
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:42,866
What did you say?

994
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:46,912
What do you mean by "your last day"?

995
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:49,039
It means it's my last day.

996
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:53,210
I'm unemployed now.

997
01:01:54,336 --> 01:01:57,464
I get that they're taking over,
but they can't just do this.

998
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,299
This is a wrongful termination.

999
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,468
Could you please seek legal advice?

1000
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:09,976
Don't be so down.

1001
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:12,062
I held this job for a long time.

1002
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:13,480
I'm okay with it.

1003
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:19,110
How about
a beef BBQ party tonight? My treat.

1004
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:21,363
My goodness.

1005
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,740
CEO YOON SE-JIN

1006
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:25,075
EMPLOYEE RESIGNATIONS

1007
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:27,661
Three people from
the Production Team resigned.

1008
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,412
It's really starting now.

1009
01:02:29,955 --> 01:02:30,872
What is?

1010
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:33,166
The storm brewing at Wonhan.

1011
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:38,838
We're like little sample bottles of lotion
that come with Sunnyeo Food.

1012
01:02:38,922 --> 01:02:42,425
They don't really need us, but we're here.

1013
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:44,552
So they squeeze as hard as possible

1014
01:02:44,636 --> 01:02:46,137
until nothing is left.

1015
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:50,100
But there must be an upside to this.

1016
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:56,731
Wonhan will send us
one of their own as our chief.

1017
01:02:56,815 --> 01:02:59,150
So maybe they'll help us improve.

1018
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:00,652
Hee-dong.

1019
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:02,946
When someone's trying
to sell you insurance…

1020
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:05,782
- Yes?
- Make sure to ask me about it first.

1021
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:09,286
Okay.

1022
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:19,546
Just drive it in there.

1023
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,923
You just focus on the ladder.

1025
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,311
Jae-cheol is doing great today.

1026
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:36,604
Tell me if something looks off.

1027
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:38,398
Let's finish up so we can get coffee.

1028
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:39,858
I could go for lunch.

1029
01:03:42,027 --> 01:03:45,655
I won't be quick to judge.
We'll keep the lab for now.

1030
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:48,366
Don't worry and focus on your work.

1031
01:03:49,034 --> 01:03:50,910
He made me let my guard down.

1032
01:03:51,995 --> 01:03:53,163
Those Wonhan bastards.

1033
01:03:57,584 --> 01:04:00,170
All right. Send whoever you want.

1034
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:03,423
I'll show them what hell is.

1035
01:04:53,932 --> 01:04:56,017
Kyung-mi! Hey!

1036
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:58,019
Huge news, huge.

1037
01:04:58,103 --> 01:05:01,189
Today, in Ward B…

1038
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:03,691
Damn it.

1039
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:05,568
Am I invisible?

1040
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:11,157
<i>Kim Mi-kyung, do not touch!</i>

1041
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:13,493
<i>The Mi-kyung Anti-smoking Union.</i>

1042
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:14,661
KIM MI-KYUNG
DO NOT TOUCH!

1043
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:32,887
Four, eight…

1044
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:36,057
eight, five.

1045
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:34,866
What…

1046
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:38,161
Why are you doing this to me?

1047
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:46,294
Let me move on.

1048
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:48,296
Just leave me alone!

1049
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:51,883
You Wonhan bastards!

1050
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:23,957
Go away.

1051
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:26,709
If you mess with me right now,

1052
01:07:26,793 --> 01:07:29,754
I'll kill you,
I don't care that you're my brother.

1053
01:07:41,808 --> 01:07:43,810
Just piss off!

1054
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:46,980
I'm sorry.

1055
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:50,275
For being a Wonhan bastard.

1056
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:16,759
What the fuck?

1057
01:08:45,163 --> 01:08:46,998
- Hey, Hwan-kyung.
- Yeah?

1058
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:49,292
Help me out here.

1059
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:53,713
The boss that I despise
turns out to be my next-door neighbor.

1060
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:55,423
The protagonist is shocked.

1061
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:57,675
Is this a terrible ending?

1062
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:02,013
It is. I've seen that about 7,000 times.

1063
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:05,600
You're right.
I would think the writer's lazy too.

1064
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:09,520
It's such a rom-com cliché.

1065
01:09:09,604 --> 01:09:12,106
THE BOSS I HATE IS MY NEIGHBOR

1066
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:35,088
This doesn't seem to be
a mere coincidence to me.

1067
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:37,382
Let me introduce myself properly.

1068
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:41,594
My goodness, you're alive!
