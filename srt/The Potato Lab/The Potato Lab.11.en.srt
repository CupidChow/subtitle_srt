THE POTATO LAB

2
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:50,384
Did you really do that to me?

3
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,136
Yes.

4
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,854
I just want to say this.

5
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,817
I'm so…

6
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,113
so sorry--

7
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:43,979
MY BELOVED PRINCESS

8
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,497
<i>Can you forgive me now?</i>

9
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:07,794
This was the biggest one I could find.

10
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,496
You can tell me anything at any time.

EPISODE 11
DISASTER

12
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:23,245
<i>Fried chicken in the morning is the best</i>

13
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:27,082
<i>Fried chicken, fried chicken…</i>

14
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,712
Jeez!

15
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,339
Why do you look like that?

16
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,050
You don't look human.

17
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,344
You're like some seaweed
that washed up on the beach

18
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,596
and dried out in the sun.

19
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,182
Do you have concealer?

20
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,226
Concealer couldn't fix you…

21
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,190
Yes, I do.

22
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,278
Try using the stick concealer
under the cushion foundation.

23
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,400
Good morning.

24
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,118
Mi-kyung.

25
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,902
Welcome, Ms. Kim.

26
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,112
- We're here to cater…
- To your every need.

27
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:22,906
This way, please.

28
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,412
What's going on?

29
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,339
We stole this
from Production this morning.

30
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,590
A brand-new chair.

31
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:45,971
Excuse me.

32
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,307
Hey! Come on.

33
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,309
- Hee-dong.
- Yes.

34
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,314
Pine needle tea.
It's great for stress relief.

35
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,150
I made it iced, just how you like it.

36
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:02,195
What is this? It's so annoying.

37
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,281
Did somebody poison the water cooler?

38
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,533
Why are they doing this?

39
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,201
Why do you think?

40
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,662
They became sworn brothers
so they could devote themselves

41
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,998
to serving you until you leave.

42
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,458
Gosh.

43
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,793
MK.

44
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,756
This is peppermint oil.

45
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,676
I know you tend to get angry

46
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,889
more often than others.
Every time that happens,

47
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,474
rub this behind your ears--

48
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,976
Knock it off!

49
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,812
Come on, guys.

50
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,690
Why do you think
I held off on telling you?

51
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,609
I knew you would overreact like this.

52
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:41,985
- So, I…
- Mr. Bu.

53
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,695
What?

54
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,491
That's not for me, is it?

55
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:51,244
What? No.

56
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,704
Of course not.

57
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:56,207
You know, this is for…

58
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:57,751
Ms. Jang.

59
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,755
I got this for our very own
Ms. Jang Seul-gi.

60
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:05,008
You've been working so hard lately.

61
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,302
- I have?
- Yes.

62
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,141
HOW TO START A BUSINESS

63
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:16,603
Is this the first thing you do at work?
"How to start a business"?

64
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:18,897
Ms. Jang.

65
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:24,486
Make sure you take this and live
a long, if somewhat unhealthy, life.

66
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,737
Okay.

67
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,574
Ms. Kim, can I have
a word with you outside?

68
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,202
Sure.

69
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:33,828
Go on.

70
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,374
Your belt is shedding glitter.

71
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,416
Jeez.

72
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,834
Dismissed!

73
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:47,968
- Here.
- Thank you.

74
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,135
No problem.

75
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,932
Ms. Kim, I wanted to ask you.

76
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,477
Do you speak any Vietnamese?

77
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,187
Vietnamese?

78
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,941
I know a couple of words.

79
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,526
<i>Bun cha</i> and <i>banh mi.</i>

80
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:09,114
- Why do you ask?
- It's nothing, really.

81
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:12,909
One of my friends
is going to Vietnam to study potatoes,

82
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,244
and there's a job opening there.

83
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,537
For a potato researcher?

84
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:16,705
Yes.

85
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,459
I tried my best to find something,
but that's all I got.

86
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,630
They're leaving in two weeks.

87
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,676
If you start preparing now,
you could make it.

88
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,220
I can't just disappear.

89
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,847
It's busiest right after the harvest.

90
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,684
Are you seriously worrying
about this place right now?

91
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,686
You need to think about your next step.

92
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,773
Anyway, I swore on my life as a researcher

93
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,234
that you're more than capable.

94
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,445
Living abroad might be difficult,

95
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,489
but apparently there are
a few more Koreans at the lab,

96
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,408
and you can keep working with potatoes.

97
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,326
Think about it.

98
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,205
I just did.

99
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,665
What?

100
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,460
- I don't want to go.
- Oh dear.

101
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,756
I'm going to see how the harvest goes,
take a look around the storage facilities,

102
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,342
and double-check the farm contracts.
I have too much to do.

103
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,136
The rest of us can do all of that.

104
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,221
The time I have left at the lab

105
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,099
is precious to me.

106
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,355
I don't want to get distracted
and waste it.

107
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,984
I'll do whatever I can until the end

108
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,653
and enter unemployment with dignity.

109
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:37,535
You're honest to a fault,
which sometimes makes you foolish.

110
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,040
I know. Why am I such a silly goose?

111
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,583
All right.

112
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,877
I get it.

113
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,507
Thank you, Mr. Bu.

114
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,884
For looking out for me.

115
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,095
Who says I'm looking out for you?

116
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,597
I was trying to get paid
to introduce you.

117
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,140
You just had to ruin that.

118
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,135
We worked hard on it.

119
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,349
Enjoy your lunch.

120
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,517
You too.

121
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,550
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

122
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,843
Right?

123
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,387
I'm worried.

124
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,640
I have so many things to worry about.

125
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,646
Hey, Chief! Chief So!

126
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,024
My goodness.

127
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,776
Good afternoon, everyone.

128
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,445
Good for who, exactly?

129
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,198
We’ve already heard the terrible news!

130
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,033
What news? What's going on?

131
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:43,578
Seriously, you still don't know?

132
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:47,081
Our very own Ms. Kim Mi-kyung
is leaving the lab.

133
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,292
Our handsome Chief here

134
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,293
fired her.

135
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,628
I thought you were engaged.

136
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,254
How could you fire your fiancée?

137
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,423
There seems to be a misunderstanding. We--

138
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,885
However I look at it,
that’s poor judgment on your part.

139
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,347
Our lab would fall apart without Ms. Kim.

140
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,974
From the Research Team
to the Production Team and the Work Team,

141
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,518
Ms. Kim is involved in all of them.

142
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:10,188
Here's something you might have missed.

143
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,606
Ms. Kim

144
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,401
is someone who could take a glass of water
and turn it into Hangang River.

145
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,863
So if I had to choose,
Ms. Kim should keep working

146
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:22,158
and you should stay home.

147
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,952
That's more reasonable!

148
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,370
Am I right?

149
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,621
I'm telling you once again--

150
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,666
Yes, that would be better!

151
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,002
You have the perfect build
for washing dishes.

152
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:33,962
- Right, Chief?
- Yes!

153
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,296
Wait a second.

154
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,174
So Ms. Kim is getting fired,

155
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,635
but the wedding's still on?

156
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,428
- Of course it is.
- Please stop!

157
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,181
Let me be very clear.

158
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,851
Ms. Kim and I are not planning
on getting married.

159
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,645
In fact, we broke up.

160
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:54,482
So please stop spreading false rumors
and making us uncomfortable.

161
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,779
What? Oh my gosh.

162
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,364
Seriously?

163
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,699
What did he say?

164
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,866
That's breaking news.

165
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,340
- What?
- What?

166
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:26,806
Oh, no.

167
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,645
Ms. Kim, are you doing okay?

168
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,857
- Sorry?
- I asked if you were doing okay.

169
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,944
Why do you ask?

170
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,700
That's my phone.

171
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,496
<i>- Big news!</i>
<i>- Chief So's official statement.</i>

172
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,916
<i>He and Ms. Kim broke off</i>
<i>their engagement. It's over!</i>

173
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,718
Eat your lunch, everyone.

174
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,571
Why would you go around saying that?

175
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,697
Sorry?

176
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,533
I heard you told people
that it's over between us.

177
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,370
Did you really have to announce it?

178
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,498
I didn't announce it.
I was just correcting them.

179
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,709
People will keep talking about us,

180
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,587
and it will make you uncomfortable
every time they do.

181
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,091
And you thought I'd enjoy

182
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,843
hearing other people gossip
about our breakup?

183
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,887
Ever since people found out
I was getting fired,

184
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,182
they've been pitying me
and it's making me so uncomfortable.

185
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,143
So why did you give them
another reason to talk about me?

186
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,481
It was inconsiderate of me.

187
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,234
I'm sorry.

188
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,487
At this point,

189
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,156
your thoughts or intentions don't matter.

190
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,993
You're like a natural disaster to me.

191
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,246
You show up wherever I go,

192
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,916
destroying everything I've built
and everything I'm dreaming of…

193
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,171
This isn't the first time…

194
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,382
you've done that.

195
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,350
I…

196
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,896
don't want any drama
during the time I have left,

197
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,316
so I'm trying my best
to act like everything's fine.

198
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,569
So…

199
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,323
could you please just leave me alone?

200
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,368
What do you want me to do?

201
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,289
All we do now is greet each other.

202
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,834
How much more distance
do you need to feel comfortable?

203
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,628
Just stay away from me!

204
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,797
I don't want to see or hear you!

205
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:22,690
I understand.

206
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,651
I'll try my best…

207
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:30,531
to avoid running into you.
I'll be more careful.

208
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:55,515
CHIEF'S OFFICE

209
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:40,101
Honeybun. How many <i>mandu</i>
would you like in your soup?

210
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,853
- Twelve.
- They're really big.

211
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,314
Twelve.

212
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:48,734
I swear, you'll die from overeating
one of these days.

213
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,861
Wait, honeybun.

214
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,448
Didn't Mi-kyung feel a bit off today?

215
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,702
I only saw her back
as she was leaving. Why?

216
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,956
Just like a ghost that's been trapped
in a limestone cave for 500 years,

217
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,000
she was exuding a spooky energy.

218
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,460
She looked like a character
from <i>The Lord of the Rings,</i>

219
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,879
but she wasn't one of the good guys.

220
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,464
Do you know what I'm saying?

221
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,509
You're basically saying
she looked like a mess.

222
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,637
Don't you ever think
that the way you talk is inefficient?

223
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:17,680
Anyway,

224
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:21,851
a huge emotional tornado
swept through this room last night.

225
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,562
I'm determined to find a clue.

226
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,481
How long have you been here?

227
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,109
Twenty-seven minutes.

228
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,945
And you missed that?

229
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,908
Wait, what's that doing there?

230
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,538
Also, remember how she wanted the diffuser
Ward B gave her to last longer

231
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:43,873
and told us not to breathe?

232
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:45,124
I do.

233
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,376
She was being so extra and super mean.

234
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,588
- I don't see that, either.
- What?

235
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,966
I also don't see the picture
that was there.

236
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:55,885
Wait a second.

237
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:01,307
- You don't think--
- Think what? What is it?

238
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,566
MY BELOVED PRINCESS

239
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,504
Welcome home, Mi-kyung!

240
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,547
You crushed it today!

241
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,428
Oh my gosh, the trash can.

242
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:42,973
Why did you go through my trash?

243
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:46,477
- Pass.
- Pass.

244
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:49,563
All right.

245
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,692
I'm tired, so let's skip
the whole interrogation.

246
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,570
So Baek-ho and I are done, okay?

247
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,615
Go ahead and have dinner without me.
I'm gonna go lie down.

248
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,617
Wait…

249
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,228
Mi-kyung.

250
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:34,233
I'm guessing you're not ready
to talk about it yet?

251
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:40,698
Okay. I won't bother you.

252
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,576
What is wrong with me?

253
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,788
Nothing is wrong with you!

254
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:51,250
Getting dumped by some guy
doesn't mean anything has to change.

255
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,252
Keep your head up and live your life.

256
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,963
Why do you automatically
assume that I got dumped?

257
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,133
You didn't?

258
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,471
Well…

259
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,600
Up until a few days ago,

260
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,311
just thinking about So Baek-ho
made you smile at the dinner table.

261
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,104
It's more likely that he ended it.

262
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:16,859
So what happened? Why did you dump him?

263
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,446
I never dumped him. It's just that…

264
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,954
Something made me…

265
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,583
very disappointed
in So Baek-ho as a person.

266
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:40,424
You know what it was like for me
when I left Wonhan, right?

267
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,927
How could I forget?

268
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,514
To this day,
it still makes me grind my teeth.

269
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:47,598
Mine too.

270
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,101
It still keeps me up at night
thinking about how unfair it was.

271
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,396
But I found out…

272
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,692
that So Baek-ho was
one of the people who tortured me.

273
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,905
- What?
- I still…

274
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,534
want to try and understand him.

275
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,871
He was just following orders.

276
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:13,707
And he didn't even know who I was.

277
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:14,667
But…

278
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,753
it still makes me mad.

279
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,588
The fact that the person I like

280
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:23,467
was partially responsible for
the most horrible time of my life…

281
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,556
The fact that he played a role in it…

282
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,559
makes me so mad.

283
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:33,978
Gosh.

284
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,980
Isn't it funny?

285
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,399
In my effort to move on from all of that,

286
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:41,402
I ran far away to the mountains
and left everything behind.

287
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,738
But I just couldn't get away.

288
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,994
It almost makes me think that it's karma.

289
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,996
Why would you think that?

290
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,414
You did nothing to deserve that.

291
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,916
After all I've been through,
I still trusted him.

292
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:59,420
I saw the good parts that he showed me

293
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,255
and thought they were everything.

294
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,010
I got my hopes up
believing he was a nice guy.

295
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,598
I feel so stupid and pathetic.

296
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:16,270
I'm just sick of it all.

297
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:22,735
That's it.

298
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,697
Talking about it with you
will only make me cry.

299
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,618
I'm going to bed early.
I don't want to think about anything.

300
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,456
Okay.

301
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:37,625
Sleep well.

302
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,336
Don't dream about anything.

303
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,027
What's wrong, honeybun?

304
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,112
Did Mi-kyung lash out at you?

305
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:10,324
I told you not to talk to her right now.

306
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,535
- It's nothing like that.
- What is it, then?

307
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,371
Are you sad because they broke up?

308
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:18,749
I swear to you. I'll love you until I die.

309
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,378
That's not it either, stupid.

310
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,130
Then what is it?

311
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:27,508
What's wrong?

312
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:31,053
I've been lying to Mi-kyung
this whole time.

313
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,471
What?

314
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,723
She's going to be disappointed in me too.

315
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:37,601
She'll never forgive me.

316
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:06,171
Just stay away from me!

317
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,424
I don't want to see or hear you!

318
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:47,880
Jerk.

319
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,675
Why do I miss you?

320
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:04,813
Come on.

321
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:08,150
The alarm's been ringing forever.

322
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:17,576
Get up, Mi-kyung. It's time to go to work.

323
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,248
Mi-kyung!

324
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:24,291
Are you okay?

325
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,960
Gosh, that's loud.

326
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,090
Are you okay? What's wrong?

327
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:35,761
Okay, Hwan-kyung.

328
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,597
Tell her to get some rest.

329
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,600
Make sure she doesn't get out of bed
until she's healthy and well-rested.

330
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:43,435
Bye.

331
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,020
JU SEUNG-HEE

332
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,606
Why? What's wrong?

333
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,234
She's in the ER
because of stomach cramps.

334
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,402
She's sleeping and hooked up to an IV.

335
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:55,197
She was just acting tough for show.

336
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,449
Gosh, that dummy.

337
00:26:57,533 --> 00:27:00,702
It's a miracle she's lasted this long.

338
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,289
She's going through a breakup
on top of getting fired.

339
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:06,416
She should've collapsed a long time ago.

340
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,089
Speaking of which…

341
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,299
between the two of them,

342
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:17,386
you don't know how they broke up
or who dumped whom,

343
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,639
do you, Potato Gang?

344
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:24,268
Do you seriously want to talk about that
when she's sick?

345
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,813
I'm just looking out for my coworker.

346
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,065
I'm making sure I have all the details.

347
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:33,694
I need the full context
in order to provide the proper care.

348
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,571
What more is there to know?

349
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,198
What man in his right mind
fires his girlfriend?

350
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,284
Let her move on.

351
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:43,829
Don't say anything in front of her.

352
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:45,539
They didn't break up.

353
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:49,126
What? Do you know something?

354
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,711
Sorry?

355
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:54,256
Did I just say
what I was thinking out loud?

356
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,384
Yes, you did indeed. What is it? Spill.

357
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,844
Well…

358
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:02,055
It's not something that I know for sure,

359
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:06,977
but I sometimes have visions in my dreams.

360
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:12,983
I saw a beautiful ossuary that had
a bunch of flowering trees.

361
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,110
Then I noticed their names
next to each other.

362
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,405
They'll die in the same year

363
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,657
and their urns will be together.

364
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:25,829
That means they'll stay
together forever, right?

365
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,414
Gosh.

366
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:32,294
I can't believe I'm conducting
scientific research with someone like him.

367
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:36,089
We should really
get the water cooler checked.

368
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:37,883
There's definitely something in there.

369
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,384
Nobody drink the water until we do.

370
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,511
Okay.

371
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:44,514
- Should I call the water cooler company?
- I'm on it already.

372
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:52,314
KOREA-NEW ZEALAND
JOINT SMART FORUM

373
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,778
What are you doing at corporate?

374
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:01,531
I'm staying in Seoul for a few days
because I have some business to attend to.

375
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,492
Excuse me.

376
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,457
Did we need him for something?

377
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:15,003
No, he said he was busy with the lab,
so his work here is on hold.

378
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,052
Just a second.

379
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:29,643
No!

380
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,480
Hold on.

381
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:36,775
I should call her.

382
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,071
No, I can't.

383
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,948
No.

384
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,849
- Hello.
<i>- Hello, Ms. Kim.</i>

385
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,436
I'm calling…

386
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:15,981
to discuss the PMI direction
of the R&D Department…

387
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:19,860
Are you sick?

388
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:23,238
<i>No, I'm fine. Go on.</i>

389
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:26,074
You think I can't tell from your voice?

390
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,117
What's wrong?

391
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:29,661
<i>Do you have a cold?</i>

392
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,500
Just stomach cramps.

393
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,794
They'll go away soon.

394
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,840
So what's wrong with the report?

395
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,217
Come on.

396
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,018
<i>I'm hanging up</i>
<i>if you don't have anything to say.</i>

397
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,561
Is it that bad?

398
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:55,687
What do you mean?

399
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:56,855
I'm just saying.

400
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,816
You can eat three portions
of spicy chicken feet at night

401
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,819
<i>and feel fine, but now you're sick.</i>

402
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:05,572
<i>Things must really be bad.</i>

403
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:07,824
Are you serious right now?

404
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,285
Yes, things are bad.

405
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,746
I have no idea what to do with my life.

406
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,831
I don't know who to trust.

407
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,042
<i>Ever since I met you at Wonhan,</i>

408
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,211
my life has been a mess.

409
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,004
Things couldn't be worse.

410
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,466
So please…

411
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:29,513
don't go out of your way
to make me listen to your voice.

412
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:31,890
I'm begging you.

413
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:36,603
That was unnecessary. I was just worried.

414
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,272
Anyway…

415
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:43,318
Get some rest and watch what you eat--

416
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:51,743
Gosh! Why do I ever worry about you?

417
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,995
You'll be just fine.

418
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,588
Damn it!

419
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,775
<i>Mr. Yoon, you're fired.</i>

420
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,862
<i>Ms. Lee, Mr. Kim, Ms. Lee… you're fired.</i>

421
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,989
- Why?
- You're fired.

422
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,490
What do you mean?

423
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:33,160
You're fired. You no longer work for us.

424
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:36,580
LETTER OF INVOLUNTARY RESIGNATION

425
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,998
<i>Please. I have a family.</i>

426
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:41,126
<i>- Why would you fire me?</i>
<i>- Tell me what I did wrong.</i>

427
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,919
<i>There must be some sort of mistake.</i>

428
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,133
<i>- Mr. Kim, you're fired.</i>
- Why?

429
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,926
- Mr. Lee, you're fired.
- You can't do this.

430
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,178
Mr. Lee, you're fired.

431
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:52,929
- Mr. Park, you're fired.
- Why?

432
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,306
<i>- Why am I fired?</i>
<i>- You're fired.</i>

433
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,348
<i>- No way.</i>
<i>- You're fired.</i>

434
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:56,433
<i>Please give me a chance…</i>

435
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,977
<i>Ms. Kim, you're fired.</i>

436
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,323
I knocked three times.

437
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:12,824
Didn't you hear me?

438
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:17,621
I had something on my mind.

439
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,165
Gosh, some pair you are.

440
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,377
- What do you mean?
- Kim Mi-kyung and So Baek-ho.

441
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,838
One person is spacing out at work,

442
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:29,007
while another is sick in bed.

443
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,343
How can I stay out of it
when you're obviously upset?

444
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,136
- Mi-kyung is sick?
- Yes.

445
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,139
What did you say to her?
She's usually strong as an ox.

446
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,558
Didn't you let her go
before her feelings grew?

447
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,352
Are you sure you did that right?

448
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,687
It looks like her feelings
have already grown.

449
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,145
What are you doing here?

450
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:34,322
Shoot, how do I do this?

451
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,324
Honeybun, I'm glad you're here.

452
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,743
- What's up?
- It's Mi-kyung.

453
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:41,371
She's been drinking nothing
but electrolyte drinks all day.

454
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:44,374
I wanted to cook her something.
Do you think this will do?

455
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,794
Saury, pineapples, and spinach.

456
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,714
What on earth are you trying to make?

457
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:54,718
Saury pineapple spinach soup?

458
00:34:56,011 --> 00:35:00,265
No, that's not food.
It's abuse in soup form.

459
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,851
You shouldn't even feed that
to your arch-enemy.

460
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,269
Jeez.

461
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:06,813
What's this?

462
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:14,821
Wow, this is filled
to the brim with abalone.

463
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:19,534
Actually, I didn't make it. Ward B…

464
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,454
What are you doing up?

465
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:23,788
You could've just called me.

466
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:27,876
It's fine. I just wanted to get some air.

467
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:33,423
I picked up some porridge.

468
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,008
Do you want some?

469
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,010
I'll have some when I get back.

470
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:46,311
Wait a second.

471
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,524
That smells like abalone porridge.

472
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,235
Made with plenty of abalone guts.

473
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,199
It is.

474
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,762
Take it back.

475
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:22,389
What is this?

476
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:28,186
Don't play dumb with me.

477
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,815
Hwan-kyung is too cheap
to get the most expensive item,

478
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,693
even if his sister is sick.

479
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,695
He'd get tuna vegetable porridge at best.

480
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,700
I know you gave this to him.
Why are you doing this?

481
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:45,912
You don't want to be the bad guy
despite all those awful things you did?

482
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,082
Did taking care of me behind my back
make you feel better?

483
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,501
I'm glad you have the energy
to be mad at me.

484
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,336
You should still get some rest.

485
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,966
- I told you to leave me alone.
- I couldn't take it.

486
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:00,760
I heard you were sick in bed,

487
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:03,054
but I couldn't ask if you were okay.

488
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:06,558
As someone who's supposed to stay away,
I had to go behind your back.

489
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,184
I just had to do something.

490
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,729
Is that good enough?

491
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,191
I can't have abalone.

492
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:17,902
I made it for you.

493
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:21,489
Throw it out or give it away.
Do whatever you want with it.

494
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:25,410
Jeez.

495
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:29,122
He's not the one
who should be acting cold.

496
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:21,382
Hey.

497
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:23,551
Gosh.

498
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,346
I fell asleep after dinner.

499
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,559
What time is it?

500
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,313
- It's ten.
- Okay.

501
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,357
You forgot to take your pills.

502
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,317
Here they are.

503
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,402
Thanks.

504
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:04,551
Did the doctor say
that I was dying or something?

505
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,470
Why have you been teary all day?

506
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,138
It's nothing.

507
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,892
I'm just sad to see you sick.

508
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,436
Go back to sleep.

509
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:23,027
Hey, Ong-ju.

510
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,321
What?

511
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:29,409
You know I cry a lot. Let it go.

512
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:33,079
I know you're a crybaby,
but this is too much even for you.

513
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,164
What is it?

514
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:37,625
Am I actually dying?

515
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,711
Who said you're dying?

516
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,629
I couldn't go on if you were.

517
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,214
Then what is it…

518
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:50,263
What is it? Does it hurt again?
I'm starting the car.

519
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,808
It's not my stomach.

520
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,311
I'm having patience cramps.

521
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,730
Just tell me.

522
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:01,649
Something's going on, right?

523
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,737
- Ong-ju.
- If you're

524
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:07,739
disappointed in me…

525
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:10,283
will you dump me too?

526
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:12,785
What are you talking about?

527
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:15,163
If I did something wrong to you…

528
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:20,084
but had the nerve
to remain your friend all this time,

529
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,712
like you did with So Baek-ho,

530
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:26,049
will you cut me off too?

531
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,636
What did you do that was so wrong?

532
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,847
- If you're being dramatic again--
- I knew…

533
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,808
that Ki-se was cheating on you.

534
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,145
What?

535
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,148
I found out when I was
dress shopping with Su-hyeon,

536
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:46,986
which was months before your breakup.

537
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:49,572
I knew all along.

538
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:53,326
I swear my alarm never went off.

539
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,536
Where should I meet you?
I'm at the entrance right now.

540
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,955
We're having it at a hotel.

541
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,581
What?

542
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,002
Ki-se?

543
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:04,796
There's no way I could afford that.

544
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,006
It's all thanks to my mother-in-law.

545
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,385
Right? I got lucky.

546
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,347
Are you the groom? The bride is ready.

547
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,807
Okay.

548
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,393
Let's get a drink
before the wedding. It's on me.

549
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,562
No way.

550
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,691
- You!
- What?

551
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:26,776
Wait, Ong-ju!

552
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:29,112
Hold on.

553
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:31,698
You bastard! What are you doing here?

554
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:35,034
Why did the clerk just call you the groom?

555
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,703
Mi-kyung has no idea, right?

556
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:40,039
She has no idea
you're doing this behind her back!

557
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:43,334
- I haven't told her yet.
- You bastard.

558
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,254
How could you do this to her?

559
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,423
I'm begging you.
Please let her hear it from me.

560
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,882
It's the least I can do.

561
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:53,261
"The least you can do"? Are you serious?

562
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,471
Mi-kyung…

563
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,890
trusts you blindly.

564
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:01,602
What is she going to do?

565
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:03,521
Damn it!

566
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:06,691
I knew I had to tell you.

567
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,110
I wanted to go find him with you

568
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,820
and beat him up.

569
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:15,867
But that meant you'd break up

570
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,785
because of what I said.

571
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:21,956
I got scared.

572
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,333
What if you thought it was my fault?

573
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,919
What if you started hating me for it?

574
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:31,424
I ignored it because I was scared.

575
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:36,012
If I had told you then and there,

576
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:38,723
and you had dumped him first,

577
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:43,394
you wouldn't have had
to go through all of that at Wonhan.

578
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,064
Because I was a coward…

579
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:51,319
you got screwed over
without knowing what was going on.

580
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,947
I feel terrible about that.

581
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:58,034
I'm sorry.

582
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:05,875
You should get your IQ checked again.

583
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:09,337
- What?
- You're clearly an idiot.

584
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:13,132
How is that your fault?

585
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:17,595
When I ran away and hid in Pyeongwon,

586
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:22,016
about to give up all hope…

587
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:28,940
you followed me all the way here

588
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,692
and talked to me all day
about trivial things.

589
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,654
You took me out to eat meat,
drink, and stargaze.

590
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:36,030
You dragged me around.

591
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:41,327
You reached out to me
so many times and saved me.

592
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:45,039
How could I be disappointed in you?

593
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:48,751
Don't you hate me?

594
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:54,549
I think you're annoying.

595
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:58,636
But still…

596
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:02,223
I don't want you to die before me.

597
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,892
I'll hate you if you do.

598
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:17,989
I'm sorry.

599
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,368
You dummy.

600
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,540
I'm sorry.

601
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:31,794
Gosh, my allergies are acting up.

602
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:47,560
SENSE AND SENSIBILITY

603
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:55,526
Gotcha!

604
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,696
I knew I'd find you here.

605
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:03,743
I thought you were staying at Ms. Yoon's.
Why are you here?

606
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,371
I really wanted to enjoy my life in Seoul.

607
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:11,167
But you've been ignoring my calls
and texts for days.

608
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,170
I had to barge in
to see if you were alive.

609
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:17,465
You always do
whatever you want, don't you?

610
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,260
You're not wrong,
but I don't like your tone.

611
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,431
Tell me if you're mad at me.

612
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:28,517
So I can apologize,
and we can make up and go eat something.

613
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:31,646
I'm not mad at you.
I'm just tired, and I need some rest.

614
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:35,066
Wow, your friend came all the way here
in the middle of the night,

615
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,360
and you're completely ignoring her?

616
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:41,489
Jeez.

617
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,491
Well, you're no fun.

618
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,370
I'll just go next door
and hang out with Hwan-kyung--

619
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:48,579
Not there!

620
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,086
What were you saying?

621
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,088
You want to eat?

622
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:00,633
CHICKEN FEET, RAMYEON, BANQUET NOODLES

623
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:03,594
MSG is the source of true happiness.

624
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,097
I'll have two soju shots.

625
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,725
Honestly, I'd rather have two bottles,
but I know you'd get mad.

626
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:12,019
Did you know?

627
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:13,688
Know what?

628
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,356
That Ki-se had a girlfriend.

629
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:23,864
Yes.

630
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:25,950
He told me right before he left for Korea.

631
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:29,078
He told me that he was sorry
and that we should end it.

632
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,330
And?

633
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:33,457
- I asked him to stay.
- Why?

634
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,293
Because I really liked him

635
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:38,254
and I wanted to be with him.

636
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:42,800
Even though it would hurt someone?

637
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:45,219
Love was more important to me.

638
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:47,888
You probably think I'm a bitch
for feeling that way.

639
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,599
But back then, I did.

640
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:53,227
I was willing to accept the karma.

641
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:56,814
I just wanted to protect
my love and my heart.

642
00:46:57,857 --> 00:46:59,275
I chose that over anything else.

643
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,985
But in the end

644
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:03,029
you got hurt too.

645
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:06,198
Don't you think it was the wrong choice
for everyone involved?

646
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,868
Don't you feel guilty at all?

647
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:12,913
Gosh.

648
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:16,375
That's it.

649
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:18,044
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

650
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:19,545
- A bottle of soju, please.
- Okay.

651
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:30,973
Baek-ho.

652
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,392
Do you love Mi-kyung?

653
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:38,981
It's okay. You don't have to answer.

654
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:40,733
You're a cautious person.

655
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:43,319
It takes a long time for you to be sure.

656
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:47,907
But once you're sure
that someone is the one…

657
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:52,119
your only fear from that point on

658
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,955
is losing that person.

659
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:59,043
That's all.

660
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:02,922
I know that I made the wrong choice
and that I should feel bad.

661
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:05,966
I know that.

662
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:10,096
Park Ki-se was a bad person
who just saw me as a way up the ladder.

663
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:11,472
And I…

664
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,892
was a dumb, selfish child.

665
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:19,313
I'm such a mess right now
and I can't settle down anywhere.

666
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,399
I think that's karma.

667
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:23,859
But if I could turn back time

668
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:26,904
to that exact moment,

669
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,781
I would still make the same choice.

670
00:48:30,366 --> 00:48:31,283
Don't you regret it?

671
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:37,540
One time, I had a horrible nightmare
and woke up crying.

672
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:40,459
And Park Ki-se was right next to me.

673
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:44,380
I was so sweaty and warm
with my face buried in his chest.

674
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:49,301
But I didn't care if I suffocated
right then and there.

675
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:51,929
If I could feel that way for one more day…

676
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,724
I wouldn't regret it.

677
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,594
That's the stuff.

678
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,139
Bye.

679
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:41,770
Bye.

680
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:45,024
If you don't want me barging in again,
answer your phone more often.

681
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,775
- I'll think about it.
- All right.

682
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:48,861
That's my friend.

683
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,488
Okay, get in the car.

684
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:52,031
- Go on.
- Okay.

685
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:54,742
Text me when you get home.

686
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:09,400
Seoul Guy, what are you doing here?

687
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,193
I'm sorry for dropping by this late.

688
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:16,073
I just realized that I've done nothing
but take gifts from you.

689
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:19,702
This isn't anything fancy,
but I wanted to repay you somehow.

690
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:23,664
Wow.

691
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:28,002
Fried chicken
from Pyeongwon Market is the best.

692
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,420
How did you know that?

693
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:32,881
And <i>sikhye</i> too?
This must've been a pain to carry.

694
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:35,801
You know I can't let you go empty-handed.

695
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:38,012
Honey!

696
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,722
There's no need for that.

697
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:42,224
- You've already given me--
- Nonsense. Stay right here.

698
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:45,644
My kitchen belongs to the whole town.

699
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:46,729
Wait…

700
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:50,024
How much <i>dongchimi </i>do we have left?

701
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,666
No one's ever given me
homemade kimchi before.

702
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:12,421
It's half past ten.

703
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:18,737
<i>Here come the players!</i>

704
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:20,030
- Gosh.
- Wow.

705
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:22,282
We're not players.

706
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:25,953
We're just a bunch of cheap laborers.

707
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,454
Look at us.

708
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:31,375
We do research, clerical work,
and even manual labor.

709
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:34,253
How come we each get paid
for just one job?

710
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:38,090
I think this calls for an audit.

711
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,383
I couldn't agree more.

712
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:43,220
Come on, are you going
to keep complaining on harvesting day?

713
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:44,596
Zip your lips.

714
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,267
I told you to take one more day off.

715
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,977
Are you sure you're okay?

716
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:54,189
I'm in top condition
from the IV I just got. Don't worry.

717
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,817
You're still a patient, so be careful.

718
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:58,819
All right.

719
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:00,863
Before the harvest…

720
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,533
let me say a few words.

721
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:06,201
Gosh.

722
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:09,329
Wow. My beloved Research Team.

723
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:13,250
Our hard work this past year
has finally come to fruition--

724
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,502
- Right! I almost forgot.
- What?

725
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:19,089
I prepared this
for the hard work we'll be doing.

726
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:20,340
Energy jelly!

727
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:22,009
Wow!

728
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,762
It's grape flavored.

729
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:27,181
Here you go.

730
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:29,224
- Wow.
- Thanks.

731
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:32,227
I saw celebrities eat this on TV.

732
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:33,896
- Wow.
- This thing

733
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,564
is fruity

734
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:36,690
and delicious!

735
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:38,901
Okay, now.

736
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:41,779
Pay attention.

737
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:44,239
There's an age-old saying

738
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:48,410
that farmers' footsteps
make potatoes grow.

739
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:53,165
This means that it takes a lot of effort--

740
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,709
Oh, the potato lab is here.

741
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:57,711
- Hello.
- Hey!

742
00:54:57,795 --> 00:54:59,379
- How are you?
- Thank you for everything.

743
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:01,548
- Hello.
- Long time no see.

744
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:03,467
- I can't listen to that.
- Thank you.

745
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,385
Forget it. I'm not doing the speech.

746
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:07,888
I'm not doing it!

747
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,410
- Goodness!
- Are you okay?

748
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:31,870
- Oh my goodness.
- Mr. Ko.

749
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:36,291
- Say "Ah."
- Ah.

750
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,130
Thank God.

751
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:55,185
Snake! There's a rattlesnake!

752
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:57,104
- A rattlesnake!
- Where?

753
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,567
Come on.

754
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,485
Look at this!

755
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,491
Let's see.

756
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:15,831
Wow.

757
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,546
Gosh!

758
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:41,565
- Oh my!
- Be careful.

759
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:43,233
Don't hurt the potatoes.

760
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,904
- Here you go.
- Goodness.

761
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:53,452
You're bringing three to four boxes
while the others are bringing two.

762
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,162
Take it easy.

763
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,580
I'm fine.

764
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:59,499
All this heavy lifting
is good for clearing my head.

765
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:02,336
How's the quantity?
The sizes are looking okay.

766
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:05,297
I was already worried
after the growth inspection.

767
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,424
As expected, it's not looking good.

768
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:09,885
We're going to be
a few thousand kilos short.

769
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:14,056
I don't know if I should blame
the weather or the people anymore.

770
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,683
Gosh.

771
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:26,234
Yes, Mr. Park.

772
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:31,031
Sorry?

773
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:34,034
What happened?

774
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:37,079
POTATO LAB

775
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:50,092
What did Mr. Park do now?

776
00:57:56,765 --> 00:57:58,392
Can someone explain the situation?

777
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,726
What happened?

778
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:01,603
It's like I told you already.

779
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:03,939
The storage facility at the Chungnam
factory had a problem.

780
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:06,775
A temperature-setting issue
froze all the potatoes.

781
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:09,027
All 500 tons have to be discarded.

782
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:10,737
This can't be happening.

783
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:13,240
You've been storing potatoes forever.

784
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,575
How could you let this happen?

785
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:17,703
How could I have known?

786
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:21,331
The controller box malfunctioned
and made the temperature drop below zero--

787
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:23,333
Preventing accidents like that

788
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:25,544
is part of the Production
Department's job!

789
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:29,881
You work for the potato lab.

790
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:32,009
Why did no one even
check the storage facility

791
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:34,177
while 500 tons of potatoes were freezing?

792
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:36,096
It's not their fault.

793
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:42,310
Chief Hong noticed the issue early on
and was planning on fixing it.

794
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:45,939
But I must have overlooked it
during the takeover.

795
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,275
I apologize.

796
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:52,696
Five hundred tons is 20%
of the annual purchase quantity.

797
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:55,699
We already have a bad crop this year.

798
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,659
There's no way we can match the quantity.

799
00:58:57,743 --> 00:58:59,077
I'm aware.

800
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:02,205
That's why I'm planning
an emergency purchase plan.

801
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:04,166
I looked into a couple of distributors--

802
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:05,125
That won't work.

803
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:10,005
Those companies will know
right away that we're desperate

804
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:13,800
and double the price
for all of their supplies.

805
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:16,094
We should go to farms instead of companies

806
00:59:16,178 --> 00:59:19,389
and double-check the quality
before we buy in small amounts.

807
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:20,474
That's right.

808
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:23,143
Even the operation of the Chungnam factory
is unclear at the moment.

809
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,103
We should focus on quantity, not quality.

810
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:28,356
We should prioritize normalizing
the inventory as soon as possible.

811
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:32,069
Do you still think
that all potatoes are the same?

812
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:36,490
That we should just buy any potatoes
so we can get the factories running?

813
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:37,657
They're not all the same.

814
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:41,536
Potatoes that have been
nurtured daily with affection

815
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:44,790
are different from those that are
just planted and sprayed with pesticides.

816
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:46,792
This is the potato lab,

817
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:49,836
and we strive to provide the world
with good potatoes.

818
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:53,298
We want to at least defend our reputation.

819
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,342
Can't you let us do that?

820
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:19,616
How many potatoes
does each farm have in storage?

821
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:22,035
It varies,

822
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:24,204
but some of them have up to hundreds.

823
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:27,374
In order to secure 500 tons,
we'll need to visit at least 100 farms.

824
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:32,921
We have to gather
all of the connections we made

825
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:34,673
during the farming education sessions.

826
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:38,885
Check every farm that grows potatoes.

827
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,137
Wait a minute.

828
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:45,308
Ms. Ju, you stay out of the purchasing
and focus on the harvesting.

829
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:47,435
I'll take Mr. Ko
and start with the nearby farms.

830
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:49,062
- Okay.
- The Production Team

831
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:52,274
will visit farms in pairs.
Please send me the list of farms.

832
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:54,943
- Then I'll--
- I'll go with Ms. Kim.

833
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:01,199
You're coming with me?

834
01:01:01,283 --> 01:01:03,118
Yes. And as for the Chungnam factory,

835
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:06,580
we'll ship a portion of the potatoes
we have in storage here at the lab.

836
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,248
Since this is an urgent matter,

837
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,709
everyone should come
to the storage warehouse and help.

838
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:20,677
Ms. Kim!

839
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:25,015
Is your wedding with Chief So back on?

840
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:26,975
No! I have no idea…

841
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:30,187
Why would he…

842
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:32,856
Is he out of his mind?

843
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:37,027
Okay, turn, turn.

844
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:45,118
We're short on time,
so let's make it quick.

845
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:46,578
- Yes, sir!
- Mr. Ko.

846
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:47,954
Where's Mr. Ko?

847
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:49,331
- No idea.
- He has a stomachache.

848
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:52,000
I swear, he disappears
whenever we have work to do.

849
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:01,635
Ms. Kim! Leave these to me.

850
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,178
You can take the smaller ones.

851
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:13,313
Are you feeling better?

852
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,400
What do you think? I came to work.

853
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:29,537
Does your workflow
have to overlap with mine?

854
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:31,122
We could easily switch off.

855
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:33,625
I'm working at my own pace.

856
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:36,836
If you're uncomfortable,
you can slow down so we don't overlap.

857
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:41,132
What if I don't want to?

858
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:44,511
Mr. Lee.

859
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:46,846
Never date someone you work with.

860
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,057
That's what happens when it's over.

861
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:51,017
I told you, it's not over between them.

862
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:01,903
Why do you want to do the purchasing?

863
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:03,863
You don't know anything about farms.

864
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:05,740
I'm the one who's responsible for this.

865
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:08,451
I'm obligated to do my best
to take care of it.

866
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:11,162
You could fulfill
that obligation by yourself.

867
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:14,749
Why do you need me for it?
It's going to be uncomfortable.

868
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:17,043
Because I don't know anything about farms,

869
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:20,547
I chose the person in charge
of farming education as my partner.

870
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:21,840
Is that a problem?

871
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:34,102
Should we separate them?

872
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:38,023
- They both seem so bitter.
- Stay out of it.

873
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,942
That man's grumpiness

874
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,278
is addicting to watch.

875
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:45,655
Come here.

876
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:46,698
POTATO LAB

877
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:57,375
One, two, three,

878
01:03:57,459 --> 01:03:58,668
four.

879
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:00,378
Now!

880
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,302
I can't breathe.

881
01:04:09,721 --> 01:04:10,764
Jeez!

882
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:14,059
You're supposed to walk on the right side.

883
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:15,268
No!

884
01:04:23,902 --> 01:04:25,528
- What was that?
- What happened?

885
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:26,738
What is it?

886
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:37,791
Mr. So!

887
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,168
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

888
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:41,836
I'm not the problem right now…

889
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,755
- Oh, no.
- Oh my gosh!

890
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,300
Oh my God.

891
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:49,677
Are you okay? Chief So…

892
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:51,304
I'll get the first aid kit.

893
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:54,224
Chief So, you're bleeding.

894
01:04:54,349 --> 01:04:55,433
I am?

895
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:56,851
Are you stupid?

896
01:04:57,852 --> 01:05:00,480
Why would you jump under a falling ladder?

897
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:01,981
You should've gotten out of the way.

898
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:03,650
MK, why are you mad at Chief So--

899
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:05,402
What about you?

900
01:05:05,485 --> 01:05:07,904
Should I have gotten out of the way
and let you get hurt?

901
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:10,198
You didn't have to take the hit for me.

902
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:12,534
What if you really had gotten hurt?

903
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:15,412
Did you want me to die from guilt?

904
01:05:15,495 --> 01:05:17,622
I didn't have time to think about that.

905
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:18,873
It was an automatic reaction.

906
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:20,458
I don't like that!

907
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:23,211
Why do you automatically think of me?

908
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:24,421
Do you seriously not know?

909
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:26,214
No! I don't.

910
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:28,883
I never said I wanted to break up.

911
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:31,219
But you announced it to the whole company.

912
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:33,179
You told me I could take it out on you.

913
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:35,807
But you gave up immediately
after I got mad once.

914
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:38,560
Couldn't you…

915
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:41,062
Couldn't you have…

916
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:43,690
just waited a little bit?

917
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:48,445
You could've begged and asked me to stay

918
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:50,989
or at least tried to change my mind.

919
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:53,950
You couldn't even do that.

920
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:57,537
Why do you have to be so self-righteous
and stubborn all the time?

921
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:15,847
What are those two doing?

922
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:19,309
This is the potato lab, not a soap opera.

923
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:20,560
Are you okay?

924
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:23,521
Those two drained all your energy.

925
01:06:23,605 --> 01:06:26,274
You look like you're about to pass out.
Take deep breaths.

926
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:28,651
"Whoo." Like that.

927
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,612
- It does feel a little surreal.
- What?

928
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:33,031
Neither of them

929
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:34,574
are acting their age.

930
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:35,658
Gosh.

931
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:38,369
What do we do about the potato shipment?

932
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:40,038
I thought it was urgent.

933
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:43,291
How are we supposed to interrupt them?

934
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:46,753
There's plenty of space in the backyard
and by the vending machines.

935
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:48,671
Why did they have to start fighting there?

936
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:51,090
What are you all doing out here?
Chief So needs this.

937
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:52,258
Wait!

938
01:06:54,385 --> 01:06:57,013
Anybody hungry? It's around lunchtime.

939
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:58,181
It is?

940
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,309
- Lunch?
- I see.

941
01:07:02,894 --> 01:07:05,605
- I get it.
- Right.

942
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:14,364
I also understand.

943
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:32,590
Don't think that I forgive you

944
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:35,260
just because I said that.

945
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:38,805
I still think of you as a Wonhan bastard,

946
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:41,224
and I'm still mad.

947
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:48,147
Go. You have to go see a doctor.

948
01:07:48,273 --> 01:07:50,650
I'm okay. It doesn't hurt at all.

949
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:52,860
Quit being so difficult.

950
01:07:52,944 --> 01:07:53,903
OPERATE
OFF

951
01:07:57,115 --> 01:07:59,492
Why is this closing on its own?

952
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:04,080
What?

953
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:13,464
Open the door, please!

954
01:08:13,548 --> 01:08:15,341
It's malfunctioning.

955
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:17,760
Let's go have lunch, everyone.

956
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:19,804
And a cup of coffee if there's time.

957
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:21,389
- Potato Gang!
- Potato Gang!

958
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,352
Ms. Ju! I'm still in here…

959
01:08:26,978 --> 01:08:28,771
Kim Mi-kyung is still in here!

960
01:08:28,855 --> 01:08:30,815
I think they closed it on purpose.

961
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:40,199
Are they all insane?

962
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:45,622
This is a cold storage facility!

963
01:08:45,705 --> 01:08:48,625
You can't put people in a potato fridge!

964
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:54,547
What's so funny?

965
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:58,176
We're about to either freeze
or suffocate to death.

966
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:01,929
Also, you're injured and bleeding.

967
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,390
You're the only one in danger.

968
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:06,684
You're straining your heart
with intense physical activity

969
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:08,269
in cold temperatures.

970
01:09:08,353 --> 01:09:09,604
And you're shouting,

971
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:12,315
which means you're breathing in
too much cold air.

972
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:15,485
So what?

973
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:18,613
Do you want to just stay trapped in here?

974
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:20,114
I don't think we're trapped.

975
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:23,201
I think this is
an opportunity for us to talk.

976
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,372
I'm sorry,

977
01:09:27,455 --> 01:09:30,583
but I don't have anything
I want to talk about.

978
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,378
Fine.

979
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,130
I don't know what they're thinking,

980
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:39,384
but if they went to lunch,
they'll be back in an hour.

981
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:42,595
Let's take this time to meditate
separately, away from each other.

982
01:10:04,242 --> 01:10:05,952
Jeez.

983
01:10:06,661 --> 01:10:08,287
This stupid, kind heart of mine.

984
01:10:16,087 --> 01:10:17,880
Go sit over there.

985
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:19,257
Why?

986
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:22,218
Don't ask why. Just sit down already.

987
01:11:00,548 --> 01:11:01,632
It stings.

988
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:03,426
That's karma.

989
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:37,084
Mi-kyung.

990
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:40,630
Don't be a crybaby.

991
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:42,423
I'm being as gentle as I can.

992
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:43,758
If I begged,

993
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:45,927
would you forgive me?

994
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:50,473
If I asked you to stay…

995
01:11:53,351 --> 01:11:54,602
would you stay?

996
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:12,286
You're all set.

997
01:12:14,205 --> 01:12:15,706
Put the Band-Aid on yourself--

998
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:29,345
If I tell you that I realized what I want…

999
01:12:32,974 --> 01:12:35,101
and that I love you,

1000
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:36,853
would you…

1001
01:12:41,566 --> 01:12:42,859
come back to me?

1002
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:25,276
It's good.

1003
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:09,236
Jeez.

1004
01:14:23,334 --> 01:14:24,418
Wait.

1005
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:35,388
MY BELOVED PRINCESS

1006
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:02,415
<i>I am hereby evicting you</i>
<i>from USB Guesthouse, Mr. So.</i>

1007
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:05,001
You're guilty of breaking
the heart of Kim Mi-kyung.

1008
01:15:05,084 --> 01:15:06,544
You careless bastard!

1009
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:09,547
You said I should roll over
and act cute like a puppy, right?

1010
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:10,506
<i>I can't.</i>

1011
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:12,675
<i>You are so lethal to my heart.</i>

1012
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:14,385
Why are you suddenly doing this?

1013
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:16,262
<i>Sorry I didn't contact you first.</i>

1014
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:18,681
<i>Potachips' production depends on this.</i>

1015
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:22,518
- I said I'm busy!
- Just a second!

1016
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:24,108
<i>If you can help us out just this once…</i>

1017
01:15:26,063 --> 01:15:27,898
What happened? Is something wrong?

1018
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,367
