THE POTATO LAB

2
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:50,509
What are you doing?

3
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,136
What about you?

4
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:54,888
What are you doing here?

5
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,474
- This is--
- Mi-kyung!

6
00:00:58,517 --> 00:00:59,601
Who is it?

7
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:04,231
What are you doing?

8
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:05,816
Damn it.

9
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:09,820
What?

10
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:12,656
Hey, where did she go?

11
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:21,790
Finally.

12
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,722
Damn.

13
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,146
Oh, gosh.

14
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,655
I did offer to drive.

15
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:57,534
I'd rather have my heart explode

16
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,370
than bruise my pride
by getting in your car.

17
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:05,876
Damn it.

18
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,632
So honored you'd deign to accept my water.

19
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,926
Now can you explain
what in the world is going on?

20
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:17,429
Hey.

21
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,556
You're the one who should be
explaining yourself.

22
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,601
You're the one who came to my house
in the middle of the night!

23
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:23,685
"House"?

24
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,687
That's your house?

25
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,105
Unbelievable.

26
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:29,066
Don't act like you didn't know.

27
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,442
Oh, I see.

28
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,654
You came down from Seoul,
wandered around Pyeongwon,

29
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,989
got lost, and came across
the first place with lights on

30
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,866
and it just happened to be
your ex's house?

31
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,827
Wow, what a peculiar coincidence.

32
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:44,289
You're really living up
to your nickname, Park SOB.

33
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:45,916
Wait, don't tell me

34
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,835
you still have feelings for me.

35
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,962
Is that why you're showing up
at my house and at work?

36
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,214
Don't be ridiculous.

37
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,508
Then why are you acting like this?

38
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,010
It's pissing me off
the more I think about it.

39
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,013
Was ruining my life not enough for you?

40
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,973
Are you enjoying this?

41
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,934
You sleazy bastard.

42
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,102
Stop it!

43
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,520
I'm not here to see you!

44
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,439
Then who else were you coming
to see at my house?

45
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:10,524
Yoon Hee--

46
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,777
So Baek-ho!

47
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,028
I'm here to see Mr. So.

48
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:18,115
Corporate received this address
as his temporary residence.

49
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,163
I see.

50
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,957
What's this all about?

51
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,751
Why is So Baek-ho living at your house?

52
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:30,836
Ridiculous.

53
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,087
Living with me?

54
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,173
He's not living with me. He's a guest!

55
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,384
At USB Guesthouse.

56
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:40,887
Then, a few days ago!

57
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:42,848
Yoon…

58
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:44,850
You also met…

59
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,061
Why did it have to be here? Why?

60
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,229
Mr. So, right, So Baek…

61
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,564
Is he out of his mind?

62
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,315
Director So. Hey!

63
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,817
Where's Director So?

64
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,569
Why are you causing a scene?

65
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:58,864
Mr. So went to sleep hours ago.
Just leave.

66
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,412
How do you know that?

67
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,539
- Goodness.
- Are you two close?

68
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,124
Are you?

69
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,004
You didn't call him Chief So…

70
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,840
or Director So.

71
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,801
Just Mr. So.

72
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,803
Don't worry about it.

73
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,598
I can call him whatever I want, all right?

74
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,141
I'm not worried!

75
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,479
Why is he so insistent on
staying somewhere like that

76
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,105
instead of a nice hotel?

77
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,607
- What?
- What's the deal?

78
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,525
Are you two more than just friends?

79
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,904
Yeah! We're best friends.

80
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:42,324
We soak in the bath together
and scrub each other's backs.

81
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:45,577
Whoa.

82
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,746
Jeez Louise.

83
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,164
Freaking ridiculous.

84
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,959
- You jerk!
- Whoa!

85
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,044
Yikes.

86
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,549
By the way,

87
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,885
I won't be held responsible
for what happens

88
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,470
if and when you run into Ong-ju.

89
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,931
She bought a hatchet two days ago
for self-defense.

90
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,057
Just so you know.

91
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:12,896
Gosh.

92
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,482
Get lost!

93
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,150
Man…

94
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,166
Good grief.

95
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:43,552
Of all the bad luck in the world,
it just had to be him at my door.

96
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:58,066
ONE HOUR AND 50 MINUTES AGO

97
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,583
<i>I propose a truce.</i>

98
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,502
<i>I'm so exhausted. I can't do this…</i>

99
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,465
Sending this
is as good as admitting defeat.

100
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,259
SO FROM WARD B

101
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,100
Hello?

102
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,810
<i>You can stop apologizing now.</i>

103
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,439
Why?

104
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,399
Are you too exhausted to continue?

105
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,358
<i>No.</i>

106
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,402
When I saw you just now,

107
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,987
you looked pale and sickly.

108
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,448
It concerns me that this might
affect your performance.

109
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,033
What?

110
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,837
Seems like you're also worn out,

111
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,964
seeing that you're
already getting ready for bed.

112
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,058
I'm not worn out--

113
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,851
Just say you accept my apology.

114
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,604
That you've gone soft-hearted
seeing me try so hard.

115
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,898
Isn't that why you called me?

116
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,525
You're right.

117
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,152
I accept your apology.

118
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,237
Okay. Then…

119
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,531
the Ghost Bird incident ends here and now.

120
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,658
<i>Here and now.</i>

121
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,391
Oh wow, look at the time.

122
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,935
Please get some rest.

123
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,520
I'll do the same as well.

124
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:00,563
All right.

125
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:06,820
<i>Ms. Kim?</i>

126
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,489
Yes?

127
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:17,580
Sleep well.

128
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,426
Yes.

129
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,053
You also,

130
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,222
well…

131
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,599
Good…

132
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,059
You sleep too!

133
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,203
Oh my gosh. "Sleep well"?

134
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,916
Who does he think he is?

135
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,794
Sleep well…

136
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:19,267
EPISODE 6
FALSE GOAT'S BEARD

137
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,362
Mr. Lee.

138
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,032
Hello, Mr. Park.

139
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,326
I didn't wake you, did I?

140
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,660
No, of course not.

141
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,583
I'm sorry, but you're
the only person I could call

142
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,044
at a time like this.

143
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,213
Something to do with your ex-wife again?

144
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,175
Mr. Park.

145
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,303
Just make the announcement
that you're divorced.

146
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:58,181
You're in this tired routine
of keeping it a secret from everyone

147
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,557
and staying single for years,

148
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,434
just following your ex-wife's
trail of crumbs.

149
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,770
What kind of a miserable life is that?

150
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,064
Of course, I know that it's hard
to relinquish the title

151
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,774
of the chairman's son-in-law--

152
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,077
Gosh, sleep talking is such a bad habit.

153
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,288
Things got a little complicated.

154
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,375
Hee-jin is currently staying
with my ex-girlfriend.

155
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:29,295
Wait, she's with your ex-girlfriend…

156
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,507
That's crazy.

157
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,716
That's crazy!

158
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,968
No, not like that.

159
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,346
The guesthouse in Pyeongwon
is managed by my ex-girlfriend.

160
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,391
So Baek-ho, Yoon Hee-jin,
and Kim Mi-kyung,

161
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,393
they're all there together.

162
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,604
The person you hate.

163
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,274
The person who hates you.

164
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:53,069
And the person who presumably loathes you.

165
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:54,946
Wow.

166
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,700
The three of them

167
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,494
must be spending every night
badmouthing you.

168
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,539
They can say whatever they want
about me. I don't care.

169
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,583
The most important thing

170
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,669
is that they do not
find out about each other.

171
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,922
Kim Mi-kyung can't find out
about Yoon Hee-jin,

172
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,383
and Yoon Hee-jin shouldn't know
who Kim Mi-kyung is.

173
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,554
Wait a second.

174
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,306
Kim Mi-kyung?

175
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,350
Wasn't the assistant manager
you took to your office for a talk

176
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,351
Kim Mi-kyung?

177
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:29,939
That's enough of that.

178
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,441
Mr. Lee.

179
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,152
I have a favor to ask.

180
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,032
POTATO LAB

181
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,576
Yes, come in.

182
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,003
What is it?

183
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,340
I'm here to get this confirmed.

184
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,092
It's a report of the contract farms
and purchases for next year.

185
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,595
Simply put, it outlines the quantity
and variety of potatoes

186
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,431
we will be planting and purchasing.

187
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,351
It's basically the same as this year's,
so you just have to sign it.

188
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,603
Understood. You can leave it and go.

189
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,733
You don't really have to look over it.

190
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,694
It's essential to review something
before confirming it.

191
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,239
I see.

192
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,117
Okay.

193
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,410
I'll leave it then.

194
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,247
Assistant Manager Kim.

195
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,584
What?

196
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,712
At the lab, please address me
properly as Chief So.

197
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,009
Sure thing!

198
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,636
Interim Chief So.

199
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,430
- One more thing.
- What now?

200
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:45,932
Have a good day.

201
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,198
They say this
is really good for your back.

202
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,200
Wow, you're so flexible.

203
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,871
Where's the report?

204
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,708
He said he was going to review it
and then sign it.

205
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,834
What?

206
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,253
But he's not going
to understand any of it.

207
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,587
That's what I'm saying.

208
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,840
I guess he's trying to say,
"I'm the boss."

209
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,801
We all know you're the boss, okay?

210
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,764
Hello, this is Bu Jae-joong,
the general manager of Potato Lab.

211
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:27,849
Oh, hello.

212
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:30,727
Excuse me?

213
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,396
Sorry I'm late.

214
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,233
- What's this for?
- I don't know.

215
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,152
Jelly?

216
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,528
Oh, thank you.

217
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,114
We're all here.

218
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,283
Thank you for coming.

219
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,494
Today, I'll be presenting Wonhan Retail's

220
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,997
Potato Lab's 2024 Potato Purchasing Plan.

221
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,665
You are?

222
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:56,419
What is that?

223
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,795
INTRODUCING
NEW VARIETY MARSHALL

224
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:58,796
Marshall?

225
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,839
I saw it in an article.

226
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,966
It was developed for processing.

227
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,802
But what does that have to do
with our purchasing plan?

228
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,221
Starting next year, Wonhan Retail

229
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,974
will be solely introducing
the new American variety Marshall

230
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,517
to produce Potachips.

231
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,852
What?

232
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,854
Wait. What do you mean by "solely"?

233
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,231
We're planting just those
and not Jangsaeng?

234
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:18,399
Correct.

235
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,694
Wonhan Retail will no longer
be dealing with Jangsaeng.

236
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,075
Jangsaeng is the variety
we developed here at Potato Lab.

237
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,577
Why are you pushing it aside

238
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,246
for this new variety?

239
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,123
- I just don't--
- In a nutshell,

240
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,001
because Marshall
is a superior variety to Jangsaeng.

241
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:41,381
What do you know about potatoes?

242
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,049
A superior variety?

243
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:46,803
Have you grown Marshalls before?
Do you know its resistance to disease?

244
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:50,515
Marshalls are an early season variety with
a shorter growth time than Jangsaengs.

245
00:14:50,602 --> 00:14:52,433
Their tubers are extra-large,
and their yield

246
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:55,269
is about 2,000 kg per hectare
more than that of Jangsaeng's.

247
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,022
In terms of raw material,
that's what makes a superior variety.

248
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,691
A variety that can be harvested
faster and in greater quantities.

249
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,405
We understand that in corporate's view,

250
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,741
Marshall seems more cost-effective.

251
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:13,413
But changing a variety
is a huge issue, Chief So.

252
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:16,457
You can't fry any old potato
to produce Potachips.

253
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:20,169
There are so many factors to consider,
starting from their L-values.

254
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,130
JANGSAENG, MARSHALL
COMPARISON GRAPHS

255
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:25,508
As you can see, Marshall and Jangsaeng
aren't markedly different in numbers.

256
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,761
Their dry weight, starch content,
reducing sugar content,

257
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:32,640
and the aspartic acid and glutamic acid
in their amino acid composition

258
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,100
are similar.

259
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,727
Marshall's L-value
is also between 63 and 68,

260
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:40,606
allowing for Potachips production
without a change in quality.

261
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:45,403
It's not the same potato
just because the numbers are similar.

262
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,531
Potachips have been made
with Jangsaeng for over 15 years.

263
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,908
If the raw material changes,
the flavor will also change.

264
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,910
- Isn't that a change in quality?
- Right.

265
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:56,664
She's right. Jangsaeng
is Potachips' identity.

266
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,793
That is why I would like to conduct
the first blind test with you,

267
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,588
the Research Team,
before putting the plan into action.

268
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,470
These Marshall Potachips
have been made by the R&D Team

269
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,346
at Headquarters through
the exact same process.

270
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,726
I'll give you all the time you need.

271
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,228
Please proceed with the taste test.

272
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,355
If there is a meaningful difference

273
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,608
between the original Potachips
and the Marshall Potachips,

274
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,276
I will cancel my plan altogether.

275
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,321
Go ahead and cancel it.

276
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,991
I'll tell you the difference
right here, right now.

277
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,220
Do I need to taste more?

278
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:55,014
The unique rich flavor, the crispiness.

279
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,057
This is Jangsaeng.

280
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,558
Yeah!

281
00:16:58,976 --> 00:16:59,977
You got this!

282
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,896
Oh my goodness.

283
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,856
Would you mind trying the one next to it?

284
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,486
Is it really necessary?
Yes, give her some water.

285
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,545
What is it?

286
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:32,885
This one…

287
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:35,888
is also Jangsaeng.

288
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:36,889
- What?
- What?

289
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,059
What?

290
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:55,283
Wow.

291
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,493
I truly can't figure it out.

292
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,620
It tastes and looks exactly the same.

293
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:03,583
Which one's ours and which one's theirs?

294
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,793
Even the machines can't figure it out.

295
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,170
The chip color is almost identical too.

296
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,130
What do we do?

297
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,340
Are we getting rid of Jangsaeng like this?

298
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,301
Hey!

299
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:14,844
Don't give up yet.

300
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,221
He knows how to punch numbers
into a spreadsheet,

301
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,640
but he knows jack squat about potatoes.

302
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,811
I'm going to beat him with science
and facts, like a true researcher.

303
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:24,979
Nice.

304
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,565
Breathe in, breathe out.

305
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,650
Breathe in, breathe out.

306
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,527
He didn't have to do this.

307
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,696
He could have at least
discussed it with us.

308
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,989
Exactly!

309
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,283
I thought he was just loafing around,
but he was actually

310
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,410
planning this scheme behind our backs.

311
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,536
Gosh, I can't believe it.

312
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,790
It's our fault for underestimating
the Strategic Planning director.

313
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,252
I remember when
I first started working here.

314
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,796
We used to refer to Mr. Hong
as "Jangsaeng's Dad."

315
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,466
He wasn't the only one
who loved it dearly.

316
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,594
If Mr. Hong is Jangsaeng's father,

317
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,971
then our Mr. Bu is at least

318
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,514
Jangsaeng's aunt--

319
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:01,849
Where did he go?

320
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,601
- What?
- Mr. Bu?

321
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:05,603
Mr. Bu.

322
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,105
- What?
- Is he not there?

323
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:15,112
NEW VARIETY OF STRONG RESISTANT POTATOES
JANGSAENG POTATOES

324
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:16,947
NEW VARIETY JANGSAENG DEVELOPED

325
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,339
Wow, Mr. Bu.
Your hair was thick back then.

326
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:36,175
What do you mean?

327
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,428
I broke a hairbrush just this morning

328
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,639
because my hair is so thick.

329
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:43,933
So silly.

330
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,310
Did you really quit smoking, Ms. Kim?

331
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,523
Why?

332
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:53,234
Don't tell me you started again.

333
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:54,777
I didn't.

334
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,365
I quit to commemorate

335
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,910
the registration of our Jangsaeng
as a new variety.

336
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,163
But it's lingering on my mind today.

337
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,126
Well…

338
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:13,963
Let's make the calls
to the contract farms.

339
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,591
Tell them we're planting
Marshalls starting next year.

340
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:18,801
Mr. Bu.

341
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:22,513
Chief So made a convincing argument.

342
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,267
If we can get good harvests
with huge potatoes,

343
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,520
it's a win for both the farmers
and the company.

344
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,898
It is also true that Jangsaeng
isn't like it used to be

345
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,443
with the temperatures increasing.

346
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,447
It's time we began using a new variety.

347
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:44,076
Even if we do use a new variety,

348
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,412
it should be one we developed at our lab.

349
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,290
If we're going to buy someone else's,
why have a potato lab

350
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,250
and why have potato researchers?

351
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,962
Good lord,

352
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,173
do you have to rub salt in the wound?

353
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,008
I'm repenting as we speak.

354
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,678
The so-called head of the Research Team

355
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:06,015
hasn't put out a single new variety
for the past 15 years.

356
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,018
What have I been doing?

357
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,271
I didn't mean it like that. I…

358
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:20,613
Why do you say…

359
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,032
we have no varieties?

360
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,200
Your eyes.

361
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,578
Why do you have crazy eyes again?
What are you planning now?

362
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,707
Mr. Bu. Don't make any calls.

363
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,042
We aren't going to use Marshall.

364
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,085
- We don't have to.
- Wait, Ms. Kim!

365
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:37,087
Get permission from me first!

366
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,381
You can't resort to violence, okay?

367
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:48,766
MAROO

368
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,818
- What is this?
- Maroo!

369
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,445
Let's use Maroo instead.

370
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,906
A new variety
that we developed in our lab.

371
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:07,493
You must have failed the blind test
if you're redirecting like this.

372
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,619
Not the point.

373
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:12,832
You said that Marshall's yield
is about 2,000 more than Jangsaeng, right?

374
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:15,042
A good Maroo harvest
also yields about that much.

375
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,128
It's also an early season,
extra large, just like Marshall.

376
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:20,339
If their qualities are the same,
we might as well use

377
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,008
a domestic variety developed
specifically for domestic growth.

378
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,219
Maroo is not an official variety,
as far as I know.

379
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,346
Yeah, but give it two years.

380
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,306
It's undergoing biopsy tests right now,

381
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,433
so next year, it'll pass
the local regional trials

382
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,894
and then be registered
as a variety the year after. Two years.

383
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,647
That's not a long time in this field.

384
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,191
Two years will just fly by
in the blink of an eye.

385
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:40,860
I'm sorry,

386
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:43,279
but Maroo completing
the local regional trials in one year

387
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,823
and passing without any incident,

388
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,992
isn't that wishful thinking
on your part?

389
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:50,536
Yes, but also a prediction.

390
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,539
Because I wish it will happen,
then it will happen.

391
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,165
Based on what?

392
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,630
Yes, here.

393
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:05,384
This is Maroo being grown
at Haeman Sweet Potato Lab.

394
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,928
I personally asked them to run trials
on an open field.

395
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:10,222
Even in high temperatures,
the potatoes are growing well.

396
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:13,392
Researchers there are surprised
at how well it's adapting.

397
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,938
Is this enough explanation
for my confidence in Maroo?

398
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:19,773
Well…

399
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:23,819
It's still closer to a prediction
than solid evidence,

400
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:28,073
but I agree with your point that Maroo
is more suitable for domestic growth.

401
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:29,742
Right?

402
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:34,455
So let's just put your grand plans
on hold for just a bit,

403
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,540
and when we harvest
the Maroo next month…

404
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:45,341
I'll be gone…

405
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,927
next month.

406
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,731
Well, I'm not impatient for nothing.

407
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,442
I'll go and see how it's growing.

408
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,736
It should be at its halfway point by now.

409
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:06,987
Right…

410
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,197
now?

411
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:13,702
Just wait a few days
and go with me on the weekend.

412
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,871
What if you fall asleep on the road?

413
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,831
Driving ten hours round trip isn't easy.

414
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:20,584
I'd rather leave the weekend untouched

415
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:23,963
and ruin an already ruined weekday
with more work.

416
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,341
And this is a pro tip for
long-distance driving that only I know.

417
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,969
When you get sleepy, eat two
<i>Bbuldak</i> fire noodles with no water.

418
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,845
You can't fall asleep then.

419
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:36,183
My gosh, how can someone
be like that? Hardworking,

420
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,977
yet insane at the same time.

421
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,354
She works hard because she's insane.

422
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,189
Sane people don't do that.

423
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,315
You're right.

424
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,738
I'll drive you, Ms. Kim.

425
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,240
Are you going too?

426
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,616
Why? Seems unnecessary.

427
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:58,080
Maroo's current growth status

428
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:01,333
is data that will determine
a crucial decision for the lab.

429
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:02,793
As the decision maker,

430
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,004
I have a duty to check
the objectivity of the data--

431
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,089
That means you're going to watch her.

432
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,340
Ms. Kim may be overzealous,

433
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:10,801
but she's not the type
to use cheap tricks.

434
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,803
This isn't necessary.

435
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,641
Well…

436
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:22,271
As the chief of the lab,
even in situations like this,

437
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,356
- I must actively--
- Jeez.

438
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,275
Let's just go.

439
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,194
Before you start composing a thesis
on why we need to go together.

440
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,822
I'm off.

441
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,716
Oh my goodness!

442
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:54,053
How did you know my knees were bad?

443
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:55,804
Thank you, young man.

444
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:59,016
The Korean way of respecting
your elders still lives on.

445
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,773
I'll see you tomorrow.

446
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,295
- Ms. Ju.
- It's not just me, right?

447
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,798
You felt it too, right?
There's something there, right?

448
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:32,091
But,

449
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,551
it just doesn't make any sense.

450
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,055
To get into a situationship
with the man who fired you?

451
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,223
That's insane.

452
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,600
To get into a situationship
with the person you fired?

453
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:42,851
Pure lunacy.

454
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:46,438
Maybe lunacy is
what brought them together.

455
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:48,982
But still, how is this possible?

456
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:50,484
Ms. Kim even said

457
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,820
that she'll never date someone
from the same company again.

458
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:54,655
She said that if she ever does,

459
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,449
she'll change her name to Dog Mi-kyung.

460
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,660
Guess she'll be applying
for a name change soon.

461
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:03,247
We should start practicing
saying "Ms. Dog."

462
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,165
- Ms. Dog.
- Ms. Dog?

463
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,042
- Ms. Dog?
- Ms. Dog.

464
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,919
<i>- Ms. Dog, Ms. Dog</i>
<i>- Ms. Dog, Ms. Dog</i>

465
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,879
<i>- Ms. Dog, Ms. Dog</i>
<i>- Ms. Dog, Ms. Dog</i>

466
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,089
<i>- Ms. Dog, Ms. Dog, yo!</i>
<i>- Yeah!</i>

467
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,550
<i>- Ms. Dog, yo! Ms. Dog</i>
<i>- Ms. Dog, Ms. Dog</i>

468
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,802
<i>- Ms. Dog, Ms. Dog</i>
<i>- Ms. Dog, Ms. Dog</i>

469
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,679
<i>- Ms. Dog, Ms. Dog</i>
<i>- Ms. Dog, Ms. Dog</i>

470
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,687
<i>Ms. Dog, Ms. Dog</i>
<i>Ms. Dog, Ms. Dog, Ms. Dog</i>

471
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,063
<i>Ms. Dog, Ms. Dog</i>

472
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,148
That was great!

473
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,691
- Yeah?
- One more time?

474
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,193
<i>Ms. Dog, Ms. Dog</i>

475
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,085
Oh my.

476
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,089
Why is So Baek-ho all wrapped up in this?

477
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:58,677
How do I separate them?

478
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:03,515
EDITED ONE HOUR AGO

479
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,353
MK0531.

480
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:12,149
That's Mi-kyung's birthday.

481
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,245
Shoot.

482
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:31,835
POTATOES SAVE THE WORLD!

483
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:41,720
NO COMMENTS YET

484
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:13,669
Shoot.

485
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,588
Gosh, that scared me. Hold on.

486
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:19,549
Yes, this is Park Ki-se.

487
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,593
Hello. No, it's okay.

488
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:40,654
Are you uncomfortable?

489
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,573
No, not really.

490
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,410
How long have we been driving?

491
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,536
Around 10 km?

492
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,329
1.8 km, actually.

493
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:50,497
I see.

494
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:00,757
Should we turn on the radio?
It's too quiet, isn't it?

495
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:02,342
Sure, you can if you'd like.

496
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:09,391
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

497
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,727
What kind of a song is this? Jeez!

498
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,731
I mean, this song is kind of…
You know what I mean.

499
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,482
Kids can listen to the radio, too!

500
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,693
Isn't it illegal to play a song like that?

501
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,986
My gosh.

502
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,112
Excuse me?

503
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,697
You know what?

504
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,575
I'll make a playlist
of wholesome, nice songs.

505
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,493
Okay.

506
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:29,786
What kind of songs do you like?

507
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,747
I like rock, like shoegaze.

508
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,165
What?

509
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,791
Rock? You?

510
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:36,835
Why?

511
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,587
It's not what I expected.

512
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,381
I thought you'd listen to Bach,

513
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:44,343
Schumann or other people like that.

514
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,844
I see…

515
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,013
So you do have some good taste.

516
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:51,433
I don't know how you see me,

517
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,518
but I do have interests and emotions

518
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:56,063
like everyone else.
I am a human being, after all.

519
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:59,941
Then do you cry when you're sad?

520
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,612
Are you being serious?

521
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,280
Yes!

522
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:08,408
I simply can't imagine you crying, Mr. So.

523
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,995
When was the last time you cried?

524
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,457
You're taking this long to answer?

525
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,167
Never cried in your life, have you?

526
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,753
Beep-beep. You are not a human being.

527
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,797
- You're stainless steel.
- A movie.

528
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,924
I recently cried watching a movie.

529
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,426
What movie?

530
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,057
<i>Coco…</i>

531
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:47,280
Why would you ask me
and then laugh at me? What is this?

532
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,449
Wow, just wow.

533
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,993
I could have had
such a comfortable work life

534
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,995
holding this over you as leverage.

535
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,749
What a tragedy
that I don't have much time left.

536
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,840
I didn't say it to make you feel guilty.

537
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,133
It was just a joke.

538
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,680
Gosh.

539
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:14,599
Oh my gosh, I'm only saying this

540
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:17,018
because you keep fidgeting
like you're feeling guilty.

541
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:21,648
I don't blame you
for the fact that I'm getting fired.

542
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:25,360
Obviously, I was furious at first.

543
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:28,572
I even mentally punched you
a few times.

544
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:31,450
But the fact of the matter is,

545
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:34,369
you were just doing your job.

546
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:39,291
Just like how I have to cut off
stems as a potato researcher,

547
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:44,379
you just did your job
as the chief of the lab.

548
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,591
But, despite all that,

549
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,927
I really hope

550
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:53,930
that you'll continue
to watch me work a bit more.

551
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:56,850
I work hard at everything I do.

552
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,812
I'm not saying I'm like, crazy talented

553
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:03,440
or that I'm extremely smart
or anything like that.

554
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:05,859
But working hard and diligently,

555
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,236
that is something I can do.

556
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,322
So…

557
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,283
I just do it, whether it works out or not.

558
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,660
I try to be active
and avoid sitting around.

559
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:19,122
Even the smallest dot can make a line
if you draw enough of them.

560
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,375
Then that line becomes a road.

561
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:31,426
Don't take this as me begging.

562
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,552
I'm just saying…

563
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:36,431
because stuff like this
isn't written on resumes.

564
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,394
You can decide for yourself
whether I'm someone

565
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,146
who deserves another chance.

566
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,693
Yes.

567
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:49,986
I understand.

568
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:01,206
All right, time for requests!

569
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,625
DJ MK will play anything you want.

570
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,293
Mr. So Baek-ho from Pyeongwon.

571
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,003
What's your song request?

572
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:17,889
"Bit by bit…

573
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,976
slowly…

574
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:23,728
to you."

575
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,480
Okay.

576
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:29,442
"Bit by bit,

577
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,361
slowly,

578
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:33,154
to you."

579
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,105
Gosh.

580
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,400
There, there, let's go home.

581
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,193
That was a nice walk, wasn't it?

582
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,072
Let's go home.

583
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:23,121
What? What did you say?

584
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,541
You don't want to be alone?

585
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,668
Okay, fine.

586
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,547
Then both of you can
get right into my belly.

587
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,426
For heaven's sake.

588
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,887
Just admit that you're an alcoholic.

589
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,972
And quit the dumb one-woman show.

590
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:44,434
Don't listen to him.
We're meant to be together.

591
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,311
Let's go to my room.

592
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,319
UGLY KIM HWAN-KYUNG
SO UGLY

593
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,448
You're all invited
to the welcome party for Yoon Hee-jin!

594
00:35:58,531 --> 00:35:59,491
This is your ticket.

595
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:04,245
What are you doing?

596
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,207
Why did you keep this?

597
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,541
Keep what?

598
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:09,668
This. The entry ticket.

599
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:11,628
Well, it's cute. That's all.

600
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,010
Why? What's wrong?

601
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,680
Ong-ju!

602
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:34,526
Damn.

603
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:39,948
What's wrong?

604
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,121
Did I do something wrong?

605
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,291
- Ong-ju.
- I think I'm jealous.

606
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:52,669
What?

607
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,672
I'm jealous
that you might like another girl.

608
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:59,008
What are you talking about?

609
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:00,844
A minute ago,

610
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,388
I didn't feel anything towards you.

611
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,640
But the moment I saw that sticker,

612
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:07,183
I saw a whole montage unfold

613
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:09,561
of you and the girl friend
of the guest in Ward B

614
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,647
holding hands, getting married,
and celebrating your baby's birthday.

615
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,275
And all of a sudden,

616
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:17,652
my mood dropped.

617
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,739
But it's not real. Right?

618
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:24,033
I'm just being possessive, right?

619
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:26,077
I'm probably just worried
that I'll lose the guy

620
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,704
who cooks everything for me, right?

621
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,080
Lee Ong-ju!

622
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:30,582
Are you kidding me?

623
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,751
I confessed to you three times.

624
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:35,336
You rejected me when I was 17
because I was too young.

625
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,881
You rejected me when I was 20
because you were too busy.

626
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,716
At 23, it was because
you'd known me too long

627
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,259
and didn't see me that way.

628
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,860
And the night before
I enlisted in the army,

629
00:37:43,985 --> 00:37:45,430
you said we should forget about it.

630
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,849
That you slept with me
because you broke up with Hyun-sung

631
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,559
and not because you liked me.

632
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:51,311
And now you're upset

633
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,439
because I might like someone else?

634
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:55,857
What is wrong with you?

635
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,443
Am I just a toy to you?
A placeholder?

636
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,654
You know how long I've liked you!
So how could you say that?

637
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:02,739
You're so…

638
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,868
so freaking cruel.

639
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,924
Hwan-kyung.

640
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:23,760
Kiss me.

641
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:25,553
What?

642
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:29,390
What are you playing at?

643
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,976
- If you're playing with me again--
- Oh, come on!

644
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,061
Just do it!

645
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,088
It is…

646
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,299
doable.

647
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:18,481
MAIN BUILDING

648
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,490
Oh, man…

649
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:29,909
I'm sorry.

650
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,578
I didn't realize I fell asleep.

651
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:33,705
Are we…

652
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,168
What?

653
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:42,964
Wait, where did he go?

654
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,756
Having a good time?

655
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:26,174
Yes.

656
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,760
I haven't done that since middle school,
but it's still funny.

657
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:29,844
Oh my!

658
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:32,722
What are you doing here by yourself?
This is my job.

659
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,391
You were sleeping so soundly.
I couldn't wake you.

660
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,394
I measured the above-ground height

661
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,063
from that end there to here.

662
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,774
Whoa, you did a lot--

663
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:44,943
What?

664
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,069
Wait a second.

665
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,198
You have to be freaking kidding me.

666
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,450
These are sweet potatoes, not potatoes!

667
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,994
You know, that viral meme?
"It's sweet potato!"

668
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:58,289
- What?
- What kind of potato lab chief

669
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:01,084
can't tell apart
a potato and a sweet potato?

670
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,293
Yeah, look.

671
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:05,296
Look at that. You can tell it's not
a potato just by the leaf alone.

672
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,422
I see.

673
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:09,092
I thought it looked strange,

674
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:12,595
but I assumed it was a different shape
because it's warmer.

675
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:13,680
Jeez.

676
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:16,140
This is what happens
when you just memorize potato facts

677
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:17,225
like test answers.

678
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:21,104
I can't even tell anyone this happened
because it makes me look bad.

679
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:23,982
Gosh. Come on, get up.

680
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,237
Wait, hold on a second.

681
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:30,822
What?

682
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,205
Oh! Yes!

683
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,082
The Maroo are over there! Look.

684
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,292
They were right in front of you,

685
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:44,961
and you didn't even notice. Good grief.

686
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,546
So one thing you should know

687
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,214
is that I'm slightly blind at night--

688
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:50,008
Be quiet and follow me.

689
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:51,759
Jeez!

690
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:10,778
Good gracious.

691
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:15,283
What kind of crazy person
parked their car like--

692
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,453
Wait. This is Chief So's car.

693
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,982
Emergency, emergency!

694
00:42:33,207 --> 00:42:36,220
How many times do I have to tell you
to speak softly in the morning?

695
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:38,848
I'm already in a bad mood
just because I'm at work.

696
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,725
No! Outside!

697
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:41,851
Outside!

698
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:42,810
No, wait.

699
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:45,229
You have to see
with your own eyes to believe it.

700
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:47,732
Come on, let's go outside.
Come on, hurry up!

701
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,025
For heaven's sake.

702
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:51,319
- Let's go. Come on.
- What is it?

703
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,006
What is this?

704
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:14,842
Wait.

705
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:18,846
Why is Mi-kyung here with Chief So?

706
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,140
They went down to Haeman

707
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:22,725
to check on the Maroo growth.

708
00:43:23,022 --> 00:43:25,186
They must have arrived
in the morning and passed out.

709
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,687
She's right.

710
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:28,773
They're just here because of work.

711
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:32,068
Don't be silly. Two single people

712
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,028
go all that way in one car,

713
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:37,698
work overnight together,

714
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:40,493
come back and fall asleep together

715
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:41,828
in this small, enclosed area?

716
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:45,331
Is this something "just co-workers"
would do?

717
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:48,501
I mean, it is unlikely
for someone like Ms. Kim.

718
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:51,587
Remember when Mr. Park
from the Processing Team asked her out.

719
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:53,548
- Right!
- She told him she was

720
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,758
selling her kidney
to pay off her gambling debt.

721
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,802
It was a legendary rejection.

722
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:01,013
I thought Ms. Kim liked me.

723
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:02,140
What?

724
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:04,392
What on earth
are you talking about, Hee-dong?

725
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:06,060
Enough chitchat.

726
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,563
Even to me,

727
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:11,107
they look like
they have something going on.

728
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:14,235
Now the problem is,
how do we deal with this?

729
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,778
Firstly, for me…

730
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:19,615
I'm against this marriage.

731
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,200
What? Why?

732
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:23,452
They're adults.
They can date if they want to.

733
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:27,832
Where else can you find someone
as thoughtful as Ms. Kim these days?

734
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,168
She needs a man who's deep
and thoughtful like her,

735
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:32,253
instead of a calculating guy like him,

736
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,839
so they can live happily ever after.

737
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:38,676
Yes, I also agree
that MK has a great personality.

738
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:39,635
I really do.

739
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:41,888
But consider their looks.

740
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:44,140
Consider their qualifications.
Their assets.

741
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,559
Chief So really does shine brighter.

742
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:51,022
If I were a woman,

743
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,399
I would've been hitting on him nonstop.

744
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:54,734
Oh, that son of a gun.

745
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,664
It's already been 30 minutes?

746
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:11,292
I feel like I just closed my eyes.

747
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:13,586
I'll count yesterday's work trip

748
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,630
as today's workload.

749
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:16,881
Go home and rest.

750
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:21,344
You're breaking your own principles?

751
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,846
I'll take a half-day
and come back at lunch.

752
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:27,391
I need to organize all the numbers
and run the Maroo growth report by you,

753
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,894
so you can decide
on whether to make the call.

754
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,401
By the way,

755
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,862
what was the answer?

756
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:42,823
The blind taste test
with Jangsaeng and Marshall.

757
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:45,785
I tasted them carefully,
but I couldn't find a difference.

758
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,495
Of course you couldn't.

759
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,581
Both bags were Potachips
made with Marshall potatoes.

760
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,208
What?

761
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,253
Wow.

762
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,964
Wow. You conned the researchers?

763
00:45:58,047 --> 00:45:59,173
I never lied.

764
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,342
I asked you to find
a meaningful difference

765
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,636
between the Jangsaeng product
and the Marshall.

766
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,264
I didn't say you had to pick
either A or B.

767
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:07,515
Wow.

768
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,017
You know that's
a really cheap trick, right?

769
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:11,394
Is it cheap?

770
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,354
It was a trick, but it proved my point

771
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,356
that there wouldn't be
a difference in quality.

772
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:16,482
Gosh…

773
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:18,901
You're so annoying sometimes.

774
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:20,945
Because you always say the right thing.

775
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:28,202
Don't tell me "sleep well" today.

776
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:32,415
I wasn't even thinking about saying it…

777
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:37,586
What?

778
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,089
What are you all doing here?

779
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:41,841
- What?
- Stretches!

780
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:42,925
What?

781
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:46,304
One, two, three, four.

782
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:49,140
Two, two, three, four.

783
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,600
- Research Team, stand up!
- And up!

784
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:53,477
Deep breath.

785
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,771
One, two, three, four.

786
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:58,482
- And down again.
- Down again!

787
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:00,735
- What is this? What's going on?
- Two, two,

788
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,403
- three, four.
- What is this good for?

789
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:05,156
- Five, six, seven--
- Me too! I want to do it too!

790
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,700
- Eight. The end.
- What is this?

791
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:10,161
- And up again!
- What is this?

792
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,245
Oh my!

793
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:36,729
When did you wake up?

794
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,147
Thirty minutes ago.

795
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,692
Yeah, me too.

796
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:46,197
Why didn't you say you were up?

797
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,990
The awkwardness was suffocating.

798
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:52,787
Because I was scared

799
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,080
you'd wave this one off too

800
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:55,664
and friendzone me again.

801
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:59,543
You worry way too much.

802
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:03,089
I wasn't drunk
and it wasn't a one-night stand.

803
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:06,467
I made the decision
using my brain with an IQ of 130.

804
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,635
So,

805
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:09,387
don't worry.

806
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,265
Ong-ju.

807
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:16,060
We're dating now. Yes?

808
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:17,978
Yes.

809
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:20,689
We're dating.

810
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:25,861
What do you want for breakfast?

811
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:28,114
It's the first meal
I'm making as your boyfriend.

812
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:30,032
Tell me everything you want to eat.

813
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:31,158
Come on.

814
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,661
Is food really important right now?

815
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,705
Give me a kiss first.

816
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,129
Ong-ju!

817
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:44,547
Hwan-kyung!

818
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:49,677
- What? She didn't go to work?
- I don't know!

819
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,015
Pants, your pants!

820
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:56,934
- Put them on!
- Hwan-kyung!

821
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:59,186
Yeah! Just a second!

822
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,479
You're here?

823
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:09,029
Clean your room once in a while!

824
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:11,073
How do you have maggots in there?

825
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:13,117
I know, right?

826
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,578
I was so shocked.

827
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:16,871
I almost fainted.

828
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:18,539
Thank you for helping me.

829
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,209
You two…

830
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:31,177
have some sandwiches, if you're hungry.
They're in the fridge.

831
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:34,263
Why are you home right now, anyway?

832
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:36,974
Did you sleep somewhere else?

833
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,646
Yeah. I went on a work trip.

834
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:43,606
Overnight? Alone?

835
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:48,694
Who else would I be
going with on a work trip?

836
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:49,904
Wait a second.

837
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,072
You two didn't know
I didn't come home until now?

838
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:53,199
- Wait, what?
- What?

839
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:56,702
Well…

840
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:59,246
I was a bit busy last night.

841
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,957
Yeah, me too. I was busy too.

842
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:04,585
Both of you? Busy doing what?

843
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:07,880
Did you two…

844
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,389
play cards all night long again?

845
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:19,225
I told you to be careful!

846
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:21,060
A small bet snowballs like crazy,

847
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:23,229
and before you know it, you go bankrupt!

848
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:25,731
Gambling should not be taken lightly.

849
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:28,400
Okay, we won't do it again.

850
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:29,985
Be careful.

851
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:31,070
- Okay.
- I'm watching you.

852
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,155
- Yeah.
- Don't you dare.

853
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:35,074
Go, rest up.

854
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:40,579
Lord, have mercy.

855
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,331
I was so nervous.

856
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,548
But just in case,
come down after five minutes.

857
00:50:45,648 --> 00:50:46,710
I'll have coffee ready.

858
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:49,547
Hey.

859
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:51,799
Aren't you forgetting something?

860
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:07,731
Whoa, my gosh.

861
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:08,691
Baek-ho.

862
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:13,904
Oh, you didn't have to.

863
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:18,117
How come there isn't
a single café around here?

864
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,868
I wouldn't have come
empty-handed otherwise.

865
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:22,037
What brings you here?
I wasn't expecting you.

866
00:51:22,141 --> 00:51:24,999
Oh, I see. You don't want me
beating around the bush.

867
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,876
I'm sure you're not here just to chat.

868
00:51:28,377 --> 00:51:29,878
I have work to attend to.

869
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:31,005
I'm sure you do.

870
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,424
Director So doesn't waste
a minute of his time.

871
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:36,635
Here.

872
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:41,640
What is it?

873
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:43,809
You know Director Lee
is rolling in money, right?

874
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:45,686
I heard his parents
had a vacation home here,

875
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,521
so I begged and begged him for the keys.

876
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:49,315
It's not that far from the lab

877
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:51,025
and has a caretaker too.

878
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,110
You just have to move in.

879
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,069
Right now?

880
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:57,448
What do you mean?
Do you know how bad I felt?

881
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,450
I'm the one who sent you here,

882
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:02,411
but I wasn't able
to take care of you at all.

883
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:06,081
It's fine.

884
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,250
I'm used to business trips,

885
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,169
and I'm fine with where I'm staying.

886
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,921
How can it be fine?
You're such a quiet person

887
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:15,341
and you have to stay
in that tiny guesthouse

888
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:16,592
with other people.

889
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:18,302
It's not as noisy as you think.

890
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:19,428
And you know

891
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:22,264
that it's more uncomfortable
for me to owe someone.

892
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:25,267
Think of it as a gesture of goodwill.

893
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:29,063
While I'm here,
I'll help you move your stuff. Let's go.

894
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:34,652
What?

895
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:35,736
Ki-se.

896
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:41,200
Is there a reason why I have to go there?

897
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:45,329
What about you?

898
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:49,833
Is there a reason why
you have to stay at that guesthouse?

899
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:51,043
Do you?

900
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:53,337
That guesthouse, it's run by Mi--

901
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:57,716
Who was it?

902
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,760
Assistant Manager Kim at this lab, right?

903
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,595
She manages the place, doesn't she?

904
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:04,723
You hate getting personally involved
with co-workers.

905
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,558
You have to keep interacting with her,

906
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:09,520
but I don't hear a single word
of complaint from you.

907
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:10,646
How did you know that?

908
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:14,066
And! You forgot
what yesterday was, didn't you?

909
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,484
Didn't you?

910
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:16,902
Yesterday…

911
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:19,655
The MOU with Final Global.

912
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,990
You devoted all your time
to it for months.

913
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:25,494
The special resolution was yesterday
and you didn't even ask about it.

914
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:27,287
Who are you spending time with these days

915
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:29,456
that you would forget
such an important issue?

916
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,875
I've never seen you like this before.

917
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:32,835
You know that?

918
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:36,338
Seriously.

919
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:39,842
I mean…

920
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,346
I understand that
you're focused on your work,

921
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,974
but in the end, you're here temporarily.

922
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,600
The goal is to downsize.

923
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:52,271
So don't lose your focus, okay?

924
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:46,074
Oh, hello!

925
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,372
Who is he saying hello to?

926
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:54,124
- I don't know.
- No, he was just right there.

927
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,336
The son-in-law of Wonhan's Chairman Wang.

928
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:59,421
Director Kim. No, Director Oh.

929
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:01,215
- Executive Director Park Ki-se?
- Yes!

930
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,216
You saw him here?

931
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:03,675
Yeah.

932
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:07,095
The news about Ms. Kim and Chief So
must have been quite a shock.

933
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:09,264
- It made you see things.
- No.

934
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:12,351
He was definitely right there,
peeking in to look at us.

935
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:14,895
Goodness, do you think
executive directors have that much time?

936
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:19,107
Why would he come to Pyeongwon
from Seoul for no reason?

937
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:20,484
- No, I--
- Come on, Hee-dong.

938
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:21,860
Get it together.

939
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:23,362
Now you know.

940
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:25,948
Ms. Kim likes good-looking guys.

941
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:28,033
You had no chance with her.

942
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,702
I'm getting worried about him.

943
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:34,373
How did he even get into our lab?

944
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:45,634
FINAL GLOBAL
MOU

945
00:55:56,562 --> 00:55:58,105
FINAL GLOBAL CEO BAE SANG-HYUP

946
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,663
POWER OFF

947
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:32,556
It's Director So from Wonhan Retail's
Strategic Planning Department.

948
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,683
I apologize for calling you back so late.

949
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:36,685
Right, yes.

950
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:15,015
ASSISTANT MANAGER KIM MI-KYUNG

951
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:25,150
What?

952
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:34,409
<i>The person you're trying to reach</i>
<i>is not available. Please leave a message…</i>

953
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:46,463
Why aren't you picking up?

954
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:47,965
I had something to say.

955
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:49,299
I didn't see it.

956
00:57:53,762 --> 00:57:57,224
Regarding our trip tomorrow
to the PMI Task Force,

957
00:57:57,766 --> 00:58:00,435
I'll drive your car for you.
Let's go together.

958
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:02,604
Let me repay you
for driving all the way to Haeman.

959
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:03,981
It's all right.

960
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:05,524
I'd rather go on my own.

961
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:09,903
I see.

962
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:19,454
What's wrong with him now?

963
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:23,000
Jeez.

964
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:28,964
When did you get here?

965
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,382
Hey.

966
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:31,758
Just now.

967
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,552
No kidding. It was yesterday.

968
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:36,054
Wow, I slept for 22 hours straight.

969
00:58:36,138 --> 00:58:37,848
I really am living my best life.

970
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:40,851
Don't raise the TV volume over 20
when you're watching a movie.

971
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:43,186
Please. I'm a little tired today.

972
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:46,606
Where do you think you're going?

973
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:50,193
Don't you know I have an important problem
that I have to solve right now?

974
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:51,653
What problem?

975
00:58:51,737 --> 00:58:54,489
The person of interest
that you've been hiding from me.

976
00:58:54,573 --> 00:58:55,782
I'm going to find her.

977
00:58:57,701 --> 00:58:59,494
I have an amazing plan, you know.

978
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:01,621
Even you can't escape it.

979
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:03,415
I'm already escaping.

980
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,417
You're right. Wait!

981
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,632
Would you look at that?

982
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:14,801
You're ignoring me, right?

983
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:18,972
Fine.

984
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:20,932
Let's see…

985
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:24,102
how long…

986
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:27,898
you can keep this up.

987
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,320
Well,

988
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,363
this was just the first step.

989
00:59:35,447 --> 00:59:36,615
The second step is…

990
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:43,330
Why are you touching them?

991
00:59:50,879 --> 00:59:52,839
Yoon Hee-jin's Tactile Play!

992
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:56,676
Oh, look at that.
This is going to wrinkle so fast.

993
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,178
Look, it's already wrinkled.

994
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:00,680
The shirt's going to be ruined.

995
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:08,605
You're really making me
bring out the big guns, aren't you?

996
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:10,190
Your provocations are childish.

997
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,526
This is more of a disaster
than a provocation.

998
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:26,081
Do you know what these are?

999
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:27,958
These are my favorite sneakers.

1000
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:31,670
That's right.
I haven't washed them in six years.

1001
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:38,093
I even wore these on
the Camino de Santiago last year.

1002
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:39,511
In the middle of summer.

1003
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:41,513
- Hey, wait, Hee-jin, you--
- Here we go.

1004
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:44,474
Where should I step with these first?

1005
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:49,521
That pristine white bed
is looking so appealing right now.

1006
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,731
- Yeah.
- Okay, fine!

1007
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:54,776
Fine.

1008
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:56,653
Fine.

1009
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:58,280
- You're going to tell me?
- Yeah.

1010
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:00,282
Fine, I will. So just get those

1011
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:02,951
out of my room right now.

1012
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:23,346
So who is it?

1013
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,849
Where did you meet her?
How long has it been?

1014
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:31,563
She's from work.

1015
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:33,523
Oh my gosh! An office romance?

1016
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:36,318
Holy cow, this is so thrilling already.

1017
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:38,069
Do you secretly hold hands?

1018
01:01:38,153 --> 01:01:40,488
Do you gaze longingly
at each other across the meeting room?

1019
01:01:40,572 --> 01:01:42,908
Never. It's not a romance either.

1020
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:44,284
Why not? Don't you like her?

1021
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:45,994
I never said I liked her.

1022
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:48,580
Why haven't you told her
you like her when you do?

1023
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:50,749
Are you going to keep nitpicking?

1024
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:53,376
I'm not nitpicking.
I'm asking insightful questions.

1025
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:56,087
You like her.
You miss her. You want to be with her.

1026
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:57,672
So why aren't you dating her?

1027
01:01:57,756 --> 01:01:58,757
Jeez.

1028
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,717
It's not as simple as that.

1029
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,886
Dummy. The heart is simple.

1030
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,596
It's a green light or a red light.

1031
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:07,307
Erase everything from the world

1032
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,851
and just imagine her,
standing across the street.

1033
01:02:10,936 --> 01:02:12,103
What color's the light?

1034
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:16,900
Yellow.

1035
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:18,860
What?

1036
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:22,656
The yellow light that comes on
the moment you step onto the stop line.

1037
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:26,451
That's what she's like to me.

1038
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:28,286
That's so lame.

1039
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:31,373
You classify everything
as right or wrong,

1040
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:33,416
but your own heart is a gray area?

1041
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:35,460
Boo.

1042
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:37,754
So Baek-ho, what a coward.

1043
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:38,838
Boo.

1044
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:45,011
I know.

1045
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:55,313
If one cannot manage
the work appropriately

1046
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:57,148
and only focus on getting the deal through

1047
01:02:57,232 --> 01:03:00,068
or fail to efficiently maneuver
through the merger,

1048
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:02,862
it could become a failed M&A.

1049
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:06,574
The major risks according
to the life cycle of the M&A.

1050
01:03:06,658 --> 01:03:09,828
If you look at this graph here,
it's divided between the size of resources

1051
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:11,913
and the M&A cycles.

1052
01:03:11,997 --> 01:03:14,791
The two stages are approach and execution.

1053
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:17,711
During the approach stage,
you establish a plan for the M&A,

1054
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,422
target screening, due diligence,
and negotiations.

1055
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:23,633
And lastly, the execution stage
is the merger.

1056
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:27,220
Now, if you take a look at
the main causes of major risks per stage,

1057
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:29,889
firstly, the approach risk

1058
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:32,434
is focusing the resources
on the deal itself…

1059
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:38,565
Eat up.

1060
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:53,496
Nice, pork cutlet.

1061
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,166
I knew it! It's Kim Mi-kyung.

1062
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:57,250
Kim Mi-kyung?

1063
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:00,337
It is her?

1064
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,755
Wait, she's looking at us.

1065
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:03,798
What about her?

1066
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:04,841
She dated Mr. Park.

1067
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:07,093
- Mr. Park--
- Hey, be quiet.

1068
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,554
And then she got
kicked out of the company.

1069
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:11,139
- She really got kicked out?
- Yeah.

1070
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:12,432
Just eat.

1071
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:14,476
Wait, I can't see her. She got kicked out?

1072
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,228
When?

1073
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,189
Chief.

1074
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:20,899
How long did they date?

1075
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:25,403
I can't hear you. Speak up.

1076
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:29,866
So you're saying
she suddenly came back to the company

1077
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:32,035
where her ex is an executive director.

1078
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:33,244
Unbelievable.

1079
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:13,701
SIX YEARS AGO

1080
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:23,795
Isn't it so funny?

1081
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:25,338
Seriously.

1082
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:27,048
I know, right? It's so famous.

1083
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:28,383
- No, it's not.
- That's crazy.

1084
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:30,009
- I thought it was someone else.
- Really?

1085
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:31,261
Hello.

1086
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:33,763
Let's go to the bathroom.

1087
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:35,223
I'll go with you.

1088
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:37,475
I suddenly remembered
I had something to do.

1089
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:57,495
Hey!

1090
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:33,239
Man.

1091
01:06:35,617 --> 01:06:37,410
Today sucks so much.

1092
01:06:52,634 --> 01:06:55,053
Hello, this is
Assistant Manager Kim Mi-kyung.

1093
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:08,900
That was a rather aggressive entrance.

1094
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:12,403
- Have a seat--
- Shut up!

1095
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:15,907
I came to tell you
to never call me again.

1096
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:18,910
I'm going to change my number today

1097
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:21,496
and throw this phone
into the East Sea and leave it to drown

1098
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:25,083
in the salt water because
I had to hear your voice through it.

1099
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:29,170
That's how much
I hate talking to you. Understand?

1100
01:07:30,922 --> 01:07:32,715
It was just one phone call.

1101
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:38,888
Were you crying?

1102
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:42,850
Get your eyes checked.

1103
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:44,227
Why would I cry?

1104
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:46,563
You can't fool me. You cried.

1105
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:49,274
What happened? Did someone say something?

1106
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:51,317
Okay.

1107
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,529
Get to the point already.

1108
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:57,407
If you called me here
for something stupid,

1109
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:59,075
I'm actually going to kill you.

1110
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:01,035
I'll kill you even
if it's something important.

1111
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:02,203
I'll kill you!

1112
01:08:04,706 --> 01:08:06,457
Fine. Kill me.

1113
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:14,215
Director So just sent up
the form to fire you.

1114
01:08:16,676 --> 01:08:17,677
What?

1115
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:24,601
Right now?

1116
01:08:26,311 --> 01:08:29,022
Not a few weeks ago?

1117
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,481
- Today?
- Yeah, today.

1118
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:35,320
And here I thought
you two were super close

1119
01:08:35,403 --> 01:08:37,071
the way you speak to him.

1120
01:08:38,156 --> 01:08:41,409
I'm not going to sign off on it
for a while, so don't worry.

1121
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:44,746
But I thought you should know
that Director So made his decision.

1122
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:32,835
What do you need me to do?

1123
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:37,423
<i>Sleep well.</i>

1124
01:09:41,052 --> 01:09:43,513
I really hope

1125
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:46,516
that you'll continue
to watch me work a bit more.

1126
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:48,518
Kim Mi-kyung.

1127
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:54,482
What a fool you've made of yourself.

1128
01:09:58,528 --> 01:09:59,654
I…

1129
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:05,243
I was so stupid…

1130
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:12,458
I didn't even know.

1131
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,373
Are there any other flowers that you like?

1132
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:56,252
False goat's beard?

1133
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:22,320
What's with the flower pot up there?

1134
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:24,989
Why are you growing that?

1135
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:27,909
Because it's a flower I like?
Is that really why?

1136
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:33,164
Can you just tell me
I'm not your person of interest?

1137
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:36,083
That I'm nothing,
that I misread everything?

1138
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:38,628
Can you just tell me that right now?

1139
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:42,673
One day you're ice cold,
then you're all warm and kind,

1140
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:45,259
but just when I start
to like being with you,

1141
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:49,013
you pull back suddenly and act like
I'm not even a passing thought.

1142
01:11:49,597 --> 01:11:51,182
It's driving me absolutely nuts.

1143
01:11:51,766 --> 01:11:53,643
All you talk about are principles,

1144
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:56,854
but you come and go as you please
through my heart, without any rules.

1145
01:11:56,938 --> 01:11:58,231
Why?

1146
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:00,733
Do you even have a why?

1147
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:04,195
Or do you just think I'm a total idiot?

1148
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:07,824
- Ms. Kim Mi-kyung.
- Just be honest with me!

1149
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:10,910
What am I to you, Mr. So Baek-ho?

1150
01:12:18,376 --> 01:12:19,961
A line I want to cross.

1151
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:20,688
<i>- You want to talk?</i>
<i>- Yes. Talk.</i>

1152
01:13:20,771 --> 01:13:22,356
<i>Okay, we can do all that.</i>

1153
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:23,608
<i>But…</i>

1154
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:25,109
<i>This first.</i>

1155
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:32,533
Stop.

1156
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:35,429
<i>A line? This country</i>
<i>has only one line you can cross.</i>

1157
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:38,975
<i>What should I do? I must be crazy.</i>

1158
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:40,601
What time were you born?

1159
01:14:40,685 --> 01:14:42,853
And what about Chief So?
When was he born?

1160
01:14:42,937 --> 01:14:46,691
Please stop!
Can someone sedate him already?

1161
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:50,945
Kim Mi-kyung is not someone
you can take advantage of!

1162
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:52,071
Egg-kick!

1163
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:55,574
It's about what happened six years ago.

1164
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:56,826
<i>Ms. Kim.</i>

1165
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:58,160
<i>I'm here…</i>

1166
01:14:58,244 --> 01:15:00,329
<i>to ask you out.</i>

1167
01:15:00,413 --> 01:15:03,207
Instead of having dinner,
can we do something else?

1168
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:11,632
