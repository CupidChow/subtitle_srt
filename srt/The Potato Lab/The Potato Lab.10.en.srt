What…

3
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:08,485
do you regret, exactly?

4
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:14,241
If your answer is what I think it is…

5
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:17,869
then you don't mean it.

6
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,373
- Mi-kyung--
- I've been in your shoes, remember?

7
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,333
When my mom passed away…

8
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,336
I could only think about

9
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,255
everything I'd said

10
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,507
and done wrong.

11
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,010
Because regrets are for

12
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,095
those left behind.

13
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:40,100
I blamed myself
and made myself suffer.

14
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,814
That's what you're going through, Ki-se.

15
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,442
Yeah.

16
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,453
I won't get mad at you
because I know you didn't mean it.

17
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,580
But you need to pull yourself together

18
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:04,041
and give your father a good send-off.

19
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,017
Don't rush back. Take your time.

20
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:24,645
Okay.

21
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,295
- Yeah, hey--
<i>- Why haven't you…</i>

22
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:36,174
picked up your freaking phone?
This is an emergency!

23
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,093
Why bother carrying your phone around

24
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,803
<i>and paying for a plan</i>
<i>if you won't pick up?</i>

25
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,805
You might as well be
lighting beacons instead.

26
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,807
Sorry, I had it on mute.

27
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,184
Why? What's going on?

28
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:48,812
Baek-ho?

29
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,565
Hwan-kyung saw him drive out
earlier this morning.

30
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,859
He was probably going to the funeral.

31
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,695
<i>You didn't run into him, right?</i>

32
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,865
No, I didn't see him.

You're here.

What's going on?

40
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,864
Didn't both of you
take a half-day yesterday?

41
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,950
Today, you had to go to a funeral,
and he said he was going to Headquarters.

42
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,203
But I thought you two
were secretly going on a date

43
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,871
and got jealous.

44
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,373
Chief So went to Headquarters?

45
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,167
Did he not tell you?

Is there a reason why
you have to stay at that guesthouse?

Baek-ho, I'm…

51
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,331
not a completely open person.

Excuse me, Mr. So?
Did you forget how to knock?

62
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,443
When you asked me
to deal with that employee back then,

63
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,653
was it because of Mr. Park?

64
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,532
What on earth are you--

65
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:48,700
It's important.

66
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,455
Leave us.

67
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,216
Back then, I thought my life was over.

68
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,053
I lost everything,
including my pride for my life's work

69
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,598
and my hopes for my future.

70
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:16,019
I just lived because I was still breathing

71
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,147
and only woke up in the morning
because I opened my eyes.

72
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,523
It was getting so bad…

73
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:33,828
Gosh.

74
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:36,539
Oh my goodness.

75
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,250
- Good work today.
- You too.

76
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,044
And good luck to you, Ms. Kim.

77
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,462
What luck does she need?

78
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,256
I know that it was 100% your fault, MK.

79
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,635
Hurry up, apologize to Chief So
and make up already.

80
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,637
I already told you
we didn't have a fight.

81
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,514
How is it all my fault?

82
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,141
If anything upsets you, hit me up.

83
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,768
I'll run over whenever--

84
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,228
- Okay, get home safely.
- Goodbye!

85
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,771

What on earth is going on right now?

00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,972
Hey, boyfriend!

91
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,351
Are you trying to get dumped
after two days of dating?

92
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,187
Why haven't you called me all day?

93
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,356
I thought you were ghosting me--

94
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,615
Is something wrong?

95
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,411
I missed you.

96
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,125
Jeez, it's only been one day.

97
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,140
Wow!

98
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:23,605
You know, you should've
opened a pasta place instead.

99
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,857
Why do you only make this for me?

100
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,360
The line would go on for hours
if you opened a restaurant in Seongsu.

101
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,573
You look really tired today.

102
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,785
Did Headquarters call you in
because something was wrong?

103
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:37,911
No.

104
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,662
I had to confirm something in person.

105
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:40,789
I see.

106
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,084
How was your day?

107
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,336
I mean,

108
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,881
I had to go somewhere in the morning

109
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,425
and then clocked in
to do whatever work I had.

110
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,385
It was pretty good.

111
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,431
Except I was worried about someone.

112
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:01,893
I'm sorry.

113
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,732
What exactly is going on?

114
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,194
Do you know what you look like right now?

115
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,656
A long time ago, my dog broke
a flowerpot in the backyard there

116
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,658
and acted all guilty about it.

117
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,327
He'd whine and lie on his back
in front of Hwan-kyung.

118
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,412
That's what your face looks like.

119
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,998
You did something wrong, didn't you?

120
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,630
Look at your face!
You look so scared right now.

121
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,632
I'm just kidding.

122
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,094
I know how honest you are.

123
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,223
You'd probably explain
everything thoroughly, apologize,

124
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,393
and say, "Reprimand me appropriately"
or "Penalize me properly."

125
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,936
Good God.

126
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,564
Just thinking about it drains me.

127
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,316
I'd much rather you
lie on your back and act cute.

128
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,777
Then I'll do that.

129
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,073
The verbal agreement has been finalized.

130
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,910
I'll be looking forward
to the day you apologize.

131
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,891
Wow.

132
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:26,352
You live right next door.
Are you really going to walk her back?

133
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,854
My goodness.

134
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:31,941
You two are so sweet
you'll attract bees, my honey.

135
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:36,404
Oh, please! You miss each other so much
that you call each other from the bath--

136
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,948
Wait a second. What are you doing?

137
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,284
I'm washing your teddy bear.

138
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,162
It's so dirty I can't stand it.

139
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,164
You didn't even ask me for permission!

140
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,417
Then you should've kept it clean!

141
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,419
Do you see this? The water is grimy

142
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,421
from you rubbing
your face on it all the time.

143
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,797
Hey!

144
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:58,051
You can smell Baek-ho's scent
on the back of its head!

145
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,261
Now it's all gone because of you!

146
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,098
Honeybun,
I think it's time for you to run.

147
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,642
Mi-kyung.

148
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,188
No.

149
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,148
I'm 30 years old now.

150
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:15,902
I will no longer be oppressed by
this tyrant with anger management issues.

151
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,155
Trying to defy me? That's cute.

152
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:24,202
So what will you do

153
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,453
with this?

154
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,372
Can you even pull the trigger?

155
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,707
Don't get any closer.

156
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:31,668
I can shoot.

157
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,836
- I will shoot!
- Hey, hey!

158
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,505
Whoa!

159
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,006
- Oh, Mi-kyung!
- Whoa!

160
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,134
Are you all right?

161
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:41,844
Hey!

162
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:47,809
I'm with the winner, yay!

163
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,562
- Stop!
- Oh, yeah! Nice!

164
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:52,814
- Yay!
- Stop!

165
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,316
Mi-kyung, here! Here!

166
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,487
Hey, you!

167
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,545
Take that! You!

168
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,006
So silly.

169
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,175
- Oh, don't you dare.
- Whoa!

170
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,218
Oh?

171
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,137
- Wait a second!
- I got you!

172
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,224
Wait, stop!

173
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:48,911
What is this?

174
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,331
My scent.

175
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:53,958
I see.

176
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,511
No one use the new shampoo! It's mine!

177
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,064
I'll kill you if you use it!

178
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:57,313
GONGMO FUNERAL HOME

179
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:07,031
It would've been uncomfortable for
everyone if Hee-jin or Ms. Wang had come,

180
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,116
so I came alone.

181
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,827
- Don't be too upset by that.
- It's fine.

182
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,121
Thank you for making the time to visit.

183
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,417
I heard that your father
was in the hospital for a long time.

184
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,960
He left us too soon.

185
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,463
He was the same age as my mom, right?

186
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,090
Yes.

187
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,094
- When's the burial?
- The day after tomorrow.

188
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,888
You should take a few more days off.

189
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,432
You look awful.

190
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,642
No, it's fine.
There are important deals to review.

191
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:35,810
Would you like some?

192
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,603
No, I drove.

193
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,021
Okay.

194
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,033
Well…

195
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,910
God.

196
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,787
I don't know
if I should bring this up now.

197
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,168
Do you remember
when you asked me recently

198
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,170
about that woman from six years ago?

199
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,882
What about it?

200
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,509
Director So came to see me today.

201
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,304
He wanted to know
exactly what had happened.

202
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,889
Why are you two suddenly

203
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,640
bringing that up?

204
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,434
Did something happen?

205
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,906
Go, win, go! Go, win, go!

206
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,950
Go, win, go! Go, win, go!

207
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,369
- Go, win, go! Go, win, go!
- Whoa, whoa!

208
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:38,581
Go, win, go! Go, win, go!

209
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,007
My goodness.

210
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,343
You never change, do you?

211
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,845
I told you to stop lying down like that

212
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,263
wherever you go.

213
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:59,977
You have to lie down
as much as you can on the weekends

214
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,980
to recharge enough
to go back to work on Monday.

215
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:04,273
Don't act like you forgot.

216
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,734
Goodness me. Come on, sit up and eat.

217
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:09,529
These won't last
when the rainy season comes.

218
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,490
Why don't I just lie here
with my mouth open,

219
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,325
and you can toss them in one by one?

220
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,244
Don't be ridiculous. Get up.

221
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,206
Oh, gosh.

222
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,251
- Go on, eat.
- Okay.

223
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:25,628
Hey.

224
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,796
- It's sweet.
- Yes.

225
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,426
- Monk.
- Yes?

226
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,721
I have a fascinating story to tell.
Wanna hear?

227
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,474
Is this about Ong-ju
and Hwan-kyung dating?

228
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:40,935
How do you know that?

229
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,563
I heard it on the day of, silly.

230
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:44,981
Ong-ju called me all excited.

231
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,275
Wow, I can't believe her!

232
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,235
She kept it a secret from me,
her best friend,

233
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,279
but immediately reported it to my dad?

234
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:54,115
Goodness, don't be so petty
over things like that.

235
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,492
Hwan-kyung had a crush on Ong-ju for ages.

236
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,077
We should be supportive.

237
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,246
What? How long have you known that?

238
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,581
Am I the odd one out?

239
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,457
Do you three have a secret group chat?

240
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,834
You didn't know?

241
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,003
Oh, good grief!

242
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,717
Then perhaps you've also heard
about the other piece of news?

243
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,011
Yeah. Ong-ju said,

244
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:18,556
"Looks like you'll have a
son-in-law soon!"

245
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,974
I can't believe her.

246
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,309
There's just one thing.

247
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:24,812
Don't forget to use contraception, okay?

248
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,230
- Oh my gosh, Dad!
- What?

249
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:28,399
What kind of monk says that?

250
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,692
We haven't--

251
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,278
Oh my gosh! Why would you say that?

252
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,863
Goodness me.

253
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,489
Am I wrong, though?

254
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,825
When I see my friends' profile pictures,

255
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,535
they go from their kids' wedding photos

256
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,121
to photos of their grandkids
after six months or so.

257
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,080
Come on.

258
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:46,959
Your daughter
isn't that open-minded, okay?

259
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,961
Besides, we just started dating.

260
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,588
We…

261
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,424
don't know that much about each other yet.

262
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,511
So, what's he like?

263
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:03,100
Well, he's a bit…

264
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,061
weird.

265
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,106
He's quirky but cute.

266
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:13,819
Although he's smart,
he can be dumb at times.

267
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,489
He's cold, but warm to me.

268
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,617
His eyes are so sweet.

269
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:24,497
You certainly seem happy, my dear.

270
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,623
You're right.

271
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,293
I'm about to lose my job,
but I can't stop laughing.

272
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:30,836
I must be happy.

273
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,465
As long as you're happy. Eat up.

274
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:36,967
Dad! Mi-kyung!

275
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,347
Ong-ju's gotten into a fight
with the child monks.

276
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,556
Help me break it up!

277
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,226
- Oh no.
- My goodness.

278
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,979
When will I ever have a moment of peace?

279
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,022
Where is she?

280
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,817
Do you like pumpkin leaves?

281
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,532
Do you like pumpkin leaves?

282
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:44,577
Yes, I do.

283
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:10,102
Have you lost your appetite
because it's uncomfortable to eat with me?

284
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:14,398
Oh, no. It's delicious.

285
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,026
I was feeling particularly lonely today,

286
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,403
so I wanted to have someone to talk to.

287
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,447
Are you busy? Am I keeping you?

288
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,699
Oh, no. I'm fine.

289
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,621
You know, people need
to have conversations.

290
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,748
Whether it is good or bad.

291
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,333
My husband was like you.

292
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,919
He never really opened up.

293
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,798
So whenever he felt frustrated,

294
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:41,342
he'd just run around the neighborhood
until he ran out of breath,

295
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,511
then come home,
have a glass of cold water,

296
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:44,845
and that was that.

297
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:48,307
He bottled it all up
and started ignoring me.

298
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,935
I wasn't running for that reason.

299
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,269
I go jogging three times a--

300
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:53,354
When I was young,

301
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:57,274
I thought my husband was thoughtful.

302
00:21:57,358 --> 00:22:01,987
But that poor, quiet man
didn't live past 60.

303
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,616
Now I can see that he was a fool.

304
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:11,372
He just kept swallowing down
every sad thing that happened.

305
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:14,583
Imagine how torn up he was inside.

306
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,711
He lived with that pain his whole life.

307
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,015
You must miss him a lot.

308
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,856
Every year,
when the potato harvest came around,

309
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:40,442
he'd pick out the biggest,
prettiest ones and bring them home.

310
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,027
When I became ill one winter,

311
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:45,239
he sold off a calf to buy me
a cotton comforter.

312
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:49,159
Longing for someone who's gone…

313
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:51,996
it's selfish, I know.

314
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,165
I just hold onto the hope

315
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,126
that we'll see each other again soon.

316
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,466
How did you bear it?

317
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:09,930
I…

318
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,601
I grew up with nothing and no one

319
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:16,353
and always received things,

320
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,189
but never lost anything.

321
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,235
I don't remember
caring for something either.

322
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,361
So…

323
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,364
I have absolutely no idea

324
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,284
how to overcome

325
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,244
the feeling of loss

326
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,998
or how to let go when I actually lose…

327
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,461
something precious to me.

328
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,338
There's no one wise enough

329
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,715
in this world to know that.

330
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,550
Even at this age,

331
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:50,596
I still miss my parents and my husband

332
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:52,890
something fierce.

333
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:56,602
I have not overcome that sorrow

334
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,978
even for a single day,

335
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,106
not even for a single moment.

336
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,526
You just live with this…

337
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:07,112
constant ache every day.

338
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,408
But you're still alive.

339
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:15,579
It may hurt, scab over,
and become scarred, but you won't die.

340
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:20,584
People can handle that much.

341
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,670
That much pain,

342
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,589
you can bear it and live your life.

343
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,604
Oh, goodness gracious.

344
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:42,898
Oh gosh…

345
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,359
I said too much, didn't I?

346
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,318
No.

347
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,321
I'm just ashamed of myself…

348
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,116
for being a coward.

349
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,242
Oh, honey.

350
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:03,460
Don't keep it all bottled up.

351
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:06,046
Goodness.

352
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,716
- Ms. Hong!
- Ms. Hong!

353
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,218
- Ms. Hong!
- Ms. Hong!

354
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,345
We pressed sesame oil today--

355
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,765
Oh my. Why are you here,

356
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,352
Seoul Guy?

357
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:21,437
Wait, hold on.

358
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,231
Are you crying?

359
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,482
Why are you crying?

360
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,652
Oh, no, I'm not.

361
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,863
It's just the wind.

362
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,407
You're really crying.

363
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:37,369
What are you doing?
Go bring the <i>makgeolli.</i>

364
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:39,997
Oh, right! I'll go get some.

365
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,540
<i>- Makgeolli.</i>
<i>- Makgeolli.</i>

366
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:44,251
What happened?

367
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,556
I'm so freaking annoyed.

368
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,308
If you hadn't stopped me,

369
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,186
I would've taught that rude kid a lesson.

370
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,520
What lesson?

371
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:06,899
Do you want to be on the news
for fighting a kid at a temple?

372
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,151
It ended with both of you crying,

373
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,070
so just consider it a draw.

374
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,112
Nope.

375
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:13,906
He cried first. I won.

376
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:14,948
Good Lord.

377
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:15,949
What?

378
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,914
Do you smell that? It smells delicious.

379
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:30,756
Hey!

380
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,348
You know what this is?

381
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,683
This is sesame oil pressed
from Mr. Byun's mill.

382
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:44,812
Wow. He told us to write
our names down on a waiting list

383
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:47,314
but he just gave some away to the guest?

384
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,816
If you'd like a bottle--

385
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:51,360
Then I won't refuse.
This thing is worth its weight in gold.

386
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,403
We still have some
<i>nokdu-muk</i> left, right? Let's go.

387
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:55,072
I'll cook the eggs. You parboil the <i>muk.</i>

388
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,240
Let's go.

389
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:01,036
Looks like you're
a bona fide Youngeul-ri resident now.

390
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,247
This is Mr. Byun's love language, you see.

391
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,999
This means that your attendance
at Youth Association President Park's

392
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,709
60th birthday next month is mandatory.

393
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,177
Hey! Why are you making
that "I messed up" face again?

394
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,517
Want to go for a walk?

395
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,201
I thought this was a date,

396
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:43,245
but I guess it's a walk of silence.

397
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,459
What is it?

398
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,213
Out with it. I'm all ears,
as long as you aren't proposing.

399
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,393
Goodness gracious,
who's breaking the mood?

400
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,145
It's Ms. Ju.

401
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:09,938
Just a second.

402
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,690
Hey, boss.

403
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,903
Oh, sure.
Then I'll bring it with me tomorrow.

404
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:18,488
No worries. Okay, bye.

405
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,159
Do you have to go to the lab?

406
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,577
It wasn't a work call.

407
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,413
The Research Team is having
a picnic tomorrow.

408
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:30,000
Since it'll get hectic next week
when the harvest season starts,

409
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:34,046
we're taking a day to just drink
and have fun before the work begins.

410
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,089
I see.

411
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:43,972
So,

412
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,975
what's got my Softie Sweetie all hesitant?

413
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,980
Look, why don't we…

414
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:55,484
go somewhere for--

415
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,526
What?

416
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:01,573
Fireflies!

417
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:07,204
Wow!

418
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:16,338
I haven't seen a firefly in years.

419
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,048
It's your first time seeing them, right?

420
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,133
Yes, it is.

421
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:21,802
Wow.

422
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:24,012
To be honest,

423
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,765
I ran away from Seoul to here on a whim,

424
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:31,770
but every time I see things like this,
I'm so glad I decided to live here.

425
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,231
They're so pretty, like tiny stars.

426
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:42,656
The picnic.

427
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:44,992
- Can I go too?
- What?

428
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,536
We didn't invite you on purpose.

429
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,664
We're going to get super drunk and rowdy.

430
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,666
And I know you don't like that at all.

431
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,543
My preferences aside,

432
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,878
as the chief, I have the duty to encourage

433
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,172
the Research Team
before their grueling work…

434
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,053
And I want to be with you longer.

435
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:11,852
Oh gosh.

436
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,691
The weather is amazing!

437
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:20,944
Good morning.

438
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,822
We were getting ready

439
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,325
to go swimming later on.

440
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:27,326
Yes, we were!

441
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,496
Just know that I will head straight home
the moment I see

442
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,874
more than one centimeter
of bare flesh below the collarbone.

443
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,208
- Oh.
- I mean, I'm in shape.

444
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:36,293
Yes, ma'am.

445
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:38,128
- Hey, potatoes!
- What?

446
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,088
- Oh, hello!
- Hello!

447
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,007
- Hello!
- Welcome!

448
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,176
- Wow! Su-jin!
- Hi!

449
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:47,471
Long time no see, Su-jin.
Did you tag along to play with your dad?

450
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,513
- Yes, she did!
- No.

451
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,515
- What?
- In the morning, my mom said to Dad,

452
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,767
"Do you expect me

453
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,770
to be stuck at home watching the kid
while you go and play?"

454
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,688
So I had to come along.

455
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:59,024
Oh, sweetie, your sunscreen
is all messed up here.

456
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,525
- Let go of me!
- Hey!

457
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:02,361
- Hello, hello!
- Hey!

458
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,446
- Hey!
- Hi, Su-jin!

459
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,657
Oh my gosh,
the taxi dropped me off over there,

460
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:09,910
but I followed Mr. Ko's perfume,
and it led me here.

461
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,370
No joke.

462
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,873
We're all here, then.

463
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:15,832
Let's go.

464
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:16,917
- Yes.
- Yes.

465
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,879
The theme of today's picnic

466
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,631
is none other than

467
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,924
glamping!

468
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,675
Glamping?

469
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,303
Which one is that?

470
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,889
- Is it a new Teenieping?
- No.

471
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,935
Come on, Mr. Bu. You can't say anything
that ends with "ping"

472
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,937
in front of a young girl.

473
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:39,147
We barely got through Children's Day.

474
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,273
Just look at her.

475
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:41,775
- What? No, it's nothing.
- Okay.

476
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,945
All right, then. Anyway,

477
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,656
so I rented out a very luxurious camp…

478
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,534
camp…

479
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:58,458
vehicle for travel,

480
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,293
so do look forward to it.

481
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:02,754
With the beautiful nature of Gangwon--

482
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,589
No more work talk today!

483
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:06,675
- Whoo!
- Research Team!

484
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,635
- Let's eat and play!
- Let's eat and play!

485
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:12,639
- Potato, potato, potato!
- Potato, potato, potato!

486
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:15,809
Let's go, let's go!

487
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:19,312
I spent all night trying to book this.

488
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,314
That's so nice of you.

489
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:22,566
What?

490
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,360
THE BEST LUXURY CAMPING CAR

491
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,616
Luxury? Where? Where's the luxury?

492
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,784
What?

493
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,871
Wait.

494
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,587
A Swedish prison
would be better than this.

495
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,047
That's strange.

496
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,884
When I saw the pictures online,

497
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:52,053
it was really luxurious and spacious.

498
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,098
- Look.
- Hey!

499
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,558
Who cares if it's a little tight?

500
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,144
It's better than
being cooped up in the office.

501
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:01,438
Come on, Research Team.

502
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:04,065
Let's eat and play!

503
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,984
- Let's eat and play!
- Let's eat and play.

504
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,694
- Is this it?
- Oh my goodness!

505
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,821
Fancy seeing you here.

506
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:13,241
KIMJUNGMI FOOD
SWEET POTATO LAB

507
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,973
My, oh my, aren't you the Research Team

508
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:39,684
from Sunnyeo Food Potato Lab?

509
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,271
What's with the harsh vibes?

510
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:46,107
Potatoes and sweet potatoes.

511
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:48,235
Rivals for eternity.

512
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,862
We have a particularly bad relationship

513
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:52,989
with that Sweet Potato Lab.

514
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:55,158
INNOVATION AND FUTURE
OF AGRICULTURE AND RURAL VILLAGES

515
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:56,826
FORCIBLY REMOVED TWICE FROM CONFERENCES

516
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,995
<i>We have a record of</i>
<i>being forcibly removed twice</i>

517
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:01,831
<i>from agricultural conferences</i>
<i>for heated arguments.</i>

518
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:04,668
<i>In the National Root Vegetable</i>
<i>Association's foot volleyball matches,</i>

519
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,546
<i>our record against them over six years</i>
<i>is 1 win, 3 losses, and 2 draws.</i>

520
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:08,797
<i>And…</i>

521
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,757
FOOT VOLLEYBALL
1 WIN, 3 LOSSES, 2 DRAWS

522
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,677
…there's something they don't know about.

523
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:17,514
Our Ms. Ju
and their deputy general manager

524
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,432
dated in college.

525
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,310
For three months.

526
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,063
That's rather old news.

527
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,942
We're no longer with Sunnyeo Food
but with Wonhan Retail.

528
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,278
You could say we've moved up considerably.

529
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:33,863
So you rented out a budget camping car

530
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:37,200
befitting your large company. How frugal.

531
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,579
- We rented a luxury camping car.
- Jeez.

532
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:44,332
You've come so far for a company trip.

533
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,835
But then again, I suppose Gangwon-do

534
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:50,797
is the best place to vacation in Korea.

535
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,674
- That's right.
- Actually, as you know,

536
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,844
the south is temperate year-round,

537
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,305
so one can get
too comfortable and relaxed.

538
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:01,850
We need to come to rough places like this
with strong winds

539
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,269
- to refresh ourselves.
- Exactly right.

540
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,689
Excuse me? Rough place?

541
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,525
According to
the river basin survey this quarter,

542
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,694
Gangwon-do's water quality was nationally

543
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,030
the… best--

544
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,239
All right.

545
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:19,200
Don't bother them.
Take a moment to unpack.

546
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:23,455
I'm sure they're busy researching snacks.

547
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,624
- You're right.
- "Snacks"?

548
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,543
Did you just call
our sweet potatoes "snacks"?

549
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:31,713
It sure isn't a staple food.

550
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,215
Go and make some sweet potato lattes

551
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:37,010
and candied sweet potatoes. Bang, bang!

552
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,928
- There you go!
- I can't believe this.

553
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:41,473
If potatoes are such a great staple food,

554
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,059
why is their population support
per unit area

555
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,810
only half that of sweet potatoes?

556
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:47,646
- Oh, please!
- Excuse me. Sir?

557
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,940
You can't attack the potato
with population support.

558
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:53,443
Don't you know that the explosive
population growth in Europe

559
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,320
in the 18th century
was all due to potatoes?

560
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,238
That's where
the Industrial Revolution started.

561
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:00,116
And from there stemmed
the Information Age!

562
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,620
Potatoes basically created
human civilization in the 21st century!

563
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:06,414
Sweet potatoes are the real future food.

564
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,958
As for potatoes,

565
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,543
their time is limited.

566
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:15,090
Didn't you see the article about
coral reefs melting away in the Jeju sea?

567
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,424
Give it 20 years.

568
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:19,386
There won't be a place left
in Korea cool enough

569
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:21,429
- to cultivate potatoes.
- Exactly right.

570
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:22,889
- What did you say?
- Shame on you.

571
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,975
Attacking fellow agriculturalists
with climate change

572
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,687
- is crossing a line!
- Exactly!

573
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,939
- Who crossed the line?
- Don't be ridiculous!

574
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,191
You're the one
crossing the line saying that!

575
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,492
Calm down, everyone.

576
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,079
Wait, hold on!

577
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,124
Chief So!

578
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,250
- Chief So?
- What?

579
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:51,751
Chief.

580
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:06,182
I'm Chief So Baek-ho
of Wonhan Retail's Potato Lab.

581
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:09,436
I see.

582
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,647
- I'm from the Sweet Potato Lab--
- You must be the dessert researchers.

583
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,149
Dessert?

584
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,281
I do apologize
for hosting you at a place

585
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,032
that falls short of expectations.

586
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:26,953
It was my mistake for not checking
thoroughly beforehand.

587
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,750
Please go rent a first-class camping car…

588
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:36,629
that is suitable for our Potato Lab.

589
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:39,424
With all the add-ons.

590
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,385
Wait, really? Nice!

591
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:51,102
Oh, I knew it. My--

592
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,645
Prince.

593
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:53,646
What?

594
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:57,734
- Wow!
- Ta-da!

595
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,528
I rented out
the most luxurious glamping grounds!

596
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:03,531
Wow, this is amazing!

597
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:07,035
All right then. We'll have some free time…

598
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,369
Wow.

599
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:12,373
Oh, my goodness.

600
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:15,585
Gosh, my legs are killing me.

601
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,506
The beautiful sunlight, the waves…

602
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:22,133
I don't need any of that.
I love a good room.

603
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:26,930
While I'm glad that we get
to enjoy all this because of you, Chief,

604
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,515
isn't this too much?

605
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,476
I don't mean to brag,

606
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,103
but this isn't that huge an expense to me.

607
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:37,398
Wow. I'm both envious and annoyed by that.

608
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,361
And to you,

609
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,822
this is your last picnic here.

610
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,574
I wanted it to be a good memory.

611
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,203
I'm kind of annoyed by that too,

612
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,664
especially coming
from the person who fired me.

613
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,346
Don't tempt me.

614
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:11,599
I'm struggling to keep myself
in check as it is.

615
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:14,936
If I did whatever I wanted to,
I might get arrested for indecency.

616
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,025
Well…

617
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,195
Let's see…

618
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,824
The door is closed,
and the curtains are drawn.

619
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:30,285
No one will know

620
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,828
what we do in here.

621
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:42,505
Well, then.

622
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:46,676
Maybe a quick kiss would be--

623
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,177
What's your name, mister?

624
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,016
Oh… Su-jin!

625
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,267
Why are you…

626
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:58,897
Mr. Ko's in the next room over.
He's not here.

627
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,232
I know that.

628
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:05,153
I'm here to play with him.

629
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,822
I walked around the whole place,

630
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,034
and I like him the best.

631
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,328
Me?

632
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,495
Yes!

633
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:15,955
What's your name?

634
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,291
It's So… Baek-ho.

635
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:19,667
How old are you?

636
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:21,294
I'm 34 years old.

637
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:23,588
Perfect.

638
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,800
Your hand.

639
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:31,554
Come transform with me.

640
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:33,348
- Pardon?
- Come on!

641
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,391
Wait, hold on. Hold on.

642
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:36,893
Wait, where are we--

643
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,895
- Hurry up!
- Mi-kyung, I…

644
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,939
Wait, can you tell me where we're…

645
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,359
Let's go!

646
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:49,864
Come in! Come on!

647
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,835
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

648
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:39,080
No, you have to face that way. Like this.

649
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:44,627
CATCH! BAEK-HO-PING

650
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:05,148
LADY HO-STLEDOWN

651
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:20,413
Oh! A puppy!

652
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:24,709
Su-jin!

653
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:27,587
Su-jin, where are you going?

654
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,757
DECISION TO PLAY

655
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:33,593
Exactly! Gosh.

656
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:36,512
Oh! Sweetie, you're back!

657
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:37,555
Dad!

658
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:39,098
Come here, come here.

659
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:42,185
Oh, you must be exhausted.

660
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,979
- Wherever she goes, she…
- When did he get here?

661
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:48,566
…always goes for the looks.
She takes after her mom that way.

662
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:49,859
You should eat!

663
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,611
We grilled all kinds of mushrooms for you.

664
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,362
Oh, it's all right. Enjoy.

665
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:56,115
I think I need to get some rest.

666
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,202
Chief So, I…

667
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:00,578
This is…

668
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,831
quite embarrassing for me,

669
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:07,418
but I wanted to say this to you
as the general manager

670
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:09,462
of our Research Team.

671
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:13,508
I'm so grateful to you for taking care

672
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,094
of our wonderful team.

673
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:18,429
- Yes.
- I will

674
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:22,683
lead them well this season

675
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,021
and wrap things up nicely.

676
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,606
Wow!

677
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,733
- And!
- Oh, man.

678
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:35,238
- And, well, here's the thing.
- Hey! What is it?

679
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,323
- What?
- What's he doing?

680
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:38,366
Love you!

681
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,201
Oh my!

682
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,246
- Thank you.
- Why

683
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,872
are all middle-aged men like this?

684
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:47,083
Whenever my uncle
gets drunk on the holidays,

685
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,585
he goes around making hearts
at people like that.

686
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:53,589
Mr. Bu, you should go get some sleep.
You might kiss him at this rate.

687
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:55,675
Dad, I'm sleepy.

688
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,760
Does my princess want to sleep?

689
00:43:57,844 --> 00:44:00,805
Okay, let's go sleep. Let's go.

690
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,056
- But Dad?
- Yes?

691
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,182
What's "indicen"?

692
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,184
What? "Indicen"?

693
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:06,144
What's that?

694
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:07,937
Does she mean "indecency?"

695
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,105
- Yeah!
- What?

696
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,024
Where did you learn
a word like that, Su-jin?

697
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:13,901
From that auntie and uncle.

698
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:16,112
They were lying down together--

699
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,864
- Oh dear.
- Whoa!

700
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:20,449
Oh, no! Su-jin.

701
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:23,202
Here's what "indicen" means…

702
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:24,662
It's a type of food.

703
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:26,330
Where is it from again?

704
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:29,625
- France.
- Yes. Par-- it's French cuisine.

705
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,669
Right. Something like, "indicén"?

706
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,379
- "Indicén," yes.
- No, it wasn't.

707
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,798
She said they'll be arrested
for "indicen."

708
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,049
Oh dear!

709
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,428
Ms. Kim. What did you do
in front of a kid…

710
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,765
Oh, it's not like that.
We were just joking around!

711
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,768
Why is her memory so good?

712
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,103
She must be a prodigy.

713
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:51,230
She's basically a recorder.

714
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:52,690
No one can fool her.

715
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,650
I memorized something else.

716
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:56,277
What is it now?

717
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,322
That uncle said he fired Auntie Mi-kyung!

718
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:01,449
What?

719
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:07,747
Hold on.

720
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,083
What did I just hear?

721
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:18,966
Oh, Su-jin!

722
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,886
Here, let's go to bed.

723
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,554
- I'll put her to sleep.
- Yeah. Thanks.

724
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:25,223
Let's go. You must be sleepy.

725
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:27,308
Wait.

726
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:35,942
Oh, wow. She really heard
that one wrong this time.

727
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:37,068
Well…

728
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:40,154
What word sounds similar to "fired"?

729
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,531
Fi--

730
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:43,950
She's correct. Ms. Kim…

731
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:46,619
has been fired.

732
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:49,205
What? How could Ms. Kim be fired?

733
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:53,167
She works incredibly hard,

734
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,087
and we learn so much from her.

735
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:59,006
There's no way she got fired.

736
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:02,468
Potato Lab is currently
undergoing restructuring.

737
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,929
It is nothing personal against Ms. Kim.

738
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,181
It was a decision that had to be made

739
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,892
in order for the lab to survive and grow.

740
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:12,228
But still,

741
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:14,313
MK…

742
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:17,358
I mean…

743
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:20,611
- Wait, MK--
- When…

744
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:23,698
is her last day?

745
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:27,368
As soon as Mr. Kwon's

746
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,787
onboarding is completed.

747
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,000
I had no clue.

748
00:46:35,418 --> 00:46:37,837
I said I'd buy you beef
once we were done.

749
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,799
Oh, my goodness!

750
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:45,052
While I'm thankful
that you are all sad about me leaving,

751
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:48,014
didn't we promise
not to talk about work today?

752
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:50,975
Here. Let's eat…

753
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:53,060
and play.

754
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:02,403
Hee-dong! The meat's getting burnt.

755
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,488
We can't let it go to waste.

756
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:09,410
I'm…

757
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:12,038
going to go for a walk.

758
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,293
Me too.

759
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:24,300
Where are you going?
Have some more meat.

760
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,914
There's somewhere we need to go.

761
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,378
I'm a little tired today.

762
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:01,796
This isn't a request.

763
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:19,313
What is this place?

764
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:22,316
Come in.

765
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:34,036
POTATOES SAVE THE WORLD!

766
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:41,335
Remember when I told you
I was cultivating potatoes on the side?

767
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:43,421
This is my greenhouse.

768
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,552
This is rather big

769
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,429
to be "on the side."

770
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:54,390
Of course. I'm not
a potato researcher for nothing.

771
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,600
Did you think I'd just have a hoe in here?

772
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:59,645
I pulled some strings
to buy used equipment

773
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,397
and set everything up.

774
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:07,153
This place…

775
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:10,906
is so important to me

776
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:13,993
that I don't even let Ong-ju
or Hwan-kyung in here.

777
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:18,205
But do you know why I'm showing you?

778
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,422
To show you that I'm going to continue
researching potatoes like this,

779
00:49:27,006 --> 00:49:28,591
so you won't feel bad.

780
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:33,721
Obviously, I'm sad and upset
at the fact that I have to leave

781
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,640
the place where I worked so hard.
I love it there.

782
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:37,808
It's unfortunate.

783
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,144
But…

784
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:43,189
this isn't the first time
that has happened to me.

785
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,524
And it probably won't be the last.

786
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,570
So I'm confident

787
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:53,324
that whatever I do next,
wherever it may be,

788
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:56,076
I will be great at it.

789
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,662
Sure, my day job's now become a night job,

790
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:01,165
but I'll still be researching potatoes.

791
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,381
I'm saying that just because
you're firing me,

792
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:12,510
my life isn't going
to drastically change,

793
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:15,679
and I won't lose my hopes and dreams.

794
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:22,853
Why are you not getting mad at me?

795
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:25,481
I made a mistake.

796
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,276
You shouldn't be comforting me.

797
00:50:29,902 --> 00:50:32,488
You should be resentful.
You should curse me out.

798
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:35,241
Why won't you give me a chance
to beg for forgiveness…

799
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,743
You keep telling me you're fine--

800
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,119
Because I'm happy.

801
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:42,039
I'm happy because of you, Baek-ho.

802
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:51,048
How can I hate someone

803
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,092
who makes me happy?

804
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:11,318
Can you say something?

805
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,487
It's cringey talking by myself.

806
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,575
I can't find the words.

807
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:21,662
Please give me…

808
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:25,666
a little bit of time.

809
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:31,422
All of a sudden? What--

810
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:38,846
Wait.

811
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:41,974
Baek-ho!

812
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:08,792
Damn it.

813
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:14,381
Darn it.

814
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:16,383
Jerk.

815
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:20,763
What the heck
are you playing at, you jerk?

816
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,890
What time does he need?

817
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,309
Damn him.

818
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:30,314
Is this really the time
to play hard to get?

819
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:33,567
Stop wasting time
and just kiss me, you PG-13 man!

820
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:43,410
You're scaring me.

821
00:52:56,048 --> 00:52:57,549
Ki-se used to date her.

822
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:01,387
I looked into him as we were
getting ready for the wedding,

823
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:03,430
and it turned out to be an open secret

824
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:06,100
that he had a long-term girlfriend
on the same team.

825
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,018
Park was stammering out apologies

826
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:10,646
while Hee-jin was floating on clouds,
oblivious to it all.

827
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:11,730
What else could I do

828
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:13,357
but step in and clean things up?

829
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,150
It was a private relationship.

830
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:18,779
That was something
they should have taken care of, not you.

831
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,281
If Hee-jin is involved,
it involves our family.

832
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:24,910
What if that woman lost her mind
in anger and exposed us somewhere?

833
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,079
Chairman Wang's baby daughter
Yoon Hee-jin

834
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:30,416
becomes nothing more
than a mistress of a low-level employee.

835
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:31,834
That simply won't do.

836
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:34,461
That's the excuse you're making…

837
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:37,798
for ruining an innocent person's life?

838
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:42,469
Since when did you care about
an employee's future before firing them?

839
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:44,221
And get it straight.

840
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:47,015
I only asked you to deal
with the situation.

841
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:49,643
You're the one who proposed
a method and carried it out.

842
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,146
Whatever that woman went through,

843
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,814
it's all because of you, Baek-ho.

844
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:59,111
Because I'm happy.

845
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,030
I'm happy because of you, Baek-ho.

846
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,868
<i>All because of me.</i>

847
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,391
Please review the document
and sign it, Director So.

848
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:35,230
Yeah, that's haughty enough, Mi-kyung.

849
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,818
DOCUMENT FOR REVIEW

850
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:42,780
- Let's go.
- Whoa!

851
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:57,169
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

852
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:01,632
And this.

853
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:06,470
I didn't use it, but I ironed it anyway.

854
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:09,431
Your father gave this to you
when you became an adult.

855
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,726
You remember the weirdest things.

856
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:17,439
How's your mother doing?

857
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:19,900
She's all right.

858
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,944
I plan on visiting her more often.

859
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,531
That's good.

860
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:29,743
Thanks.

861
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,163
What you said helped me a lot.

862
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:37,417
Instead of thinking about
all the ways I failed him,

863
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:40,712
I tried to remember
all the good times I had with my father.

864
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:44,258
And it was much better.

865
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:49,596
If it helped, then…

866
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:52,599
I'm glad.

867
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:54,935
And…

868
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:58,480
I meant it when I said I regret it.

869
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:01,024
What?

870
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:02,901
The way you had to leave.

871
00:56:03,986 --> 00:56:05,028
I regret it.

872
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,282
I regret it the more I think about it.

873
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:12,369
Are you out of your--

874
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,957
You can't blindside me like this!

875
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:20,002
I can't even curse you out right now.

876
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,129
That would just be morally wrong.

877
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,755
That temper never changes.

878
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:28,594
Can you just be a little bit patient
and let me finish?

879
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:35,267
Fine. I'll hear you out.

880
00:56:36,018 --> 00:56:37,978
Say it as calmly
and peacefully as possible.

881
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,189
I'm just saying,

882
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:43,483
I regret it. That's all.

883
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,111
No matter how selfish I am,

884
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:48,947
I wouldn't beg you
to take me back or anything.

885
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:50,115
I'm not that shameless.

886
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:52,826
Ugh. Hey, pause. I'm so sorry.

887
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:55,287
But…

888
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,625
I think I'm just about at my limit.

889
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,337
Sorry. I'm gonna go.

890
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,884
Did Baek-ho not say anything to you?

891
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:14,389
What?

892
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:16,808
What should he say to me?

893
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:20,145
Nothing. Let's go.

894
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:23,315
Don't leave me hanging.

895
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:25,484
Don't trust him too much.

896
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,112
That's all I can say.

897
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:46,004
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

898
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:03,271
Hello!

899
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:05,399
- One cream udon with pollock roe, please.
- Yes, sir.

900
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,150
You can have a seat over there.

901
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:09,444
Oh, I can't. I can't sit there.
Can I sit somewhere--

902
00:58:09,528 --> 00:58:10,696
During lunchtime,

903
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:12,739
you sit in order of arrival.
Go ahead and sit.

904
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,741
- Oh, I--
- Next, please!

905
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,369
Hello. This way.

906
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:22,082
Hello.

907
00:58:24,126 --> 00:58:25,377
Wow.

908
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:28,338
You do have quite an eye, Ms. Kim.

909
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:30,716
How did you know this place was good?

910
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:31,675
Well…

911
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:35,345
If work sucks, you should at least
have good food.

912
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:37,806
Oh, right.

913
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:40,809
I guess you're not coming out
to the lab anymore?

914
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:42,352
I saw that you emptied your desk.

915
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:43,603
Yes.

916
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:46,106
Mr. Park said
I could come back to Headquarters.

917
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,110
Mr. Park?

918
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:53,405
Were you at the lab because
Mr. Park ordered you to be?

919
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:54,823
It wasn't a business trip?

920
00:58:58,452 --> 00:58:59,619
Oh, wow.

921
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:05,417
How much do you know about me?

922
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,626
Name, age, job.

923
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:08,295
And?

924
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:11,173
And?

925
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:13,008
You're currently residing
at USB Guesthouse

926
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:14,843
with Mr. So and Mr. Park's ex-wife.

927
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:17,637
You're also Mr. Park's ex-girlfriend
and Mr. So's current girlfriend…

928
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:19,598
- Oh, wait.
- Wow.

929
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:22,559
You really did your research.

930
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:25,437
You must have kept
quite a close tab on me.

931
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:29,316
I only work to ensure
the smooth operations of the Strategic--

932
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:33,111
How is this related to your department?
You were just spying on me.

933
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:34,279
Oh my…

934
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:36,490
What did he say to you?

935
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:39,576
Did he want you to break up
me and So Baek-ho?

936
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,661
What on earth is that bastard up to?

937
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:42,829
Excuse me.

938
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:45,165
Do not insult Mr. Park.

939
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,292
Answer my question!

940
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:50,629
Why is Park Ki-se
trying to get between us?

941
00:59:52,631 --> 00:59:54,800
Well, when he was tipsy,

942
00:59:54,883 --> 00:59:55,884
he said Kim Mi-kyung

943
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:59,054
doesn't know what So Baek-ho did to her.

944
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:01,014
What he did to me?

945
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:03,517
That's all I know.

946
01:00:03,642 --> 01:00:04,893
I'm sorry.

947
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,479
Oh, thank you.

948
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,403
Wow.

949
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:17,489
This looks good.

950
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:27,999
Cream udon with pollock roe
is always a surefire hit.

951
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:29,543
Yes.

952
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:37,634
- Mmm! It's good.
- Yeah?

953
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:38,802
Gosh.

954
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:41,555
It's so good.

955
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:43,807
- Hello, Mr. Byun.
- Oh!

956
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:47,102
You could've ordered by phone.

957
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:49,896
We would've shot out like an arrow.
We have nothing else to do.

958
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,857
Have some of this.

959
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,692
I'm not here for coffee.

960
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:57,320
Ever since the other day,
I just can't help

961
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:59,197
being worried about Seoul Guy.

962
01:01:01,283 --> 01:01:02,200
Our guest? Why?

963
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,095
What?

964
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:27,100
You really do keep
yourself entertained, don't you?

965
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:29,352
- Come here, quickly!
- What's wrong with you?

966
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:32,606
You're hiding something from me, right?

967
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:33,940
What brought this on?

968
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:35,525
Spit it out already.

969
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:38,486
If you tell me now, I'll forgive you.

970
01:01:39,905 --> 01:01:40,822
So,

971
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:45,285
remember when you dyed your hair pink,
and I said it looked good on you?

972
01:01:46,328 --> 01:01:48,205
It actually looked really weird.

973
01:01:48,288 --> 01:01:49,372
Not stuff like--

974
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:54,502
You said it brought out my eyes
and lit up my face!

975
01:01:54,586 --> 01:01:56,296
I had pink hair for three years!

976
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:57,631
Even at my first love's wedding!

977
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:00,592
Remember, you promised to forgive me.

978
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:04,554
I wasn't asking
about such traitorous confessions.

979
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,059
Are you sure there's nothing
wrong with So Baek-ho?

980
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:11,353
What about him?

981
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:13,396
Remember Sesame Oil Gift Day?

982
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,397
Ward B cried.

983
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:16,816
Don't lie.

984
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,360
Come on.

985
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:21,238
You couldn't even bother
to make up a more believable story?

986
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:23,156
I'm serious!

987
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,574
He was crying at Ms. Hong's place.

988
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:28,245
Mr. Byun, the Chairman,
and Mr. Park all saw it.

989
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:29,663
Four eyewitnesses.

990
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:34,584
So I wrote out the timeline,
and it was too suspicious.

991
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:37,212
You two had a nice date on Friday.

992
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:39,756
On Saturday, Ward B cried secretly.

993
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:43,051
Then on Sunday, you went to the beach
but came back the night of.

994
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:45,512
I figured it out.

995
01:02:48,932 --> 01:02:51,268
It's an adult issue, right?
Something intimate?

996
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:56,231
Go on, you can tell me now.

997
01:02:56,731 --> 01:03:01,486
As someone who has devoted
her life to that field…

998
01:03:09,828 --> 01:03:12,706
I swear I'll end
this friendship this year.

999
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,341
So Baek-ho cried?

1000
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:25,760
Why?

1001
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,056
How is that even possible?

1002
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:33,560
Don't trust him too much.

1003
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:37,605
Please give me a little bit of time.

1004
01:03:39,691 --> 01:03:42,444
Damn it, what on earth
are these two playing at?

1005
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:50,035
Baek-ho.

1006
01:03:50,118 --> 01:03:53,079
I'm frustrated out of my mind.
I can't do this anymore.

1007
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:54,581
Come out! Let's talk.

1008
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,210
Whatever it is, just tell me.

1009
01:03:59,294 --> 01:04:01,713
That way, I can also think about
whatever it is.

1010
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:07,135
For heaven's sake.

1011
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:10,764
Don't you know I'm impatient?

1012
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,224
You know this
only makes me angrier, right?

1013
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:14,184
Mi-kyung?

1014
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:18,938
He's not home yet.

1015
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:22,692
I see.

1016
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,820
Why would you tell me that now?

1017
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:27,697
I yelled for nothing.

1018
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:30,658
- I just got--
- Get out of my face.

1019
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:32,285
Okay.

1020
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:53,848
<i>You can't avoid me today.</i>

1021
01:04:53,932 --> 01:04:57,143
<i>I won't move an inch</i>
<i>from the front door until you're back.</i>

1022
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:13,993
ASSISTANT MANAGER KIM MI-KYUNG
I WON'T MOVE AN INCH

1023
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:15,537
FROM THE FRONT DOOR UNTIL YOU'RE BACK

1024
01:05:29,551 --> 01:05:31,636
You look like
you already know everything.

1025
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:34,806
It's for the better, I suppose.

1026
01:05:35,515 --> 01:05:38,059
It's not an easy story
for me to tell either.

1027
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:42,355
When do you plan on telling Mi-kyung?

1028
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:46,151
- She didn't seem to know yet.
- Don't act like you care about her.

1029
01:05:47,402 --> 01:05:48,361
It's repulsive.

1030
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,451
You're right. I have no right to.

1031
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,121
But you aren't being
honest with her either.

1032
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:00,874
That's why you're here.
To tie up any loose ends.

1033
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:01,958
Mi-kyung

1034
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:05,753
didn't leave the company
just because she broke up with me.

1035
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:08,423
She left after suffering
all kinds of ridicule at Wonhan.

1036
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:10,758
I know. I also know I set it off.

1037
01:06:10,842 --> 01:06:13,595
Then you know exactly
what decision you should make.

1038
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:23,563
It's a shame things came to this.

1039
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,356
You didn't know who Kim Mi-kyung was then.

1040
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,442
You just did what you always do.

1041
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:29,360
This must feel unfair to you.

1042
01:06:29,444 --> 01:06:30,487
What about you?

1043
01:06:34,282 --> 01:06:35,867
How did you feel?

1044
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,998
The person you once loved
was being torn apart.

1045
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:46,002
She had to suffer for no reason.

1046
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:50,632
But you didn't do anything.

1047
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:53,426
You weren't affected by it at all.

1048
01:06:55,637 --> 01:06:58,139
- Back then, I--
- I don't want to hear your excuses.

1049
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,225
You were just a piece of trash.

1050
01:07:00,308 --> 01:07:01,184
Baek-ho.

1051
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:04,145
She does not deserve
that kind of treatment from anyone.

1052
01:07:04,229 --> 01:07:07,106
She wasted her emotions
and heart by pouring them out

1053
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:10,151
- to someone like you.
- I know.

1054
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:14,322
I know that she was too good of a person,

1055
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:17,534
that I was a total bastard
for betraying her. I know that now.

1056
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:24,332
I regret it deeply,
and I feel truly sorry for it.

1057
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:27,502
That's why I want Mi-kyung
to live a normal, happy life now

1058
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:29,879
and not be so stupid as to
fall in love with the man

1059
01:07:29,963 --> 01:07:31,714
who pushed her over the brink.

1060
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:35,802
I want her to live
comfortably with someone

1061
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:39,013
who lets her forget about the past,

1062
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:42,100
who is not related
to Park Ki-se or Wonhan.

1063
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:47,313
She might be short-tempered
and picky,

1064
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:50,984
but when she's actually hurting,
she doesn't say a word.

1065
01:07:52,944 --> 01:07:55,113
She'd rather die
than show her vulnerable side

1066
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:56,906
and she cries alone in a corner.

1067
01:07:57,699 --> 01:08:00,326
- Before her feelings grow--
- I'm going to let her go.

1068
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:01,911
I will…

1069
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:05,832
let her go.

1070
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:06,643
Didn't you see my text?

1071
01:09:07,435 --> 01:09:08,519
I did.

1072
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:10,521
Then why are you so late?

1073
01:09:11,606 --> 01:09:12,815
I told you I'd wait.

1074
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:18,738
You know what, it's for the better.

1075
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:23,409
I was so mad.
If you had come back right away,

1076
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:25,411
I would've unleashed my temper on you.

1077
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:29,415
It's a bit unfair that you came back
just as I was dozing off.

1078
01:09:29,499 --> 01:09:31,834
I was literally awake five minutes ago.

1079
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:35,380
I didn't even look at my phone.
I just sat here…

1080
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:38,049
and contemplated.

1081
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:43,471
What did you contemplate?

1082
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:48,434
How you left the greenhouse

1083
01:09:49,352 --> 01:09:51,854
and avoided me afterwards,
ignoring all my texts.

1084
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:54,524
I should be furious about it.

1085
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:59,237
But I wasn't. I was just worried.

1086
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:04,033
I worried that something
might have happened to you.

1087
01:10:04,826 --> 01:10:06,119
I thought…

1088
01:10:07,954 --> 01:10:09,664
"What if he leaves me?"

1089
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:15,503
So I came to the conclusion…

1090
01:10:17,422 --> 01:10:21,300
that I really like So Baek-ho a lot.

1091
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:24,303
My "stainless steel" man.
He'd better come home. When he does…

1092
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,477
I'll give him a hug.

1093
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:03,968
Six years ago,

1094
01:11:04,844 --> 01:11:08,514
when I was on Wonhan Retail's HR Team,
I was asked for a favor.

1095
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:11,934
- What? What are--
- You need to know this.

1096
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:13,895
Please hear me out.

1097
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:19,317
The favor asked of me
was unjust and not right,

1098
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,985
but I did not refuse.

1099
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:23,863
I even went so far
as to wrap up the matter

1100
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:27,116
in an extremely despicable way
to avoid legal trouble.

1101
01:11:27,742 --> 01:11:30,036
What do you mean? How despicable?

1102
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:31,913
Will you get arrested?

1103
01:11:31,996 --> 01:11:33,247
The favor asked of me…

1104
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:38,336
was to kick out
Assistant Manager Kim Mi-kyung

1105
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:41,964
of Planning Department's Team 2
at SSM Headquarters.

1106
01:11:44,217 --> 01:11:46,135
It was tacit knowledge
that a sudden transfer

1107
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:48,262
to another department
was a heavy disciplinary action

1108
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:49,972
tantamount to being laid off.

1109
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:52,517
- Which was what I expected.
- Wait. Wait a second, Baek-ho.

1110
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:55,478
My plan was to make that employee
leave the company on her own

1111
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:57,814
due to her being unable
to handle the pressure

1112
01:11:58,481 --> 01:11:59,982
and isolation.

1113
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:04,111
I…

1114
01:12:04,195 --> 01:12:06,572
drove an innocent person over the brink…

1115
01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:10,785
then promptly forgot about her
and moved on.

1116
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:13,913
Never for a second have I thought

1117
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:18,167
about how devastating that time
would have been for her,

1118
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:20,628
or how lonely and distressed
she must have been.

1119
01:12:22,964 --> 01:12:24,799
The person you like, Mi-kyung…

1120
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:31,055
that's who I am.

1121
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:41,649
No.

1122
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:45,486
I can't believe this.

1123
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:50,074
I don't know what you're trying to say…

1124
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:55,913
Mi-kyung.

1125
01:12:57,123 --> 01:12:59,125
You already know what I'm trying to say.

1126
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:03,462
Just get angry at me.
You can curse me out or hit me.

1127
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:05,798
Until you feel better. Please.

1128
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:08,676
Please do something!

1129
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:12,471
Why?

1130
01:13:15,308 --> 01:13:17,476
Do you think if I did that to you,

1131
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:20,354
that would lessen your guilt?

1132
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:22,857
Do you think I'll say it's fine

1133
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:25,526
after I curse you out for a bit?

1134
01:13:26,027 --> 01:13:26,986
My goodness.

1135
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:30,197
"The employee left the company

1136
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:32,450
due to being unable
to bear the pressure and isolation."

1137
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:36,996
You summarized that incident
in one simple sentence, Baek-ho.

1138
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:39,749
Would you like to know the details?

1139
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:43,210
I was betrayed by my boyfriend,
who I was engaged to…

1140
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:47,089
and was tormented by all kinds of rumors

1141
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:51,093
spreading behind my back.
Even my coworkers turned on me.

1142
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:54,764
After that, I was moved to another team.

1143
01:13:56,974 --> 01:13:59,852
It was unfair and upsetting,
but I pulled myself together.

1144
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:03,814
"This is an opportunity
to start with a clean slate."

1145
01:14:03,898 --> 01:14:05,441
That's what I told myself.

1146
01:14:08,402 --> 01:14:10,655
I wanted to believe, even then.

1147
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:12,657
But…

1148
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:15,326
do you know how they treated me there?

1149
01:14:16,744 --> 01:14:18,913
No one spoke a word to me.

1150
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:20,790
No one made eye contact with me.

1151
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:23,960
I just sat there pointlessly.

1152
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:34,136
<i>I was so deeply isolated.</i>

1153
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:36,138
<i>Every single day,</i>

1154
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:38,349
<i>I felt like I was withering away.</i>

1155
01:14:41,352 --> 01:14:43,521
I endured that for three long months…

1156
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:47,274
before I couldn't do it anymore.

1157
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:49,819
If I went any longer,

1158
01:14:50,945 --> 01:14:53,030
I thought I would lose myself completely.

1159
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:58,619
So I gathered up my despair, humiliation,

1160
01:15:00,371 --> 01:15:03,541
all my feelings of self-loathing
and worthlessness, and then I ran out.

1161
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:10,297
And it took me a long, long time
before I became okay again.

1162
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:13,968
I…

1163
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:15,761
I finally…

1164
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:20,599
feel like I can live a happy life.

1165
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:25,980
But what you're saying…

1166
01:15:27,314 --> 01:15:28,274
is that everything

1167
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:30,818
was your fault. Am I right?

1168
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:34,238
The reason why I had to suffer,
why I despaired,

1169
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:35,656
was all because of you?

1170
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:40,161
Tell me.

1171
01:15:40,995 --> 01:15:43,080
Did you really do that to me?

1172
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:45,875
Did you?

1173
01:15:58,846 --> 01:15:59,847
Yes.

1174
01:16:27,541 --> 01:16:28,876
What? What's going on?

1175
01:16:28,959 --> 01:16:31,045
Wait, what? What's happening?

1176
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:32,630
What happened?

1177
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:34,215
What?

1178
01:16:34,298 --> 01:16:36,008
- Why?
- Shush!

1179
01:16:36,801 --> 01:16:37,718
Stop.

1180
01:16:38,636 --> 01:16:39,762
Just for five minutes.

1181
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:42,264
I just want a five-minute break.

1182
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:47,228
I bet. It's not easy being a princess.

1183
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:48,813
Not a princess.

1184
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:50,564
A noble lady.

1185
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:54,652
Whichever it is,

1186
01:16:55,236 --> 01:16:56,320
let's take a photo.

1187
01:16:56,403 --> 01:16:58,030
This kind of beauty needs to be recorded.

1188
01:16:58,114 --> 01:17:00,032
What? No, I don't want to.

1189
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:01,450
Why now, of all times--

1190
01:17:01,534 --> 01:17:02,785
Come on.

1191
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:06,705
It's my first time asking for a picture
of us together. Are you saying no?

1192
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:07,748
Oh…

1193
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:10,000
Come here.

1194
01:17:10,084 --> 01:17:11,961
You're so pretty.

1195
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,588
- Here we go.
- Wait, hold on.

1196
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:16,132
Goodness.

1197
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:18,717
Okay, smile.

1198
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:22,847
One, two, three.

1199
01:17:29,851 --> 01:17:32,523
MY BELOVED PRINCESS

1200
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:02,219
<i>You're like a natural disaster to me.</i>

1201
01:18:02,303 --> 01:18:04,096
You show up wherever I go,

1202
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:07,641
destroying everything I've built
and everything I'm dreaming of…

1203
01:18:07,725 --> 01:18:09,310
Jerk.

1204
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:10,769
<i>Did you know?</i>

1205
01:18:10,853 --> 01:18:12,813
Even though it would hurt someone?

1206
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:15,107
<i>If you're disappointed in me…</i>

1207
01:18:16,317 --> 01:18:17,776
will you dump me too?

1208
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:19,612
<i>If I ask you to stay…</i>

1209
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:21,822
<i>will you stay?</i>

1210
01:18:25,284 --> 01:18:26,535
<i>Mr. So!</i>

1211
01:18:34,504 --> 01:18:36,504
