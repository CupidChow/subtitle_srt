1
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,955
THE POTATO LAB

2
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,290
I'll just get right to it.

3
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:48,590
Ms. Kim.

4
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,386
You're fired.

5
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,080
This is certainly a different approach.

6
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:24,293
Could this be your way of flirting?

7
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,296
Clingy one day, threatening the next,

8
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,464
blowing hot and cold

9
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:31,883
until you make the other person go crazy?

10
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:35,470
If you thought this would work on me,

11
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:36,597
you're way off base.

12
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,224
Who tries to court someone by firing them?

13
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:41,727
So you're seriously firing me right now?

14
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,812
Is this because I kissed--

15
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,901
Is this revenge for what happened?

16
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:52,571
There are no personal reasons

17
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:53,947
behind your layoff.

18
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:55,907
Then what is this supposed to be?

19
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:58,410
My job here at the Potato Lab

20
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:01,038
was to lay off everyone
except for essential personnel.

21
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,040
But the fact
that I'm the one getting fired

22
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,000
makes it feel pretty personal.

23
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,002
Why me? What exactly disqualifies me

24
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,755
from being considered essential?

25
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,966
You're the sole nonexpert on the team.
You have no relevant experience.

26
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,761
You have contributed the least
to the research. In short…

27
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,929
you're redundant.

28
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,060
Redundant?

29
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,570
Did you even look

30
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,697
at my time sheet?

31
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,157
Yes, I did. You are quite diligent.

32
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,326
- But--
- What the lab needs right now

33
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,911
is experts, not diligent employees.

34
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,330
And yet, I'm not considered one
even though I've worked here

35
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,289
for six years?

36
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:45,707
Ms. Kim.

37
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,835
Could you tell me
what exactly your job entails?

38
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,547
Me? I breed the potatoes…

39
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,966
pretty well.

40
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,843
I also educate farmers
about potato varieties

41
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,929
and manage the contract farms.

42
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,473
Sometimes I help out
at the Admin building and the Work Team--

43
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,058
So you don't have a main job.

44
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,602
So I'm a jack of all trades.
A vital talent.

45
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,605
Researchers do research,
admin work is done at the Admin building,

46
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,565
and the Work Team
does other miscellaneous tasks.

47
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,109
You aren't essential…

48
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,735
to any of these teams, Ms. Kim.

49
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:14,820
Hold on.

50
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:16,863
People aren't machines.

51
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,074
The workload can't be
split neatly like that.

52
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,369
Every team needs a helping hand,
and I'm the one who helps!

53
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,955
Yes, and that only proves
that you are not an expert.

54
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,332
Anyone can step in to help.

55
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,877
You have not led any research projects
or contributed to any academic papers.

56
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,380
You haven't presented
at a single conference.

57
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,423
I have failed to find

58
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:37,259
any proof that you are an asset
to developing new varieties.

59
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,678
You didn't fail to find proof.
You're just not aware of it.

60
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,388
Don't think you know everything.

61
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,931
Then you tell me.

62
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,016
What were your goals
as a potato researcher

63
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,351
for the past six years?

64
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:49,187
What did you do to achieve them?
And what were the results?

65
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,898
You think I just came
to work here without any goals?

66
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,900
My goal

67
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,362
is to develop a potato variety
and name it after me.

68
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,495
As for results…

69
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:16,506
That's as good an answer as any.

70
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,925
You do not have to leave immediately.

71
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,344
Since you are currently
in charge of onboarding,

72
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:25,015
I'll send out the official notice
once Mr. Kwon's training period ends.

73
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,059
You may begin transitioning today.

74
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:42,949
What the hell is wrong with him?

75
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:47,788
Damn it.

76
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,042
Damn it!

77
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,670
That man is out of his mind.

78
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,631
You're nuts!

79
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,757
You psychopath.

80
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,676
He's not human. He's cold as steel.

81
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,432
God damn it.

82
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,604
What am I going to do?

83
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,840
NEW MESSAGE

84
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:44,594
EPISODE 4
THIS MESSAGE HAS BEEN DELETED

85
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,764
<i>I don't know, I don't know</i>
<i>Even if you tell me</i>

86
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:51,601
<i>A million times</i>
<i>I don't know, I don't know</i>

87
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,687
- Hey, Hwan-kyung!
- Whoa, shit!

88
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:55,772
Can you knock first?

89
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,440
Oops.

90
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,193
I heard you singing
and thought you were cleaning.

91
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,487
That doesn't mean
you can just barge in here!

92
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,657
You do know that
I'm a full-grown man, don't you?

93
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,034
Technically.

94
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,954
But you're not a man in my eyes,
nor are you fully grown.

95
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:12,706
Then what am I?

96
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,457
A neutered puppy?

97
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,751
Right now, I'd say

98
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,461
you're a plucked chicken in broth.

99
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,923
- Wanna go eat chicken this weekend?
- Get out!

100
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,800
Jeez.

101
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,553
Stop being dramatic.
I already saw everything, anyway.

102
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,400
Why can't I keep my damn mouth shut?

103
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,153
What? What's going on?

104
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,239
Well,

105
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,241
Mi-kyung's not home yet.

106
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,160
We were going to eat out.

107
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,454
Maybe something came up.

108
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,248
But we're having <i>gopchang.</i>

109
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,875
Beef <i>gopchang.</i>

110
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,005
Hello.

111
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,885
Wow, why does it smell so good in here?

112
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,219
Hey,

113
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:09,971
sorry for bothering you.

114
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,307
Did my sister
go on a business trip today?

115
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,809
Not that I know of. Why do you ask?

116
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,227
It's nothing big,

117
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:19,105
but she won't answer her phone
and she still hasn't come home.

118
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,149
I wonder if something happened at work.

119
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,864
Come on. Thank you, good night.

120
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,491
Good night.

121
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,826
Come on.

122
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,214
So you're seriously firing me right now?

123
00:07:53,556 --> 00:08:00,480
MAIN HALL

124
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:10,949
Oh, Mi--

125
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,535
I hope you have been well.

126
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,161
Yes.

127
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,291
Can I get something to eat?

128
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,838
Wait, your eyebrow…

129
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,313
Here's the thing.

130
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,190
I've been to
my fair share of restaurants

131
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,775
during my work trips, right?

132
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,695
But nothing beats
Gilmoon Temple's seasoned greens.

133
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,364
Seriously, you deserve a Michelin star.

134
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:54,701
I almost forgot.

135
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,537
In exchange for the food.

136
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,712
Substituted with soy milk?

137
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:06,671
Yes.

138
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,507
From a vegan bakery?

139
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,469
- Of course.
- Accepted.

140
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,013
It never ceases to amaze me.

141
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,098
You quit everything to become a monk,

142
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,933
including alcohol, smoking, and meat.

143
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,478
You even disowned all your kids.

144
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,604
But you can't quit coffee?

145
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,274
Buddha never said
that you're not allowed to have coffee.

146
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,276
Wow, you're so funny.

147
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,321
So what's the matter?

148
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,991
- What do you mean?
- Our Ms. Mi-kyung

149
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:38,203
only comes to visit
when her heart is troubled.

150
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,789
Wow, you even read minds now?

151
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,042
All you're missing is an eye patch.
Then you could be King Kung Ye.

152
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,794
You know you do that, right?

153
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,213
Hiding behind jokes when you're upset.

154
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,382
Well, it's just a little thing

155
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:52,717
that pissed me off.

156
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:53,885
It's nothing serious.

157
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:58,056
You drove all the way here from Pyeongwon
because it's nothing serious?

158
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:02,477
Mi-kyung.

159
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,397
Do you remember what I told you
when our family split up?

160
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,691
Yes, of course.

161
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,278
"Be a lamp unto yourself. Do not wait
for others to light it for you."

162
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,030
Exactly.

163
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,907
Just focus on you,
however the storm blows.

164
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,784
That's all you need to do.

165
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,327
Yeah.

166
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,998
You've clearly been here
for too long to remember

167
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,709
that the world is filled
to the brim with jerks

168
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,379
and one wrong encounter
can mess up your life.

169
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:33,591
I see. Well, in that case…

170
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,970
What can you do but face them head-on?

171
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,391
- Do the other monks know, Dad?
- What?

172
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,601
That you're this punk monk in private?

173
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,314
How are the kids?

174
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,860
Jin-kyung's busy raising the kids.

175
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,529
Hwan-kyung hasn't starved to death yet.

176
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,324
Goodness, slow down.
I'll pack you some to take home.

177
00:10:58,408 --> 00:10:59,284
It's okay.

178
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,288
This is fine. But please pass on
a message to Buddha for me.

179
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,166
Tell him to visit me in my dreams

180
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,750
and tell me six winning numbers.

181
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,752
You silly goose.

182
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,963
You can't say things
like that in a temple.

183
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:13,798
Oh, wait!

184
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,885
- Buddha is speaking. Write it down.
- Whoa!

185
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:19,554
- Six, seventeen, twenty-one.
- Whoa. Wow!

186
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,183
Gosh.

187
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,155
<i>I'm on the Next Level</i>

188
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,866
<i>Open the door beyond</i>

189
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,785
<i>I'll destroy you in the end</i>

190
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,845
Asshole.

191
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,848
I bet this is super expensive.

192
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,519
And fully tricked out.

193
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,739
Guess I didn't have to worry.

194
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,170
Where have you been?
Why didn't you pick up?

195
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,964
I was so worried I couldn't sleep.

196
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,008
You have sleepy eyes.

197
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,636
So you went to Gilmoon Temple, right?

198
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,305
How's our monk? Is he well?

199
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,141
"Our monk"?

200
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,852
That's rude. How dare you
refer to Dad like that?

201
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,312
What? Am I wrong?

202
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,147
Legally, we're strangers.

203
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,149
He didn't even call on Children's Day.

204
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,444
What are you talking about?
You're over 30 now.

205
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,280
Did you throw your conscience
out the window?

206
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,533
But I'm still the baby of the family!

207
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,035
When Mr. Byun visits his parents,

208
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,244
they still call him "baby."

209
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,203
Jeez.

210
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:50,496
Then go find a rich sister

211
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,374
who will baby you and get adopted.

212
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,500
I won't stop you.

213
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,545
Anyway, why did you go see Dad?

214
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:58,796
Did something happen?

215
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:00,923
Nothing happened.

216
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,092
I just wanted some seasoned <i>naengyi.</i>

217
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,056
Honestly, I think Dad kinda failed you.

218
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:12,393
The eldest daughter of three
whose mother passed away early.

219
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:16,522
That alone kept you
from becoming chill and carefree.

220
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,400
But then he left his kids
and became a monk,

221
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,195
turning you into this frustrating adult.

222
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,948
So this is your way

223
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,868
of asking me to beat you up, right?

224
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,081
And Dad didn't abandon us.

225
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:35,208
He made you breakfast
and ironed your school uniform

226
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,293
every single day
until you graduated high school.

227
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:38,961
And he still managed to go to work!

228
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,588
Dad did all he could.

229
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,423
And now he's living his life.

230
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,342
All we have to do is support him.

231
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,721
I'm going to bed. Oh, right.

232
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,099
I'm going to make <i>bibimbap</i>
with that tomorrow,

233
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:52,308
so don't touch it.

234
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,812
- Mi-kyung.
- What?

235
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,690
Let me know
if there's anything on your mind.

236
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,568
I'm an adult now. I'm all grown.

237
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,362
If you get into a fight,

238
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,572
I'll throw salt at them
from the sidelines.

239
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,325
God.

240
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:11,953
Okay.

241
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,498
I'll tell you if I get
into a fight with some pork belly.

242
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,083
Bring some herb salt with you.

243
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:22,213
There's no way her MBTI is an F.
She's a T through and through.

244
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,094
POTATO LAB

245
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:33,433
Hey!

246
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,101
Your meeting's done already?

247
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:36,519
Yes. Ow!

248
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,646
Oh, my heart.

249
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,064
- What is it?
- What?

250
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,275
- What is it?
- Why? What's wrong?

251
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,276
Did he scold you?

252
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,236
No.

253
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,697
- He's so hot.
- Oh, come on.

254
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,782
He's so much hotter up close.

255
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,534
It's not good for the heart.

256
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,870
Don't you think
our chief is really gentle?

257
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,037
I'm just a newbie,

258
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,373
but he asked me
if I had any ideas for the lab

259
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,208
or suggestions for improvements.

260
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,503
Someone please explain to Hee-dong.

261
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,797
He wasn't being nice to you.

262
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,466
He's sizing you up.

263
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,468
No way.

264
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,013
It's your turn, Mr. Ko.

265
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,890
Why me?

266
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,933
MK should be going after you.

267
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,102
He said he already talked to Ms. Kim.

268
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,312
What?

269
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,271
Oh, yes.

270
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,484
I had a chance to talk to him earlier.

271
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,527
Then you should've told me!

272
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,362
Now I don't have time to prepare.

273
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,782
Why did you talk to him first?

274
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,662
I was just the first meeting
on the schedule, that's all.

275
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,122
- Hey, Mr. Ko.
- Yes.

276
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,082
When you go talk to him,

277
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,751
just be careful not to run your mouth.

278
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,211
And don't act all buddy-buddy.

279
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,880
Gosh, I'm sure it's all lost on you,

280
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,174
but fashionistas like us

281
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,968
share a certain special bond.

282
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,346
A couple of trips
to the department store together

283
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,182
and before you know it,
you've become friends.

284
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,936
Wait, you bought that
at a department store?

285
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,605
Oh, you ignorant fool.

286
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,691
My goodness, what is this?
A shirt or braided straw?

287
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:08,778
Yikes! Nope. That's gross.

288
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,030
My goodness. Look at him.

289
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,823
- What's with that nonsense?
- Wait.

290
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,034
What about him?
He's dressed like a lotus lantern,

291
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,702
and it's not Buddha's Birthday.

292
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,748
How is this braided straw?

293
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,251
Why are you laughing?

294
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,130
Yes, come in.

295
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,508
Wait, hold on!

296
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,804
Hey! You shouldn't
push your superior like--

297
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,104
Hello, Mr. So.

298
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,190
What is it?

299
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:48,192
I have a query, Mr. So.

300
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,653
Go ahead, then.

301
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,906
That day…

302
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,201
I was too harsh, wasn't I?

303
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,128
So…

304
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,796
about the layoff.

305
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,008
Is it absolutely 100% confirmed?

306
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,552
I could give you
the notice now if you'd like.

307
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,805
Oh, no! No, of course not.

308
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,307
I was just wondering

309
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:24,145
if you were open to reconsideration.

310
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,780
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>This is the Kim Mi-kyung smile.</i>

311
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,617
<i>Even if you're made of steel,</i>
<i>you wouldn't spit on a smiling face--</i>

312
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,951
I thought I made myself clear.

313
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,078
I do not revoke a decision
once it's made.

314
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,205
PTOOEY

315
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,373
<i>I guess you would.</i>

316
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,507
Then I'm going to really…

317
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,635
actually leave.

318
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,262
I'm going to see
what other jobs are out there!

319
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,931
- Okay.
- No, really.

320
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,602
I could quit on my own before you fire me.

321
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,482
Am I supposed to be upset about that?

322
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,569
<i>This ridiculous jerk and his principles.</i>

323
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,631
Salary freeze.

324
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,218
My salary is already
on deep discount as it is,

325
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,136
but I'll let it drop more.

326
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,846
This year-- no, next year.

327
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:45,726
I'll freeze my salary
for the next two years!

328
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,396
Wow, so cheap! So affordable!

329
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,481
Honestly, this is a deal
you don't want to miss.

330
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,359
You can't find this kind
of cost-effective manpower anywhere.

331
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:03,828
Ms. Kim.

332
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,707
Yes, Chief! I'm right here!

333
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,713
Please tell Mr. Ko to come in.

334
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,962
What are you doing?

335
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:56,964
Hey.

336
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,133
Nothing, I'm just a little tired.

337
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,301
You're acting strange today.

338
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,510
You look out of it.

339
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,888
What do you mean? I always do.

340
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,682
I've been out of it since I turned 30.

341
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,310
Here, the<i> sikhye's</i> on me today.

342
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:19,820
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

343
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,658
Gosh, I almost forgot.

344
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:27,578
Ms. Ju, didn't you say
you had a headhunter you knew?

345
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,706
- Can you give me their number?
- Headhunter? That's random. Why?

346
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,417
So the thing is, my friend

347
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,836
said they wanted to get away
from the city and the smog.

348
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,838
And they're looking
for a job in this field.

349
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:38,923
What?

350
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,966
Even after they saw how you work?

351
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:41,926
Yeah.

352
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,845
You'll get their card later.
It's on my desk.

353
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,597
Great, thank you.

354
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:52,937
Ms. Kim

355
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,565
doesn't have any other friends
besides us and Ong-ju.

356
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:57,733
That's true.

357
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:02,822
If you were her, would you recommend
that your friend become

358
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:03,948
an agricultural researcher?

359
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,369
No, I wouldn't,
even if they were my worst enemy.

360
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,120
That's what I'm saying.

361
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,000
Mr. Park.

362
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,585
- Yeah.
- Did you hear?

363
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:17,753
Hear what?

364
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,256
Ms. Yoon dropped by
Ms. Yoon's office yesterday!

365
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,424
What do you mean? Ms. Yoon?

366
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,176
Yoon Hee-jin?

367
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,177
Yes!

368
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,102
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

369
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:35,729
Ms. Yoon. We need to talk.

370
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,692
Where's Hee-jin?

371
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:43,779
I don't know.

372
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,282
Tanning somewhere
in the Mediterranean?

373
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,201
I know you saw her yesterday.

374
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,661
Here, at Wonhan.

375
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,289
Are you doing this on purpose?

376
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,915
You know I looked everywhere for her.

377
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:57,793
And if you find her?
You think she'll just forgive you?

378
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,547
Don't you think it's time to quit?

379
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,633
Seeing you being so clingy
even after getting divorced,

380
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:05,593
it's embarrassing.

381
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:06,760
I'm not being clingy--

382
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,767
Do you really not know where she is?

383
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:14,935
I don't.

384
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,521
Even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

385
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:28,616
What is this?

386
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:29,950
Grand Moulton.

387
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:31,493
Pyeongwon?

388
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,930
KIM JIN-SU

389
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,397
I'm telling you,

390
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,524
someone checked
into a room here with my card.

391
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:05,778
Doesn't that count for something?
At least tell me what room it is.

392
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,655
I'm not asking you
to break down the door.

393
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:09,073
I'm sorry, sir.

394
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,534
As per our hotel's policy,
we cannot disclose guest information.

395
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,870
I could relay your contact info--

396
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,206
She knows my number!

397
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:20,834
I do apologize.

398
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:26,173
Sorry I shouted at you.

399
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,801
Then could you deliver

400
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,344
a message to the room?

401
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,972
That someone's waiting for them
at the cafe on the first floor.

402
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:33,931
I will.

403
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:35,516
Thank you.

404
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,434
Once again, I apologize.

405
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:45,109
<i>The person you're trying to reach</i>
<i>is not available.…</i>

406
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,451
<i>When did you come back to Korea?</i>

407
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:55,828
<i>Please pick up.</i>

408
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,622
<i>I'll come to you.</i>
<i>Are you really going to be like this?</i>

409
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,254
<i>I'm at the first-floor cafe.</i>

410
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,172
<i>Come down.</i>

411
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:18,892
Hello.

412
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,686
Ms. Kim Mi-kyung?

413
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,312
- Yes.
- Nice to meet you.

414
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,694
What? Why is she here?

415
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,529
I am so sorry.

416
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:33,532
It's such bad manners
to arrange for a meeting the day of.

417
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,492
But I just happened
to be in Pyeongwon, so…

418
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:37,286
It's totally fine.

419
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:40,914
I sent you my resume last-minute, too.

420
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:42,583
Did you have time to look at it?

421
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,209
- Yes.
- Resume?

422
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:47,671
I noticed your work experience
is uncommon in the agricultural field.

423
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:50,549
You worked at
Wonhan's Planning Dept. for a long time.

424
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,886
Did you have a particular reason
for becoming a potato researcher?

425
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,345
Well…

426
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,431
A coffee for me as well.

427
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:00,976
At the time,

428
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,896
I was in a place

429
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,898
where I needed a catalyst in my life.

430
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,485
Then is this
another catalyst for you?

431
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,444
Leaving the lab?

432
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,157
Well, the thing is,

433
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,160
I'm not quitting
because I actually want to.

434
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,788
I do want to keep
researching potatoes.

435
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:24,625
Are there any open positions
where I could continue this work?

436
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,460
To be honest,

437
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:28,545
it's going to be difficult

438
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:30,881
to get into another
agricultural lab right now,

439
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,716
let alone continue potato research.

440
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:34,843
I see.

441
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,720
But…

442
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:40,140
I'm a really hard worker
once you assign me to something.

443
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,232
Thank you for your time.

444
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:58,659
I'll be waiting for your call.

445
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:00,494
You can call me any time.

446
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,037
Sure.

447
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:30,274
You can't go a day
without spilling something, can you?

448
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:32,901
What? Why are--

449
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,737
- Why are you here--
- I have some business here.

450
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,865
Don't get the wrong impression
that I followed you.

451
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:39,908
Then leave and go about your business.

452
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,453
I don't even want to know
why I'm running into you.

453
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:45,664
I'm not in the mood
to deal with you right now.

454
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,417
You got fired by Director So, right?

455
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:53,088
Don't be too hard on yourself.

456
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:55,674
That's just what his job is.

457
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,888
Is that why you met up
with a headhunter? To transition?

458
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:01,930
Hey.

459
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,016
I told you to leave.

460
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,018
You still have a stain there.

461
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,687
You'll need to wash that.

462
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,646
Damn you.

463
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,611
So you want to continue lab work?

464
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,614
I heard bits and pieces from over there,

465
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:20,616
and it seemed like it.

466
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,704
You know what? I'll leave.

467
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,165
I could let you keep working.

468
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:35,839
Director So reports to me.

469
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,383
I'm the one who signs off on it.

470
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,427
It would take me one word…

471
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,431
and you could stop
desperately sending out resumes.

472
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:46,767
What the hell are you playing at now?

473
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,935
I'm not playing at anything.

474
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,356
It's just…

475
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:55,400
for old times' sake.

476
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:56,610
What?

477
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:57,945
Yes, for old times' sake.

478
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,447
I can at least do that much for you.

479
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,616
No, I want to do it for you.

480
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:14,253
Fine.

481
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:17,381
Then…

482
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:22,469
can I ask you for a favor?

483
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,137
What is it?

484
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:27,224
Take your right hand…

485
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,351
and lift it up

486
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:30,894
all the way like this.

487
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:32,229
My hand? Why?

488
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:34,439
- Like this?
- Yeah.

489
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,816
And then,

490
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:39,069
spread your fingers wide.

491
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,280
Okay.

492
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:44,491
Now put all your strength
into slapping yourself across the face.

493
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,034
Slap myself…

494
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:48,578
- Come on, Mi-kyung.
- What?

495
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:50,747
I'm trying to help a nutjob
come to his senses.

496
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:52,582
Now's not the time to be stubborn.

497
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:56,420
I'm not being stubborn.
I'm preserving my dignity.

498
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,048
Even if I'm desperate,
I'm not picking up shit from the ground.

499
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,512
My God, you freaking piece of…

500
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:10,934
I mean it, Mi-kyung!

501
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:12,311
My number's still the same!

502
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:15,814
Stubborn as always.

503
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,107
Hey, White Tiger!

504
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,322
You texted me for the first time in a year

505
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,824
just to make me a delivery boy
to Room 1202?

506
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:10,660
Wasn't it sweet, though?

507
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:12,162
Like a surprise gift?

508
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,005
When did you come back to Korea?

509
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:23,382
Yesterday.

510
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:24,549
I heard you were here

511
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,551
and came down to play with you
right away.

512
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:27,636
Weekend plans?

513
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,137
Cleaning the window screens.

514
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,139
Are you joking?

515
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:32,974
No. Why?

516
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,602
You're so boring.

517
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:38,146
Why would you live like that
in a place like this?

518
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,565
You should go see the sheep!
Walk by the wind farms!

519
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,734
Cleaning window screens
is also an excellent pastime.

520
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:45,153
It combines physical exercise
and satisfaction.

521
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:46,655
Wow.

522
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:50,659
Oh, I can see it now.

523
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,869
I can see your future.

524
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:53,995
So Baek-ho.

525
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:56,540
You're going to die alone.

526
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,501
Seems like you're doing well.

527
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,753
Because I know how to have fun.

528
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:05,132
What about you?
Anything interesting happen?

529
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:09,678
A bird chased me
and I rolled down a hill.

530
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,513
I also got sprayed with pesticides.

531
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:13,640
What a talent.

532
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,101
How can you say stuff like that
so boringly?

533
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,645
It all happened at work.

534
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,564
You really want to know more?

535
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,816
Oh, forget it.

536
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:27,612
Then what about a person?

537
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:30,157
Any interesting individuals?

538
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,159
An interesting person?

539
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,455
Wonhan, Wonhan!

540
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:39,791
You Wonhan bastards!

541
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:46,423
What? Haven't you ever seen someone
with tattooed eyebrows before?

542
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,014
What was that smile?

543
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,516
You thought of someone, didn't you?

544
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,143
No, I didn't.

545
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,187
You liar. Oh my gosh.

546
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:02,105
Oh my gosh!

547
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,483
I'm so curious.

548
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:06,902
There's so much I want to ask you. But!

549
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,029
I know you'll never spill.

550
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,447
It's already pissing me off.

551
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,532
I'm going to lose sleep over this.

552
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:15,911
It's nothing like what you're thinking.
And it can't happen.

553
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,162
Why not?

554
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:19,956
Is she married?
Tell her to get divorced.

555
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,291
You only live once.

556
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:28,298
INCOMING CALL

557
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,178
Should you get that?

558
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,265
Why would I want to ruin my mood?

559
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,726
He can listen
to the ringback tone all he wants.

560
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:42,729
I know I shouldn't get involved,

561
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:46,191
but this whole time,
Ki-se's been looking for you everywhere.

562
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,777
Avoiding him like this
isn't good for either of you.

563
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:51,821
Would you look at this?

564
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,657
Whose side are you on right now?

565
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,200
We've been best friends forever.

566
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:58,036
Park Ki-se's only your friend
because he was my husband.

567
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:01,164
If I don't like him,
you shouldn't like him either.

568
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:02,582
That's what friendship is.

569
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:05,585
I want to argue every single point
you've just made…

570
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:09,631
- but you won't listen, will you?
- Of course not. My time is precious.

571
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:14,344
Just leave it. Let's eat already.
The food's getting cold.

572
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:16,888
Have a seat.

573
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,185
It looks so good.

574
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,147
It's so good.

575
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,316
- It's good?
- Yeah, it's amazing.

576
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:30,569
Eat up.

577
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,537
<i>…is not available. Please leave a message…</i>

578
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,757
Why are you so sick?

579
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,097
Forty-nine…

580
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,432
Forty-nine.

581
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:11,359
Ms. Kim!

582
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:15,530
Can you look at a slide for me?

583
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,033
What slide?

584
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,411
Thank you.

585
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,209
Oh my gosh!

586
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,545
What are you doing?

587
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:33,465
I'm sorry. They threatened me too.

588
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,467
Threatened?

589
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,058
What are you two doing?

590
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,267
Ms. Jang.

591
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:47,020
Don't be too rough with her.

592
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:48,813
Yes, ma'am.

593
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:53,902
What?

594
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,904
What? Why are you doing this?

595
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,615
You. Don't you
have something to tell us?

596
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:00,200
What?

597
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:01,826
What are you…

598
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:02,911
Ms. Kim.

599
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,497
When we formed our Potato Gang,

600
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,667
do you remember the promise we made?

601
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,253
Yes, I remember.

602
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:13,838
"No secrets in the lab."

603
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,841
Then why did I…

604
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:21,763
have to hear from someone else
that you're looking for another job?

605
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:22,972
Wait, how did you…

606
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,017
The headhunter!

607
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,519
He snitched that quickly?

608
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:30,188
Some professional he is.

609
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:34,526
What is going on?
Why are you quitting all of a sudden?

610
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:35,652
No, I…

611
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,823
Hee-dong won't open
the door until I say so.

612
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,659
- Just tell us already!
- Tell us!

613
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,244
Wait, I…

614
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:20,697
I have no appetite.

615
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:44,262
DEPUTY GENERAL MANGER
JU SEUNG-HEE

616
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,233
Very nice.

617
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,004
- What? What is it?
- Yes!

618
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,882
Yes, I'll be right there! Thank you!

619
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,386
I thought it was an emergency.

620
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,345
It is an emergency!

621
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,722
It's crazy, I can't believe it!

622
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:11,307
Hey, do you know that comic series?

623
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:13,184
<i>The Moonlight, the Whip, and the Beast.</i>

624
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:14,936
How many times do I have to tell you?

625
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:18,022
People like me
don't know anything you read.

626
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:20,233
Anyway, it was published 20 years ago,

627
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,443
but it became the stuff of legend
when it got cancelled

628
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,195
for being really indecent.

629
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:27,073
But there's someone who wants
to give a copy away for free!

630
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,533
Right now!

631
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:30,952
At Yangyang! In Gangwon-do!

632
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,414
Yangyang, Yangyang!

633
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,624
Hey, give me the car keys.
I need to go now.

634
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,751
- What?
- Come on, hurry up.

635
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:41,754
It seems weird, though. It's that rare,
but they're giving it away?

636
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:43,089
What?

637
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,299
Yeah, I guess so.

638
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:49,012
It's amazing how generous he is.

639
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,763
- "He"?
- Danchung Apartments, apartment 1006.

640
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:51,723
It's a guy?

641
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,517
- Building 207, apartment 1006…
- Wait, you're going to a man's place?

642
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:56,144
Ong-ju!

643
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:06,821
Here for the books?

644
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:10,033
Sir, please let me express
my gratitude first.

645
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,951
No need, just take it. Quick!

646
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:13,536
Before my wife comes back. Go on!

647
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,497
Peace and health to you and your family!

648
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,416
You'll be blessed, truly!

649
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,713
May you rake in money
with every breath--

650
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:26,257
Stop yelling about your pervert comics
and let's go already!

651
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:28,676
<i>The Moonlight, the Whip, and the Beast!</i>

652
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,596
I'll cherish it for the rest of my life!

653
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:35,058
I'll take it with me to the grave!

654
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,935
Thank you!

655
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,190
You're practically drooling.
Are you that happy?

656
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,692
Yeah, I love it.

657
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:45,777
It's fantastic.

658
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:49,530
I feel so inspired,
like it's nourishing my soul.

659
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,283
I truly feel alive right now.

660
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:54,744
What is it even about, anyway?

661
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:59,040
Let's just say that the plot
can't be described in a PG-13 drama.

662
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:01,084
Don't worry about it.

663
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,678
Whoa, it's the ocean.

664
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,554
Yeah, it's a nice view.

665
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:18,059
Hey, do you want to go swimming?

666
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,185
Right now?

667
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:21,312
It's been years since we went on vacation.

668
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:23,231
Let's just jump in while we're here.

669
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:24,816
So you're saying,

670
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,652
you're going to get in my car
in dripping wet clothing?

671
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,572
Okay, fine. I'll just take it off, then.

672
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,324
I can swim in my bra and panties.

673
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:36,244
In your underwear?
Are you out of your mind?

674
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,705
Then what do you want me to do?

675
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:40,707
Should I just keep my pants on?

676
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,792
Or just my shirt and no pants?

677
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,044
Or nothing but my shoes?

678
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:47,797
Don't put it on, don't take it off…
What is this, a trick question?

679
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,132
Then don't turn left or right,

680
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,134
and don't go forward or backward.

681
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,760
See? Isn't that freaking annoying?

682
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,220
That's how I felt just now. Swag.

683
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,097
Come on, whoa. Skrrt!

684
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,647
Wow! It's the beach!

685
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:12,613
Oh, that's cold! It's cold!

686
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:18,494
How is she so excited?
Is she a puppy or something?

687
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,164
Do you want some beer?

688
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,333
Yes! One crate!

689
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:48,858
Are you all right?

690
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:53,029
Yes.

691
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,504
Hallelujah.

692
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:27,814
Wait. Where did she go?

693
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,777
Have a glass.

694
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:35,530
- Really?
- Sure, have some.

695
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,573
- Okay, cheers!
- Cheers.

696
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:39,742
Here we are.

697
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:43,371
Hey, more beer! Yay!
Thank you.

698
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,498
Let's have another round.

699
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:49,836
Cheers!

700
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,420
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

701
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:58,970
- That's good.
- Nice.

702
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:01,389
So you're all surfers?

703
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,807
Yes, we are.

704
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,225
That's why you're so…

705
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,603
So healthy and fit.

706
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:09,021
Honey!

707
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:11,232
Can I ask how old you are?

708
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,317
- You look around my age.
- No, you look way younger--

709
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:14,652
Honey!

710
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,279
Oh my gosh!

711
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,531
Did you know?

712
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:21,409
I've always really wanted
to learn how to surf.

713
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,244
Honey!

714
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,871
Ma'am!

715
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:26,873
Your husband's looking for you!

716
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:31,419
Honey! There you are!

717
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:33,880
Honey.

718
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:35,882
How can you do this?

719
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:39,010
We just got back together! How could you?

720
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,929
Do I have to sue for infidelity again?

721
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:44,724
- What?
- Do I have to sue each of them

722
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,144
for tens of millions of won
to get you back?

723
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:51,314
I'm so sorry. I don't know him.

724
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,816
He must be crazy. Don't--

725
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,194
Ye-na won't stop crying.
She keeps asking for you.

726
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:58,362
Please come back home.

727
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:00,865
What are you talking about?

728
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,074
Mister, if you're drunk,

729
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:03,159
- go somewhere else.
- Honey!

730
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:04,118
- Go!
- We have to go.

731
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:05,661
- No, wait!
- Honey.

732
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:07,955
Wait, I don't know who Ye-na is!

733
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:10,166
Wait! Come back! Wait!

734
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,210
Honey, please! Come to your senses.

735
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:13,252
Shit.

736
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,839
What do you think you're doing?

737
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:17,840
What?

738
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:20,551
I got rid of them for you
because they were bothering you.

739
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:22,428
I wanted to be bothered.

740
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:25,306
I wanted them to pester me forever!

741
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,558
I didn't realize you wanted that.

742
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:30,603
You couldn't read a room
even if you had a magnifying glass.

743
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:34,148
Gosh darn it, he was exactly my type!

744
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:35,483
What am I going to do now?

745
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,818
You barely met him, so how's he your type?

746
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:38,986
Besides,

747
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,113
a man who isn't working on a weekday?

748
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:42,990
The only thing he'll do
is make you suffer.

749
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,076
What do you know?

750
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,327
Damn it.

751
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:55,211
Honey! Wait for me!

752
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,359
PET PLANT

753
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:28,703
FLOWER POT
FRAGILE

754
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:34,250
FALSE GOAT'S BEARD

755
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,844
APOLOGIES FOR THE LATE DELIVERY
PLEASE RAISE IT WELL

756
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:56,063
Are there any other flowers that you like?

757
00:46:58,691 --> 00:46:59,692
False goat's beard.

758
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,957
MK. You didn't eat breakfast, right?

759
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:17,209
- Yes!
- You didn't eat either, right?

760
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,420
- You didn't eat either?
- Of course!

761
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,672
I even prepared indigestion medicine.

762
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:24,425
Knew I could count on you, Foodie Jang.

763
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:27,261
So smart, so proud!

764
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:29,638
What is it? Why are we so excited?

765
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:32,350
It's our regular meeting day today.

766
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:33,726
Wait a minute.

767
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,269
Is this your first time?

768
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,021
- Right, it is.
- Yes! Is it fun?

769
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,482
It's not just a normal meeting.

770
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:42,526
Mr. Bu's wife runs
a convenience store, you see.

771
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:45,196
And every three months,
when we have our regular meeting,

772
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,490
she insists on treating us all

773
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,617
to reward us for our hard work.

774
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,160
Now, think about it.

775
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:52,995
You walk into a convenience store.

776
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:55,373
<i>And you can take all the food there</i>

777
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:59,335
<i>without any sort of restrictions.</i>

778
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:14,475
That…

779
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,018
is heaven!

780
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:17,353
Exactly!

781
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,606
Really? It's really unlimited?

782
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:23,150
- Yes, totally!
- Really?

783
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:30,783
Gosh.

784
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,119
My parents birthed me…

785
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,498
but Mr. Bu raises me.

786
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:40,167
Mr. Bu!

787
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:44,380
Follow me!

788
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:45,339
Dad!

789
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:47,216
- Dad!
- Dad!

790
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,969
- Mr. Bu! Mr. Bu!
- Mr. Bu! Mr. Bu!

791
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,887
- Say what?
- Mr. Bu!

792
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:53,597
- Hands up!
- Mr. Bu!

793
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:55,474
- Break it down!
- Mr. Bu!

794
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,232
All of these flavors of pastries

795
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:05,359
have been sold out everywhere.

796
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:07,319
- Is there cherry?
- Yeah.

797
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:08,737
- Yay.
- Wow, cherry.

798
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:11,365
What?

799
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:15,619
We must have gotten the wrong room.

800
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:17,705
It's been so long since our last meeting.

801
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,124
- That's not--
- Research Team, about-face!

802
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:22,543
Forward!

803
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:25,087
Hold on!

804
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:30,926
This is the Research Team
meeting room, though.

805
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:33,846
- Yes.
- It is.

806
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:35,431
- It is.
- Then why…

807
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:39,018
Wait…

808
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,314
Why are you here?

809
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:47,735
I heard you had a regular meeting today.

810
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,362
- I wanted to attend.
- Okay, sure.

811
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:51,906
Ow…

812
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:52,907
For what reason…

813
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,451
Mr. So?

814
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:03,876
MAROO K RESEARCH PROGRESS REPORT

815
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:08,631
The expected yield for Maroo K this year

816
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:11,967
is about 31 tons per hectare.

817
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,846
It's at a similar rate as last year.

818
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,933
As for the distresses…

819
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:22,186
<i>Planning on calling</i>
<i>Chief So "Chief So Ridiculous."</i>

820
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,562
<i>Because he's being ridiculous.</i>

821
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:25,564
…4.1%.

822
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:31,153
And secondly, cracking decreased by 1.3%.

823
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:32,821
<i>Be patient.</i>

824
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:35,032
<i>- The bread isn't going anywhere.</i>
- Thirdly,

825
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,784
- the hollow heart…
<i>- But I'm still mad.</i>

826
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,744
<i>Not letting us eat</i>
<i>when the food is right there.</i>

827
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:41,914
<i>- Isn't this abuse?</i>
- …0.4%.

828
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,002
And lastly, the internal rust spots.

829
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:49,088
The internal rust spots decreased by

830
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:52,591
0.1%.

831
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:55,094
<i>He doesn't care about our work,</i>
<i>so why is he even here?</i>

832
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:57,179
<i>- He's so overbearing!</i>
- That's how much

833
00:50:57,263 --> 00:50:58,722
they have decreased in the past year.

834
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:00,975
NEW MESSAGE

835
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,269
And also,

836
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,980
if you look at the third section here,

837
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:10,150
we use diagnosis test kits
periodically to test…

838
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,696
for PVY,

839
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:18,367
and PLRV,

840
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:25,207
as well as PVX.

841
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,502
PVX.

842
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:33,215
As of right now,
only these are shown here,

843
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:36,135
but we also use diagnosis kits

844
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:37,886
for PVM,

845
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:39,930
PVM.

846
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:41,974
And when…

847
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:47,896
we examined the PVM…

848
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:50,482
well…

849
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:52,026
THE DANGEROUS CHAT

850
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:55,029
…from all PVX…

851
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,155
I'm fucked.

852
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:59,033
…PLRV…

853
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:06,206
PLRV, and…

854
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,377
PV…

855
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,256
VX…

856
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,592
P…

857
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,262
M…

858
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,226
So when we examined them-- hold on.

859
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,646
Mr. So, this previous step here--

860
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,606
Look here!

861
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:33,942
- What? MK?
- Ms. Kim!

862
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:36,528
Ms. Kim!

863
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:38,113
- MK!
- Ms. Kim!

864
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:39,073
MK!

865
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:40,866
What are you doing?

866
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,201
- Ms. Jang! You--
- What do I do?

867
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:44,578
- What do we do?
- What do I do?

868
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:51,877
Damn it!

869
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:53,379
Damn it!

870
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:04,848
Ms. Kim.

871
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,810
What are you doing
with my phone right now?

872
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:10,521
Ms. Kim!

873
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,773
POTATO LAB RESEARCH TEAM

874
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:20,864
SO WHY IS HE EVEN HERE?

875
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:22,032
HE'S SO OVERBEARING!

876
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,161
DELETE

877
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:28,497
DELETE MESSAGE(S)

878
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,732
- Ms. Kim.
- Oops. My mistake.

879
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:58,610
I thought it was mine,
but it was your phone.

880
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:16,211
Goodness me.

881
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:18,672
MK!

882
00:54:19,298 --> 00:54:20,591
Ms. Kim!

883
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,509
Even if something like that happened,

884
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:25,846
how can you run off like that
with the chief's phone?

885
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:27,765
So? Did you delete it?

886
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:31,810
Yes!

887
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,896
- Nice!
- Great job!

888
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,606
Ms. Kim.

889
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:38,484
Why did you do that?
I'm the one who messed up.

890
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:40,027
Oh, it's fine. Forget it.

891
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,197
He's already out to get me, so it's fine.

892
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,199
He'll probably just think
I'm going crazy again.

893
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,700
Come on.

894
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:48,243
Ms. Kim.

895
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:51,371
You're something else.

896
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:54,333
It was shocking how fast you moved.

897
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:57,544
- Good grief.
- Take a breath and let's eat.

898
00:54:57,628 --> 00:55:00,464
- Ms. Jang, eat.
- But!

899
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:04,301
Wouldn't Mr. So also have

900
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:07,429
the messenger app
installed on his computer?

901
00:55:07,513 --> 00:55:10,015
- Of course he would.
- Yeah.

902
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:12,184
Why?

903
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:15,145
When you delete messages on the phone…

904
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:18,649
they stay on the desktop version.

905
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:21,902
What?

906
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:27,241
What?

907
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,579
What in the world did she do?

908
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:36,667
Ms. Kim! About what just happened--

909
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,002
Where are you going? Ms. Kim!

910
00:55:40,379 --> 00:55:43,841
CHIEF'S OFFICE

911
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:45,467
What's going on now?

912
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:49,513
Ms. Kim.

913
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:50,764
Ms. Kim!

914
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:52,266
Hold on.

915
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:56,395
How would I know
the password? "Wonhan"?

916
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:57,479
INCORRECT PASSWORD

917
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:03,569
"So Baek-ho." Damn it!

918
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:06,363
"Baekho1818."

919
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:08,615
Damn it.

920
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:14,705
Darn it!

921
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,213
What's your password?

922
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:26,174
Your computer password.

923
00:56:26,258 --> 00:56:27,759
Can you tell me, please?

924
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:30,470
What are you trying to do right now?

925
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:33,265
It's nothing weird, it's just…

926
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:36,727
just tell me, please!
I just need to use it for ten seconds.

927
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:40,230
Mr. So?

928
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:56,872
Why would I need to tell you that?

929
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,004
Please leave.

930
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,423
Even by your standards,

931
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,175
you've gone way too far.

932
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,311
Ms. Kim.

933
00:57:21,897 --> 00:57:23,231
I wrote mean texts.

934
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:28,028
I cursed you out.

935
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:30,530
I meant to send them to my friends,

936
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:34,368
but I accidentally sent them
to the lab group chat.

937
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:38,080
So I was trying to delete that. I'm sorry.

938
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:42,000
That's it? That's all this fuss is about?

939
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:43,710
It's not that simple.

940
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:47,255
I wrote insults I can't say out loud,

941
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:51,468
and I tore into you like crazy.

942
00:57:52,094 --> 00:57:53,637
If you saw it,

943
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,389
you would be really offended.

944
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:08,652
I won't be.

945
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:12,948
Your opinions and thoughts
do not matter to me at all.

946
00:58:14,116 --> 00:58:15,033
However,

947
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,119
since you've
worked yourself up into a fit

948
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:19,121
and can't focus on your work,

949
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,831
I'll indulge your wishes, then.

950
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:57,993
CONFIRM

951
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:06,918
Be careful from now on.

952
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:10,881
And please be mindful
of your superiors in an official setting.

953
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:14,301
I'm sorry.

954
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,836
THIS MESSAGE HAS BEEN DELETED

955
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:12,901
No, wait.

956
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,611
Why do I need to hide?

957
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,238
Jeez.

958
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:27,874
Your opinions and thoughts
do not matter to me at all.

959
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:30,752
You don't matter to me either,
so don't worry!

960
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:07,455
<i>I wrote insults I can't say out loud,</i>

961
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:10,917
and I tore into you like crazy.

962
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:14,462
If you saw it,
you would be really offended.

963
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:40,655
EMERGENCY ALERT
HEAVY RAIN, STRONG WINDS, THUNDER

964
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:41,948
Man…

965
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:55,879
The greenhouses!

966
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:18,193
POTATO LAB

967
01:03:23,675 --> 01:03:25,427
Oh no. Oh my gosh.

968
01:03:29,848 --> 01:03:30,849
Oh dear!

969
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,382
What do you need me to do?

970
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:07,612
POTATO LAB

971
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:55,994
THE MOONLIGHT, THE WHIP, AND THE BEAST

972
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:04,627
Put it down.

973
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:06,754
Yes, ma'am.

974
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:34,574
<i>You came out of nowhere.</i>

975
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:35,742
<i>I just find it interesting.</i>

976
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,410
Why is he on my mind? Whatever.

977
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:41,915
I think I'd haunt you if I were a ghost.

978
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:43,458
<i>I'd follow you everywhere.</i>

979
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:47,170
I think you mean, "Thank you."

980
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:49,005
Why are you doing this to me?

981
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:50,131
Please, stop! Hold on.

982
01:06:51,466 --> 01:06:52,842
<i>That's what love is.</i>

983
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:55,011
I think they're both
just out of their minds.

984
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:57,055
Did you know about
So Baek-ho’s girlfriend?

985
01:06:57,472 --> 01:07:00,016
You cry yourself to sleep at night
because you miss me, don't you?

986
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:03,436
You're way more shameless
than I thought.

987
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:09,359
