1
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,955
THE POTATO LAB

2
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,303
How long

3
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,347
are you going to be standing like that?

4
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,350
Mi…

5
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,477
Mi-kyung, I--

6
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:01,728
Just a minute!

7
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:04,398
Why are you so impatient?

8
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,191
You can't say something like that…

9
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,405
and not give me time to process it!

10
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,285
Go away!

11
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,454
Yes. Okay.

12
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,685
If you tell everyone about me again,

13
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:45,397
that I was crying,
then you're going to be in trouble.

14
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,483
- I wasn't even thinking about telling--
- Don't argue with me!

15
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:52,487
Okay.

16
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:55,073
I'll hear you out.

17
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:56,199
Why did you do it?

18
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,578
You said you knew I was innocent.

19
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,540
Then why did you cause
such horrible things to happen?

20
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,628
Is that who you really are?

21
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:09,379
I mean,

22
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:11,506
are you still

23
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,384
that kind of person?

24
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:17,763
Yes.

25
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,431
I am still that kind of person.

26
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,726
Nothing has changed between then and now.

27
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,020
However,

28
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:28,190
I have been feeling
ashamed of myself lately.

29
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:32,069
I judged people's lives
based on a few pages

30
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,239
and never thought anything of it.

31
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:39,868
In fact, I regarded those
who'd be emotionally swayed as foolish,

32
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,954
believing that I was sensible

33
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,208
because I made data-driven decisions.

34
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,627
But now that I look back on it,

35
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:54,007
I simply did not know
how to empathize with others.

36
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,885
I couldn't put myself in anyone's shoes.

37
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,096
I didn't know how to interact with anyone.

38
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,098
That's who I am.

39
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:03,642
A cold-hearted man.

40
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:08,814
I realized much too late
that the things I've done all these years

41
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,441
caused tremendous despair…

42
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:14,653
to countless people.

43
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,572
I know I can't undo the past.

44
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:19,825
And…

45
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,578
I know I'm very late.

46
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,456
But I sincerely apologize.

47
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,086
I'm sorry, Mi-kyung.

48
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,391
You are so lethal to my heart.

49
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,274
I'm the one who's hurt,

50
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,026
but why do I feel like comforting you?

51
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,197
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

52
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,450
Because you know
you look cute when you cry?

53
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,161
- Oh--
- And you knew I would give in?

54
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,708
I mean,

55
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,754
since you've reflected on yourself
and are apologizing,

56
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,883
I might be leaning a bit
towards accepting it.

57
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,259
But it doesn't mean

58
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,764
that I'm fine now
and we should start dating again.

59
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,099
So just…

60
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,144
just wait.

61
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,606
Until I can smile at you again.

62
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,775
Don't run away.

63
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,194
Don't hide.

64
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,780
Just keep bothering me…

65
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,159
and wait for me.

66
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,418
That's all I ask.

67
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,056
I will.

68
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,683
I won't give up.

69
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,323
Who closed the storage door?

70
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,909
There's the reason why.

71
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,078
It's not like that.

72
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,205
- We didn't close--
- I mean,

73
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,624
when a couple makes up,

74
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,835
they don't only use words.

75
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:35,794
It's true.

76
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,214
You're right. It must have been so hot

77
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,675
that they had to come into the cooler.

78
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,010
- So hot.
- That's not what happened.

79
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,805
We were simply trying to keep warm
in low temperatures,

80
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,431
so physical contact was inevitable--

81
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,141
- I see.
- No need to say more.

82
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,727
Keep warming each other up.

83
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:56,731
- No, we really--
- We know our cue. We'll go.

84
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,650
Wait! Don't close the door!

85
00:06:00,858 --> 00:06:02,445
FINAL EPISODE

86
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,198
- Like this?
- Yeah.

87
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,367
- Welcome home.
- Hey.

88
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:16,459
Why are you dying?
You were fine when you left.

89
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:17,419
Feeling sick again?

90
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,338
I don't have the energy
to explain right now.

91
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,925
Can you come up and put some
pain relief patches on me?

92
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,261
- And bring the microfiber comforter too.
- Okay.

93
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,600
Poor thing.

94
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,227
I didn't realize it was taking
such a toll on her.

95
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,479
Ah, the tragedy of love.
How can it be so cruel!

96
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,190
Turning a woman who'd down
a bowl of <i>naengmyeon</i> outside in mid-winter

97
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:40,775
into a weak, shaky leaf.

98
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,990
Hey… Honeybun?

99
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,450
This is all…

100
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,410
This is all--

101
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,555
Oh, hello. How can I help you?

102
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,599
I am hereby

103
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,476
evicting you from USB Guesthouse, Mr. So.

104
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,770
Pardon?

105
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,109
EVICTION NOTICE

106
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,028
This is my first time kicking out a guest,

107
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,073
so I'm not sure if that's correct,

108
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,032
but get packing.

109
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,242
Or else

110
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,370
I'm going to have to use physical force.

111
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,705
Mr. Kim.

112
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,750
Do you know what
an eviction notice exactly entails?

113
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,919
Do I have to know every single law?

114
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,880
You're guilty of breaking
the heart of Kim Mi-kyung,

115
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:47,050
eldest daughter of Kim Jin-gyu,
the 38th generation of Gimhae Kim clan!

116
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,345
That alone is enough
for you to be evicted.

117
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,308
And Mi-kyung has agreed to this?

118
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,018
She…

119
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,772
It doesn't matter.

120
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:04,234
The important thing is that I'm the owner,
and I'm kicking you out. Understand?

121
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,237
I'll transfer the rest
of the rent next week,

122
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,780
when my installment savings matures.

123
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,324
I don't want a crappy interest rate.

124
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,121
Oh my God.

125
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,710
Mi-kyung, you don't have to worry now!
I took care of everything.

126
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,547
How dare you? Come here!

127
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:27,590
How crazy are you?

128
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,009
Ow, ow, whoa!

129
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,107
So what I said before…

130
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,070
Thank you.

131
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,407
Did you get in a lot of trouble?

132
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,620
I am a fully grown adult.

133
00:08:58,705 --> 00:08:59,664
I don't get in trouble.

134
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,960
We have mature conversations…

135
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,920
conversations…

136
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,814
She always gets angry and yells at me

137
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:28,735
when I'm just trying to be considerate.

138
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,740
Come on, hurry up!

139
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,493
Gosh.

140
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:45,251
Why are they so quiet?
What are they doing?

141
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,795
I can't hear a thing.

142
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:50,215
It's not like they disappeared
into outer space or whatever.

143
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,217
Let's go back inside. I'm tired.

144
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,761
You didn't see
Hwan-kyung's face when he left.

145
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,514
He was so worked up.
He said he'd crush So Baek-ho.

146
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,725
They could've gotten into a fistfight.

147
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,186
Who's crushing whom?

148
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,107
Hwan-kyung is barely capable
of fighting a feisty insect.

149
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,609
You know, like mantises and grasshoppers.

150
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,985
Would you listen to this?

151
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,363
Don't be rude.

152
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:17,200
Hwan-kyung is more toned
than you'd expect under his shirt. Okay?

153
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,493
Ew! Please!

154
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,620
Anyway…

155
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,622
Is Baek-ho good at fighting?

156
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,750
He was in the Special Forces,
so I'm sure he is.

157
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:27,710
Then

158
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,171
what if Hwan-kyung tried to hit him first?

159
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,757
Then he would be dead now,
fighting an ex-Special Forces guy.

160
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,927
How could you say
such an awful thing so casually?

161
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:37,720
That does it.

162
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,306
- Honeybun!
- Oh my.

163
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,183
I'll save you!

164
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,938
Dang it.

165
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,023
Oh my gosh.

166
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,029
Honeybun!

167
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,116
Jeez.

168
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,159
Oh! Hey!

169
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:02,954
Are you seriously doing this?

170
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,497
Oh my gosh.

171
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,291
Oh man.

172
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,963
Hey, Ong-ju. For heaven's sake.

173
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:20,847
Wow.

174
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,765
I'm confused.

175
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,894
Am I supposed to count this as cheating?

176
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:28,730
How did they even end up like this?

177
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,232
I guess he's learning

178
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,775
how to get along with others.

179
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,569
What?

180
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,488
This is our chance.

181
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,240
Turn your camera on.

182
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:49,083
Photo key chains,
photo T-shirts, and photo mugs.

183
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,295
We're going to make
an ocean of souvenirs.

184
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:56,382
You never cease to amaze me
with your genius, Mi-kyung.

185
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,929
Hey, come here. Let's get them up close.

186
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,809
It's a little gross, though.

187
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:11,522
POTATO LAB

188
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,945
Oh! Hello, Chief So.

189
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:20,281
Wow, you're practically glowing today.

190
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,116
You must be super well-rested.

191
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,036
Yes, I slept well as usual.

192
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,621
I'm sure you did.

193
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,374
Since you were cozy
even without a blanket.

194
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,042
- Let's go.
- Just a moment.

195
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,710
- Are you leaving now?
- Yes.

196
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,338
We'll send updates
about the harvest in the group chat.

197
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,090
Please drive safely, everyone.

198
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,633
- Good luck, all of you.
- Thank you.

199
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,801
- Good luck!
- We'll get going.

200
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,052
- So they're saying--
- Goodbye.

201
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,178
- Bye.
- Good luck.

202
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,348
I can't believe it.

203
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,601
I can't believe I am actually jealous
of those who get to work in the field.

204
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:52,897
This emergency purchase
has me so stressed that I can barely eat.

205
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,316
Eating two bowls of rice
instead of three doesn't count.

206
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,195
Anyway, where in the world is Park?

207
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,863
Sorry, I'm here! Please forgive me.

208
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,283
- Gosh.
- Why the heck are you so late?

209
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,410
- We were getting ready.
- This is all because of you.

210
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,787
- So, are we all here?
- Yeah.

211
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,498
All right. Then let's get going,
Purchase Team.

212
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:14,752
This quarter's Potachips' production
depends on this.

213
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,796
- Put your heart into it.
- Yes.

214
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,423
Okay. Potato!

215
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,383
- Potato!
- Potato! Po…

216
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,391
Wait…

217
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,602
am I also supposed to do it?

218
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:34,731
Of course! You're not
chief of some corn lab.

219
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,651
Right.

220
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,405
Po… Potato.

221
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:46,659
- Potato, potato, potato!
- Potato, potato, potato!

222
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,833
- Hello!
- Hello.

223
00:13:58,796 --> 00:13:59,839
Come on.

224
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,344
What was that? Oh my gosh.

225
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,228
Well, hello.

226
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,898
These were harvested this summer.

227
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,274
Oh, I see.

228
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,486
Why don't you look at these over here?

229
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,445
Oh, sure.

230
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,655
Wait, hold on! Sir, sir!

231
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,449
- I said I'm busy!
- Just a second!

232
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:30,453
Just one second.
Can you sell just 20 tons?

233
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,662
Come on. Don't be ridiculous…

234
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:35,166
What do you mean?
Fine, then how about ten tons--

235
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,001
No way. We don't have
anywhere near ten tons.

236
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,419
- I have to go.
- Wait, hold on.

237
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,171
Let go. I'm busy enough as it is.

238
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,718
Take a look. These were harvested
this year and are of great quality.

239
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,637
The eyes aren't discolored. They're fresh.

240
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,098
How many of these do you have?

241
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,767
We have about 150 kilograms left.

242
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,019
- I see. We'll take them.
- Sure.

243
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:07,448
Man.

244
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,245
Thank you for the food.

245
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,956
This one's vegan. It's mine.

246
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,625
- This one's yours.
- Okay.

247
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,421
Take a break when you're eating.

248
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,005
We don't have time for that.

249
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,467
We worked all day
and only came up with 200 kilograms.

250
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:29,762
How can we meet
the 500-ton quota at this rate?

251
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,519
Wait, isn't this what I made
at the cooking contest?

252
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,478
Ugly Cheese Potatoes.

253
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,355
I thought you might like it,
so I ordered some.

254
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,066
So can you smile now?

255
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,279
You think I'm that easy?

256
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,574
You think working together
for one day made us close again?

257
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:51,617
Come on.

258
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,286
Didn't it, though?

259
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,371
Hmm? Didn't it?

260
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,169
Hey, this is good.

261
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,262
Hello? Yes, Mr. Bu.

262
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:12,847
Youngsan?

263
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,476
I don't think it can be done today.

264
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,643
Youngsan?

265
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,523
Are you talking about
Chairman Kang in Youngsan?

266
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,650
You got hold of him?

267
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,168
Hello. I'm Kang Dong-won.

268
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:49,300
I'm Chief So Baek-ho
of Wonhan Retail's Potato Lab.

269
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,722
I'm Assistant Manager Kim Mi-kyung.

270
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,976
It's nice to meet you.

271
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:08,486
First of all, thank you for inviting us.

272
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,238
It's such an honor to even

273
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:11,697
- come see you--
- That's enough.

274
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,158
I've been getting so many calls
saying you have an emergency.

275
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,160
So I called to figure out what's going on.

276
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,079
Tell me and be quick about it.

277
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,039
Then we'll get straight to the point.

278
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:24,710
The potato lab is currently
making emergency potato purchases.

279
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,255
As such,

280
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:30,091
we are willing to pay
any satisfactory amount for them.

281
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,551
Satisfactory?

282
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,262
Satisfactory, you say.

283
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:36,514
Right.

284
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,101
This chair here.
How much do you think it is?

285
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,062
Well,

286
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:44,814
1.2 million…

287
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,816
No, wait. 1.5 million won?

288
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:48,901
It wasn't a question.

289
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:50,778
Pardon?

290
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:54,490
What I'm saying
is that I'm already well-off.

291
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,784
So money doesn't interest me.

292
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,538
But I am rather curious about

293
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,916
how you two plan on satisfying me.

294
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,711
I understand your caution
coming into these talks.

295
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:10,047
But as you also know,
time is not on our side.

296
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:13,259
If you tell us your conditions,
we'll match them.

297
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,219
Mr. So Byung--

298
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,637
So Bak-ho?

299
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,725
Anyway.

300
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,059
Chief.

301
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,478
You're not a farmer, are you?

302
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,647
I don't see how
that is relevant to this deal.

303
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:29,775
Would you look at that?
Cold as the Arctic.

304
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,361
How can I put this?

305
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,531
You don't have a farmer's spirit at all.

306
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:39,702
We're talking about the great noble work
of growing sustenance on this land,

307
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,038
and all you're focused on are numbers.

308
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,664
Yes, you're right.

309
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:46,334
To be honest, he's a temporary chief,

310
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,878
so he's basically an egghead.

311
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,922
But I, Kim Mi-kyung,
am the real deal, a potato researcher.

312
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:55,468
All I think about is how much I love
potatoes and farming.

313
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:03,017
Speaking from one farmer to another,
I know you understand our situation.

314
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,104
If you can help us out just this once,
we'll never forget your kindness.

315
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,609
- Ms. Kim.
- Yes.

316
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,570
Do you know how many potatoes
I am currently holding

317
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:15,821
in storage right now?

318
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,616
Yes, of course. About 100 tons--

319
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,076
This wasn't a question either.

320
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:24,664
It's 98 tons.

321
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,918
Right now, we're talking about
a truly massive amount of potatoes.

322
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,795
It's 98 tons in one deal.

323
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,089
But your strategy

324
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,841
is to appeal to my emotions
as a "fellow farmer"?

325
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,635
Am I hearing you correctly?

326
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:41,305
Or do you really think
I'm doing some kind of charity work?

327
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,686
Didn't you just say a farmer's spirit--

328
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,396
- Mr. Cha.
- Yes, sir.

329
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,065
See them out and waive the parking fee.

330
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,858
Just a minute. I know we rushed you.

331
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,985
- If you can give us just ten min--
- Gosh.

332
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,612
I hate clingy people.

333
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,741
If you want to meet again in the future,

334
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,493
it'd be best if you leave now.

335
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:03,994
By the way,

336
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,706
why do you keep talking down to us?

337
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,833
I was spoiled as a child.

338
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,459
Is that a problem?

339
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,212
- Look--
- No, it's not.

340
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,339
We'll go.

341
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:19,885
Thank you for today's meeting.

342
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,063
HONORARY PROMOTION, SERGEANT KANG DONG-WON

343
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,648
Golden Bat?

344
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:35,526
GOLDEN BAT
NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE

345
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,986
What are you doing? Let's go.

346
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:38,738
Just a moment.

347
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,117
Were you

348
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,785
in the Special Forces, by any chance?

349
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:45,745
Yes, I was.

350
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,205
I don't imagine
you've heard of the Golden Bat.

351
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,498
Which class?

352
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,667
Why are you asking that?

353
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,714
I won't ask again. Which class?

354
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,346
Well, what about you?

355
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,266
Which… class are you?

356
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,314
198th.

357
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,940
Unity! Sir!

358
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,650
Kang Dong-won, of the 210th class

359
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:19,111
of the 11th Special Forces Brigade! Sir!

360
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,531
- Unity.
- That little bastard.

361
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,074
Where did you serve?

362
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:26,619
I've been discharged
from the 79th Battalion, sir!

363
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,705
One, two, three, four!

364
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:43,552
Louder!

365
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,037
Gosh, I didn't realize I fell asleep.

366
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:16,919
I didn't think you'd ever leave.

367
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,046
Did you have that much to talk about?

368
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,423
It's been a while since I saw someone
from the same platoon.

369
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:22,633
And…

370
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,059
You got him to sign it?

371
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:35,062
We got the entire stock of 98 tons.

372
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,857
And he'll pull some strings
to obtain about 20 tons more for us.

373
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,401
Oh my gosh! This is insane!

374
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,695
What would I do without you?

375
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:55,040
We got over
a huge obstacle, thanks to you.

376
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,751
Thank you for all your hard work today.

377
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,044
Let's head on home.

378
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,299
You stopped yourself
from giving me a kiss, right?

379
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:07,636
What are you saying?
Don't be ridiculous. Go away.

380
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:24,862
All right.

381
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:28,949
Let's see.

382
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,301
Whoa!

383
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:53,140
Whoa, how did you know
I was thinking of you?

384
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,060
I have something
I'd like to give you, Mr. Hong.

385
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,312
- Mr. Hong!
- Hey.

386
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:01,774
Goodness.

387
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,986
I was going to visit Youngeul-ri
tomorrow anyway.

388
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:10,282
You know I can't rest whenever
I have something to show off.

389
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:11,659
Ta-dah!

390
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:14,203
MK-107 is here!

391
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:17,915
The tubers are a bit small,
but they're smooth and pretty.

392
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,418
It's an honor, Ms. Kim.

393
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,796
How can I eat something so precious?

394
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,215
Come on. You can steam, stir-fry, fry,

395
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:30,177
or use any other method to cook it.
Just give me some feedback.

396
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,304
That way, it will be
a better potato next year.

397
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:34,473
Thanks for this. I'll eat it all up.

398
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:36,350
And here.

399
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,520
I heard about the purchase situation,
so I looked into it.

400
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,189
I talked to them already,
so you just have to go buy it.

401
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,941
They have about 3,000 kilograms.

402
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,360
You're not even getting paid for this.

403
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,237
You shouldn't do extra work.

404
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,155
I can't believe you.

405
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,699
I'm partially at fault too.

406
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:54,868
I should have made sure
that my successor was informed.

407
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,287
Why is that your fault?

408
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:59,373
It's Baek-ho's fault for forgetting.

409
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,583
Are you not holding back anymore?

410
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,545
- You don't call him Chief So?
- Come on.

411
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:08,382
The only Potato Lab chief for me
is you, Mr. Hong.

412
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,592
I was only able to start my research

413
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,928
on MK potatoes because of you.

414
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:16,348
That was all because of you
and your persistence.

415
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:19,893
Who knew you'd take the potatoes
rotting away in a snowfield

416
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:22,187
and cultivate them to reproduce like this?

417
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:28,027
But I heard you were leaving the lab.

418
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,863
News sure does travel fast.

419
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,656
Do you have a place to go?

420
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,907
Well…

421
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:34,908
Not yet.

422
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:38,996
I'm not sure what I should do next,
to be honest.

423
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:42,082
My whole life has been
so consumed by potatoes

424
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,043
that I can't think of anything else.

425
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:45,169
I know that feeling.

426
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:48,922
Since I retired,
I keep dreaming about potatoes.

427
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:53,886
Should all the people
who got kicked out by Wonhan

428
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,095
get together and open a lab?

429
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:57,765
Why don't we call it Hong-Kim Potato Lab?

430
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:59,349
Oh! I like it.

431
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:02,728
Then I'll be chief.
And you can be vice chief.

432
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,563
Starting with a coup, huh?

433
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,400
Maybe I should have brought more.

434
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,666
SEPTEMBER

435
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:29,463
THE END

436
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,472
I don't have time to think about
Baek-ho right now.

437
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:46,480
SEPTEMBER 30, 2024
ASSISTANT MANAGER KIM MI-KYUNG'S LAST DAY

438
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:57,491
Good morning.

439
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:01,495
"Good morning"?

440
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,789
I have to go to work
on the weekend because of you,

441
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,332
and you think it's a good morning?

442
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,918
I made some soup.
Should we have some before we go?

443
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:10,379
No.

444
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,297
I'll just buy a sparkling water

445
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,758
with tons of ice at the convenience store.

446
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:16,802
Right now, I'm burning up inside.

447
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:19,471
I see. I'm on your bad side today.

448
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:22,558
I understand.
But I'll do my best to bother you

449
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,809
like I promised.

450
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,352
Oh, do whatever you like.

451
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,354
None of that's important to me right now.

452
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,522
What?

453
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,315
Think about it.

454
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,819
Harvest season is the busiest time,
and the purchases are making it worse.

455
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,779
The Research Team can barely
get any work done.

456
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:38,615
My days at the lab are numbered as it is.

457
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,577
So why should I spend time playing along?

458
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,917
Let's go. We have to cover
a lot of ground today as well.

459
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,099
Mommy?

460
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,435
Surprise.

461
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,896
When did you come back to Korea?

462
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,732
I can't believe this.

463
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,123
The passcode was still the same.

464
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,083
What…

465
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:36,048
- What are you doing here?
- Sorry I didn't call you first.

466
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,925
I just wanted to come inside

467
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,676
one last time.

468
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:42,429
I went to see my mom today.

469
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:46,767
I had to listen to years' worth
of lectures all at once, which was rough,

470
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:51,021
but she finally agreed to our divorce.

471
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,821
Wait, what do you mean?

472
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,242
You're free now, Ki-se.

473
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:06,161
You can leave me and Wonhan
and start over.

474
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:11,541
You're relieved, aren't you?
To finally get everything off your back?

475
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,293
Why are you doing this right now?

476
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:14,878
Is something wrong?

477
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:18,590
I don't know.

478
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:22,469
I guess the vitamins I take
to boost my brain finally kicked in.

479
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,179
I thought about it and realized

480
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:27,015
that the root issue was me, not you.

481
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,309
I trapped myself
in the happiest moment of my life

482
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:32,562
and blinded myself with longing
for what could have been.

483
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:38,819
Hee-jin.

484
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,154
I'm going back to New York.

485
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:44,157
I'm going to finish school,
try getting a part-time job,

486
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:48,203
and meet someone
who appreciates me for who I am,

487
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,956
instead of just seeing me
as a chairman's daughter.

488
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:56,586
I'm going to live so well
that you'll be jealous.

489
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,047
That's my new goal. What do you think?

490
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,219
I'm sorry.

491
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:06,722
You shone so brightly that I thought

492
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,682
I could shine too if I was next to you.

493
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:10,767
I thought I could forget

494
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:12,894
all about my shabby life.

495
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,440
I'm a huge idiot.

496
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:21,528
I'm sorry.

497
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:24,906
In the end, I made you lonely

498
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,700
and you left on your own.

499
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:28,577
I am

500
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:29,953
so sorry.

501
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,288
Nevertheless…

502
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,250
I was very happy because of you.

503
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,587
Take care.

504
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,464
Ex-husband.

505
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:47,804
Take care.

506
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,765
Hee-jin.

507
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,036
Good night.

508
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,622
Are you aware you only spoke
to me ten times today?

509
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,292
You clearly weren't busy
if you were keeping count.

510
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,336
I counted because it's important to me.

511
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:25,384
Last time, you said I should roll over
and act cute like a puppy, right?

512
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:27,094
If I really do it,

513
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,262
would that make you feel better?

514
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,142
Sure, go ahead.

515
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,229
- What?
- Go ahead.

516
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,898
A puppy can do it, so why can't you?

517
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,670
Gosh.

518
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,381
Just tell me.

519
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,341
Why are you suddenly upset with me?

520
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:10,512
- You know what? I'm tired.
- It's the layoffs, isn't it?

521
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:18,270
This morning, you said your days
at the lab are numbered.

522
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,523
Is that why you're upset?

523
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:22,941
Gosh.

524
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:27,237
Do you really have to go
and dissect everything?

525
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,072
I'm trying to let it go.

526
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:32,409
I repeatedly insisted that I was fine,

527
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:35,787
so getting mad now makes me look
really weird. I know that.

528
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:38,123
You were always weird.

529
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,917
What? Do you want to fight?

530
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,335
That's why I like you.

531
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,463
Because you say you hate me
but then you kiss me.

532
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,423
You tease and torment me
but always apologize.

533
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,258
You get mad over such trivial things,

534
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:51,094
but you comfort me
when I make a mistake.

535
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:54,473
Because you're unpredictable
and unfathomable.

536
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:55,807
I see.

537
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:58,894
- So in one word, I'm crazy?
- That's what you got out of that?

538
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,857
It's a fact that I've gone crazy
because of you.

539
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,734
If I think about leaving the lab,

540
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,695
I get so sad and don't know
what to do with myself.

541
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,823
But despite everything,
it's your smile that pops into my head.

542
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,783
That's how it was from the beginning.

543
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:19,372
A single word from you makes me cry,
laugh, feel anxious or excited.

544
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:23,585
I'm a fool, but I'm so taken with you
that I can't think straight.

545
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:24,920
And you think I'm not?

546
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,507
I adore you so much that it frightens me.

547
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:32,260
Now, a day without you feels too quiet,
too awkward, and too boring.

548
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,261
What's worse,

549
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:35,931
I spent all of last night
wondering whether it's right to fire you--

550
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,516
You're thinking about that now?

551
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,851
Did you not think about it
when you gave me the notice?

552
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:43,730
At that time, I wasn't fully aware
of how crucial you were to the lab!

553
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:46,858
That's why I told you
to watch me a bit more.

554
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,652
Are you trying to annoy me?

555
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,570
Watching you, I realized some things,

556
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:51,905
so now I'm reconsidering.

557
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:54,282
Wrong.

558
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,700
It's because you love me.

559
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,287
You're not acknowledging me
as an employee.

560
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:03,458
You're reconsidering
because you love me and feel bad.

561
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:05,585
Jeez.

562
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,964
I don't want to get any unfair benefits

563
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,715
for dating my boss.

564
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,259
I'll settle it for you.

565
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:15,804
If you don't fire me,
I'm going to leave voluntarily.

566
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,472
- You can't.
- Why not?

567
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,808
Let me leave with dignity!

568
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,143
Then you can't get
unemployment benefits.

569
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,187
If you're that worried,
go ahead and fire me.

570
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:25,897
- Why are you so wishy-washy?
- Wow.

571
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:29,150
I'm not the one going back and forth
on my word right now.

572
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,280
I'm putting in my notice
on Monday. That's that.

573
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,365
- You just wait.
- Fine. I'll just reject it.

574
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:36,408
Oh my gosh!

575
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:39,077
Then I'll resign every day!

576
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,413
And I'll hold a one-person
demonstration to fire me.

577
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,207
Then I'll reject it every day
and report you for obstructing business.

578
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:45,375
Oh my God!

579
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,420
Why do you always have
to have the final word?

580
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,142
Well?

581
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,436
Why do you

582
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,688
keep talking back to me?

583
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,440
You annoyed me so much

584
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:11,318
that I had to shut you up like that.

585
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:13,486
Damn it.

586
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,238
Gosh.

587
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,200
We'll leave it at that.

588
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:20,702
Right now,

589
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:23,788
both of us are too emotional.

590
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,420
You kept talking back to me too.

591
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,180
So what?

592
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,475
What are you going to do about it?

593
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,193
Sheesh.

594
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,570
You're so childish.

595
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,697
And you're annoying.

596
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:33,441
Damn.

597
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:37,445
How is this fine? Not coming home?

598
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,155
Sleeping at his place?

599
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:41,950
How can they?
They've barely started dating!

600
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:45,370
How dare they when I,

601
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,747
Kim Mi-kyung's guardian,
am standing right here?

602
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:50,208
Am I just supposed to let this happen?

603
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,751
Go to Mi-kyung

604
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:54,587
and tell her
what you just said, verbatim.

605
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:57,006
It's been a while since
I've seen you get beaten up.

606
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:03,221
Hey, what are you trying to get
a glimpse of, anyway?

607
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,931
Even if she's your best friend,

608
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:09,352
isn't it really weird
to try to sneak a peek?

609
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:10,603
Hey.

610
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:14,482
I'm just a simple pervert
who likes a bit of dirty talk.

611
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:15,775
I'm sane.

612
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,152
As you know,

613
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,404
I learned how to read lips
as the former vice president

614
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,822
of the Future Spy Club.

615
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:25,201
I was merely trying to find out
what that poor naive soul was saying.

616
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,581
So? What did they talk about?

617
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,999
Did you find out anything?

618
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,126
Before they closed the curtains,

619
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,502
Mi-kyung spoke Spanish.

620
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,713
Spanish? My sister spoke Spanish?

621
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,716
She said, and I quote,

622
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:44,220
<i>"¿Dónde está la biblioteca?"</i>

623
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:47,223
What does that mean?

624
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:50,560
"Where is the library?"

625
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,396
Damn it, what do I do?

626
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,153
Oh man.

627
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,340
Act natural.

628
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,351
Act natural.

629
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,423
Should I pretend I can't see you?

630
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:01,232
Just a second.

631
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:16,372
Oh man…

632
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,388
I'll sleep here.

633
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:35,600
All of a sudden?

634
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,143
Why?

635
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,020
Right now,

636
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:42,148
you look like you'll faint
at the slightest touch, Mi-kyung.

637
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:44,525
I…

638
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,445
I won't faint.

639
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,656
Coming over was my idea.

640
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,713
Good night. Sleep tight.

641
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:08,007
I'll turn off the lights.

642
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,024
I'm not saying I don't want to.

643
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:36,995
I'm just…

644
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:39,622
so nervous.

645
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:42,792
I don't know what to say

646
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:47,213
or how to start everything naturally.

647
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:50,049
I really don't remember anything anymore.

648
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,057
Then…

649
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,643
can you just say one thing to me?

650
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,353
What's that?

651
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,525
Wait, do you mean

652
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:11,571
that four-letter word
that starts with "L"?

653
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:15,324
How can I say that? It's so awkward.

654
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:17,368
I did.

655
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,370
I can't.

656
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:25,001
It's not in my nature
to say things like that.

657
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,919
You already know. I don't have to say it.

658
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:28,212
I see.

659
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,966
I guess that's the depth
of your feelings for me.

660
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,552
I understand.

661
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,055
Have a good night.

662
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,140
Wait!

663
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,239
I love you.

664
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:05,833
Happy?

665
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,174
Stop talking now.

666
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:13,359
CEO YOON

667
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:40,052
- Hello.
<i>- Did you just wake up?</i>

668
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,263
<i>You slept in this late?</i>

669
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,973
No, I'm awake.

670
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:45,558
How can I help you?

671
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,727
You should've gotten an email about it.

672
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,813
It's a beverage company that F&B
Headquarters is considering for an M&A,

673
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:52,690
but it has over 500 employees.

674
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:56,194
<i>We plan on downsizing by 100.</i>

675
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:58,196
<i>Look over it and get back to me.</i>

676
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:00,198
Yes, ma'am.

677
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,352
<i>I realized much too late</i>

678
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:31,938
<i>that the things I had done all these years</i>

679
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:34,440
<i>caused tremendous despair</i>

680
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:36,776
<i>to countless people.</i>

681
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:42,949
One hundred people.

682
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,246
Gosh.

683
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:55,795
Good morning.

684
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:57,421
Wow.

685
00:45:57,922 --> 00:46:00,675
I woke up and didn't see you,
so I thought you ran away.

686
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,886
Are you working?

687
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,096
Oh. No.

688
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:09,225
- You must be hungry.
- Yes, very.

689
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:11,727
Look. I'm so hungry right now--

690
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,229
- Yes?
- It sounds like a drum.

691
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:17,400
- Let's go eat.
- Okay.

692
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,709
- Hey, Mr. Lee--
<i>- Are you all right?</i>

693
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:39,755
The group chats are exploding right now
with the news of your divorce!

694
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:43,050
News really does spread
like wildfire at our company.

695
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:44,802
<i>Should I speak up and correct them?</i>

696
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:47,054
<i>- If the chairman finds out--</i>
- No, there's no need.

697
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:50,141
<i>Thank you for keeping my secret</i>

698
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:51,600
<i>all this time.</i>

699
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:53,394
What? What are you--

700
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,479
Mr. Park? Mr. Park! Mr. Par--

701
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,799
I see. I'm actually
at Headquarters right now,

702
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:25,843
so I'll come by tomorrow morning.

703
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,261
It's 500 kilograms, right?

704
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:30,181
Yes. Thank you.

705
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:33,976
Gosh.

706
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,731
Mr. Park really is something else.

707
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:41,025
He got divorced ages ago

708
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:44,195
but pretended he was still
the chairman's son-in-law.

709
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,072
Oh my God!

710
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,199
How can someone be so shameless?

711
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:51,410
You'd have to be if you want to get
the crumbs from the chairman's table.

712
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:54,163
I mean, I guess that's all over now.

713
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:57,792
He's probably resigning, right?

714
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,502
Oh, of course.

715
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:08,094
STRATEGIC PLANNING DEPARTMENT
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR PARK KI-SE

716
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:14,892
Can I come in?

717
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:16,852
Are you here to pay
sympathies or spectate?

718
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:18,729
Both.

719
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,025
Goodness.

720
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,031
I bet it's rough out there.

721
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:31,826
I can't say it isn't.

722
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:34,662
I passed a crap ton of people
talking about you

723
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,414
on the way here from the conference room.

724
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:38,249
You should've joined in.

725
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:41,502
You probably can insult me the best
of anyone on Earth.

726
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:44,296
If you're talking nonsense like that,

727
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,507
I guess you're doing
better than I thought.

728
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:49,385
Jeez.

729
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,847
Remember Kim Jin-su?
The one who joined the company with us?

730
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,057
Yeah. He lived
in the neighborhood next to yours.

731
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:57,560
I ran into him in the parking lot,
and he walked right past me.

732
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,728
Wow. What a piece of crap.

733
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:01,605
You took him out so many times.

734
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:03,774
It was all for nothing, I guess.

735
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:12,825
I tried so hard

736
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:15,035
to live well, but damn.

737
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:17,997
It disappeared just like that.

738
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,377
Are you quitting?

739
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:24,336
Yeah.

740
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:28,048
I got called to the chairman's office
the moment I got to work.

741
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:29,758
I leave at the end of the month.

742
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:31,552
Me too.

743
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,930
Why do our start and end dates
have to be the same?

744
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:37,892
Don't lump us together.
I worked my way up to executive director.

745
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,894
Unlike someone
who just stayed assistant manager.

746
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,687
Shut up, you jerk.

747
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:48,986
I did think about you a lot today.

748
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:52,198
It's only been half a day,

749
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,325
and I feel so helpless.

750
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,160
I couldn't imagine how you survived

751
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:58,746
that whole time.

752
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:00,873
And I felt so bad.

753
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:04,001
Don't apologize.

754
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:07,379
You're so pathetic right now
that I might end up accepting it.

755
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:09,673
I wasn't planning on it anyway.

756
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:13,969
Later on, down the line,

757
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,555
I'll call you one time.

758
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:20,267
Once I really make my own life.

759
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:23,562
When I feel unashamed and proud of myself,

760
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:25,606
instead of seeking others' approval…

761
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:29,568
I'll apologize then.

762
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,864
Don't forgive me.
Just congratulate me.

763
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:50,464
I won't block you.

764
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,259
But don't take too long.

765
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:57,137
Don't die before I call you.
Stop drinking so much.

766
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,974
Don't make me beat you up.

767
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,357
Oh man.

768
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:32,256
What's with the sun stick?
The sun's gone down already.

769
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:36,051
I'm pretending that I'm a female lead
in a K-drama today.

770
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:39,013
What do you think?
Does it look soft like baby skin?

771
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:39,972
Well…

772
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:42,808
Hold on.

773
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:45,436
Here, above your lips. Is that a mustache?

774
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,771
It's peach fuzz!

775
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:54,361
Kim Mi-kyung!

776
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:58,240
Mi-kyung! Hey!

777
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:01,994
Oh, damn it.

778
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:04,788
I've got you.

779
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:08,042
There's something I need you to tell me.

780
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,043
Open the door!

781
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:10,961
Whoa!

782
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:14,381
Okay, calm down, you freaking psycho.

783
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:16,091
The moment I heard you slept over,

784
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:18,218
it was all I could think of.

785
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:19,928
So please answer me. Please.

786
00:52:20,012 --> 00:52:21,722
Just one question.

787
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,182
Was it sweet? Or passionate?

788
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:26,602
That's two questions,
so you're disqualified.

789
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:29,647
Damn it! Jesus.

790
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,148
You're so greedy.

791
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:33,400
My God,
I'm so sick and tired of this.

792
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:37,905
Why are you alone? Where's Baek-ho?

793
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,991
He still has work to do, so he'll be late.

794
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:41,950
What's for dinner?

795
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,036
There's a party at Ms. Hong's today.

796
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,788
To celebrate Myungsu
hitting 200 kilograms.

797
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:49,500
Oh, nice! Time to stuff
my face with <i>japchae.</i>

798
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,043
Mi-kyung.

799
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:53,545
I can't breathe

800
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:55,422
because I'm so curious.

801
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:57,007
I'm dying.

802
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,552
Keep her out of my room,
and I'll give you 50,000 won.

803
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:01,845
Done. Here we go!

804
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:03,889
Wait! Whoa! Hey!

805
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,641
Damn it, not this again!

806
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,310
Dog Mi-kyung! Dog Hwan-kyung!

807
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:11,063
I'm going to make you two go extinct!

808
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,523
Hey, let go!

809
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:14,817
- Let go of me!
- Jeez Louise.

810
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:12,624
- I hope I didn't call at a bad time.
- No, I was just packing.

811
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,626
I'm moving back into my mother's place.

812
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:15,586
I see…

813
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,423
What brings you all the way here?

814
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,508
Well, I…

815
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:23,844
just wanted to say hello.

816
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,932
I guess you do care a bit
for your former roommate.

817
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:32,394
I'm okay. Don't worry.

818
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:36,398
Right…

819
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,359
I'm sorry, but if it's not urgent,
I'm going to go.

820
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:41,361
I have a lot to do.

821
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:44,573
- We'll talk later.
- To be honest…

822
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,494
I came because I was bored.

823
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,747
I wanted to talk to someone,

824
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,166
but when I looked at my contacts,

825
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,502
I realized that the only person

826
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:58,712
I could possibly consider
a friend was you.

827
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,423
Wow. Friend?

828
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:04,134
Are you kidding me?
I'm four years older than you.

829
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,095
That's not what I meant.

830
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:08,263
Of course you did.

831
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:10,766
Even when we were studying abroad,
you used to chase after me

832
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,935
and nag me every time
I came out of the shower.

833
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,978
It wasn't nagging. I was asking nicely.

834
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:17,397
Was it that hard to take
the hair out of the drain?

835
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:19,608
It's not like
there was a lot to begin with!

836
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,568
I counted them.
There were 22 strands in total.

837
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:26,073
You counted them? That's absolutely crazy.

838
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:29,159
If you want to make a point,
you need to have objective data…

839
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:36,166
I'm not wrong.

840
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:40,212
Just admit it. You're crazy.

841
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:41,630
Back then, sure.

842
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:47,010
Not just back then.

843
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:48,554
Ugh.

844
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:51,849
- I'm sorry.
- Oh wow.

845
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:55,519
I'm so full that I'm about to explode!

846
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,771
It's such a shame.

847
00:55:57,855 --> 00:56:00,399
If Ms. Hong had some connections
when she was younger,

848
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,276
she could've been a chef
at the Blue House.

849
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,570
It's still not too late!

850
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:06,905
You do whatever you want, Ms. Hong.

851
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:08,991
Life starts at 80!

852
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:10,158
- At 80!
- At 80!

853
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:11,326
Yay!

854
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:14,204
Anyway, it's disappointing

855
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:16,123
that Seoul Guy couldn't be here today.

856
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:19,668
We could've gotten a picture
of him and Myungsu together.

857
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:22,880
We can see him tomorrow. It's fine.
If not, we'll see him the next day.

858
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:25,173
We all live in the same village.

859
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:27,885
Come on. Seoul Guy is a guest.

860
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:30,178
He's not going to spend
the rest of his life here.

861
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:32,848
Once his job's over,
he'll go back to Seoul.

862
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:33,974
Shush.

863
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:38,395
Hey! It's Baek-ho's car.

864
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:39,479
- Yeah?
- What?

865
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:41,648
- Oh my!
- Oh my!

866
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:42,900
Seoul Guy!

867
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:48,447
Speak of the devil.

868
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:51,450
- Come.
- You're late.

869
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:53,535
- Come on, come on.
- Hurry up.

870
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:56,663
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

871
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:58,415
What took you so long?

872
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:02,252
- Where have you been?
- Seoul Guy!

873
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:03,462
- Did you eat?
- Oh my.

874
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:06,965
This is yours!

875
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:09,885
- It's delicious.
- We're stuffed.

876
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:12,471
Goodness.

877
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:13,430
There he is.

878
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:16,558
- You should have some dinner.
- We missed you.

879
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:19,645
- Where did you go?
- My goodness.

880
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:47,673
Ta-da! Welcome!

881
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,970
It's fine. Go inside.

882
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:54,930
Go sleep.

883
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:08,193
Nice to meet you.

884
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,903
It's been exactly 12 hours

885
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:12,280
since you said you wouldn't need my help.

886
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:14,449
Wait a minute! What are you doing?

887
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:15,993
What are you doing right now?

888
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:17,619
- Come here.
- You!

889
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:20,747
Take that! You!

890
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:29,798
Damn it.

891
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,717
Damn it.

892
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:32,718
Oh my gosh!

893
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:34,261
Can you forgive me now?

894
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,513
No! Go away!

895
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,163
Ms. Wang, it's Director So…

896
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,208
It's Baek-ho.

897
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:13,550
Baek-ho.

898
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:16,762
When are you going back to Seoul?

899
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:22,100
I just realized that I never asked you

900
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:24,311
because I was so wrapped up
in my own stuff.

901
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:28,523
I mean,

902
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:30,817
obviously, you have to go back.

903
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:32,694
Your house and job are both there.

904
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:35,197
Besides, Seoul and Pyeongwon
aren't that far apart.

905
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,240
It's not that much
of a long-distance relationship.

906
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:39,576
There are trains and highways.

907
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,203
- Mi-kyung.
- Just to be clear.

908
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:42,913
I'm not pressuring you at all.

909
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:45,874
You can go whenever you want.
You know what? You can go today.

910
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,876
Should I help you pack?

911
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:48,877
Relax.

912
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,630
I've got a question too.

913
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:08,647
Would you be okay…

914
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:11,233
with an unemployed boyfriend?

915
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:14,152
- What?
- So…

916
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,572
I just quit my job about ten minutes ago.

917
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:19,908
- What?
- So I'm asking

918
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:22,244
whether you're okay
with an unemployed boyfriend

919
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:24,287
living next door.

920
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:27,082
What?

921
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:28,667
I'll take that as a yes.

922
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:37,926
What did you do, So Baek-ho?

923
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:41,263
POTATO LAB

924
01:00:43,932 --> 01:00:45,058
Are you not going in?

925
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:48,687
I'm debating

926
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:51,857
if I should play "Time to Say Goodbye"

927
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:56,027
as we both walk into the lab right now.

928
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,948
You still have something to say?
You yelled at me all night.

929
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:04,452
You distracted me every time
I was saying something important!

930
01:01:04,536 --> 01:01:05,620
I still can't believe

931
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:08,874
that you made such an impulsive decision.

932
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:10,709
I understand that you like me,

933
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:13,044
but did you give no thought
to your future?

934
01:01:13,587 --> 01:01:16,256
How could you quit your job,
just like that?

935
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:19,467
You also insisted on leaving voluntarily
a few days ago.

936
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:22,345
Hey! I get paid peanuts.

937
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:24,806
You can live without peanuts.

938
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:27,100
But what about you?
Can you live without your salary?

939
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:30,228
Do you think you can just live
by foraging in the mountains

940
01:01:30,312 --> 01:01:32,230
for mushrooms and vegetables?

941
01:01:32,314 --> 01:01:34,774
Do you know how many
poisonous mushrooms there are?

942
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:36,651
- I'll go first, then.
- Hey!

943
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:38,445
I'm not done talking.

944
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:40,322
Close it.

945
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,493
And what if you get sick? What then?

946
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:48,455
Do you have insurance?
How are you going to pay for that?

947
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:52,042
If you live like this,
you're going to end up like Hwan-kyung.

948
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,960
- Oh, that's not bad.
- What?

949
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:55,503
What do you mean, it's not bad?

950
01:01:55,587 --> 01:01:57,756
He washes wet wipes
to use more than once.

951
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:00,550
For heaven's sake.

952
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:02,302
Done?

953
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:04,095
Done.

954
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:16,900
What are you doing?

955
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:19,152
Ms. Kim. Listen carefully.

956
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:22,739
We have two very important
and urgent clues.

957
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:25,533
One, when Hee-dong
went to the Hwanggok-ri harvest,

958
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:27,869
he got bit on the wrist by a dog there.

959
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:28,870
What about it?

960
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:30,997
And two, just now, Hee-dong announced

961
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:33,959
that he obtained the remaining

962
01:02:34,626 --> 01:02:36,378
emergency purchase amount of 350 tons.

963
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:37,671
What?

964
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:38,838
350…

965
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:41,549
- How is that possible?
- It's not!

966
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:44,886
Therefore, he's been struck
by a case of rabies.

967
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:47,264
The person standing there
isn't Kwon Hee-dong.

968
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:50,558
How can I put it?
It's wearing Hee-dong's skin,

969
01:02:50,642 --> 01:02:54,020
but it's actually
a lunatic dog-beast! Argh!

970
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:57,065
The probability of transmitting
rabies between humans is very low.

971
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:58,525
So why are you afraid?

972
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,151
- Because it's scary!
- Because it's scary!

973
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:03,029
- All right, Hee-dong.
- Whoa, whoa.

974
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:07,284
Hee-dong, let's break down
the details a little bit more.

975
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:11,538
It's been less than six months
since you came to our lab, right?

976
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:12,497
Yes.

977
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,416
Good. Then,

978
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:17,919
you don't have connections
or any way to get information. Right?

979
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:19,337
Right.

980
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:21,298
Exactly. Then the final point.

981
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:23,925
How did newbie employee Kwon Hee-dong

982
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:26,594
manage to get his hands on 350 tons

983
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:28,430
of potatoes overnight?

984
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:32,225
Did it really happen in real life?

985
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:33,184
It's true.

986
01:03:33,268 --> 01:03:36,021
I was on the phone with my dad
and mentioned the situation,

987
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:38,565
and he said he'd look into it.
And he just texted me.

988
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,358
- What?
- Come on.

989
01:03:40,442 --> 01:03:43,737
You said your father
was a farmer back home.

990
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,196
- Yeah.
- So how could he

991
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,824
manage to procure
that many potatoes in a few hours?

992
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:49,576
Even our lab couldn't do it.

993
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,161
My dad has a lot of friends.

994
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:53,371
He's the president
of the Korean Farmers' Association.

995
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:54,706
- What?
- What?

996
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:56,833
- Should I show you?
- What?

997
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,126
Wait, hold on.

998
01:03:58,209 --> 01:04:02,756
Mr. Kwon. Then, your father,

999
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:05,759
the president of the Korean
Farmers' Association…

1000
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:09,846
is he Mr. Kwon Bong-su?

1001
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:10,930
Yes, that's right.

1002
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:12,140
- What?
- What?

1003
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:14,809
- What?
- Wait, hold on.

1004
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:17,270
Then the president
of the Korean Fruit Growers' Association,

1005
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:19,898
Ms. Oh Kyung-ja, is--

1006
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:21,858
- How do you know my mom?
- What?

1007
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:24,944
Wow, I'm getting chills.

1008
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:26,363
- You!
- Wait a minute.

1009
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:27,614
My dad said

1010
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:30,408
the deliveries to the Chungnam factory
will begin this afternoon,

1011
01:04:30,492 --> 01:04:31,534
so please let them know.

1012
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:33,995
I have to finish my daily log.

1013
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:40,752
The biggest silver spoon
of Korean agriculture…

1014
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:43,338
was right by our side this whole time?

1015
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:46,132
Good work, everyone!

1016
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:49,636
The Emergency Purchase Committee
is now dissolved.

1017
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:52,180
Yay! Good work, everyone!

1018
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:53,431
Mr. Bu!

1019
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:58,353
Think about staying here forever, okay?

1020
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,146
My goodness!

1021
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:02,148
- Never could I have imagined…
- Yay!

1022
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:05,902
- Wow.
- I'm so amazed.

1023
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:07,612
- Wow!
- Yay, Hee-dong!

1024
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:12,992
I raised him, really! My Hee-dong!

1025
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:14,077
Yes.

1026
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:16,037
I see.

1027
01:05:16,121 --> 01:05:17,205
Goodbye.

1028
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:21,835
What happened?

1029
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:23,878
Is something wrong?

1030
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:28,842
Mi-kyung.

1031
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:30,468
The RDA.

1032
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,304
The Rural Development Administration?

1033
01:05:37,225 --> 01:05:40,019
They received my potatoes via Mr. Hong.

1034
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,940
They said they're interested.

1035
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:45,942
They want to see me.

1036
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:51,030
They said my "Mi-kyung" potatoes

1037
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:52,615
have potential.

1038
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:00,874
Congratulations.

1039
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:02,542
That's wonderful.

1040
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:08,298
Why are you crying? It's good news.

1041
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:11,509
I don't know. I can't stop crying.

1042
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:33,114
POTATOES SAVE THE WORLD!

1043
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:36,284
Tomorrow, 10:00 a.m. The RDA.

1044
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:37,994
Got it.

1045
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:39,787
I'll show you who's boss.

1046
01:06:51,299 --> 01:06:52,383
Gosh!

1047
01:06:52,467 --> 01:06:54,302
Give them all you got, Kim Mi-kyung.

1048
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:07,315
3 YEARS LATER

1049
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:13,905
MY BELOVED PRINCESS

1050
01:07:36,928 --> 01:07:39,222
Oh, what is life…

1051
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,851
I should just drop everything and quit.

1052
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:56,030
Damn it. What do I do now?

1053
01:07:57,031 --> 01:08:00,410
My life of freedom is over!

1054
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:02,120
Don't cry.

1055
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:03,246
Honeybun.

1056
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:06,249
How can I not cry?
I can't drink a drop anymore!

1057
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:10,378
What's with the ruckus this early in the…

1058
01:08:22,557 --> 01:08:25,059
Hold on. Mi-kyung. It's not that.

1059
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:26,185
It really isn't!

1060
01:08:26,728 --> 01:08:28,605
Kim Hwan-kyung, you crazy bastard.

1061
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:33,568
Wow.

1062
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,324
You careless moron!

1063
01:08:39,407 --> 01:08:42,160
You should have been extra careful
every single time!

1064
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:44,287
How dare you mess up Ong-ju's life?

1065
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,623
She's not even 40 yet! She's in her prime!

1066
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:48,708
- Mi-kyung.
- You're getting it wrong.

1067
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,710
That has nothing to do with me.

1068
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:53,046
Now you're denying your own child?

1069
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:54,297
God damn.

1070
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,090
You're one trashy piece of shit.

1071
01:08:56,174 --> 01:08:58,301
Come over here! Go die, you bastard!

1072
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:00,720
Just go and die. Die!

1073
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:03,681
I'll adopt my niece or nephew
and raise them myself.

1074
01:09:03,765 --> 01:09:06,309
But you're going to disappear
without a trace, you asshole!

1075
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:07,727
Get over here, you asshole!

1076
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:09,020
Go die, you bastard!

1077
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:10,480
I have fatty liver disease!

1078
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,106
What?

1079
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:13,191
Ow.

1080
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:17,278
I got a physical.
This is my liver ultrasound.

1081
01:09:17,785 --> 01:09:19,656
I have freaking fatty liver disease.

1082
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:23,117
I have to quit alcohol,
sodas, and fried chicken.

1083
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:25,703
But if I'm going
to stop eating all of that,

1084
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:28,873
I might as well just die.

1085
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:30,333
Damn.

1086
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:34,629
How am I going to live now?

1087
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:37,090
See? I did nothing wrong.

1088
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:40,843
What?

1089
01:09:40,927 --> 01:09:42,553
How could you say that?

1090
01:09:42,637 --> 01:09:45,473
You! What did you do while your girlfriend

1091
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:47,558
got fatty liver disease, huh?
Get over here, you ass.

1092
01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:49,102
- Get over here!
- Ow!

1093
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:52,313
- I told you not to indulge her, didn't I?
- What am I going to do now?

1094
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:54,357
- Ow!
- I told you!

1095
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,900
Get over here!

1096
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:59,028
Shall we head inside then?

1097
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:05,159
That's enough! Stop crying!

1098
01:10:05,243 --> 01:10:08,830
Girl, get off the booze!

1099
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,212
It seems like the guests inside…

1100
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:19,590
are watching an action movie.

1101
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:21,259
We can't interrupt them,

1102
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:23,803
so unfortunately,
this is the end of today's tour.

1103
01:10:24,846 --> 01:10:25,763
Here you go.

1104
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,433
Give me a call any time.

1105
01:10:28,516 --> 01:10:31,394
We are available for reservations
and pick-up 24/7.

1106
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:32,520
So this says

1107
01:10:32,603 --> 01:10:35,773
Vice Supervisor
of Daeseolryeong Potato Crop Team.

1108
01:10:35,857 --> 01:10:38,609
This one says Youngeul-ri's
Youth Association President.

1109
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:41,237
Well…

1110
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,823
- I apologize.
- No worries.

1111
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:44,782
I apologize.

1112
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:53,291
Here we are. There you go.

1113
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:57,754
I'm the CFO of USB Guesthouse,
So Baek-ho.

1114
01:10:57,837 --> 01:11:00,590
I have three jobs, you see.

1115
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:06,345
Mr. So! The toilet's not flushing!

1116
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:07,305
Got it!

1117
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:09,474
Excuse me.

1118
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:21,486
I told you

1119
01:11:21,569 --> 01:11:23,946
to keep it down
when we have guests touring.

1120
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:25,490
Oh gosh.

1121
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:27,950
Well, the situation called for it.

1122
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:29,494
It was important.

1123
01:11:29,577 --> 01:11:31,913
What's more important
than the family business?

1124
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:35,333
We keep getting bad reviews suggesting

1125
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:37,835
that a wanted criminal
may be hiding in our guesthouse

1126
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:39,879
due to your frequent swearing and yelling.

1127
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:44,967
Drive safely today.

1128
01:11:45,051 --> 01:11:46,260
No goodbye kiss for you.

1129
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:50,890
That's harsh.
I barely get to see you these days.

1130
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,850
No one told you to be so busy.

1131
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:55,978
By day, you're at the lab.
At night, you're at grad school.

1132
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:57,688
There is nothing you do with me.

1133
01:11:58,898 --> 01:12:00,441
So are you upset?

1134
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:03,736
Because I always crash as soon
as I get home and never play with you?

1135
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:06,280
Don't distract me.
I'm editing the village rules.

1136
01:12:08,783 --> 01:12:10,535
And what if I do? What will you do?

1137
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:11,953
Come on.

1138
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:17,124
What are you going to do about it?

1139
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:18,709
Kim Mi-kyung!

1140
01:12:18,793 --> 01:12:20,711
Yay, my plan worked!

1141
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:25,675
Take the day off.

1142
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:28,970
Oh. I can't do that.

1143
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:32,223
I have an important meeting today.

1144
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:33,683
Then skip class.

1145
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:36,644
I have a group project presentation.

1146
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:39,272
Wait! I can be late.

1147
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:41,566
I can be late.

1148
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:44,068
By how much?

1149
01:12:44,986 --> 01:12:46,320
Well…

1150
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:47,822
maybe 30 minutes?

1151
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,910
Whoa! Wait! Hold on!

1152
01:12:52,994 --> 01:12:54,287
Excuse me!

1153
01:12:56,998 --> 01:12:58,916
Oh my gosh!

1154
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,836
POTATO LAB CHIEF

1155
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:04,255
BU JAE-JOONG

1156
01:13:06,173 --> 01:13:09,343
Gosh, this room is so nice.

1157
01:13:09,427 --> 01:13:11,220
It's pleasant.

1158
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:13,264
Even the temperature is perfect.

1159
01:13:15,433 --> 01:13:17,977
I'm going to take a little nap. Okay?

1160
01:13:18,978 --> 01:13:21,647
The chief's office isn't your bedroom.

1161
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:23,774
Why are you always lying on my sofa?

1162
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:25,902
If you became chief
by a series of fortunate events,

1163
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:28,779
you should live as generously
as the yield from a full potato field.

1164
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:31,198
You're so strict sometimes.

1165
01:13:31,282 --> 01:13:33,200
What do you mean by fortunate?

1166
01:13:33,284 --> 01:13:34,952
The former chief ran away,

1167
01:13:35,036 --> 01:13:37,997
and I achieved this position
fair and square with my skills…

1168
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:42,335
Why, I ought to…

1169
01:13:44,879 --> 01:13:49,300
One day, I'll show you
how charismatic a boss I can be.

1170
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:52,720
How dare you be disrespectful
to the chief.

1171
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:00,978
Hello, this is Chief

1172
01:14:01,562 --> 01:14:03,147
Bu Jae-joong speaking.

1173
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:04,315
GENERAL MANAGER
JU SEUNG-HEE

1174
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:06,150
- People say you look alike.
- Accept it, man.

1175
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:07,735
- Accept what?
- But here's the thing--

1176
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:09,028
- Hello!
- Hey.

1177
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:10,112
Hello.

1178
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:11,197
- Hello.
- Hey.

1179
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,575
I don't think

1180
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:16,243
I'm cut out to be a chief.

1181
01:14:16,327 --> 01:14:17,286
- What?
- Why?

1182
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:20,373
Did they insist on wanting to talk
to the chief, not the "vice" chief?

1183
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,333
- Yeah.
- I mean,

1184
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:25,127
the name Bu is not fit to be
near any powerful title.

1185
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:27,672
Not when "Bu" sounds like "vice"
in Korean.

1186
01:14:27,755 --> 01:14:30,633
Even if you start your own company,
people will just hear "vice" president.

1187
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:33,719
If you become the chairman,
you'll still be "vice" chairman.

1188
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:36,764
- That's what I'm saying.
- What am I supposed to do?

1189
01:14:36,847 --> 01:14:37,848
Goodness.

1190
01:14:37,932 --> 01:14:39,809
I can't go back to general manager.

1191
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:44,146
Then don't. Do something
with "Bu" and be a "Bubuzela."

1192
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:46,148
Bu-bu.

1193
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:48,859
- Want to come closer?
- No.

1194
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:50,903
My goodness.

1195
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:52,571
Let's go.

1196
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:53,864
- Sure.
- Hey.

1197
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:55,408
- Hold on.
- What?

1198
01:14:59,537 --> 01:15:01,122
Call 911. Got to call 911…

1199
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:06,585
What are you doing?

1200
01:15:07,294 --> 01:15:08,421
Thank goodness.

1201
01:15:09,964 --> 01:15:11,257
I'm not that old.

1202
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:13,092
I'm sorry.

1203
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:14,969
But it's good to be careful. Right?

1204
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:16,470
- Yes, right.
- You scared him!

1205
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:18,055
You scared me.

1206
01:15:18,139 --> 01:15:19,473
Is everything ready?

1207
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:21,726
- Yes, Ms. Ju.
- Everything is set up.

1208
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:24,145
Don't lose focus.
Pull yourselves together.

1209
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:25,688
Or they'll rob you blind.

1210
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:26,772
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

1211
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:30,359
Does he faint often?

1212
01:15:30,443 --> 01:15:31,444
Occasionally.

1213
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:37,616
NEW POTATO VARIETY
MAROO PRESENTATION

1214
01:15:42,163 --> 01:15:44,832
- I guess they're not coming today.
- Excuse me, Mr. Kwon.

1215
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:48,961
Does Mr. Bu and everyone come
to see the presentation every time?

1216
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:51,213
No, usually it's just two or three people.

1217
01:15:51,297 --> 01:15:52,965
I see… what?

1218
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:54,592
Then why are they here today--

1219
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:56,927
Oh, right. Today's your first time.

1220
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:00,806
Yes, thank you so very much, everyone!

1221
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:04,769
I hope you enjoyed the introduction video
of our potato lab.

1222
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:10,649
Next, we will be introducing

1223
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:13,652
the pride of Wonhan Retail Potato Lab,

1224
01:16:13,736 --> 01:16:15,112
the new potato variety,

1225
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:17,323
Maroo!

1226
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,492
Please give a loud round of applause--

1227
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:20,659
Wait a minute!

1228
01:16:37,802 --> 01:16:39,303
You're here.

1229
01:16:39,386 --> 01:16:41,138
- Supervisor Kim.
- Sorry we're late.

1230
01:16:41,222 --> 01:16:43,599
As you all know, I work
as an honorary researcher

1231
01:16:43,682 --> 01:16:47,394
at the Rural Development Administration's
Highland Agriculture Research Institute,

1232
01:16:47,478 --> 01:16:51,273
and at night, I'm a Potato major
at Pyeongwon University of Agriculture,

1233
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:52,942
making me a potato professional.

1234
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:56,195
A potato career woman, if you will.

1235
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:00,241
Goodness' sake.

1236
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:04,829
Let's begin, shall we?

1237
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:09,375
It's been a while.

1238
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:13,796
She's like the president or something.

1239
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:14,755
This is war.

1240
01:17:15,714 --> 01:17:19,385
- They practiced that, didn't they?
- I'm 100% sure. No, make that 1000%.

1241
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:21,887
What brought together two people

1242
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:23,889
who are equally crazy?

1243
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,392
That's why they suit each other.

1244
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,936
They'll live like that
until their last breath.

1245
01:17:29,019 --> 01:17:30,396
MAROO

1246
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:33,774
Chung-hyeon.
Those psychic dreams you have,

1247
01:17:33,858 --> 01:17:36,694
did you have any more regarding us?

1248
01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:38,529
Who might be the next chief, for example.

1249
01:17:38,612 --> 01:17:41,866
I don't know about the next chief,
but I know the next minister.

1250
01:17:41,949 --> 01:17:43,659
- Minister? That's random.
- Yes.

1251
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:45,327
Ms. Jang.

1252
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:48,622
You become the Minister of Agriculture,
Food, and Rural Affairs, in 22 years.

1253
01:17:48,706 --> 01:17:50,332
- She does?
- I do?

1254
01:18:06,599 --> 01:18:07,683
Hello.

1255
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:10,477
I'm Chief Bu Jae-joong

1256
01:18:10,561 --> 01:18:13,022
of Wonhan Retail's Potato Lab.

1257
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:20,404
Everyone, today I'm here

1258
01:18:21,071 --> 01:18:22,948
not to introduce a potato.

1259
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:26,827
I'm here to guarantee,
with my 30 years of research…

1260
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:27,995
no,

1261
01:18:28,078 --> 01:18:30,789
with my whole life,

1262
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:33,834
the new potato variety, Maroo!

1263
01:18:33,918 --> 01:18:37,796
Your bright new future with Maroo--

1264
01:18:40,507 --> 01:18:41,634
- Hey
- What?

1265
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:43,928
- What's happening--
- Hold on a second, please.

1266
01:18:44,011 --> 01:18:45,054
Hold on.

1267
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:46,847
- Did you touch this?
- No, I didn't.

1268
01:18:46,931 --> 01:18:48,098
I'm sorry.

1269
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:51,018
The future's become dark. Just a minute.

1270
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:56,565
- A short explanation on Maroo.
- Sure.

1271
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:59,818
It details how well it grows in comparison

1272
01:18:59,902 --> 01:19:03,072
to other potato varieties,
so please take a look.

1273
01:19:03,614 --> 01:19:04,490
Hold.

1274
01:19:05,366 --> 01:19:07,701
These documents have very poor readability

1275
01:19:07,785 --> 01:19:09,495
for elderly farmers.

1276
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:12,331
I seem to remember
that I specifically told you last year

1277
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:14,333
to increase font size and spacing

1278
01:19:15,084 --> 01:19:16,919
and to use a clean Korean Gothic font.

1279
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:18,045
Okay, so…

1280
01:19:18,545 --> 01:19:20,172
we made the font size 16--

1281
01:19:20,256 --> 01:19:22,299
That's not the only problem here.

1282
01:19:22,383 --> 01:19:25,052
You're still using 90 gram papers

1283
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:26,929
and still purchasing brand name water

1284
01:19:27,888 --> 01:19:29,765
instead of a cheaper off-brand product.

1285
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:33,018
I can't help but suspect
that all of you are spending excessively.

1286
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:34,603
Please be mindful of the fact

1287
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:36,855
that Wonhan Retail's net revenue

1288
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:39,149
has been decreasing
for the past three years.

1289
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:41,277
That's all.

1290
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:50,202
- Well done!
- Go, go!

1291
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,831
Is he the leader of some potato cult?

1292
01:19:53,914 --> 01:19:56,875
- They clap every time he breathes.
- Right. Yes, next time

1293
01:19:56,959 --> 01:19:59,211
we'll boil tap water and cool it.

1294
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:02,298
So please stop worrying
about our expenses.

1295
01:20:02,381 --> 01:20:06,302
Now let's really talk about Maroo.

1296
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:11,181
You have to be joking, Mi-kyung.

1297
01:20:14,268 --> 01:20:16,145
Supervisor Kim.

1298
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:19,565
Did you have a question?

1299
01:20:21,275 --> 01:20:22,484
All…

1300
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:24,862
the data about Maroo

1301
01:20:25,696 --> 01:20:28,407
is in here.

1302
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:30,993
So why drag it out?

1303
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:33,037
The most important issue on the table

1304
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,122
is the cultivation contract

1305
01:20:35,205 --> 01:20:37,124
with our Daeseolryeong Crop Team.

1306
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:39,043
- That's right.
- She's right.

1307
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:43,213
How much are you proposing?

1308
01:20:49,136 --> 01:20:50,554
- 1,200.
- 1,200.

1309
01:20:57,019 --> 01:20:58,812
- 1,200 won.
- 1,400 won.

1310
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:02,483
- 1,250 won.
- 1,400 won.

1311
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,862
- 1,280 won.
- 1,400 won.

1312
01:21:10,991 --> 01:21:13,035
I'll change a digit in the middle.

1313
01:21:15,746 --> 01:21:17,247
1,320 won.

1314
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:19,750
1,400 won.

1315
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:23,087
One thousand three…

1316
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:25,381
Forget it! No deal! That's it!

1317
01:21:25,464 --> 01:21:26,632
Mr. Bu!

1318
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:29,718
Mi-kyung alone is already too much,

1319
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:31,428
but a double attack with So Baek-ho?

1320
01:21:31,512 --> 01:21:33,138
How can I win against them?

1321
01:21:33,222 --> 01:21:35,516
We're done making potato chips!
Just shut the factory down!

1322
01:21:35,599 --> 01:21:36,600
Goodness me.

1323
01:21:43,357 --> 01:21:46,485
- How could you repay me like this?
- Everyone! We apologize!

1324
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:48,404
Our chief's blood pressure is spiking,

1325
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:50,447
so we'll wrap up the presentation here.

1326
01:21:52,032 --> 01:21:53,409
Don't be ridiculous.

1327
01:21:58,705 --> 01:21:59,748
No.

1328
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:01,417
Please continue.

1329
01:22:08,799 --> 01:22:10,008
We are not…

1330
01:22:13,303 --> 01:22:14,638
- done yet.
- Done yet.

1331
01:22:17,975 --> 01:22:18,934
What are you doing?

1332
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:21,311
Goodness gracious.

1333
01:22:21,395 --> 01:22:22,688
What are you doing?

1334
01:23:28,504 --> 01:23:30,504
