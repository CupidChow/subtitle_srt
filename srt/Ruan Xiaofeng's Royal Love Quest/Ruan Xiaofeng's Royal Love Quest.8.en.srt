=Ruan Xiaofeng's Royal Love Quest=

2
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,900
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,240
So me showing my face
in public is disgraceful,

4
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,530
But Aunt keeping musicians
and male performers...

5
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,050
What does that count as?

6
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,530
Insolence!

7
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,889
Your Highness! My little sister
speaks without restraint.

8
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,139
It is my failure
in teaching her properly.

9
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,289
Moreover, recently,

10
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,920
she even hit her head.

11
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:06,619
I beg Your Highness,

12
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,259
for the sake of my service
on the battlefield,

13
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,130
please do not hold this against her.

14
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,770
I apologize
to Your Highness on her behalf.

15
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,970
I am the legitimate eldest daughter
of the Grand Emperor.

16
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,560
Even the late Emperor
had to respect me as his elder sister.

17
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,610
And yet, all of you,

18
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,320
dare to be so insolent.

19
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,600
Do you still acknowledge
the law and order of the land?

20
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,059
Since Aunt speaks
so much of royal authority

21
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,520
and law and order,

22
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,000
then allow me to debate with you.

23
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,080
Your Majesty, please judge fairly.

24
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,160
Today, I did not
stir up trouble for no reason.

25
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,369
It was those musicians

26
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,970
who spread falsehoods in public,

27
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,210
claiming that my mother died
because of political scheming.

28
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,800
I only acted to set things right.

29
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,770
Aunt came to accuse me,

30
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,080
yet your own conduct
is hardly above reproach.

31
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,520
If Yeyang Pavilion belongs to Aunt,

32
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,850
how could such slanderous gossip
be spread there?

33
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,139
Shouldn't Aunt also be punished

34
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,840
for failing to maintain discipline?

35
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:16,010
Falsehoods are slander.

36
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,730
But I only spoke the truth.

37
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,050
That does not count as deception.

38
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,259
What do you mean?

39
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,610
Princess Luyang.

40
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,730
The death of Lady Wan
has always been a sore spot for Lord Ling.

41
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,050
Your Majesty,
why continue to keep it from him?

42
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,640
Say no more!

43
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,010
Continue.

44
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,770
Aunt, please continue.

45
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,609
On the day of Lord Ling's wedding,

46
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,640
he hid in the study,
refusing to come out.

47
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,400
Of course, he had no idea
what happened in the main hall.

48
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,210
That day,
the late Emperor was gravely ill.

49
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,920
The Crown Prince
was handling state affairs.

50
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,729
I wonder what's taking Rui so long.

51
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,210
I will go check on him first.

52
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,210
Everyone, please enjoy
the refreshments I have prepared.

53
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,120
As expected of the desserts
from Lady Wan's palace.

54
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,120
Even a bowl of sweet dumplings
is presented so exquisitely.

55
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,640
After the Crown Prince ate
the sweet dumplings prepared by Lady Wan,

56
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,240
he nearly choked to death.

57
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,610
Fortunately, the imperial physicians
arrived in time.

58
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,730
They saved His Majesty's life.

59
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,170
Even if those dumplings
were prepared by my mother,

60
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,080
that does not prove she poisoned them.

61
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,889
But on that very day, your mother,

62
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,770
fell from Bixiao Tower.

63
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,800
Even her personal maid
disappeared without a trace.

64
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,890
The truth is clear.

65
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,010
Everyone knows it in their hearts.

66
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,360
The late Emperor had few heirs.

67
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,329
Among those who survived to adulthood,

68
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,120
only you and the Crown Prince remained.

69
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,210
If the Crown Prince were killed,

70
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:14,659
who would benefit?

71
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,770
Naturally, Lady Wan and her faction.

72
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,400
And when the plot was exposed,

73
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,930
your mother

74
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,600
had no choice
but to fall from Bixiao Tower.

75
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,690
My mother never spoke
of vying for the throne to me.

76
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,130
Lady Wan
held the Emperor's favour for years.

77
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,080
She secretly gathered allies.

78
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,010
To say she had no ambitions for power

79
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,480
would be difficult
for anyone to believe.

80
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,810
Impossible.

81
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,689
My mother would never

82
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,210
do such a thing.

83
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,160
Why are you laughing?

84
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:56,890
Xiaofeng.

85
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,600
There are no witnesses, no evidence.

86
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,729
Aunt is merely making assumptions.

87
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:02,890
How can that be proof?

88
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,539
Who's to say Aunt isn't the one

89
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,779
framing her instead?

90
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,890
This is not just my assumption.

91
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,250
It is what everyone knows to be true.

92
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,280
Your Highness.

93
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,640
I am but an outsider.

94
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,210
When it comes to palace matters,

95
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,040
I dare not speak recklessly.

96
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,640
No matter the truth,

97
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,130
Lady Wan cannot be brought back to life.

98
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,520
If we pursue this further,

99
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,280
it will not only damage
the royal family's reputation,

100
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,010
but it will also implicate you, Rui.

101
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,890
If the truth is as Aunt claims,

102
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,520
would that not make you
the son of a criminal?

103
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,370
How would you live with that?

104
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,960
All these years,

105
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,370
I forbade you
from investigating this matter.

106
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,210
This is why.

107
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,840
Your Majesty...

108
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,810
So you believe

109
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,489
my mother truly sought rebellion.

110
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,840
Lady Wan did all this for you.

111
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,040
In the end, she was merely
a concubine who got drunk and fell.

112
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,010
And that was the end of it.

113
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,450
As for today's incident,

114
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,960
both Aunt and Rui are at fault.

115
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,210
I...

116
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,419
find myself in a difficult position.

117
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,330
Your Majesty!

118
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,929
Lord Ling is so stubborn
and unrepentant.

119
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,899
He must be sent to the ancestral tombs

120
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,040
to properly temper his temperament.

121
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,930
Your Majesty, I have a suggestion.

122
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,609
Xiaofeng! The ministers
are discussing state matters.

123
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,770
A mere girl like you
should not speak out of turn.

124
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,770
Let her speak.

125
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,659
Since this matter

126
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,979
took place in the Eastern Market,

127
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,579
why not settle it

128
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,370
the way they do at the teahouses?

129
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,450
Explain.

130
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,369
In the Eastern Market,

131
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,249
if there's a dispute
with no clear right or wrong,

132
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,579
they settle it
with a competition of skill.

133
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,130
The victor determines justice.

134
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,979
So, I humbly request Your Majesty

135
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,480
to allow a competition
between our two teahouses.

136
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,280
If we lose,

137
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,370
then we will accept Aunt's punishment.

138
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,810
But if we win,

139
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,249
then Aunt must pay

140
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,369
the price for her words.

141
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:14,169
Your Majesty.
How can this be treated as a joke?

142
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,099
This was a minor dispute

143
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,579
to begin with.

144
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,169
What's wrong with settling it this way?

145
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,400
Or is it...

146
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:21,930
Aunt is afraid?

147
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,929
The musicians of Yeyang Pavilion

148
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,890
were personally trained by me.

149
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,040
And yet you dare challenge me

150
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,890
with your pitiful skills?

151
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,450
Seeing how confident Aunt is,

152
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,720
I suppose she has nothing to fear.

153
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,000
Then we shall do as Xiaofeng suggests.

154
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,450
In three days' time,

155
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,210
two teahouses will compete.

156
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,360
And the results shall decide the matter.

157
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,769
Didn't His Majesty
send a carriage for us?

158
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,369
Why are we walking back?

159
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,570
I never told you to follow me.

160
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,600
Just like a dog biting Lü Dongbin.
Failing to recognise kindness.

161
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,050
Are you angry at Princess Luyang?

162
00:08:59,130 --> 00:08:59,930
No.

163
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,410
Then are you angry at His Majesty?

164
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,459
No.

165
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,080
Then who exactly are you mad at?

166
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,930
Fine. I won't ask anymore.

167
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,170
What is it?

168
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,360
I twisted my ankle.

169
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,410

My mother

00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,120
came from humble origins.

179
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,720
For a time, she was favoured.
