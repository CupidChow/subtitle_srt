=Ruan Xiaofeng's Royal Love Quest=

2
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,900
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,900
Where are you going?

4
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,199
If I said

5
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,150
I wanted to squeeze through this hole
and get out of here,

6
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,980
would you believe me?

7
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,380
What are you doing?

8
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,079
The Grand General is
fighting rebels out there,

9
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,080
and you're sneaking off
in the middle of the night.

10
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,359
That makes people wonder

11
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,229
if the Grand General
could be colluding with the enemy

12
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,710
and plotting rebellion.

13
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,870
If you really don't like me,

14
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,580
let's get a divorce.

15
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,990
Why do you have to frame me?

16
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,150
Divorce?

17
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,540
It means

18
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,870
repudiation.

19
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,790
What's the point of two people
torturing each other like this?

20
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,820
I can let you go,

21
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,270
but not right now.

22
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,589
In three days,

23
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,189
there'll be a Mid-Autumn
family banquet here.

24
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,540
His Majesty will attend.

25
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,100
As long as you pretend to
be my wife for that night,

26
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,540
I'll let you leave.

27
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,180
Pull me out.

28
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,750
What's wrong with you?

29
00:02:31,078 --> 00:02:32,938
My hairpin fell off.

30
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,420
(What's this?)

31
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,690
(To Princess Zhaoning)

32
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,940
Is this the one?

33
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,860
Will this work?

34
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,589
Listen,

35
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,190
don't underestimate this drug.

36
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,940
With a single drop,

37
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,470
Her Highness will...

38
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,940
Are you sure it'll work?

39
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,679
Did you forget what happened
at Bixiao Tower?

40
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,980
We've already come this far,
and now you're chickening out?

41
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,100
Wait.

42
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,420
Think about this.

43
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,959
There'll be a big turnout
at the Mid-Autumn banquet.

44
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,100
What should we do?

45
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,980
I've planned it out.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,909
We'll coat

47
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,540
the inside of her cup with this drug.

48
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,469
No one would find out

49
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,700
it was us.

50
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,399
(This jerk promised)

51
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,860
(to let me go after tomorrow night.)

52
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,350
(But the thing is,
he almost killed me once.)

53
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,070
Your Highness,

54
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,230
here's the menu for the banquet.
Please have a look.

55
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,260
Bayberry liquor?

56
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,160
It's sweet and soothing.

57
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,360
The ladies might not be able
to handle their liquor well,

58
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,200
so we replaced unfiltered rice liquor
with this.

59
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,420
All right. Let's do it this way.

60
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,510
(Got it!)

61
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,500
(When we're asked to drink at the banquet,
he'll definitely lower his guard.)

62
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,790
(If I slip knockout powder
into his drink,)

63
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,540
(I can make my escape that night.)

64
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,180
Your Highness,
what a sight for sore eyes.

65
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,710
You too.

66
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,860
Forget it if you're not collaborating.
It's not like I want to do this.

67
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,620
Greetings, Your Majesty.

68
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,350
Greetings, Your Majesty.

69
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,300
May Your Majesty enjoy
health and longevity.

70
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,390
You may rise.

71
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,860
It's been a while.

72
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,230
Xiaofeng, you've become quite eloquent.

73
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,270
You flatter me,

74
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,950
Your Majesty.

75
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,590
Be seated.

76
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,300
Xiaofeng,

77
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,479
Rui and you have been married

78
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,100
for three whole years.

79
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,180
But why hasn't there been any news
from your stomach?

80
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,860
(Relatives of the imperial family)

81
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,470
(are also annoying.)

82
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,270
Eldest Aunt,

83
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,060
Having children

84
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,030
isn't just Xiaofeng's responsibility.

85
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,710
We're husband and wife.

86
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,470
If you must blame someone,

87
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,100
please blame me.

88
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,509
Failing in household affairs

89
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,269
is naturally women's fault.

90
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,390
A man's duty is to make achievements
for the nation.

91
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,389
Rui is considered quite accomplished
for his generation.

92
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,829
He spends his days
reciting and writing poems.

93
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,119
How elegant.

94
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,620
Unlike your useless cousin.

95
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,790
All he knows is national affairs.

96
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,189
He always claims to suppress
the southwestern rebels himself

97
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,180
and share your burden, Your Majesty.

98
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,919
Second Aunt, if he's so passionate,

99
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,599
why don't I write my brother a letter

100
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,269
and recommend him for the vanguard?

101
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,030
Although it's dangerous,

102
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,629
this will fulfill his dream

103
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,390
of dying on the battlefield.

104
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,660
What are you getting at?

105
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,879
How dare you speak insolently

106
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,660
in front of your elders?

107
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,910
Second Sister,

108
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,439
there's no need to argue
with Lord Ling and his wife.

109
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,599
Imperial Concubine Wan passed so young,

110
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,239
naturally, no one ever taught them

111
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,470
proper manners.

112
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,039
All right. That's enough.

113
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,470
It's rare for our family
to gather together.

114
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,270
Let's not bicker.

115
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,100
Rui,

116
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,420
I know you have great talents
to serve the nation.

117
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,709
If you wish to share my burden,

118
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,660
I'll entrust you with important tasks.

119
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,100
Your Majesty,

120
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,910
you know

121
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,540
that's not

122
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,660
what I'm pursuing.

123
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,710
- I...
- About that,

124
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,060
let's not bring it up again.

125
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,749
Oh, right. I've brewed new liquor.

126
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,350
Please have a taste.

127
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,500
Your Highness.

128
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,030
Try it, Your Highness.

129
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,980
Hurry.

130
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,910
This liquor

131
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,660
is quite strong.

132
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,050
(Abundant Fortune)

133
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,970
(Bixiao Tower)

134
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,239
You!

135
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,550
You scoundrel!

136
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,430
What?

137
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,620
You... You took off my clothes.

138
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,020
Your Highness.

139
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,479
It wasn't His Highness.

140
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,149
I saw you were soaked in sweat,

141
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,380
so I removed your outer coat.

142
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,100
Still, he's a scoundrel.

143
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,230
He was staring at me!

144
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,140
Are you feeling better?

145
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,590
It's just mild knockout powder.

146
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,830
Looks like you're fine.

147
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,590
You drugged me?

148
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,230
If I wanted to harm you,

149
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,500
you'd have died

150
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,350
at the banquet tonight

151
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,310
without me lifting a finger.

152
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,140
What do you mean?

153
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,860
Someone coated your cup

154
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,020
with a lethal poison.

155
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,230
If you had drunk it,

156
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,710
I'm afraid...

157
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,550
Then why did I just faint?

158
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,260
I swapped our cups.

159
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,140
The poisoned liquor

160
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,230
looked like I drank it,

161
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,140
but I poured it into my sleeve.

162
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,710
Someone's after your life.

163
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,310
First at Bixiao Tower

164
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,500
and now at the Mid-Autumn banquet.

165
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,950
(So I ended up drinking
the knockout powder I prepared.)

166
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,500
What's with that look?

167
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,980
You saved me?

168
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,140
I doubt you're that kind-hearted.

169
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,020
You planned the assassination
at Bixiao Tower.

170
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,640
- What are you talking about?
- I heard everything.

171
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,350
You and Dayuan were discussing
why I didn't die after the fall.

172
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,550
It's true that we were discussing
the accident.

173
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,839
Your Highness,

174
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,230
if I push her from here,

175
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,670
Her Highness will land right here.

176
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,900
Falling from such a height

177
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,900
doesn't even leave any scratches on her.

178
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,500
Your Highness,

179
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,470
should we

180
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,380
talk to Her Highness?

181
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,230
Not now.

182
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,980
Judging by her condition,
she does look like she forgot everything.

183
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:04,190
So that was a misunderstanding.

184
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,350
What about Yagu?

185
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,429
I saw you had Dayuan

186
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,789
bring her to the side hall.

187
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,959
Your hand was around her throat.

188
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,950
That night, I was questioning her
about the accident at Bixiao Tower.

189
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,550
Answer me.

190
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,590
Why weren't you with her

191
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,710
that night?

192
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,500
Careful!

193
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,389
Your Highness,

194
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,780
she's a mute. She can't speak.

195
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,310
But there's no need to scare her.

196
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,479
She's honest.

197
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,950
She'll tell you the truth.

198
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,020
Write it down.

199
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,550
But her throat was injured,

200
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,070
and she was badly frightened.

201
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,680
She said that Her Highness
ordered her not to follow,

202
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,260
so she went to bed early.

203
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,590
If it wasn't you,

204
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,429
who else would want me dead

205
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,070
and hurt Yagu too?
