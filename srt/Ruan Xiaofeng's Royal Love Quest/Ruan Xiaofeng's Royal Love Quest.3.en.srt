=Episode 3=

3
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,880
There's just one thing

4
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,130
I'm still confused about.

5
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,130
Why was my cup

6
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,050
drugged?

7
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,960
Could it be

8
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,680
that someone was trying to harm me?

9
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,240
Then the person must be...

10
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,289
Ruan Xiaofeng.

11
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,530
Not me!

12
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,970
Why is this with you?

13
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,560
Is this yours?

14
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,160
When did you steal it?

15
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,649
Can you speak nicely?

16
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,130
I found it.

17
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,560
If I hadn't, it would've been lost.

18
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,050
You don't even thank me.

19
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,800
What is this?

20
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,920
I've studied it for days
and still can't figure it out.

21
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,280
I don't know either.

22
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,729
You don't know?

23
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,360
Is it really yours?

24
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,050
My mother left this.

25
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,050
I heard

26
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,440
Her Highness also fell off
from Bixiao Tower.

27
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,800
We're even now.

28
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,160
You don't need to concern yourself
with anything else.

29
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,490
You must be tired. Get rest early.

30
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,040
I have other matters to attend to.

31
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,250
Your Highness.

32
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,210
About what happened earlier,

33
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,210
thank you.

34
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,680
(So it was all a misunderstanding.)

35
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,490
(Meeting you in this world)

36
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,889
(doesn't seem so bad at all.)

37
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,879
(Anti-Princess Zhaoning League)

38
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,709
(To Princess Zhaoning)

39
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:27,610
Own up. What's this all about?

40
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,640
Your Highness,

41
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,120
Guang forged this letter

42
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,680
in your handwriting.

43
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,920
The poison in the liquor

44
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,800
was also our doing.

45
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,290
Why?

46
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,040
Ever since Her Highness has married
into this household,

47
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,800
no one has had a single peaceful day.

48
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,699
That's right. Guang's stutter

49
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,889
wasn't so bad at first.

50
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,289
But Her Highness kept mocking him

51
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,769
and even humiliated him in public.

52
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,419
That's why his condition got worse.

53
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,489
And Wuyan's face.

54
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,139
She got those pockmarks

55
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,259
after using the ointment
Her Highness gave her.

56
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,769
These are your reasons?

57
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,289
Yagu had it the worst.

58
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,889
Her Highness insulted her and beat her.

59
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,770
She even poisoned her mute

60
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,890
just because she spoke
a few words more to you.

61
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,920
Ya,

62
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,400
His Highness spoke quite a lot
to you, right?

63
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,330
His Highness

64
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,890
was only asking about household affairs.

65
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,890
He barely talks to me

66
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,210
when he sees me,

67
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,490
yet he's willing to talk so much to you.

68
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,680
Your Highness,

69
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,379
I was only doing my duty.

70
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,890
I have no other intentions.

71
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,680
You've worked hard.

72
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,680
Everyone has suffered
because of Her Highness.

73
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,240
Serving a cruel mistress

74
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,450
has put you all through so much.

75
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,920
(So)

76
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,730
(this is how they see me.)

77
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,730

84
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,720
You! Let me see
how many more do you have.

85

- I... I'm out of cards.

- Show me.

(but deep down, they all hate me.)

90
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,280
What else did you do?

91
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,370
We set up traps

92
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,280
in the room.

93
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,890
We scattered soybeans
all over the floor.

94
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,609
So when she gets up at night,

95
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,640
she'll slip and fall flat on her back.

96
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,659
We also put a giant dead spider.

97
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,040
She's terrified of spiders.

What's this place? It's lively here.

113
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,080
I heard Qixia Pavilion invited
a famous figure from Jiangnan.

114
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,979
He's a master of all kinds
of performing arts.

115
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,929
That's right. His stories

116
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,369
are absolutely captivating.

117
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,659
Back then, when His Majesty
visited Jiangnan,

118
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,520
this storyteller was invited to perform.

119
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,810
Really?

120
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,859
A storyteller? Let me check it out.

122
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,520
Your Highness,

123
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,370
Her Highness left this.

125
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,480

00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,280
(I know I've made many mistakes.)

127
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,010
(I'm too ashamed to stay
in the residence.)

128
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,930
(The harm is done.)

129
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:25,080
(If I ever get the chance,
I'll make amends.)

130
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,810
You must find her.

131
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,690
There are some things

132
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,640
I need her to explain.

133
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,720
Come on in. You've been waiting.

134
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,930
A big star is indeed different.

135
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,720
Hello.

136
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,770
You must be the big star, right?

137
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,419
I didn't mean to disturb you.

138
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,289
I just never got to see a celebrity
up close before.

139
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,080
I'd like to look...

140
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,520
Are you all right?

00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,370

When Mr. Cheng finishes the meal,

146
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,690
could we...

147
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,880
Are you rushing us?

148
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,410
It's been days,

149
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,219
and we haven't seen Mr. Cheng's face.

150
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,720
As for when the performance starts,
Mr. Cheng will decide.

151
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,880
So you should just wait outside.

152
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,369
- Let's go.
- Wait.

153
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,339
It's been days.

154
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,520
- Please leave.
- Uh... I even prepared lychees for him.

155
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,960
This isn't how things should work.

156
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,410
Have you found him?

157
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,120
He's a big patron.

158
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,930
We have to give him
anything he demands.

159
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,650
Can you be professional?

160
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,690
Can you take some responsibility
for our investor?

161
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,600
Yes, sir.

162
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:21,080
You people have indeed

163
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,720
pampered Cheng Xiaolan too much.

164
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,210
As the matter stands,

165
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,360
the only way is to leave this place.

166
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,650
Go.

167
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,859
(To think that the big star here)

168
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,210
(just like all the others.)

169
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,410
Mr. Cheng, I finally got to see you.

170
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:48,729
Pardon me.

171
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,240
I... I'm not him.

172
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,059
No! I'm not him!

173
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,650
Put me down first.

174
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,240
I'm not him.

175
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,609
- No time to explain. Please help me.
- I'm not!

176
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,579
Wait, you...

177
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,330
Hear me out. I'm not!

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,939
