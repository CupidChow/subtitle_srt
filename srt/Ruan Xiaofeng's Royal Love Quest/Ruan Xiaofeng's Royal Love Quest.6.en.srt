=Ruan Xiaofeng's Royal Love Quest=

2
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,900
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,539
It's almost dark.

4
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,970
Not a single customer in sight.

5
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,539
Your Highness.

6
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,509
Something terrible has happened!

7
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,019
Speak slowly.

8
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,429
The tavern across the street
is having a promotional event.

9
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,939
Drinks are half price.

10
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:08,869
And they even invited the three
most handsome men in the capital.

11
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,500
Everyone has gone over there.

12
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,400
(Programme List)

13
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,939
(What kind of story)

14
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,090
(would bring my fans back?)

15
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,530
(Empresses in the Palace?)

16
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,500
(Story of Yanxi Palace?)

17
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,570
Who's there?

18
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,219
Your Highness?

19
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,570
Sorry, Yagu.

20
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,730
Did you see anyone just now?

21
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,970
No?

22
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,620
I keep hearing
strange noises these days.

23
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,600
It feels like
there's a thief in the pavilion.

24
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,840
You really didn't see anything?

25
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,650
No.

26
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,149
It's fine.

27
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,180
Well then, I'll leave you to it.

28
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,300
She left.

29
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,180
You have nothing to ask me?

30
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,580
I don't care.

31
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,650
You'd better not.

32
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,500
There's only one thing
you need to understand.

33
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,180
Stay away from Ruan Xiaofeng.

34
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,410
Her life belongs to me.

35
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,300
Shouldn't I be the one saying that?

36
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,930
The three
most handsome men in the capital.

37
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,689
(Spring breezes
are no match for Yang Qiong.)

38
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,280
(The only shining star is Liu Yu.)

39
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,850
Young Master.

40
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,500
Young Master Liu Yu
does not meet male guests.

41
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,900
No matter how much gold
or silver you offer, it won't work.

42
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,810
Don't misunderstand.

43
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,619
I just have a question.

44
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,500
I'd like
to seek Young Master Liu Yu's advice.

45
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,650
My master doesn't see just anyone.

46
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,060
Please leave.

47
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,020
Isn't this the star
of Qixia Pavilion, Ruan...

48
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,939
Why do I run into you everywhere?

49
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,900
Are you following me?

50
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,020
Following you?

51
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,340
What for?

52
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,490
You...

53
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,170
Then why are you here?

54
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,699
You first.

55
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,939
Why are you here?

56
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,900
Of course, to watch the performance.

57
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,780
Sneaking around in disguise?

58
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:43,020
Could it be that Qixia Pavilion
lost business to these pretty boys?

59
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,820
And you came to spy on them?

60
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,909
I'm their loyal fan.

61
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,410
Don't talk nonsense, all right?

62
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,610
Loyal fan?

63
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,610
You don't believe me?

64
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,139
Look at Liu Yu.

65
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,490
Eight feet tall,
broad shoulders, slim waist.

66
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,610
He makes all the girls swoon.

67
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,850
And look at Song Ke.

68
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,549
Every smile and frown of his...
I could just melt.

69
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,730
I wish I could marry him on the spot.

70
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,850
And Yang Qiong,

71
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,490
his voice is simply heavenly.

72
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,780
I'm dead.

73
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,819
Miss, come and catch us!

74
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,549
Don't run!

75
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,090
- Miss, over here!
- Don't run!

76
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,820
- Just let me catch you!
- Here!

77
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:43,909
Don't run!

78
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:44,939
- Let me touch you!
- Here!

79
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,469
Right here, Miss!

80
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,820
- Over here!
- Where?

81
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,290
Where? Don't move!

82
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,850
Nobody move.

83
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,020
Let me find you properly.

84
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,900
Here, right?

85
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,460
Don't move.

86
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,290
Nobody move.

87
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,650
I got you.

88
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,780
Don't move! Let me see who you are.

89
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,490
A scene like this...

90
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,050
I've seen plenty at Yeyang Pavilion.

91
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,139
A scene like this?

92
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,490
What kind of scene?

93
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,780
Well...

94
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,020
A husband catching his cheating wife.

95
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,170
Feeling unwell?

96
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,029
And in situations like this,

97
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,090
there's usually a set process.

98
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,739
First, they fly into a rage.

99
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,299
Shouting curses at the adulterers.

100
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,029
Then, they break down in tears.

101
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,530
Crying about their suffering.

102
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,739
And finally, they beg.

103
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,580
Begging you to follow her back.

104
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,059
No matter how much they struggle,

105
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,290
in the end,

106
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,940
our tavern's guards will throw them out.

107
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,170
So, dear sir,

108
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,869
I suggest you leave

109
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,379
while you still have your dignity.

110
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,410
Otherwise, don't blame us

111
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,140
for being rude.

112
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,730
Wait.

113
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,220
We are not husband and wife.

114
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,970
My dear.

115
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,220
Come home with me.

116
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,090
Li Rui, what nonsense is this?

117
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,730
What's so good about these pretty boys?

118
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,780
Are they worth trampling on
over ten years of feelings?

119
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,140
Ten years?

120
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,619
Sir, you should

121
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,499
watch your words.

122
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,410
Which one of us
are you calling a pretty boy?

123
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:45,940
My dear.

124
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,650
I forgive you.

125
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,170
Come home with me.

126
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,580
What's wrong with you? Lost your mind?

127
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:58,900
Just play along.

128
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,020
Why should I?

129
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,610
Because you're not really a loyal fan.

130
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,290
You're here on behalf
of Qixia Pavilion to spy on them.

131
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,780
I'm not.

132
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,819
Oh?

133
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,820
Then let's see
whether they believe you or me.

134
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,820
Fine.

135
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,290
What do you need me to do?

136
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,530
Just do this in a moment.

137
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,700
I don't need your forgiveness at all.

138
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,739
My dear.

139
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,580
What did I do wrong?

140
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,349
You don't understand a woman's heart.

141
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,709
I dress up for you every day.
Yet you never appreciate it.

142
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,539
You can't even tell the difference
between the fragrance I wear today

143
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,869
and the one from yesterday!

144
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,420
Because I really
can't tell the difference.

145
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,130
I don't believe you.

146
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,420
I bet these three
can't tell the difference.

147
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,709
Then you don't know
how skilled Young Master Liu Yu is.

148
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,989
One sniff is all it takes.

149
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,940
Him?

150
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:01,659
Impossible.

151
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,229
Fine, pick any girl.

152
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,709
Let Young Master Liu Yu try.

153
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,850
Me!

154
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,340
Let me!

155
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,340
Smell my fragrance.

156
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,010
No need for that.

157
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,989
Your scent is already

158
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,850
wafting through the air.

159
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,709
This fragrance has a base
of Agarwood, Aloeswood, and Musk.

160
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,869
It's a common blend sold in markets.

161
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,420
A mixture of Jia-jian incense and balm.

162
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,300
But it also contains
a hint of winter plum.

163
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,139
That's what makes the scent

164
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,660
so rich and captivating.

165
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,340
Another lady, please.

166
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,779
As you walked just now,

167
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,970
your fragrance
drifted gracefully with your robes.

168
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,660
Like a spring breeze brushing past.

169
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,890
If I'm not mistaken,

170
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,139
you must have sewn lily petals

171
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,180
into your robes.

172
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,820
Letting them infuse over time.

173
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,259
That's why your scent lingers so subtly.

174
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,220
Elegant yet restrained.

175
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,370
Wonderful!

176
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,109
While these two ladies'
use of fragrance is creative,

177
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,250
it is still a common technique.

178
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,130
Hardly a rare scent.

179
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,770
"Every petal is lively,
every leaf gentle."

180
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,130
"After the rain,
the fragrance intoxicates the soul."

181
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,899
This is imported rose essence
from the Western Lands.

182
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,060
Not only is it extremely valuable,

183
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,090
but only a few bottles
are tributed to the palace each year.

184
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,730
For you to use this fragrance,
you must be someone beyond the ordinary.

185
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,300
Young Master Liu Yu,

186
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,660
you truly live up to your reputation.

187
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,660
I have one more challenge for you.

188
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,610
Very well.

189
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,349
Since you dare to test me,

190
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:57,420
I, Liu Yu, will play along till the end.

191
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,770
Good.

192
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,220
This fragrance is Suijing Incense.

193
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,880
It was the exclusive formula of the
late Emperor's favoured concubine, Lady Wan.

194
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,340
A deep and lingering scent,

195
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,340
renowned for its calming
and sleep-inducing effects.

196
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,779
To my knowledge,

197
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,940
it was crafted by one
of Lady Wan's personal attendants.

198
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,890
Unfortunately,

199
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,010
it has long been lost.

200
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,540
Indeed.

201
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,580
This is an item from three years ago.

202
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,850
No.

203
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,700
Its fragrance remains rich,

204
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,820
and its balance refined.

205
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,700
This is freshly made.

206
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,259
Three years ago,

207
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,940
a sachet like this
would have been worth a thousand taels.

208
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,779
But Lady Wan brought chaos to the court,

209
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,250
and died in political strife.

210
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,540
Since then,

211
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,820
this scent has fallen out of favour.

212
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,010
What did you say?

213
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,739
Back then, Lady Wan

214
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,060
plotted to place her son on the throne.

215
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,660
She conspired against the Crown Prince.

216
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,460
But her schemes were exposed.

217
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,820
A treacherous consort

218
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,250
met her end.
