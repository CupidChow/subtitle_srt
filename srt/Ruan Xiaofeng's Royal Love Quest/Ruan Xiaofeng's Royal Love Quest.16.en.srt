=Ruan Xiaofeng's Royal Love Quest=

2
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,900
=Episode 16=

3
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,760
You have nothing to do with any of this.

4
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,990
Because you are not Princess Zhaoning.

5
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,310
Go. Let's go.

6
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,630
Since you are convinced

7
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,270
that the princess is your enemy,

8
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,400
why did you endure
for three years without acting?

9
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,270
First,

10
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,790
I wanted to uncover the truth.

11
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,840
Second,

12
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,840
after the fall, the princess changed.

13
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,400
She treated me with warmth and care

14
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,559
just like my sister.

15
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,640
Then do you truly believe

16
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,710
that the one who killed
your sister was the princess?

17
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,480
I don't believe the princess
would kill someone.

18
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,350
The real Princess Zhaoning

19
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,120
died in Bixiao Tower long ago.

20
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,630
And I

21
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,760
came from another world.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,630
You must think I'm crazy.

23
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,880
Just like the boy in your story

24
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,600
who woke up one day

25
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,880
to find himself in a world of magic.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,110
Something like that.

27
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:29,880
So

28
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,070
do you believe me?

29
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,320
Of course I do.

30
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,390
If it were someone else,

31
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,390
I'd think they were insane.

32
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,670
But you

33
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,110
never follow the rules.

34
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,110
So

35
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,760
how did you figure it out?

36
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,230
The divorce decree?

37
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,950
This decree was written by you...

38
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,200
No.

39
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,320
By Princess Zhaoning.

40
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,390
Your handwriting is wild

41
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,600
and full of mistakes.

42
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,670
Those aren't mistakes.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,160
That's simplified script.

44
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,390
What?

45
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,510
Nothing.

46
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,880
So, you identified me based on

47
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,160
my handwriting?

48
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,040
It wasn't only your handwriting.

49
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,200
Imitating someone's
writing isn't difficult.

50
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,720
But pretending to be someone else

51
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,160
is not so easy.

52
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,040
Uncle.

53
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,689
You were well-versed
in literature from a young age.

54
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,649
But even now,

55
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,320
you haven't held any high office.

56
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,849
Are you implying something

57
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,630
about the emperor
overlooking your talents?

58
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,320
You've changed so much.

59
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,230
Sharp-tongued

60
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,910
yet soft-hearted.

61
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,969
♪The wind caresses your face♪

62
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,880
I don't know when it started

63
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,000
but every expression of yours

64
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,240
has become unforgettable.

65
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,159
When I look into your eyes, I know

66
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,320
you're not her.

67
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,150
What?

68
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,470
Something feels off.

69
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,020
(Divorce Decree)

70
00:04:50,504 --> 00:04:52,740
(Zhaoning respectfully inscribes)

71
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,920
If Princess Zhaoning
were truly that kind of person,

72
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,200
willing to do anything
to become Lady Ling,

73
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,320
then why would she secretly write
a divorce decree after achieving her goal?

74
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,710
I actually don't think
she was malicious.

75
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,000
She seemed more naive and devoted.

76
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,390
Don't you find it strange?

77
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,320
Ever since the princess
married into the residence,

78
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,630
we've been by her side.

79
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,030
But we've never seen her do such things.

80
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,070
The princess may be infuriating,

81
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,849
but she was just spoiled and willful

82
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,240
inside the residence.

83
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,479
She was just a pampered

84
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,200
arrogant noble lady.

85
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,030
Saying she committed

86
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,150
murder and wielded absolute power,

87
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,119
I find that hard to believe.

88
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,200
Exactly.

89
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,470
So you believe

90
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,470
Princess Zhaoning
was not the true culprit.

91
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,630
I have no evidence, just my intuition.

92
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,200
But I doubt anyone would believe me.

93
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,150
If what you say is true

94
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,950
and there is another culprit,

95
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,039
they will surely eliminate Yagu

96
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,000
after using her.

97
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,360
We could use Yagu as bait

98
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,599
to lure the real culprit into the open.

99
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,510
No.

100
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,070
That would put Ya in danger.

101
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:22,950
But she

102
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,360
is not entirely innocent.

103
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,590
I'll take you this far.

104
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,599
Leave the capital.

105
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,889
Never return.

106
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:48,880
You let me go?

107
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,320
Aren't you afraid I'll kill you?

108
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,120
If you wanted me dead,
you'd have done it already.

109
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,630
Yet today, your sword never fell.

110
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,150
That means you don't truly believe
I'm the mastermind behind all of this.

111
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,120
No matter what,

112
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,150
until the truth is revealed,

113
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,680
I will not leave the capital.

114
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,390
My sister may have been wrong,

115
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,270
but she didn't deserve to die unjustly.

116
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,760
The one who killed your sister

117
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,920
must be the same one
who killed Imperial Concubine Wan.

118
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,479
Lord Ling and I will uncover the truth.

119
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,270
- Then let me stay and help you.
- No.

120
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,680
The capital is too dangerous for you.

121
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,110
As long as I can uncover the truth

122
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,320
and avenge my sister,

123
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,680
I don't fear death.

124
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:51,280
I found this at the market.

125
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,280
I thought it would suit you,
so I got it for you.

126
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,710
It does suit you.

127
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,110
From now on,

128
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,950
you're a wandering swordswoman.

129
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,990
Life isn't just about hatred.

130
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,519
There's a vast world out there.

131
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,040
You should go see it.

132
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,280
Xiaofeng.

133
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,719
Go. The farther you go, the better.

134
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,640
Hurry!

135
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,230
You're just letting her go?

136
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,569
I was watching,
in case she tried to kill you.

137
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,520
She wouldn't.

138
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,440
She wanted to kill you tonight.

139
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,599
I know her sister was involved

140
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,950
in the consort's death.

141
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,440
But she's innocent.

142
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,040
If she's guilty of anything,

143
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,200
it's being consumed by hatred.

144
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
Just like you.

145
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,710
Guang!

146
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:04,990
Guang!

147
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:10,950
Are you all right?

148
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,969
It was Lin Qi.

149
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:18,110
Lin Qi took the painting.
