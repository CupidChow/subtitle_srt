00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,900
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,790
Your sister died.

4
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,620
And yet, she lived again.

5
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:44,900
The one reborn

6
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,300
is me.

7
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,909
Li Rui has always held
a grudge over his mother's death.

8
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,700
That's why he's been secretly
investigating all this time.

9
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,580
And he had me...

10
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,870
Yes, your sister help him
with the investigation.

11
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,800
But Li Rui and I don't get along.

12
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,880
So I escaped from Lord Ling's
Residence on my own.

13
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,430
And that played right into your hands.

14
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,380
You had Lin Qi bring me
into the storytelling house.

15
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,229
One side to keep an eye on me,

16
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,270
the other to wait
for a chance to strike.

17
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,279
But who would've thought

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,940
Li Rui came chasing after me again.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,150
He completely ruined your plans.

20
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,469
You had no way out.

21
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,440
So you dug out
the evidence of your crimes

22
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,080
that Imperial Concubine Wan
had gathered.

23
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,580
Then you pinned them on me.

24
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,630
You wanted me
to be abandoned by everyone.

25
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,589
But the people around me,

26
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,150
they trust me completely.

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,389
They refuse to believe

28
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,100
that I would do such things.

29
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,469
You had no choice.

30
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,519
So you had Lin Qi steal

31
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,439
your sister's painting
from Bixiao Tower.

32
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,180
You wanted to destroy the evidence.

33
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,380
And then,

34
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,710
I arrived uninvited.

35
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,630
Brilliant.

36
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,630
With that eloquence,
you almost had me convinced.

37
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,350
But this story

38
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,100
has its flaws.

39
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,420
It starts strong but ends weak.

40
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,070
Look.

41
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,439
You're convicting your brother

42
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,980
just based on a single painting?

43
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,260
Isn't that a bit far-fetched?

44
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,470
That's true.

45
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:34,820
In that case,

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,789
I'll take the painting back for now.

47
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,839
When the time comes,

48
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,350
I promise to give you the best ending.

49
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,540
Xiaofeng...

50
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,940
You're not taking this painting.

51
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,279
If you do,

52
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,700
it'll prove that Brother is a thief.

53
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,749
Besides, you're not leaving either.

54
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,860
Guards!

55
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,350
She is now Lady Ling!

56
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,540
Xiaofeng.

57
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,660
An imperial decree.

58
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,190
An imperial decree.

59
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,679
"Princess Zhaoning has abused her power
and indulged in debauchery.

60
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,480
She built a private estate
and seized farmland.

61
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,880
Also, she has taken lives without regard,
committing grave sins.

62
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,780
She is to be arrested immediately and escorted
to the capital to face His Majesty."

63
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,980
You planned this, didn't you?

64
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,940
Xiaofeng, you mustn't make
such baseless accusations.

65
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,910
I obey the decree.

66
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,860
Then I'll go. His Majesty
will uncover the truth anyway.

67
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,029
Lord Ling, South Pacification Lord.

68
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,839
I am merely
carrying out His Majesty's orders.

69
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,310
Please allow me to proceed.

70
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,589
General Chen, what are you saying?

71
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,940
This is an imperial edict.

72
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,260
How could I dare defy it?

73
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,439
General Chen, please proceed.

74
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,420
Take her away.

75
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,100
I dare anyone to touch her!

76
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,070
Your Highness.

77
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,380
Please do not
make this difficult for me.

78
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,470
Even if the Emperor himself
were here today to take her,

79
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,270
he would have to step over my dead body.

80
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,300
If that is the case,
then forgive me for offending you.

81
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,470
Seize them!

82
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,470
After them!

83
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,439
Stop!

84
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,390
Get them!

85
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,620
Stop!

86
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,300
This way!

87
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,540
- Stop!
- Don't run!

88
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,860
This way, hurry!

89
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,030
You go ahead. I'll hold them off.

90
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,980
I won't go.

91
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,629
I can't leave you here alone.

92
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,709
Listen to me.

93
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,389
General Chen and the South Pacification Lord
are in this together.

94
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,000
They will kill you tonight.

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,200
Go back to the residence
and hide in the secret chamber.

96
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,280
That's the only way we can get
an audience with His Majesty.

97
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,389
I am a prince.

98
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,790
They wouldn't dare touch me.

99
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,350
- Go now!
- I won't!

100
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,350

- No!
