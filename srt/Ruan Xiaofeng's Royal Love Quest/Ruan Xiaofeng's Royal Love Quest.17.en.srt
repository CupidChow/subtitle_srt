=Ruan Xiaofeng's Royal Love Quest=

2
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,900
=Episode 17=

3
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,980
How's Guang?

4
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,650
He's awake. Nothing serious.

5
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,290
Wuyan and Dayuan are looking after him.

6
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,570
I can understand why Yagu
stayed by my side

7
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,010
for revenge.

8
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,909
But I didn't expect

9
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,220
Lin Qi to be a traitor too.

10
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,290
He was steady and kind.

11
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,860
He took good care of me.

12
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,290
That only proves one thing.

13
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,370
You were right.

14
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,420
The real mastermind
still hasn't shown themselves.

15
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,250
But why did he take that painting?

16
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,810
What secret does it hold?

17
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,060
Exactly.

18
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,220
Princess Zhaoning must have known

19
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,620
who the true culprit was.

20
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,299
Yet she risked keeping that painting.

21
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,370
Why not draw the culprit on it?

22
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,850
Unless

23
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,220
she didn't dare.

24
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,930
Or she refused to.

25
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,690
Master.

26
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,220
Looks like the plan to kill
with borrowed hands failed.

27
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,220
She saw the consort's memorial

28
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,180
and hesitated when she had to act.

29
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,120
She couldn't go through with it.

30
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,410
Women always weak and indecisive,
unfit for important tasks.

31
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,060
Did you kill her?

32
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,739
She's skilled.

33
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,900
Dodged my dart

34
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,900
and escaped.

35
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,900
Escaped?

36
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,580
You let her go, didn't you?

37
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,220
I wouldn't dare.

38
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,850
Qi.

39
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,020
Remember this.

40
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,300
No matter how far a hound runs,

41
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,060
it can never escape its master's watch.

42
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,370
Don't be foolish.

43
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,410
Don't forget

44
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,250
whose hands her sister died by.

45
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,180
No matter how good you are to her,

46
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,900
you'll never be together.

47
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,620
I understand.

48
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,850
I brought what you asked for.

49
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,220
This painting

50
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,020
reveals nothing.

51
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,090
The princess likely held
onto their sibling bond

52
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,820
and chose not to paint the master.

53
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,530
Now,

54
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,970
even if they don't believe
she's the mastermind,

55
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,730
no one suspects you.

56
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,050
That may be true,

57
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,970
but the Princess
is no longer the same as before.

58
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,340
She's grown smarter

59
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,580
and she no longer listens to me.

60
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,380
With her like this,
I can't eat or sleep in peace.

61
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,650
One cannot allow another
to sleep soundly beside their bed.

62
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,610
Qi.

63
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,730
Gather our men.

64
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,170
Kill her at any cost.

65
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,580
Yes.

66
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,090
Brother.

67
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,220
You are here.

68
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,530
Xiaofeng.

69
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,380
Coming here this late at night,

70
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,460
did someone in the manor trouble you?

71
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,970
No.

72
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,109
Something was stolen from the manor.

73
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,739
So I thought I'd look for it here.

74
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,780
Nonsense.

75
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,780
Why would you come here

76
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,600
to find something stolen
from your manor?

77
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,059
Someone saw the thief
run into your residence.

78
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,650
That's why I'm here.

79
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,499
Must be something valuable

80
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,780
for you to come this late.

81
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:15,939
Brother.

82
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,380
Aren't you curious
about what I'm looking for?

83
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,789
I was just about to ask.

84
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,090
What was stolen?

85
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,900
A painting.

86
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,970
Xiaofeng.

87
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,850
It's not right to touch
other people's things

88
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,490
without permission.

89
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,530
Our parents passed away early.

90
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,220
I blame myself
for failing to discipline you.

91
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,299
Ugh, enough!

92
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,650
I'm done playing this game!

93
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,379
Let's cut to the chase.

94
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,909
I'm not your sister.

95
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,029
Your sister

96
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,869
was pushed off Bixiao Tower by your men

97
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,050
and fell to her death.

98
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,650
I'm here to find evidence
of your crimes.

99
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,140
Whose crimes?

100
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,700
Yours.

101
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,029
My dear Xiaofeng.

102
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,490
Did you hit your head
too hard in the fall?

103
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,819
Fine.

104
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,109
Let's say I'm a suspect.

105
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,869
Without evidence,

106
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,970
how do you expect me to confess?

107
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,490
That's the most
ridiculous thing I've heard.

108
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,530
Enough, Xiaofeng. Stop this.

109
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,140
At least let me see the painting.

110
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,970
Fine. Look.

111
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,290
I must say,

112
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,379
your painting skills have improved.

113
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,440
(Recorded on the 6th of March, the 17th year
of Emperor Heng, at Bixiao Tower.)

114
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,650
I'm a simple man,

115
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,699
but I've stared
at this painting for ages

116
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,900
and I still can't make sense of it.

117
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,850
Lord Ling's wedding was in March.

118
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,800
Pomegranate blossoms
shouldn't be in bloom.

119
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,170
That flower tree seems newly added.

120
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,610
It must be covering something.

121
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,090
General, do you have anything to say?

122
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,549
Say what?

123
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,280
That just because there's a little
armored figure in the painting,

124
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,970
you assume I'm guilty of murder?

125
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,820
Fine.

126
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,820
Then allow me
to deduce something for you.

127
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,370
See if I'm right.

128
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,490
You are telling your brother a tale?

129
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,420
Very well, I'm all ears.

130
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,220
All right, let's begin.

131
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,229
Back then, the late emperor appointed

132
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,739
the current ruler as Crown Prince,

133
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,130
a man of integrity
who couldn't be swayed.

134
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,499
Meanwhile, you,
the South Pacification Lord,

135
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,850
despite your military achievements,

136
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,019
were not satisfied with power

137
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,090
and tried to control the court.

138
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,469
But the crown prince was too righteous,

139
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,850
too difficult to manipulate.

140
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:12,420
So you sought to have
the emperor change his heir.

141
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,589
Looking across the palace,

142
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,770
only Imperial Concubine Wan
and her son were suitable.

143
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,040
But Imperial Concubine Wan
had long fallen from favor.

144
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,730
And Lord Ling was still too young.

145
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,309
So you sent Ren Dong
to serve Imperial Concubine Wan

146
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,770
and teach her swordplay.

147
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,259
Before the emperor,

148
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,090
you praised
Imperial Concubine Wan endlessly.

149
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,469
Just as you expected,

150
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,739
after all the scheming,

151
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,940
Imperial Concubine Wan regained favor.

152
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,109
But what you didn't expect

153
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,160
was that Imperial Concubine Wan had
no desire to see her son ascend the throne.

154
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,869
Because she didn't want him

155
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,660
to become a puppet like herself.

156
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,890
So she set out
to gather evidence against you.

157
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,499
Little did she know, you had already
shifted all your crimes

158
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,019
onto your own sister,

159
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,480
Princess Zhaoning.

160
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,989
And the evidence
Imperial Concubine Wan collected

161
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,460
couldn't harm you at all.

162
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,499
After learning
about Imperial Concubine Wan's plan,

163
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,019
you didn't stop

164
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,109
but continued to use

165
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,589
your sister's love for Lord Ling

166
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,540
and successfully marrying her
into his household.

167
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,229
With this,

168
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,739
if Lord Ling took the throne,

169
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,419
your sister would be empress,

170
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,460
and you

171
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,139
would hold absolute power

172
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,660
as the emperor's uncle.

173
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,899
So, on Lord Ling's wedding day,

174
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,899
you first had Ren Dong
poison the crown prince.

175
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,370
Then, you personally lured
Imperial Concubine Wan to her death.

176
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,949
But what a shame,

177
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,869
the crown prince was saved in time.

178
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,869
And your sister

179
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,349
witnessed the entire moment

180
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,770
when you lured
Imperial Concubine Wan to her death.

181
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,589
So you devised another plan.

182
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,379
You first killed Ren Dong
to silence her,

183
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,229
then spread the rumor

184
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,700
that Imperial Concubine Wan
had taken her own life out of guilt

185
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,160
after failing to poison
the crown prince.

186
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,499
But your sister

187
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,130
became the thorn in your side.

188
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,820
Even though

189
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,300
she never planned to expose you.

190
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,309
She merely painted day after day

191
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,180
to ease the turmoil in her heart.

192
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,779
Yet you still sent people

193
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,820
to push her off Bixiao Tower.

194
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,820
Your sister died.

195
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,730
And yet, she lived again.

196
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,010
The one reborn

197
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,420
is me.
