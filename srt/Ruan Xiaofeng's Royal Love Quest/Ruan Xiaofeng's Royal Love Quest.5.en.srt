=Episode 5=

3
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,050
No entry for outsiders.

4
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,969
You two are here
to cause trouble, aren't you?

5
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:46,859
That's right.

6
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,240
We're here to apply for the job.

7
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,730
It's written in black and white.

8
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,059
Anyone capable,

9
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,170
regardless of status,
will be treated equally.

10
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,130
Well then...

11
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:04,560
All right.

12
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,539
Join them

13
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,560
in the interview.

14
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:08,920
Is that fine?

15
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:10,920
All right.

16
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,560
This is a secret recipe

17
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,410
passed down from my mother.

18
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:24,210
I think I can be a cook.

19
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,360
Your Highness, shall we continue?

20
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,160
(He may look frail,)

21
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,690
(but his gaze carries a murderous aura.)

22
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,560
(His steps are swift,)

23
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,080
(and his stance firm.)

24
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,410
(He must know martial arts.)

25
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,360
You try this piece?

26
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,770
Xiaofeng, he won't let me eat meat.

27
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,450
What's going on?

28
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,610
Stop bullying him.

29
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,360
Please have a taste.

30
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,920
Your Highness, shall we continue?

31
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:58,960
Look at him.

32
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,120
He's strutting around like a peacock.

33
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,050
(He needs a splash of water.)

34
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,920
Xiaofeng, he splashed me!

35
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,680
It's burning hot!

36
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,569
Li Rui! Dayuan!

37
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,170
What's going on? Was that on purpose?

38
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,609
I was demonstrating my technique.

39
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,259
Technique? Who asked to see that?

40
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,099
Get out.

41
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,479
Both of you, leave now!

42
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,350
(Qixia Pavilion)

43
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,640
Maybe I was mistaken.

44
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,770
That Lin Qi is nothing
but a flamboyant fool.

45
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,640
It seems she's
not in any danger for now.

46
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,210
Let's look for other clues.

47
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,570
It's so beautiful.

48
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,729
Yagu, how many more surprises

49
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,130
are you hiding from us?

50
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,419
All right.

51
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,720
Then I'll now announce the final result.

52
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,450
Welcome to Qixia Pavilion!

53
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,419
I don't feel like drinking now.

54
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,249
Just leave it there.

55
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,280
I'll have it later.

56
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,010
Who's there?

57
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,470
(Bixiao Tower)

58
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,579
- Good, good.
- Good.

59
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,450
Coming.

60
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,779
Harry took a closer look.

61
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,609
That blond kid
had two strong men standing beside him.

62
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,570
Clearly, he was a rich young master.

63
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,160
And what was his name?

64
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,450
His surname was Ma,
and his name was Erfu.

65
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,129
He came from a prestigious family.

66
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,280
And he often said one thing...

67
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,370
What was it?

68
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,609
"Be careful, or I'll tell my father!"

69
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,720
- Good!
- Good!

70
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,729
Right on target!

71
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,729
See that, Guang?

72
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,019
That's what you call skill.

73
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,400
This is real skill.

74
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,570
Can you do it?

75
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,520
Let me show you what real skill is.

76
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,810
Double target hit?

77
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,080
A reverse shot, too?

78
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,690
Yagu! You...

79
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,929
Your voice is back!

80
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,339
This...

81
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,289
Could it be
because of my arrow just now?

82
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,609
Did I make a contribution?

83
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,169
What does this have to do with you?

84
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:49,779
But...

85
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,049
This is incredible.

86
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,099
It's all thanks to my arrow.

87
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,370
Forget it.

88
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,809
I planned this meticulously.

89
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,659
Meticulous...

90
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,400
Meticulously planned! She done with it.

91
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,010
Yagu.

92
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,130
Haven't I been drinking tonics lately?

93
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,600
Actually, that prescription
wasn't for me.

94
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,160
It was for you.

95
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,019
The ingredients in it

96
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,640
are especially good for your throat.

97
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,489
But I...

98
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,160
But you didn't drink it, did you?

99
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,729
I used a vapor therapy method.

100
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:27,370
Drinking wasn't the key.
Boiling the herbs was.

101
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,450
Boiling the herbs?

102
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,179
She spent so much time
watching over the stove every day.

103
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,579
The essence of the herbs

104
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,609
turned into vapor

105
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,290
and was absorbed into her throat.

106
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,600
Isn't that
far more effective than drinking it?

107
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,810
Yagu.

108
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,609
About the past,

109
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,120
I really don't remember.

110
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,170
Maybe you've suffered
a lot because of me.

111
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,570
I can't change what's already happened.

112
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,099
So from now on,

113
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,690
I will make it up to you.

114
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,600
All right?

115
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,410
Yagu.

116
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,470
(Qixia Pavilion)

117
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,080
Your Highness.

118
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,240
Have you found anything?

119
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,410
This was found outside
the railing of Bixiao Tower.

120
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,480
This isn't a common incense
sold on the market.

121
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,080
It's a top-quality blend,
crafted by an expert.

122
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,290
This scent...

123
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,720
Dayuan.

124
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,529
Do you remember the master perfumer

125
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,170
who once served my mother?

126
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,409
I remember.

127
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,360
Her name was Ren Dong.

128
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,210
But she disappeared without a trace.

129
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,650
After my mother passed away,

130
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,570
all her trusted aides

131
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,859
either met untimely deaths

132
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,330
or vanished without a trace.

133
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,720
There must be
something suspicious behind this.

134
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:09,840
Your Highness.

135
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,210
About this sachet,

136
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,930
I have an idea.

137
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,050
Let's hear it.

138
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,290
If we want to uncover
the origin of this incense,

139
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,930
there's one place we should go.

140
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,819
The entertainment houses
and pleasure districts.

141
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,339
They love using incense the most.

142
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,409
The courtesans and performers there

143
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,840
must have knowledge about it.
