(Qixia Pavilion)

5
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,079
Welcome to

6
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,159
today's showdown
between the two pavilions.

7
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,070
First,

8
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,870
let's give a round of applause
to the Beauty Trio from Yeyang Pavilion.

9
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:56,989
Bravo!

10
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:03,029
(Never stop loving Yang Qiong)
Bravo!

11
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,070
Bravo!

12
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,180
What's going on?

13
00:01:35,567 --> 00:01:36,999
- What's happening?
- What's going on?

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,469
- Something's not right.
- His voice sounds off. It's different.

15
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,639
Could he be lip-syncing?

16
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,079
Is it really him singing?

17
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,910
- It's not him.
- He's fake singing.

18
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,990
I've been observing Yang Qiong.

19
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,999
I noticed that every time he sang,

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,309
his eyes kept looking

21
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,870
toward the side of the stage.

22
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,790
I suspect

23
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,940
he must be lip-syncing.

24
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,029
He can't seriously be lip-syncing.

25
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,469
Listen to the voice.

26
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,749
How could it be?

27
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,990
He's fake singing.

28
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,189
- Lip-syncing!
- Get off the stage!

29
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,260
- Lip-syncing!
- Get off the stage!

30
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,350
- Get off the stage!
- Lip-syncing!

31
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,910
Awful!

32
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,420
Unbelievable.

33
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,350
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

34
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,879
Even though Liu Yu

35
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,119
is tall

36
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,660
and has long legs,

37
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,470
he always seems unsteady

38
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,230
whenever he dances.

39
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,940
There must be something
inside his boots.

40
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,310
How do we expose him?

41
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,790
He's easily affected.

42
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,589
All you need to do is...

43
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,540
Liu Yu!

44
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,590
Liu Yu!

45
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,700
Liu Yu, show us a roundhouse kick.

46
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,879
Roundhouse kick!

47
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,860
Once more!

48
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,140
He's wearing height insoles!

49
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:29,119
Shorty!

50
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,910
Shorty!

51
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,590
What about Songke?

52
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,190
Songke?

53
00:03:49,668 --> 00:03:54,189
He's handsome!

54
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,470
Bravo!

55
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,860
Bravo!

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,820
Bravo!

57
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,799
Such a wonderful performance!

58
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,980
Coming up next is

59
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,679
Qixia Pavilion.
Let's give them a round of applause.

60
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,660
Bravo!

61
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,710
(Do I really have to do this?)

62
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,980
Maybe they're just shy.

63
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,500
Let's give them
a warm round of applause.

64
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,830
Please.

65
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:12,541
Bravo!

66
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,790
Whatever.

67
00:05:43,922 --> 00:05:49,312
Bravo!

68
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,740
Bravo!

Excellent!

84
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,710
Your Majesty, the results of the vote.

85
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,100
Qixia Pavilion narrowly won.

86
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,270
Do you accept this?

87
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,230
No, I don't.

88
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,060
They cheated.

89
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,060
It wasn't a fair win.

90
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,950
Strategies should be employed in wars.

91
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,350
The world of business
is no different from the battlefield.

92
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,559
Xiaofeng's tactics are clever.

93
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,800
As expected from someone
born into a military family.

94
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,660
You flattered me, Your Majesty.

95
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,860
Actually, it wasn't all my efforts.

96
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,949
If they had played fair and open,

97
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,760
I wouldn't have had a chance
to use such tricks.

98
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,500
Your Majesty,

99
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,670
these performers

100
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,359
have been spreading rumors
in East Market.

101
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,780
They're arrogant

102
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,020
under Aunt's indulgence.

103
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,380
I ask you to uphold justice,
Your Majesty.

104
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,020
Since a pact was made,

105
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,389
Aunt, as the Princess Royal,

106
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,860
I believe you'll honor your word.

107
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,720
Your wise judgment convinces me,
Your Majesty.

108
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,380
I accept

109
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,380
your decree.

110
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,620
But I'm getting up in years,

111
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,860
and nearing death.

112
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,350
Suffering such humiliations
from the younger generation

113
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,950
is truly...

114
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,350
Your Majesty,

115
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,780
Aunt is getting up in years.

116
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,740
She shouldn't be disturbed
by worldly affairs.

117
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,100
The capital isn't a place
for a peaceful rest.

118
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,260
Heishui is serene and pure

119
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,740
and is blessed by our ancestors.

120
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,740
It'd surely be a perfect retreat
for Aunt.

121
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,470
That sounds good.

122
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,230
I decree that Yeyang Pavilion
will be closed at once.

123
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,830
Princess Luyang will be sent
to Heishui for rest.

124
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,470
Aunt, please return to your residence
and prepare for your departure.

125
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,389
Your Majesty.

126
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,470
Be on your way, Aunt.

127
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,670
Your Highness.

128
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,900
Your Highness.

129
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:21,980
Let's go.

130
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,980
Seeing both of you

131
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,860
supporting each other

132
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,550
makes me glad.

133
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,860
I'll grant you one wish.

134
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,350
Speak it

135
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,380
if there's anything you want.

136
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:48,590
Your Majesty, I'd like to ask
for your permission

137
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,850
to reopen the investigation
into Imperial Concubine Wan's fall.

138
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,549
Rumors are spreading

139
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,429
throughout the capital.

140
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,319
Unless we uncover the truth,

141
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,430
rumors won't stop.

142
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,389
It would also help

143
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,500
restore the honor
of the imperial family.

144
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,000
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

145
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,230
It's my idea.

146
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,230
Please don't blame Xiaofeng.
