=Ruan Xiaofeng's Royal Love Quest=

2
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,900
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,899
Our lord is seeing no one.

4
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,939
Take your worthless invitation
and get lost.

5
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,220
- You...
- What, you?

6
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,370
I serve the South Pacification Lord.
You...

7
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,500
- The South Pacification Lord?
- Scared now?

8
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,259
Scared? Of you? What a joke.

9
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,650
I'll beat you up all the same.

10
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,420
- You...
- Go!

11
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,370
- Save me a spot.
- You...

12
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,069
Save me a spot.

13
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,509
Do you yield? Do you?

14
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,579
I think you...

15
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,979
I think you don't know your place.

16
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,540
- Do you yield?
- Do you?

17
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,860
Do you?

18
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:06,939
Do you?

19
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:07,709
Do you?

20
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,290
I... I do.

21
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,340
What's all this commotion?

22
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,620
Do you yield?

23
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:14,819
Your Highness.

24
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,780
Your Highness.

25
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,620
Nothing's wrong.

26
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,219
Your Highness.

27
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,450
Your Highness.

28
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,420
What is it?

29
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,570
Your Highness.

30
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,509
I bring this invitation by order

31
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,010
of the South Pacification Lord.

32
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,819
He has chosen righteousness over kin,

33
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,340
earning His Majesty's favor.

34
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,010
A banquet is being held today,

35
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,900
and he invites Your Highness to attend.

36
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,370
Your Highness.

37
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,700
Now get lost!

38
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:50,930
Out!

39
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,290
Out!

40
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,669
It's a rare occasion today.

41
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,090
Let's all toast to Lord.

42
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,669
Yes, a toast!

43
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,220
Your Highness, please.

44
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,829
- Good! Good!
- Yes, good.

45
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,179
- Well done!
- Yes!

46
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,130
- Bravo!
- Indeed.

47
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,530
Lord Ling has arrived.

48
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,250
I received all the invitations.

49
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,500
How could I not come?

50
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,180
Someone, bring Lord Ling a seat.

51
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,180
No need.

52
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,250
I'm here.

53
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,530
Just to take one thing.

54
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,380
What's happening outside?

55
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,410
Go check.

56
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,020
Go, go.

57
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,260
This dance...

58
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,000
But after
Imperial Concubine Wan's death,

59
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,380
this dance was supposed to be lost.

60
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,970
Could it be...

61
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,340
That's right. I'm a ghost.

62
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,259
I've come to claim
the life of my killer.

63
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,460
Killed?

64
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,490
Imperial Concubine Wan was murdered.

65
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,090
- Don't spout nonsense.
- It's true.

66
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,520
He is the master of this house,
the South Pacification Lord.

67
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,839
- The South Pacification Lord?
- The South Pacification Lord?

68
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:47,909
- He did it.
- That's right.

69
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,610
- How could it be him?
- This...

70
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,909
The grudge between us

71
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,460
began eight years ago.

72
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,850
(When I met him,)

73
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,530
(I was a fallen concubine,
bullied and powerless.)

74
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,780
(He said the palace was cold
and the court treacherous,)

75
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,989
(and asked
if I would stand by his side.)

76
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,229
(Bixiao Tower)

77
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,410
(Finally,)

78
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,460
(I became the most
favored concubine in the harem.)

79
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,260
(He became the South Pacification Lord,
feared throughout the court.)

80
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,820
(Then,)

81
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,260
(he sought to remove the Crown Prince,)

82
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,650
(and make my son the heir.)

83
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,020
(I had long lost control over my fate,)

84
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,900
(but I didn't want Rui)

85
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,820
(to become his puppet.)

86
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,869
(Later, I gathered evidence,)

87
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,850
(hoping to bring him down.)

88
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,820
(But I never expected,)

89
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,989
(he would pin all his crimes)

90
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,650
(on his sister, Princess Zhaoning.)

91
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,850
(During Lord Ling's wedding banquet,)

92
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,820
(the Crown Prince nearly died
after eating the tangyuan.)

93
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,780
(That's when I knew,)

94
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,610
(it was all his doing.)

95
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,090
And then?

96
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,220
Then,

97
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,349
he lured me to Bixiao Pavilion,

98
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,229
pushed me off,

99
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,460
and framed me for it.

100
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,700
- This...
- This...

101
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,989
Plotting against His Majesty?
Framing a concubine?

102
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,220
That is treason.

103
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,530
Xiaofeng.

104
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,260
Utter nonsense.

105
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,020
So it really is you, my dear sister.

106
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,490
Putting on a ghost act here, are you?

107
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,460
Isn't that Princess Zhaoning?

108
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,739
How could this be?

109
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,589
Could it be that Princess Zhaoning
has come back from the dead?

110
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,299
Are you a cat or something?

111
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,109
How many lives do you have?

112
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,700
Why aren't you dead yet?

113
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,340
Let me count.

114
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,940
Imperial Concubine Wan.

115
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,410
Princess Zhaoning.

116
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,900
Ren Dong. Ya.

117
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,020
My life

118
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,970
hasn't been mine alone for a long time.

119
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,499
That day, under your orders,

120
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,820
Lin Qi tried to take my life.

121
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:38,589
Mr. Lin.

122
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,820
I'm no shopkeeper.

123
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,090
I know.

124
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,180
Ya.

125
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,540
Didn't I tell you to leave the capital?

126
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,610
The debt isn't settled.

127
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,229
How could I leave?

128
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,090
Debt?

129
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,340
What debt?

130
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,890
The one I owe.

131
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,540
And the one owed to me.

132
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,300
Tonight, we settle it all.

133
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,130
Lin Qi.

134
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,340
That day in the bamboo forest,

135
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,940
you could have left me
to die in that trap.

136
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,610
But you didn't.

137
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,869
I was just repaying
the favor when you saved me.

138
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,370
Then at the palace,

139
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,469
you wounded Lord Ling to help me escape.

140
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,730
I was only using you.

141
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,420
I just wanted the princess gone.

142
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,660
And this time?

143
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,730
You were supposed
to kill me with this, weren't you?

144
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,730
Just like how you used it
to kill my sister.

145
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,709
I should have known my sister
died from a dart wound.

146
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,970
You're too skilled with darts
for me not to see it.

147
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,370
I was too blind.

148
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,090
So today,

149
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,890
you've come to take my life.

150
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:46,890
Lin Qi.

151
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,340
You're just like my sister.

152
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,770
You only made a mistake
and trusted the wrong person.

153
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,300
My sister devoted her entire life
to the South Pacification Lord.

154
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,460
And in the end,

155
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,370
she was nothing more than a pawn,
discarded without a thought.

156
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,700
Lin Qi.

157
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,370
Can't you see what awaits you?

158
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,370
Lin Qi.

159
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,460
Don't make another mistake!

160
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,580
There's no turning back for me.

161
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,660
(But I can still choose my own fate.)

162
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,580
Ya.

163
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:14,420
Ya.

164
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,730
Ya.

165
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,340
Go, now.

166
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,130
I'll take you with me.

167
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,060
I'll find you the best physician.

168
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,970
Even if Hua Tuo were alive,

169
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,970
he wouldn't be able to save me.

170
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,340
Quick.

171
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,340
Let's switch clothes.

172
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,300
If the soldiers come,

173
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,090
it'll be easier for you to escape.

174
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,610
I won't.

175
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,660
If you truly feel

176
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,220
you owe me anything,

177
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,130
then use the life I've given you

178
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,010
to take down
the South Pacification Lord.

179
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,940
Avenge my sister

180
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,420
for me.

181
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,730
Ya...

182
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,850
Xiaofeng!

183
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,660
Xiaofeng!
