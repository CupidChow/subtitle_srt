Excuse me. Have you seen
a young lady about this tall?

- Did you find her?
- Not yet.

Excuse me.

00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,659
Have you seen a girl

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,619
who's about this tall

8
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,290
and with a figure like this?

There's this little boy
with a lightning scar on his forehead.

16
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,060
His name is Harry.

17
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,579
When he glares intensely,

18
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,179
his cousin suddenly falls into a cage.

19
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,549
The glass between them

20
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,069
disappears instantly.

21
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,099
Inside the cage is a python
about eight chi long.

22
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,099
Whoosh! It flies out of the cage

23
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,989
and lands on the floor.

24
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,160
Then, it twists its head
and looks right at Harry.

25
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,549
Flicking its tongue,

26
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,739
it speaks.

27
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,269
Bravo!

28
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,090
Harry starts counting.

29
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,219
When it reaches midnight,

30
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,420
it's his twelfth birthday.

31
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,989
Just as he counts down to one,

32
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,860
someone knocks on the door.

33
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,869
Who are you?

34
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,989
- Right.
- Who is it?

35
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,260
- Who?
- Who is it?

36
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,130
Let's save that for the next session.

37
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,580
Well done, Mr. Cheng.

38
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,829
I haven't had the time
to explain to you.

39
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,619
I'm not Cheng Xiaolan.

40
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,619
She quit,

41
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,499
and her manager ran off too.

42
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,530
I know.

43
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,300
Miss, you are...

44
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:36,900
You do?

45
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,300
My name is Ruan Xiaofeng.

46
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,930
I followed a servant here.

47
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,389
Everyone knows
saving a show is like saving a fire.

48
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,459
No matter what,

49
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,970
I'm truly grateful for your help,

50
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,389
Miss Ruan.

51
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,530
No, it's nothing.

52
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,850
There's something I'd like to ask you.

53
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,340
What's the title of the story?

54
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,220
Harry Potter.

55
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,810
The Hogwarts Trio.

56
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,370
Oh, no.

57
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,970
Little Orphan
and the Philosopher's Stone.

58
00:03:14,058 --> 00:03:16,408
That sounds novel.

59
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,780
Brilliant.

60
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,739

61
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,900
and continue the story
of the magical stone,

62
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,930
I'd repay you handsomely.

64
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,130
What does that mean?

65
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,149
Follow her.

66
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,810

I'm not going back.

88
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,970
Why?

89
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,730
I'm willful and vicious.

00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,490
I've done some many terrible things.

91
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,850
There's no place for me
in the residence.

92
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,460
You heard that?

93
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,970
What long ears you have.

94
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,410
What exactly do you want?

95
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,650
Come back with me.

00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,020

00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,700
Let me ask you.

98
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,020
Who's asking me to go back?

99
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,380
Lord Ling

100
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,780
or Li Rui?

101
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,220
What's that supposed to mean?

102
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,789
I know very well why you saved me.

103
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,850
It's because my brother is
fighting on the front lines.

104
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,229
I'm a pawn

105
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,020
for the imperial family
to control his power.

106
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,050
Your father arranged this marriage,

107
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,140
so you couldn't reject me as your wife.

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,960
I'm just a tool for you to act
like a loving husband

109
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,460
in front of the imperial family.

110
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,340
That's not all.

111
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,410
I saved you because you fell
from Bixiao Tower,

112
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,700
which was the same way my mother died.

113
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,730
It's too suspicious.

114
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,730
I must get to the bottom of this.

115
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,580
So you should understand

116
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,850
that you're not safe out here alone.

117
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,610
The killer might come after you again.

118
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,340
Looks like I serve yet another purpose
for you now.

119
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,050
Don't worry about my safety.

120
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,490
You're a noble lady.

121
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,140
You shouldn't get involved with the mob.

122
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:25,820
Are you actually getting tricked
by the pretty boy from Qixia Pavilion?

123
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,090
So what if I'm a noble lady?

124
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,900
So what if he's with a mob?

125
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,739
At least Mr. Lin discovered my talents

126
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,780
and gave me a stage to perform.

127
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,610
It's way better than
an entitled jerk like you.

128
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,490
What? Jerk?

when can Qixia Pavilion resume operations?

145
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,580
All the servants quit

146
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,580
because they had to serve that big star.

147
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,340
Now,

148
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,370
it's just the two of us.

149
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,040
How are we supposed to continue?

150
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,180
You should've told me earlier.

151
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,709
We can write a hiring notice

152
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,019
and stick it at the door.

153
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,580
There'll be people applying for the job.

154
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,060
Good idea.

155
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,400
- Here you go.
- What position do you need?

156
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,189
Let's hire a barbecue chef.

157
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,130
All right.

158
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,300
And a tea master.

159
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,940

165
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:47,720

that hurt you.

170
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,709
But I've already left the residence.

171
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,220
Why are you still holding
onto this grudge and coming after me?
