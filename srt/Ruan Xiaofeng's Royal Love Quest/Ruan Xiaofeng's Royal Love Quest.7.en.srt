=Ruan Xiaofeng's Royal Love Quest=

00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,900
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,759
Back then, Lady Wan

4
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,159
schemed to put her son on the throne.

5
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,870
She conspired against the Crown Prince.

6
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,340
But her plot was eventually exposed.

7
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,620
A treacherous consort,

8
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,110
met her end.

9
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,550
How dare you!

10
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,430
Spreading lies about the royal family?

11
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,020
Here in Yeyang Pavilion,

12
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,990
even a mere concubine like Lady Wan...

13
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,230
No, even the Emperor himself

14
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,430
is fair game for discussion.

15
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,540
So much for speaking freely.

16
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,910
What do you intend to do?

17
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,020
Guards!

18
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,229
It's dangerous here. Go!

19
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,159
What about you?

20
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,519
A few lackeys are no match for me.

21
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,430
Go!

22
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,710
Get them!

23
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,300
Stay back!

24
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,910
If you hit me,

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,020
you offend Princess Luyang.

26
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,430
Anyone who slanders my mother

27
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,380
will not escape death,

28
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,100
no matter who backs them.

29
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,020
You are Lord Ling.

30
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,930
(Yeyang Pavilion)

31
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,790
Mount up!

32
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,470
Still feeling unwell?

33
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,660
My right eye still feels a little dry.

34
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,630
Your right eye?

35
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,140
Hold still.

36
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,019
♪In the scroll of bygone days♪

37
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,330
♪Love goes on like an endless flow♪

38
00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:01,130

42
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,420
It's getting late.

43
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,310
Let's head back.

44
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:23,909
Let's go.

45
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,789
Halt!

46
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,910
How dare you trespass
into a military-restricted zone!

47
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,279
Aren't you a prince?

48
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,380
How did you end up
tied up by your own army?

49
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,470
I was traveling in disguise.

50
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,879
Besides, I already identified myself.

51
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,070
They just didn't believe me.

52
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,839
Now I see.

53
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,030
Every time I run into you,
disaster follows.

54
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,749
I should be the one saying that.

55
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,679
If I hadn't ridden in to save you,

56
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,750
you'd have been
pinned down by those brutes.

57
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,029
If not for your safety,

58
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,399
I would have cut out
those "peacocks' tongues" to honor

59
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,069
my mother's spirit.

60
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,190
Forget it.

61
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,380
If I hadn't saved you,
you'd be the one pinned down by now.

62
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,840
Why have you become so rude?

63
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,840
You resort to violence
at the slightest disagreement.

64
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,230
Rude?

65
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,709
Now you call me rude?

66
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:21,439
If I weren't,

67
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,980
you'd have been captured long ago.

68
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,590
Don't move!

69
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,790
Stay still!

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,830
You...

71
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,710
Untie me now!

72
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,390
Wait.

73
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,270
Hurry, untie me!

74
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,420
Now you need me, huh?

75
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,980
I refuse.

76
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,309
What was it you just called me?

77
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,350
Rude?

78
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,999
Then let me show you

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,629
what true rudeness looks like.

80
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,559
You...

81
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,400
Don't move.

82
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,949
- Ruan Xiaofeng, stop it!
- Say it again!

83
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,679
- Say it!
- Ruan Xiaofeng!

84
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,230
- Say it one more time!
- Ruan Xiaofeng!

85
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,269
Enough.

86
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,629
- Say it again!
- Just untie me!

87
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,790
I won't.

88
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,860
Ruan Xiaofeng!

89
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,149
You're the rudest!

90
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,060
- Say that again.
- Who's causing trouble here?

91
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,830
Rui?

92
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,660
Xiaofeng?

93
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,270
(Oh no.)

94
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,790
(This brother looks terrifying.)

95
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,660
I heard that while I was away at war,

96
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,860
you caused trouble again
at Lord Ling's Residence.

97
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,300
A lot has happened lately.

98
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,710
Not sure
which incident you're referring to.

99
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,790
The one
where you jumped off the city tower.

100
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,590
Oh, my heavens.

101
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,030
Do you know how terrified
your brother was when he heard that?

102
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,500
You...

103
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,629
Are you all right?

104
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,790
Did you hurt yourself?

105
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,749
No.

106
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,359
It's just that...
I don't remember anything from before.

107
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,100
But I'm not injured. I'm fine.

108
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,309
You hit your head?

109
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,590
This is terrifying!

110
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,309
No.

111
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,309
My head is fine. I'm still here.

112
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,350
I just lost my memory.

113
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,150
I forgot everything from before.

114
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,710
I don't remember.

115
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,389
Oh my, memory loss?

116
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,350
Memory loss.

117
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,520
You still remember your brother, right?

118
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,740
I don't recall you either.

119
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,100
Little sister.

120
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,300
Even if you don't remember me...

121
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,910
I will never forget you
for the rest of my life.

122
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,590
But...

123
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,270
You two were fighting just now.

124
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,860
I'll admit my fault first.

125
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,270
I shouldn't have used force.

126
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,540
That's not what I meant.

127
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,629
Then what is it?

128
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,030
Who had the upper hand?

129
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,300
Well, obviously me!

130
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,749
Oh my heavens!

131
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,230
Look at this. Brother is just a brute.

132
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,350
A fierce brother
and an even fiercer sister. Good!

133
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,629
You were just injured not long ago.

134
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,830
Your body is still weak.

135
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,100
Come inside.

136
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,540
Let's go.

137
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,300
I heard you've been
frequenting the Eastern Market lately.

138
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,590
Nothing escapes Your Majesty's ears.

139
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,389
I not only know you've been going there,

140
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,270
I also know the reason why.

141
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,910
It's because of someone, isn't it?

142
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,790
What do you mean by that?

143
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,660
When it comes to her,

144
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,620
all I have is complaints.

145
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,740
If you didn't care,
why would you have so many complaints?

146
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,749
You never had so much to say

147
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,100
when talking about her before.

148
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,980
Which means now, she's on your mind.

149
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,800
You don't understand, Your Majesty.

150
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,590
She was already unbearable before.

151
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,039
But ever since she fell,

152
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,500
she's been even more unreasonable.

153
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,310
She annoys me every day.

154
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,140
Report!

155
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,860
Your Majesty,
Princess Luyang requests an audience.

156
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,980
Aunt.

157
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,239
Greets Your Majesty.

158
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,470
No need for formalities, Aunt.
Please, take a seat.

159
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,020
That won't be necessary.

160
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,900
I have come unannounced

161
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,260
just to ask Your Majesty for justice.

162
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,620
Please speak, Aunt.

163
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,909
The Grand Emperor
ruled with filial piety,

164
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,549
promoting respect for the elderly.

165
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,389
As members of the royal family,
we should lead by example,

166
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,830
setting a standard for all.

167
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,269
I may be of little worth,

168
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,470
but nonetheless,

169
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,430
I am still your elder.

170
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,710
Of course.

171
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,350
I have always followed
the teachings of our ancestors.

172
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,239
How could I dare
be disrespectful to Aunt?

173
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,549
Yet now, certain juniors
have no sense of propriety.

174
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:36,509
They dare act recklessly
in my territory,

175
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,860
committing acts of violence.

176
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,230
Your Majesty,

177
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,430
I ask that you deliver fair judgment.

178
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,430
Grant me justice.

179
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,550
Rui,

180
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,260
what is this about?

181
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,020
Your Majesty.

182
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,549
Today, I did, indeed, at Yeyang Pavilion,

183
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,260
got into an argument
with a few performers.

184
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,020
Some things were broken.

185
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,980
However,

186
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,260
I did not know beforehand
that Yeyang Pavilion belonged to Aunt.

187
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,190
That was my mistake.

188
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,740
I ask for Aunt's forgiveness.

189
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,839
As a prince of the royal bloodline,

190
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,079
Lord Ling caused
a disturbance in the marketplace,

191
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,780
injuring countless civilians.

192
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,500
How can an apology suffice?

193
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,350
Then according to Aunt,

194
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,550
what should be done?

195
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,550
The late Emperor
and Lady Wan passed early.

196
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,079
Your Majesty, as his elder brother,

197
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,950
have been too kind-hearted.

198
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,430
That is why Lord Ling
has become so unruly and reckless.

199
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,670
If he is spared today,

200
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,430
he will surely disgrace
the royal family in the future.

201
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,900
Bringing shame upon our lineage.

202
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,629
In my opinion,

203
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,190
he should be sent to Heishui
to serve at the imperial tombs.

204
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:45,430
Let him burn incense daily,
bow in reverence, and reflect.

205
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,590
It will help tame his temperament.

206
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,359
It was merely a minor dispute today.

207
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,319
And for this,
you would banish him to Heishui?

208
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,500
Is that not excessive?

209
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,950
Aunt, are you
not settling a personal grudge?

210
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,670
I was wondering
who dared speak so rudely.

211
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,120
The Princess of Zhaoning
has been quite the spectacle

212
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,860
in the Eastern Market lately.

213
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,740
Perhaps you should be sent as well,

214
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,260
so you can reflect together.

215
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,740
I tell stories at the teahouse.

216
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,710
I earn my own money and spend it myself.
What is there to reflect on?

217
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,429
A noble lady of high birth,

218
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,430
exposing herself to the public,
performing on stage,

219
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,479
it is disgraceful and improper.

220
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,950
Oh? So me showing
my face is disgraceful,

221
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,430
but Aunt keeping musicians
and male performers...

222
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,839
What does that count as?

223
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,830
