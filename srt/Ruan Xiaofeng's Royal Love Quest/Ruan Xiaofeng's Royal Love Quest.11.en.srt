=Episode 11=

3
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,290
This is it.

4
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,890
Tell me

5
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:52,820
who's behind you.

6
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,579
Why do they need this?

7
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,860
How can you be so certain

8
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,570
this is what I'm looking for?

9
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,060
I've been by her side for three years.

10
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,180
I know all her secrets.

11
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,180
Forgive me

12
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,620
for I can't answer your questions.

13
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,980
Stay here. I'll go check outside.

14
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,010
Don't chase them.

15
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,010
Didn't I tell you to stay inside?

16
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,010
I'm worried about you.

17
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,220
Are you all right?

18
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,250
It's minor.

19
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,620
I believe
this is what we're looking for.

20
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,130
Is this Imperial Concubine Wan?

21
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,810
In the 17th year
of Emperor Jihuan's reign,

22
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,300
the sixth day of the third month,
at Bixiao Tower.

23
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,690
It draws the view
before my mother fell.

24
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,690
Who's the woman next to Her Highness?

25
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,339
She's my mother's maidservant,

26
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,580
Ren Dong, from Jiangnan.

27
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,429
It's said that my mother

28
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,970
saved her life from danger,

29
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,460
and ever since, she became
my mother's trusted servant.

30
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,090
She possessed sword dance skills,

31
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,220
which my mother then used
to regain the Emperor's favor.

32
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,740
She was also skilled
in crafting fragrances.

33
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,619
The Soothing Scent
Liu Yu mentioned that day

34
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,060
was her creation.

35
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,810
Dayuan found that scented sachet
at Bixiao Tower.

36
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,250
So that means

37
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,180
Ren Dong was the last person
by Her Highness's side before she died.

38
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,340
If we can find Ren Dong,

39
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,300
everything will become clear.

40
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,300
I searched for her,

41
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,810
but there was no trace of her.
We don't know if she's alive or dead.

42
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,810
Are there no other methods

43
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,850
besides this?

44
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,580
We need more clues.

45
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,700
If His Majesty could grant
the permission,

46
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,780
maybe...

47
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,669
What's wrong?

48
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,490
- Maybe...
- Li Rui. What's wrong?

49
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,490
What's wrong with you?

50
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,490
Let me see your wound.

51
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,970
There's poison on the dart.

52
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,820
Hold on. I'll get a physician.

53
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,700
Don't go.

54
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,650
All right. I won't go.

55
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,490
Will you be heartbroken

56
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,940
if I die?

57
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,610
I... No.

58
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,819
I'm just afraid...

59
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,050
At a time like this,

60
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,900
just admit it if you like me.

61
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,850
Yes,

62
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,220
I like you.

63
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,730

But the poison was removed in time.

83
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,820

How's it? Are they back yet?

00:09:58,990 --> 00:09:59,890
We're finished.

122
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,709
Completely doomed.

123
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,180
It's just the three of us now.

124
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,010
There's no way we can win.

125
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,460
Maybe we should...

126
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,890
This is the only option.

127
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,850
Right.

128
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,370
What did you say?

129
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,309
Lin Qi and Ya are missing?

130
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:26,090
They never showed up for rehearsal.

131
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,250

137
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,589
Qixia Pavilion is going
to lose the showdown.

138
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,460
So

139
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,940
we couldn't sit and watch ourselves
lose our jobs.

143
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,589
had no choice but to switch sides
to Yeyang Pavilion.

Switch sides?

145
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,829
