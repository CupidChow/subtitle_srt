00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,940
=Ruan Xiaofeng's Royal Love Quest=

2
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,989
Your Highness,

3
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,580
how could you leave us?

4
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,470
Your Highness, how wonderful...

5
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,550
How tragic.

6
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,750
Now your turn.

7
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,479
Asking a mute to cry?

8
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,660
What's wrong with you?

9
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,029
I said

10
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,549
it was her turn to play a card.

11
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,470
Your turn.

12
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,330
=Episode 1=

13
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,309
This is bad, Your Highness!

14
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,540
Her Highness was trying
to take her own life.

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,870
She fell from Bixao Tower.

16
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,330
(Bixao Tower)

17
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,749
When the servant found her,

18
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,940
she had stopped breathing.

19
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,770
(Li Rui, Lord Ling)

20
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,350
What's wrong with you?

21
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,700
Sis.

22
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,230
Your Highness,

23
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,790
we didn't mean to disrespect you.

24
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,719
The madiao playing was Guang's idea.

25
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,540
It was Guang.
It has nothing to do with me.

26
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,540
Guang, right?

27
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,590
It's a ghost!

28
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,660
Calm down, guys.

29
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,879
Sis, you're the calmest here.

30
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,349
Look, I'm a human, not a ghost.

31
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,119
So don't be scared.

32
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,260
I'm not a ghost. I'm a human. I...

33
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,309
(Ruan Xiaofeng.)

34
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,100
(Your slides are rubbish.)

35
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,749
(Revise it based on my suggestions.)

36
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,190
(I want it before tomorrow morning.)

37
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,259
(One hour earlier)

38
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,559
(Make three wishes)

39
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,310
Make three wishes?

40
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,279
First wish,

41
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,749
I want to get rich, obviously.

42
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,790
So I won't have to work anymore.

43
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,630
Second wish,

44
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,719
money alone isn't enough,

45
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,189
I need power too.

46
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,999
That way,

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,940
no one would dare to bark at me.

48
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,700
(Jieyou VR)
As for the third wish...

49
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,159
Please spare me, Your Highness.

50
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,399
I...

51
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,309
I was panicked,

52
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,350
so I knocked you out.

53
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,310
What did you call me?

54
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,190
Your Highness.

55
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,750
Your Highness?

56
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,540
You don't remember?

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,230
This title was given
by the late Emperor.

58
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,660
Back then, the Grand General,

59
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,239
your elder brother

60
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,840
defended the country from bandit attacks

61
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,800
and was granted
the title of South Pacification Lord.

62
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,999
And you were given

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,469
the title of Princess Zhaoning.

64
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,700
Are you saying

65
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,980
that I may not be an imperial member,

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,309
but I'm

67
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,660
a noble lady?

68
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,060
Yes.

69
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,879
Looks like my second wish

70
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,230
also came here in this dream.

71
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,910
Hold on.

72
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,359
What about the third wish?

73
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,290
(Lord Ling's Residence)

74
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,300
(This dream is surprisingly realistic.)

75
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,980
(I can feel the snow
and temperature here.)

76
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,179
♪In the scroll of bygone days♪

77
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,530
♪Love goes on like an endless flow♪

♪I gaze afar

79
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,620
(Is this my third wish?)

80
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,130
♪Feelings of the past

81
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:14,650

82
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,150
(Here he comes.)

83
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,860
(The hero who likes me.)

84
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,180
(He's coming for me.)

85
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,030
(Ow! It hurts!)

86
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,500
(Logically,)

87
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,270
(he should help me up.)

88
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,590
(What's going on?)

89
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,479
You fell from Bixao Tower,

90
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,180
but you don't have a single scratch.

91
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,910
Seems like you're really something.

92
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,500
What?

93
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,330
(Bixiao Tower)

94
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,180
Oh, right. I remember now.

95
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,100
I think

96
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,300
I fell from somewhere very high.

97
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,390
Your acting skills
have improved further.

98
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,390
The entire residence is
playing along with you.

99
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,860
You were in the coffin,

100
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,230
and yet you came back to life.

101
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,910
Came back to life?

102
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,860
Does that mean

103
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,660
I'm not

104
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,679
in a dream?

105
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,830
I traveled back in time?

106
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,149
Who are you?

107
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,590
After one fall,

108
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,149
you can't even recognize
your own husband?

109
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,270
Husband?

110
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,269
We...

111
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,509
We're married?

112
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,150
Ruan Xiaofeng,
you pretend to forget everything?

113
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,559
Do you think it's fun to fool me?

114
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,069
No. Calm down.

115
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,119
I didn't mean that.

116
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,540
Let's talk nicely.

117
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,470
I let your petty suicide tricks slide

118
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,950
back then.

119
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,470
But now,

120
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,860
why would you insult Bixao Tower?

121
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,620
Fine. Since you're desperate to die,

122
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,230
I'll grant your wish.

123
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,149
Your Highness!

124
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,069
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

125
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,359
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

126
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,069
Scaring her is enough.

127
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,960
The South Pacification Lord is currently
suppressing bandits in the southwest.

128
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,269
If anything happens to Her Highness,

129
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,790
it could have serious repercussions
for the nation.

130
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,930
(Lord Ling's Residence)

131
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,269
Can you tell me

132
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,479
what kind of person

133
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,180
Lord Ling is?

134
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,920
His Highness is the only younger brother
of the Emperor.

135
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,440
He's the son of the late Emperor's
favorite Imperial Concubine Wan.

136
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,420
When the General returned victorious
three years ago,

137
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,700
you personally requested
the late Emperor for this marriage.

138
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,620
That's how you became Lady Ling.

139
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,500
Personally requested?

140
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,420
Did I throw myself at him?

141
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,389
But why does he

142
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,749
hate me?

143
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,069
His Highness doesn't hate you.

144
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,100
It's more like
His Highness doesn't care.

145
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,740
On your wedding day, Imperial Concubine Wan
jumped off the tower and died.

146
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,860
So maybe that's why

147
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,949
His Highness and I

148
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,679
have never consummated
your relationship.

149
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,030
Besides, His Highness forbade everyone
in residence to call you "Lady Ling".

150
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,100
(I see.)

151
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,470
Lord Ling wants to see you. Hurry up.

152
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,790
There's a situation.

153
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,350
I have something to ask you.

154
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,950
Yagu.

155
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,500
Just now, I saw you and Lord Ling...

156
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,830
Don't be afraid.

157
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,900
What happened?

158
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,380
Let me see.

159
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,780
Who did this to you?

160
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,230
Was it Lord Ling?

161
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,710
What a jerk.

162
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,789
Bullying me is one thing,

163
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,230
but how could he hurt you?

164
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,070
Don't be afraid.

165
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,670
I'll demand justice for you.

166
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,980
(Bloody patriarchy!)

167
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,360
(I'll show you women
aren't here to be pushed around.)

168
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,780
Falling from such a height

169
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,100
doesn't leave any scratches on her?

170
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,070
Your Highness,

171
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,260
should we...

172
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,500
Not yet.

173
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,350
Judging by her condition,

174
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,900
she does seem to have lost her memory.

175
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,730

176
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,670
