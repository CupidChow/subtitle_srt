=Ruan Xiaofeng's Royal Love Quest=

2
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,900
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,970
I wasn't born privileged.

4
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,570
My mother was a lowborn.

5
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,800
She only had my father's favor
for a short while,

6
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,250
and then she was forgotten.

7
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,219
Back then, we didn't have enough

8
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,500
food or firewood.

9
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,330
This is our share.

10
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,540
Your Highness.

11
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,860
You must understand

12
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,429
that the emperor's favor
means everything in the palace.

13
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,810
When you're in favor, you're the master.

14
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,780
When you fall out of it,
you're worth less than a servant.

15
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:13,860
Bring it away.

16
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,650
From that day on,

17
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,900
my once gentle mother

18
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,700
completely changed.

19
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,090
That's when I learned
how to start a fire.

20
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,650
That day, my mother said,

21
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,570
"Ling, remember this.

22
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,010
Be the butcher, not the meat.

23
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,650
Only by becoming stronger

24
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,450
can we avoid being trampled.

25
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,530
From that day on,

26
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,530
she quickly regained my father's favor,

27
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,700
and I gradually stood out
among the princes

28
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,810
and earned my father's recognition.

29
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,930
But I knew

30
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,500
all of it

31
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,170
was my mother's efforts
and careful planning.

32
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,730
Life in the palace

33
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,930
was never easy.

34
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,900
The moment you reach higher rungs,

35
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,060
countless eyes wait for you

36
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,580
to fall.

37
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,530
Mother changed.

38
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,180
She became ruthless,
decisive, and overbearing.

39
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,530
But I knew

40
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,900
it wasn't truly her choice.

41
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,300
If you can't become the butcher,

42
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,340
you'll end up as the meat.

43
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,370
I'll gather some firewood.

44
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,740
Do you believe in dreams?

45
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,410
Dreams?

46
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,180
For the past three years,

47
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,130
I've had the same dream.

48
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,900
Mother!

49
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,530
Mother.

50
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,370
Mother.

51
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,829
I watched

52
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,090
my mother die right in front of me.

53
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,459
Mother.

54
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,020
Every time, I think

55
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,780
if I had moved just a little faster,

56
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,820
even a step faster,
I could've saved her.

57
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,020
But no matter
how hard I run towards her,

58
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,780
nothing ever changed.

59
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,290
Everyone called her an evil concubine

60
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,050
who would do anything
for power and glory.

61
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,650
But to me,

62
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,220
she was a good mother.

63
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,490
If it weren't for me,

64
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,820
she could've stayed
that gentle and peaceful lady

65
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,290
from the harem.

66
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,730
If it weren't for me,

67
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,970
she wouldn't have
had to suffer such humiliation.

68
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,650
This isn't your fault.

69
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,650
This world

70
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,380
has no tolerance for ambitious women.

71
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,610
What's wrong with having ambition?

72
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:37,580
Many people surrender to fate.

73
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,170
Your mother was different.

74
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,220
For you

75
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,610
and for herself,

76
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,580
she lived a brilliant life.

77
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,650
She stood on her own.

78
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,940
You should be proud of her.

79
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,700
You should demand justice for her.

80
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,530
If even you don't believe in her,

81
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,850
no one in this world

82
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,490
will prove her innocence.

83
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,780
It's been three years.

84
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,220
I thought I could

85
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,380
at least find something,

86
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,260
but this is

87
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,850
all I got in return.

88
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,050
It's all right.

89
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,580
From now on,

90
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,700
you're never alone.

It's for Imperial Concubine Wan.

Besides, I'm also

101
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,170

Watch out!

108
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,580
Are you all right?

109
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,840
Haven't you always wanted to prove that
Imperial Concubine Wan was innocent?

110
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,890
Perhaps I'm the evidence.

111
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:03,850
Sorry?

112
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,180
If this is the case,

113
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,250
everything that has happened
to me finally makes sense.

114
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,169
First, someone pushed me off
Bixiao Tower.

115
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,080
(Bixiao Tower)

116
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,739
Didn't you suspect

117
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,540
that my fall might be connected to
Imperial Concubine Wan's death?

118
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,340
During my time at Qixia Pavilion,

119
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,130
I could hardly sleep.

120
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,060
I always felt someone was in my room.

121
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,370
Who's there?

122
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,820
To test my suspicion,

123
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,370
I started leaving marks everywhere.

124
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,610
Sure enough,

125
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,779
someone sneaked in

126
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,130
while I was away.

127
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,060
Yet none of my valuables

128
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,250
were taken.

129
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,540
That means they weren't after money.
They were searching for something else.

130
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,540
That's right.

131
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,820
It was only a suspicion at first.

132
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,370
But when these assassins showed up,

133
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,090
I knew for certain.

134
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,640
Think about it.

135
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,539
We caused a scene at Yeyang Pavilion
over Imperial Concubine Wan this morning,

136
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,580
and assassins appeared trying
to kill me tonight.

137
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,369
Whoever's behind this must think

138
00:10:28,369 --> 00:10:30,600
I'm secretly helping you investigate
Imperial Concubine Wan's death.

139
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,730
That's why they want to hush me up.

140
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,499
If everything truly happened

141
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,580
the way Princess Luyang claimed,

142
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,989
then why would someone try

143
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,490
to hinder our investigation?

144
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,060
The evidence must be with me.
