=Episode 13=

3
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,460
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.
This is solely my own idea.

4
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,330
Please do not blame Xiaofeng for this.

5
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,450
Since I have given my word,

6
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:11,930
how could I go back on it?

7
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,010
Pass down my decree.

8
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,549
Bestow the Dragon
Insignia Token upon Lord Ling.

9
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,440
He shall oversee
the case of Imperial Concubine Wan.

10
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,909
All divisions of the imperial court
shall follow his command.

11
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

12
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:25,989
Thank you, Your Majesty.

13
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,090
Thank you, Your Majesty.

14
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,650
Rise, all of you.

15
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,819
I must remind you,

16
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,450
sometimes, the truth is not
as one wishes it to be.

17
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,980
I will bear that in mind.

18
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,619
Ly... Lychees.

19
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,410
Fresh lychees.

20
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,560
Today's victory over Yeyang Pavilion
is thanks to everyone's effort.

21
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,160
Drinks are on me,
eat as much as you like.

22
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,060
Great!

23
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,389
Is it sweet?

24
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,690
This is the taste I've been dreaming of.

25
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,580
I have a plan.

26
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,669
Once all of this is over,

27
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,580
I'll take you all on a trip.

28
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,180
A trip?

29
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,149
Yes, traveling to see
the mountains and rivers.

30
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,650
Going out for fun. How about it?

31
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,620
That sounds amazing!

32
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,109
Eat up!

33
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,690
They taste best while chilled.

34
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,179
Aren't you having one?

35
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,740
I won't, just enjoy them yourselves.

36
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,530
This one's huge.

37
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,690
So sweet!

38
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,109
Some people here act all high
and mighty as a prince,

39
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,820
refusing to enjoy
the food with the people.

40
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,530
Isn't that a mood killer?

41
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,579
Sorry...

42
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,949
I forgot you were injured.

43
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,949
Are you all right?

44
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,850
Are you trying
to murder your own husband?

45
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,090
Sorry. I really forgot.

46
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,500
Does it hurt?

47
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:46,370
After that hit, I'm all better now.

48
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,019
Oh, Li Rui...

49
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,360
You were teasing me, weren't you?

50
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,460
Come here!

51
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,669
Come back here!

52
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,180
- Come back! Don't run!
- No, stop it!

53
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,300

I won't.

72
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,970
How can you not?

73
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,200
The poison in your body
hasn't been fully expelled.

74
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,700
The doctor said you must drink it.

75
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,200
I was worried something might go wrong,
so I stayed up all night watching over you.

76
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,170
Did you brew this medicine yourself?

77
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,410
Are you afraid of bitterness?

78
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,139
I am a man of honor.

79
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,260
Why would I fear bitterness?

80
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,730
I got this for you.

81
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,380
Is it sweet?

Eat slowly.

83
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,619
- Give me another one.
- Too many will cause heatiness.

00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,699
That's none of your concern.

85
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,170
It's a rare occasion, come on.

86
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,059
- You just sprayed it all over me!
-I didn't do it on purpose!

87
00:06:59,060 --> 00:06:59,989
Unbelievable.

88
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,610
It's not that I don't wish

89
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,900
to laugh and joke with you all.

90
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,090
It's just that
ever since my mother passed,

91
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,170
I have not dared to smile.

92
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,780
I do not dare to be too happy.

93
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:15,850
Because

94
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,730
I fear losing my resolve,

95
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,090
forgetting to avenge her.

96
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,410
Every time I smile,

97
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,020
I recall my mother's pale face.

98
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,739
Then... Do you still remember

99
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,220
how your mother smiled?

100
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,059
She would surely love

101
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,340
to see you smile too.

102
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,900
I was teaching you to smile,

103
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,700
so why are you crying?

104
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,090
Now that His Majesty
has granted us the token,

105
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,730
our days of carefree laughter
are not far away.

106
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:34,970
Yesterday, you risked your life
to plead for the token for me.

107
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,460
I owe you another favour.

108
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,420
Then, how will you repay me?

109
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,850
Since childhood,
I have had wealth and luxury.

110
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,490
Everything around me is mundane.

111
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,730
You likely wouldn't care for any of it.

112
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,610
Only this

113
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,370
is truly meaningful.

114
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:57,949
Isn't this...

115
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,090
It is indeed
my mother's dearest possession.

116
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,320
She entrusted it
to me before she passed.

117
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,250
I have kept it with me ever since.

118
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,420
No.

119
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,349
This is far too precious,
I cannot accept it.

120
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,820
It is precisely because it is precious

121
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,060
that I feel at ease leaving it with you.

122
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,130
Very well, I will keep it safe for you.

123
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,940

are starting outside. Let's go!

124

I...

146
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,610
I took Yagu out of the city.

147
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,060
We couldn't make it back
in time for the match.

148
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,220
That's not it.

149
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,309
I got cold feet

150
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,460
at the thought of performing
in front of so many people,

151
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,850
so I backed out at the last minute.

152
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,730
Mr. Lin went through
a lot of trouble to find me.

153
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,820
It was all my fault.

154
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,130
I am the shopkeeper.

155
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,580
The responsibility is mine.

156
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,250

I cannot deny my fault.

Stop.

I'm not blaming you.

159

You returned safely,
that's all that matters.

160
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,220
You're not mad at us?

161
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,019
Why would I be? We won in the end.

162
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,259
Yeah! And we even had delicious lychees.

You two missed out, they were so sweet.

164
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,739
All right. Today has been exhausting.

165
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,010
Go get some rest.

166
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,360
