Xiaofeng!

4
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,690
Stop him!

5
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,100
South Pacification Lord.

6
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,860
You have sided with evil
and harmed the innocent.

7
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,939
You poisoned the prince
and framed the concubine.

8
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,930
Your crimes have all been exposed.

9
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,330
Today, many high-ranking
officials are present.

10
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,460
Are you planning to silence them all?

11
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,579
All of them?

12
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,290
Utter nonsense!

13
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,939
You two criminals dare to slander me

14
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,650
with baseless claims.

15
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,739
Do you think
this is some storyteller's tale?

16
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,860
Where is your proof?
Show me your evidence!

17
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,090
I didn't finish last time.

18
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,170
But this time,
I'll give you a satisfying conclusion.

19
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,810
I have the concubine's
handwritten evidence.

20
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,620
It's with Lord Ling.

21
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,549
With Lord Ling?

22
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,269
Lord Ling?

23
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,340
What evidence?

24
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:39,980
Where is it?

25
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,810
- It's real.
- This...

26
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,570
I have spoken the truth.

27
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,290
The concubine knew this day would come.

28
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,579
So she wrote a letter,

29
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,010
sealing it within this jade ring.

30
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,860
But I don't know how to open it.

31
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,780
I've never taken it out.

32
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,149
More nonsense.

33
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,340
I don't know how.

34
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,570
But someone does.

35
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,500
Who?

36
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,530
(In Ya's robe,)

37
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,220
(I found Ren Dong's sword manual)

38
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,320
(along with the diagram
to unlock the jade ring.)

39
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,829
With the concubine's letter as proof,

40
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,389
this case is ironclad.

41
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,460
- That's right.
- Yes.

42
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,340
You...

43
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,300
You forged evidence to frame me!

44
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,459
General Chen!

45
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,220
Arrest these two wretches at once!

46
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,900
General Chen.

47
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,930
Everyone here is a witness today.

48
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,229
And we have undeniable proof
of the South Pacification Lord's crimes.

49
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,709
Before all these eyes,

50
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,739
it is clear who is a traitor

51
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,900
and who is loyal.

52
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,299
As the commander of the Imperial Guards,

53
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,250
will you really aid a traitor?

54
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,900
Arrest the South Pacification Lord!

55
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,530
Don't move!

56
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,389
Xiaofeng!

57
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,930
I dare anyone to take a step!

58
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,410
If anyone moves, I'll kill her.

59
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,650
Let go.

60
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,530
South Pacification Lord, don't harm her.

61
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,019
I will plead
with His Majesty for leniency.

62
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,370
Li Rui, do you take me for a fool?

63
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,429
Tell me, what do you want?

64
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,780
I'll agree to anything.

65
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,340
Prepare a fast horse for me.

66
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,250
And all of you, get out of my way!

67
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,229
Don't listen to him!

68
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,300
Shut up!

69
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,780
Li Rui, life is full of choices.

70
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,739
Will you avenge your mother,

71
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,380
or will you save the woman you love?

72
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,140
Prepare a horse.

73
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,850
Li Rui, are you insane?

74
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,260
Do you understand
the consequences of letting him go?

75
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,090
You are a prince.

76
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,699
Think clearly!

77
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,869
Shut up!

78
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,970
Prepare the horse!

79
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,260
Dear sister.

80
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,610
Your love is truly something.

81
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,700
Li Rui wouldn't trade it for gold.

82
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,580
Let's go.

83
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,650
Xiaofeng!

84
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,610
Loose the arrows!

85
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:38,940
Xiaofeng.

86
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,170
Don't be afraid.

87
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,940

(Qixia Pavilion)

89
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,819
I heard that Princess Zhaoning
gave away all her wealth.

90
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,819
She used it all to help

91
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,530
the common people who suffered
under the South Pacification Lord.

92
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,299
Don't call her a princess anymore.

93
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,549
I heard she asked
the emperor to revoke her title.

94
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,429
She wants to live
as an ordinary storyteller.

95
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,059
Is that true?

96
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,229
She even gave up her wealth?

97
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,179
She gave up her title?

98
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,179
Just to be a storyteller?

99
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,340
