=Episode 10=

3
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,549
If everything truly happened

4
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,620
the way Princess Luyang claimed,

5
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,309
then why would someone try

6
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,660
to hinder our investigation?

7
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,070
The evidence must be with me.

8
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,190
But the real Princess Zhaoning
isn't here anymore.

9
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,070
I mean

10
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,020
I lost my memory.

11
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,559
In other words,

12
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,660
if you can recover your memory,

13
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,710
- then we...
- That's

14
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,460
probably impossible.

15
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,940
Why?

16
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,580
It's hard to explain.

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,870
Instead of waiting for me
to recover my memory,

18
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,309
it's better to look for

19
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,660
any evidence I left behind.

20
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,790
Evidence?

21
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,910
I'm sure I have something.

22
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,460
If it's not at Qixia Pavilion,

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,710
it must be

24
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,510
at your residence.

25
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,020
Let's go.

26
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,300
Your leg.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,990
It has recovered.

28
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,510
What do you think

29
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,820
the evidence looks like?

30
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,630
It can be a letter, a confession,

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,940
or something that can prove the identity
of the person behind all this.

32
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,119
By that logic,

33
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,790
anything could be evidence.

34
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,140
Look.

35
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,540
There are so many jade pendants here.
How are we supposed to find anything?

36
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,380
I think you should prepare
for the showdown.

37
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,119
If we lose...

38
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,700
Don't worry about that.

39
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,310
You sure are confident
about that silly broom-riding story.

40
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,309
I've made a bold promise,

41
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,509
so there's no way I'm losing.

42
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,629
I've entrusted this to Lin Qi and Ya.

43
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,100
They're probably rehearsing right now.

44
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,260
Hold on.

45
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,820
What did you just say?

46
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,820
What did I say?

47
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,590
That silly broom-riding story?

48
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,700
So you know it?

49
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,100
You seem

50
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,940
to visit Qixia Pavilion quite often.

51
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,940
Dayuan told me that.

52
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,190
I didn't want to hear it,
but he insisted.

53
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,190
Your turn.

54
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,030
Come on.

55
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,140
Let's stop playing.

56
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,279
What's wrong?

57
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,190
What happened?

58
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,350
Both of them aren't here.

59
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,190
Oh, right.

60
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,910
Didn't we agree to rehearse today?

61
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,069
Right.

62
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,560
How are the three of us
supposed to rehearse without them?

63
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,679
True.

64
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,629
Where did they go?

65
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,679
How would I know?

66
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,510
I couldn't find them.

67
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,189
Master.

68
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,479
You're late.

69
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,980
I got held up on the way here.

70
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,749
Someone followed you?

71
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,749
It's been taken care of.

72
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,030
Please don't worry, Master.

73
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,269
Did you get the thing?

74
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,390
Not yet.

75
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,100
It's not with the princess.

76
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,100
You need to hurry up.

77
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,060
Lord Ling is investigating
the accident from back then.

78
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,799
If the princess remembers anything,

79
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,740
things could get out of our hands.

80
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,710
You may go.

81
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,180
Yes, Master.

82
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,230
This isn't somewhere you should be.

83
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,599
You helped me before.

84
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,100
We're even now.

85
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,300
It was you just now.

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,270
What are you doing here?

87
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,710
I thought you were not interested.

88
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,790
I changed my mind.

89
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,420
Knowing too much won't do you any good.

90
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,500
If this happens again,

91
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,350
I won't be able to save you.

92
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,860
Now go.

93
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,180
Wait.

94
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,500
What if I have the thing
you're looking for?

95
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,910
Since when?

96
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,270
What's it?

97
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,420
Since when did you like it?

98
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,470
How did you know?

99
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,180
It's obvious.

100
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,860
Well,

101
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,980
it was when you left home.

102
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,910
That early?

103
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,919
That means

104
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,470
you were there when I performed
on stage for the first time?

105
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,709
If that's the case,

106
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,270
you're my die-hard fan, right?

107
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,590
That's what you're talking about?

108
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,360
What did you think I was talking about?

109
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,660
Yeah, right.

110
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,030
Did you think

111
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,470
I was asking when you started liking me?

112
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,189
Liking someone isn't a big deal.

113
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,620
Why not just admit it?

114
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,130
(Xiaofeng)

115
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,059
What's this?

116
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,880
(May my arrow fly directly
into your heart. Xiaofeng)

117
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,500
Let me see.

118
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,830
Dear Lord Ling,

119
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,269
my heartstrings are drawn
like a full bow.

120
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,830
I'm ready to release the arrow of love.

121
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,590
Hold on. This is a love letter.

122
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,060
May my arrow fly directly

123
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,710
into your heart.

124
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,429
Why are you looking at me?

125
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,620
I didn't write this.

126
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,140
Not you?

127
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,380
It says "Xiaofeng" here.

128
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,020
It was written before I lost my memory.

129
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,710
Everyone has a shameful past.

130
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,190
So many letters.

131
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,140
Stop reading.

132
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,389
Stop it.

133
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,070
Give them back to me.

134
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,100
Who was it saying,

135
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,070
"Liking someone isn't a big deal.

136
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,860
Why not just admit it?"

137
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,550
A secret chamber?

138
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,430
The evidence must be in here.

139
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,350
There are candles burning.

140
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,350
Someone's been here.

141
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,230
These look like drawings.

142
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,950
You can't write love poems,
but your drawings are pretty good.

143
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,710
Wait.

144
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,550
They look like Bixiao Tower.

145
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,020
Did the painter see something
at Bixiao Tower?

146
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,070
If there are sketches,
there must be finished paintings.

147
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,380
I'll check over there.

148
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,770
(Repudiation Letter)

149
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,100
Did you find anything?

150
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,840
(Repudiation Letter)
No.

151
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,350
Look. There are marks
where a painting used to hang.

152
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,100
Someone took the finished piece.
