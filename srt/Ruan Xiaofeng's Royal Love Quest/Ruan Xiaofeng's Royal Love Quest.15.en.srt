=Ruan Xiaofeng's Royal Love Quest=

=Episode 15=

3
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,370
Soothing Scent.

4
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,180
All right, you may go.

5
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,820
Why?

6
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,539
Why what?

7
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,179
Why won't you let me play the emperor?

8
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,629
Why am I playing the physician?

9
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,789
Why am I the physician

10
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,860
and why do I have to wear a fake beard?

11
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,450
Why aren't you stuttering anymore?

12
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,530
That's right.

13
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,869
I'm not stuttering anymore.

14
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,290
I'm not stuttering anymore!

15
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,010
It seems the key to this case

16
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,530
still lies with Ren Dong.

17
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,530
Soothing Scent was in the tangyuan.

18
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,349
When the Imperial Concubine fell,

19
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,220
she was seen at Bixiao Tower.

20
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,650
Poisoning the Crown Prince.

21
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,530
Pushing the Imperial Concubine.

22
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,420
It seems Ren Dong did it all.

23
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,010
But she was merely a lowly maid.

24
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,140
Why would she poison the Crown Prince

25
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,530
and frame the Imperial Concubine?

26
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,180
There must have been someone behind her.

27
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,460
But who was her master?

28
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,410
Who was it?

29
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,460
Where's Yagu?

30
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,130
Where did she go?

31
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,941
(First, they poisoned themselves...)

32
00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:04,120
(Then, they spread the rumor...)

33
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,120
(Brought her to Bixiao Tower
and pushed her down.)

34
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,620
Ya?

35
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,530
This prescription wasn't for me.

36
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,930
It was for you.

37
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,989
I truly don't remember the past.

38
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,780
Perhaps I made you suffer greatly.

39
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,740
I cannot change what has happened.

40
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,250
But from now on,

41
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,780
I will make it up to you. Will that do?

42
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,610
Xiaofeng, are you all right?

43
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,820
You defend her so fiercely.

44
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,730
Could it be

45
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,739
you don't realise that she is

46
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,220
the one you've been searching for?

47
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,580
Your swordplay is exceptional.

48
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,900
What is your relationship with Ren Dong?

49
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,700
She is my sister.

50
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,170
Then where is she now?

51
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,020
Shortly after the incident,

52
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,580
she was killed.

53
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,490
After the Imperial Concubine's death,

54
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,530
my sister and I went into hiding.

55
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,410
When I asked her why,

56
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,460
she refused to tell me.

57
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,730
Princess Zhaoning?

58
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,970
Ya, go buy some fruits
to entertain our guest.

59
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:31,940
Go on.

60
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,970
By the time I returned,

61
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,380
my sister was already...

62
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,260
Sister!

63
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,820
Sister!

64
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,410
Sister!

65
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,140
Sister!

66
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,820
I entered the residence as a servant

67
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,970
to uncover the truth
and avenge my sister.

68
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,900
Yet, after enduring three years
of humiliation by the princess's side,

69
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,900
I found no clues at all.

70
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,530
Until one day...

71
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,650
The night the princess fell.

72
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,700
I secretly slipped this sachet

73
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,900
into the princess's sleeve.

74
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,580
The Soothing Scent inside
was highly potent.

75
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,410
It must have left her
dazed and disoriented.

76
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,610
That night,

77
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,260
I planned to sneak
into the secret chamber

78
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,410
while she was asleep.

79
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,260
But what you didn't expect was

80
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,580
that night,

81
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,869
she was tricked
by Dayuan's forged letter

82
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,050
and lured to Bixiao Tower, right?

83
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:10,970
Yes.

84
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,290
That night,

85
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,850
I found this painting
in the secret chamber.

86
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,580
But I couldn't understand its meaning.

87
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,939
After the princess fell,
she changed completely.

88
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,170
She remembered nothing from before.

89
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,900
I thought the truth
would never be uncovered.

90
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,820
Until today.

91
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,140
Thanks to this game.

92
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,170
Three years ago, at the wedding banquet,

93
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,970
the one who poisoned the Crown Prince

94
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,739
and pushed the Imperial Concubine

95
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,020
was my sister.

96
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,340
But she was only a tool.

97
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,290
A blade used and discarded

98
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,850
by Princess Zhaoning.

99
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,140
You coerced my sister
into committing this crime.

100
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,090
Then killed her to silence her.

101
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,220
Impossible.

102
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,220
If the princess had a grudge
against my mother,

103
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,700
why would she harm her?

104
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,970
If the princess was truly behind it all,

105
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,530
then how do you explain the muting drug

106
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,140
and the assassins in the bamboo forest?

107
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,090
This is indeed my mother's handwriting.

108
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,700
There's no mistake.

109
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,370
The Imperial Concubine must have known

110
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,580
that the princess was arrogant
and willful since childhood.

111
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,300
After coming of age,

112
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,580
she became even more
domineering and oppressive.

113
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,190
Naturally, she disapproved of the marriage
between the princess and Lord Ling.

114
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,920
But the princess
was obsessed with Lord Ling

115
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,090
and used the South Pacification Lord's influence
to beg the emperor for marriage.

116
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,940
The Imperial Concubine
gathered evidence,

117
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,850
intending to present it
to the court officials.

118
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,709
She was well aware
of the concubine's attitude

119
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,619
and might have even
guessed her intentions.

120
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,370
So, she wants to be
with Lord Ling forever.

121
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,899
Don't you think
she would try to eliminate

122
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,420
the person standing in her way?

123
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,090
If she had simply killed
the Imperial Concubine outright,

124
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,660
it would have caused an uproar.

125
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,770
The emperor would surely investigate,
and she would be exposed.

126
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,370
But if she dragged
the Imperial Concubine

127
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,970
into the struggle for the throne

128
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:41,340
and then staged it as a suicide out of guilt,
the royal family, for the sake of its reputation,

129
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,139
would choose to cover it up.

130
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,340
That's exactly it.

131
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,250
As for the muting drug
and the assassins,

132
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,220
one need only ask around the city.

133
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:54,060
Princess Zhaoning
is notorious for her cruelty.

134
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,300
She has long been despised by the people.
Everyone wishes to see her punished.

135
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:00,340
It's no surprise that people
would try to harm her.

136
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,610
Look at this petition,
and you'll understand.

137
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,180
In the fifteenth year
of Emperor Huan, ninth month.

138
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,499
Princess Zhaoning seized
a young man in the marketplace

139
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,499
and attempted to make him her slave.
When he resisted,

140
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,370
she beat him to death in public.

141
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,949
In the sixteenth year, spring.
She built a private villa,

142
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,250
seizing ten thousand
hectares of farmland

143
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,899
and causing hundreds of families
to become refugees.

144
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,770
In the sixteenth year, summer.

145
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,370
She ordered a fish pond to be dug,

146
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,090
enslaving commoners

147
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,060
and causing floods
that destroyed farmlands,

148
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,660
leading to thousands of deaths.

149
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:04,080
(Divorce Decree)

150
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,610
Do you have nothing to say to me?

151
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,540
What use is explaining now?

152
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,540
Didn't Yagu just say everything clearly?

153
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,220
I don't want to hear it from others.

154
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:47,300
I want to hear it from you.

155
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,090
Even if I explained,

156
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,730
would you believe me?

157
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,420
Since you refuse to speak,

158
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,940
then let me say it for you.

159
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,010
You have nothing to do with any of this.

160
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,460
Because you are not Princess Zhaoning.
