=Ruan Xiaofeng's Royal Love Quest=

2
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,900
=Episode 14=

3
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,800
There's something off about those two.

4
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,780
What do you mean?

5
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,890
They must be

6
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,290
in love.

7
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,060
Yes, in love!

8
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,370
Don't move.

9
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,060
Mr. Lin.

10
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,170
Have you nothing to say?

11
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,570
The wound is deep,
take care while recovering.

12
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,620
Nothing else?

13
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,930
Nothing.

14
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,260
Today,

15
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,570
I owe you my life once again.

16
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,370
I shall repay you in the future.

17
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,220
Repay?

18
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,410
How will you repay me?

19
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,130
If

20
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,300
what you want is that painting,

21
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,810
then I cannot help you.

22
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,530
In your eyes,

23
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,220
is everything merely a transaction?

24
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,580
I saved you today,

25
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,500
not because I wanted repayment.

26
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,460
At least, not today.

27
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,850
Wait.

28
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,650
I've seen that painting.

29
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,060
If you want to know anything,
I'll tell you.

30
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,400
(Lord Ling's Residence)

31
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,780
Your Highness.

32
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,520
The case files from various offices

33
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,520
have been delivered as per your orders
to Qixia Pavilion for Her Highness.

34
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,460
For whom?

35
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,370
Her...

36
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,810
Your wife, Lady Ling.

37
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,970
Very well.

38
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,410
Let's go to the Qixia Pavilion.

39
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,530
The princess
will stay elsewhere for now.

40
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,899
She will reside
at Bixiao Tower for the time being...

41
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,619
What are you all doing?

42
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,829
- Your Highness!
- You're here. Come, have a seat.

43
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,179
We were just short of two players.

44
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,810
Sit down. Dayuan.

45
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,060
Come on, sit.

46
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,179
We're playing a game

47
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,579
that Her Highness developed.

48
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,829
What was it called again?

49
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,059
It's called "Script Murder".

50
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,780
Yes, that's the one.

51
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,299
I adapted the script

52
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,459
based on the case files.

53
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,989
If we play now,

54
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,829
I'll assign the roles first.

55
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,740
All right.

56
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,970
Lin Qi, you'll play
South Pacification Lord.

57
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,290
Let's go through the case once
to immerse ourselves in the roles.

58
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,610
See if we've overlooked anything.

59
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,050
Oh, dear heavens...

60
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,179
Yagu, you'll play

61
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,970
Ren Dong, the maid
serving Imperial Concubine Wan.

62
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,299
Dayuan, you'll play the Crown Prince.

63
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,820
The current emperor.

64
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,970
Wuyan, you'll play
Imperial Concubine Wan.

65
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,650
Guang, you'll play
the Crown Prince's imperial physician,

66
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,940
Physician Gao.

67
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,460
Why?

68
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,090
Silence.

69
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,220
Follow the director's arrangement.

70
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,170
Let's go over the case details.

71
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,789
That day

72
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,050
was the wedding
of Lord Ling and the princess.

73
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,619
On that day, Lord Ling
dissatisfied with the arranged marriage,

74
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,970
locked himself
in his study out of frustration.

75
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,700
Meanwhile, Princess Zhaoning

76
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,429
was placed in a side chamber
near Bixiao Tower,

77
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,730
waiting in vain.

78
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:13,050
Today is the grand wedding
of Her Highness and Rui.

79
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,819
Your Highness, South Pacification Lord,

80
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,410
I offer you a toast.

81
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,610
Wait.

82
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,380
My mother was never
as pretentious as Wuyan.

83
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,580
Why?

84
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,340
Stop interrupting. Continue.

85
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,000
At the banquet,

86
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,789
the Crown Prince ate the tangyuan
served by Imperial Concubine Wan.

87
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,380
He nearly choked to death.

88
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,490
Then,

89
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,739
Imperial Concubine Wan suddenly

90
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,850
fell from Bixiao Tower.

91
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,349
So, the key to this case

92
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,900
lies with all of you.

93
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,299
Lord Ling and I are the detectives.

94
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,700
We will interrogate each of you.

95
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,909
What... tective?

96
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,220
Detective.

97
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,739
Many ministers in court
support Lord Ling as the heir.

98
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,140
Has Your Highness heard about this?

99
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,469
There have been occasional discussions
in previous reigns,

100
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,619
but they were all mere jesters.

101
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,530
Father dismissed every one of them.

102
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,730
Oh, dear heavens...

103
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,840
The court is embroiled in open
and hidden conflicts over the succession.

104
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,360
Now, with the Grand General's victorious return,
His Majesty places great trust in him.

105
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,909
Surely, many seek to win him over.

106
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,349
Grand General,

107
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,869
where does your allegiance lie?

108
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,780
I am a man of the battlefield.

109
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,530
A mere soldier, nothing more.

110
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,140
I have never concerned myself
with court politics.

111
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,580
Therefore,

112
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,380
I side with no one.

113
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,700
The Grand General is an upright man.

114
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,370
He indeed has no dealings
with either faction.

115
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,850
It was Physician Gao who treated
the Crown Prince that day, correct?

116
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,730
Yes, it was me.

117
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,890
Then you must have quite
a bit of inside information.

118
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,130
That I do.

119
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,739
With this alliance between South Pacification Lord
and the Imperial Concubine,

120
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,709
her faction has only grown stronger.

121
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,220
Was the Crown Prince not wary of them?

122
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,420
Perhaps, fearing
the rise of her faction,

123
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,659
His Highness staged a ruse.

124
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,469
First, he poisoned himself,

125
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,739
then he forced Ren Dong to lure
the Imperial Concubine to Bixiao Tower.

126
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,880
And then he pushed her down.

127
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,300
Afterward, he spread the rumor
that she had taken her own life out of guilt.

128
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,869
Ridiculous.

129
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,139
I am the emperor's legitimate firstborn.

130
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,000
I have always been held
in high regard by Father.

131
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,520
Moreover, my relationship with Rui
has always been harmonious.

132
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,499
He has never harbored ambitions
for the throne.

133
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,019
So why would I go to such lengths

134
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,300
to frame someone
who posed no threat to me, right?

135
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,340
Isn't that right, Rui?

136
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,680
With the princess marrying
into the lord's residence,

137
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,760
is the general not afraid
of being accused

138
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,890
of currying favor
with the Imperial Concubine's faction?

139
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,220
Everyone knows

140
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:57,370
since childhood, my younger sister
has adored Lord Ling.

141
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,580
She swore she would marry no one else.

142
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,180
Even this marriage,

143
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:06,940
she shamelessly begged for it herself.

144
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,820
Shamelessly begged?

145
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,130
I can attest to that.

146
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,610
General, mind your words.

147
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,580
Oh, dear heavens...

148
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,700
Look at this.

149
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,709
This is a prescription frequently used

150
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:38,490
by His Highness the Crown Prince.

151
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:43,539
It contains Morinda root, cinnamon,

152
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,660
goji berries, and curculigo
among other ingredients.

153
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,770
What does this prove?

154
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,010
What?

155
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:59,540
It proves that the Crown Prince
has kidney deficiency.

156
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,419
I told you to find evidence, not gossip.

157
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,340
What does kidney deficiency
have to do with this?

158
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,139
You should've said
you wanted evidence earlier.

159
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,250
That, we do have.

160
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,220
Speak.

161
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,989
After the incident,

162
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,970
I examined the bowl of tangyuan.

163
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:26,220
Someone had added something to it.

164
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,220
Added what?

165
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,660
It contained albizia bark,
St. John's wort,

166
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:38,060
datura,

167
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,490
aconite, and other medicinal herbs.

168
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,940
These herbs all have numbing effects.

169
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,419
Once ingested, they cause

170
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,419
loss of throat control,

171
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,379
difficulty breathing,

172
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,770
and are highly toxic.

173
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,069
In severe cases, they can cause choking

174
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,970
and suffocation.

175
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,890
The item.

176
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,090
Soothing Scent.

177
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:09,560
