1
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,190

2
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,010

3
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,390

4
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,170

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,000

6
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,200

7
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:51,430

8
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,020

9
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:07,000

10
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:28,720
 Are you...

11
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,100
 Are you really Head Eunuch?

12
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,290
 Yes, Your Highness!

13
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,560
 It is I.

14
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,930
 Get up right now!

15
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,120
 I thought I would never get to see you again.

16
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,830
 I have no regrets, even if I die now.

17
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,670
 Have you been well all this time?

18
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,840
 I survived.

19
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,080
 I put a lot of people in trouble, but I am safe myself.

20
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,080
 How could you say such a thing?

21
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,210
 You are the only hope in Joseon, Your Highness!

22
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,310
 Father's belongings were received safely.

23
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,170
 I thought they were gone.

24
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,560
 Have you been keeping them?

25
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,710
 Please come inside first.

26
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,500
 I need to get going soon.

27
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,470
 Why did you want to see me?

28
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,130
 I am sorry, Your Highness.

29
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:41,200
 The remaining ones... need to survive, too.

30
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,670
 It's the king's order.

31
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,260
 I was told to kill Lee Seol, the deposed crown prince's son immediately.

32
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,350
 I heard warriors change the world with swords.

33
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,080
 What exactly are you trying to change?

34
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,970
 What changes by doing this?

35
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:14,910
 To warriors... the king equals the world.

36
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,320
 Lee Chang's era will... end eventually as well.

37
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,010
 Just wait and see how this era ends.

38
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,250
 On the other side.

39
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,440
 Watchman?

40
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,170
 Stop!

41
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,880
 Stop it!

42
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,690
 I do not want any more bloodshed!

43
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,040
 Who are you?

44
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,010
 Hyeon...

45
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,190
 No...

46
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,400
 You cannot do this!

47
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,810
 Hyeon!

48
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,970
 Hyeon!

49
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,863
Is it because you all have been pampered while growing up?

50
00:08:13,863 --> 00:08:16,213
You have no fear.

51
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:20,483
We are from Hanseongbu.

52
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:25,404
There was a report about a traitor sneaking inside an inn in Hanyang.

53
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,270
A traitor?

54
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,360
There is no one like that here at Ihwawon.

55
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,380
You had better be right.

56
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,070
If you want to protect this inn.

57
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,570
Take a good look. This is the last one.

58
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,380
Yes.

59
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,930
What do you think?

60
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,460
He is...

61
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,100
not here.

62
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,680
Are you sure?

63
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,480
Yes.

64
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,440
Could I see your identification tag?

65
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,230
Is there a reason you cannot show it?

66
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,580

67
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,170
The Jeong family of Naju?

68
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,075
What is your father's name—

69
00:10:23,075 --> 00:10:27,789
His Excellency Jeong Yoon, the former Inspector General.

70
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,710
The curfew bell rang a long time ago.

71
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,080
Do you work regardless of day and night?

72
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,100

73
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,870
You are not from Hanyang.

74
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,130
Where did you come from?

75
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,890
Will you tell me only after I drag you to the Hanseongbu?

76
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,660
I am from Jecheon.

77
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,780
Jecheon?

78
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,150
I heard there is a village for the Kang family of Jinju there.

79
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,550
- The name of the governor of Jecheon is— 
 - It is Kang Gi Gap.

80
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,250
He is the head of my family.

81
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,050
I see.

82
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,460
Excuse me. I am here, too.

83
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,960
Your name is?

84
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,820
It is Kim Shi Yeol. His Excellency Kim Ho Ik's 14th...

85
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,850
No, was it the 15th?

86
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,340
- Anyway— 
 - A child of a concubine, I'm sure.

87
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,940
Yes, that is correct. A child of a concubine.

88
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,790

89
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:45,130
We looked all over Jungchon, but we could not even find a strand of Lee Seol's hair.

90
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,750
What do you think of that?

91
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,050
Let us wait a bit.

92
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,430
I am sure he will be caught soon.

93
00:12:54,860 --> 00:13:00,620
Head Eunuch, I do not keep useless people around.

94
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,790
I cut them off.

95
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,410
You were cut off down there already.

96
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,860
So I guess the top will have to go. 
  (Referring to his head)

97
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:17,100
If there is anyone suspicious, I will report them to you immediately.

98
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,920
Let us go!

99
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,690
Ihwawon.

100
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:14,290
My god! It'll take forever to clean this!

101
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,700
Excuse me!

102
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,120
No need to see us off...

103
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,260
We will see each other again, anyway.

104
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,080
Where did you people come from?

105
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,880
I need to know so I can decide whether to pay off the debt or not.

106
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,230
We are from Buyounggak.

107
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,740
Buyounggak?

108
00:14:53,964 --> 00:14:58,110
At this rate, Ihwawon might just become a courtesan house.

109
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,690
What?

110
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,880
One hundred silver ingots! How will they ever afford that?

111
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,320
It does not look like they have any money.

112
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,440
You should not be saying that when you are paying for the room with credit.

113
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,590
How about you?

114
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:16,040
You said you would only stay one night. And how many days have you been here now?

115
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,050
Seriously...

116
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,270
You are running away because you have nothing to say!

117
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,870
Here.

118
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,080
Have some.

119
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,060
My goodness! This!

120
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,380
I suppose Dan Oh is not home.

121
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:02,050
- No, she stepped out for a second. 
 - Wow.

122
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:07,060
This was the reason... why they have no customers.

123
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,650
Here.

124
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,390
Gosh, have some more.

125
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,090
The dumplings are very delicious.

126
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,180
Call the government office immediately if the thugs come back.

127
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,660
Yes, sir.

128
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,870
By the way, Ma'am...

129
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:33,020
Why does Dan Oh not get married?

130
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,150
I suppose...

131
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:40,600
she would look great in a wedding gown since she is good-looking.

132
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,100
Since her parents are gone, there is no one to look for a husband for her.

133
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,020
It just got delayed for those reasons.

134
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:51,880
It's always too late when you think it's too late.

135
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,160
Shall I look into a husband for her?

136
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,100
It is okay.

137
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,240
There are a lot of young men here.

138
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,650
Maybe we could look around us...

139
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:04,060
Around us?

140
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,710
You are hurting me without words.

141
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,790
- Geez! When did I do that— 
 - When?

142
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:28,300
Just now. Those shifty eyes of yours!

143
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:32,380
Okay. My, have some more dumplings!

144
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,940
Well, I...

145
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,450
My stomach! Geez...

146
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,950
You have such a clear head.

147
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,470
You act like a horse, too.

148
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,940
A horse? What do you mean by that?

149
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,840
You are like a crazy horse.

150
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,870
He is more like a foal.

151
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:51,450
- Well... 
 - You are a loose foal.

152
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,510
Stop! That is enough, everyone!

153
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:59,200
My... feelings are getting hurt a lot today.

154
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:04,660
Have some. Najudaek would get sad if you don't finish it. 
  (It means a woman from Naju)

155
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:23,440

156
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,450
Should I make you some tea?

157
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,390
It is okay.

158
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,490
There must have been a misunderstanding.

159
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:47,140
My father could not have owed money to a place like this.

160
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:52,020
No. He does not owe Buyounggak.

161
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,640
If so... who loaned him so much money, then?

162
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,950
Even if you find out, there is nothing you can do.

163
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,120
Tell me right now!

164
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,510
It is Judge Jang Tae Hwa.

165
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:09,440
What did you just say?

166
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,860
It is Hanseongbu's... Chief Administrator Jang.

167
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,040
Miss, you know what they say?

168
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,930
Poverty is just like a cold, apparently.

169
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:31,410
You cannot hide it even if you try.

170
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,730
No matter how you try to dress properly,

171
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:38,670
you cannot hide a stitched-up broken seam.

172
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,470
What are you trying to say?

173
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:52,360
I am saying that you... have no means to pay off such a big loan.

174
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:57,140
So why do you not just give me Ihwawon?

175
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,700
I cannot do that.

176
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,690
No matter what anyone says, I will protect Ihwawon.

177
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,490
It will be taken away in the end.

178
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:19,540
Unless you can offer something bigger than Ihwawon.

179
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,160
So you need physical evidence?

180
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,690
Yes.

181
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,640
Words disappear once you speak.

182
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,620
How could I trust something that I cannot see?

183
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:59,790
This is a promissory note your father wrote.

184
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:03,580
It is his handwriting, but... how come...

185
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:07,600
He borrowed it from me to care for his young students even though he was struggling.

186
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,880
You are no longer a child.

187
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,380
You had better pay off your father's debt now.

188
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:17,390
But still... how could he suddenly borrow such a large sum of money?

189
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:21,360
I made a promise to your father a long time ago.

190
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,410
One day, if my son and his eldest daughter

191
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:30,450
get married, and we became in-laws, I would cancel his debt.

192
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,970
However, they were engaged, but they did not get to have a wedding.

193
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,540
And the debt still remains—

194
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:39,190
- That is because your son— 
 - Shut your mouth!

195
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,860
She was a part of my family since she was engaged.

196
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,900
She should have lived as a widow at my house.

197
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,120
- Sir. 
- However... your older sister...

198
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,260
used her illness as an excuse to be stuck in Ihwawon and passed away.

199
00:21:54,260 --> 00:22:00,670
So... I am not in-laws with your family.

200
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,880

201
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,550
Brother!

202
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,700
Looks like that fixed it.

203
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,050
Check if it is good.

204
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,630
Please let your hand go.

205
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,960
Right?

206
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,020
Yes.

207
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,260
- You should have let your presence be known— 
 - Did you cry?

208
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,980
N-No!

209
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,380
I did not cry.

210
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,080
You did cry.

211
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,430
You lie habitually.

212
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,240
People usually pretend they don't see it at times like this.

213
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,410
- But you really had to— 
 - Do not cry.

214
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,630
I told you not to cry.

215
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,620
It makes you look ugly!

216
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:28,990
This is why they say you should not care for someone else's child.

217
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:34,090
You show up out of nowhere and demand money?

218
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:38,330
You are not just asking for a little. You want 100 silver ingots.

219
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:42,152
- If you give me a loan, I will make sure to pay you back. 
 - No.

220
00:24:42,152 --> 00:24:45,172
I do not want to waste a single poon on you. 
  (Unit of currency)

221
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,070
I disliked you from the beginning.

222
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:56,910
Since Father brought you here, saying you were his hidden child.

223
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,460
Stop.

224
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:38,180
It is the mother of Lady Park.

225
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,420
She is here for post-natal care.

226
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:44,900
Did you go and bring her yourself? You did not send a messenger?

227
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:49,400
She was about to go into labor. It was an emergency situation.

228
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,490
Well, then...

229
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,500
Let us go.

230
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,280
Hold on!

231
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:29,640
 Your Majesty, this is Eunuch Yoon.

232
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,460
Come on in.

233
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:41,650
Your Majesty, Lady Park delivered the child safely.

234
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:44,500
How about the child? Is the child okay?

235
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,250
Yes, Your Majesty.

236
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,290
Congratulations.

237
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:51,170
It is a prince.

238
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:57,080
 In your fate, you do not have a son.

239
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,600
Is this a Sajudanja?

240
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:25,950

241
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,390
What is wrong?

242
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:42,240
What does it say, anyway? Gosh! It is so frustrating!

243
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,510
Just say something!

244
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,040
"I ask you to marry me, Maiden.

245
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,610
I heard that Ihwawon is full of debt.

246
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,810
If you marry me,

247
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,680
I will pay your debt of one hundred silver ingots right away.

248
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,650
Sir Ong."

249
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,860
Sir Ong...

250
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,180
It is him, is it not?

251
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:13,040
The one with eyes like this. The one who always follows you around!

252
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,790
How did he hear about your situation, anyway?

253
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:18,700
I will send it back right away. Give it to me.

254
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,900
Just leave it there for a bit.

255
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,740
Give it to me right now!

256
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,030
He is someone who buys people off.

257
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,360
I can never let him have my precious lady!

258
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,390
Precious, my foot.

259
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,640
No one thinks of me that way.

260
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,930
Since when was I an aristocrat?

261
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:39,550
To me, you are the most precious person in the world.

262
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,660
So you had better not say stuff like that!

263
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,820
I know.

264
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,630
But it still is an official proposal.

265
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:49,660
It will hurt his feelings if I reject him immediately.

266
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,260
I am okay.

267
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,590
Just drink it!

268
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:11,470
This might be... our last time having sujunggwa. 
  (Cinnamon persimmon dessert drink)

269
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,540
Who sent that sajudanja earlier?

270
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,620
Sajudanja?

271
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,620
Which family was it from?

272
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,430
Tell us!

273
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,350
Men understand men better.

274
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,490
Later.

275
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,930
You look very troubled.

276
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:35,230
He must be a really ugly man.

277
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,650
I mean,

278
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,670
they say you cannot live in a thatched cottage after living in a tile-roofed house.

279
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:41,990
You have seen this handsome man every day.

280
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,070
I am sure you are not satisfied with most men!

281
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,520
Yes, yes. Let us say that.

282
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,020
Just finish the rest of sujunggwa.

283
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,670
Wait. You said you will not have any!

284
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,970
I changed my mind.

285
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,190
Are you going somewhere?

286
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,900
Yes, to the market.

287
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,300
I just ran out of paper.

288
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,000
I need to go there as well. Let us go together.

289
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,360
How great. It would have been boring to go alone.

290
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,220
Gosh, so boring.

291
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:42,840
How can my day be so full of boredom?

292
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,190
Do you want to come with us, Brother?

293
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:48,490
Sure thing. Get some fresh air the first time in a while.

294
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,520
It has not been that long, has it?

295
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,460
You are going as well?

296
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:55,480
- I also have some business. 
 - Why?

297
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,050
Are you going to get your sword sharpened by the carpenter?

298
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:02,730
Should I sharpen something else... besides the sword?

299
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,180
Wh-Where?

300
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,910
Anywhere.

301
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,860
I guess you are happy?

302
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,200
What do you mean?

303
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:29,240
You just... do not seem to be thinking of leaving Ihwawon at all.

304
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,160
Are we really one family now?

305
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:38,490
I am going to take a look at some swords.

306
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,520
You all can go ahead.

307
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,360
Sure, sure.

308
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,690
Goodness, you are here, Miss?

309
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,360
Dan Oh was also a woman, huh?

310
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,890
She cannot pass by the accessory shop without stopping.

311
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,080
There.

312
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,150
I had it made with special care.

313
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:07,170
I also used only the most precious materials, too.

314
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:12,620
Goodness, I know of your skills very well, Miss.

315
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,200
There you go.

316
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,530
Five nyang?

317
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:21,880
This does not even cover the cost of the materials.

318
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,460
I used only the best ones, such as coral and wheat flowers.

319
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,660
So do not be like that and let us do 10 nyang...

320
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:30,120
One hundred silver ingots!

321
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,750
I will buy them for 100 silver ingots.

322
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,380
As long as you will marry me.

323
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,420
Anyway, you are...

324
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:42,350
bound to fall into my embrace, so just give in at this point.

325
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,450
What makes you so sure to be saying that?

326
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:50,880
It is obvious what choice a woman struck in poverty has to make. Right?

327
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,180
Stop playing hard to get.

328
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,650
Am I doing this only for my own good?

329
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:01,090
- Who are you? 
 - That is enough.

330
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,030
Are you that guy from before?

331
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,780
He still could not fix his dirty habit.

332
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:09,140
How dirty, seriously.

333
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:19,820
How many men are you seducing with that innocent-looking face?

334
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,590
A noble family's lady should know what is shameful.

335
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,720
You, Sir Ong!

336
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,560
- What? Sir Ong? 
 - Yes, you!

337
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,770
You who are rude and ignorant!

338
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:33,600
I am going to say this only once, so listen up.

339
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,070
What is this bad feeling?

340
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:44,200
No matter how the world changes, marriage is between human beings.

341
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,870
What? I am not a human being?

342
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:51,560
It is better to drown in a lake like Shim Cheong than to marry a beast. 
  (Korean folklore character)

343
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,620
Wh-Why are you suddenly speaking informally to me?

344
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,730
Do people speak with honorifics to dogs?

345
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,440
What? D-Dogs?

346
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:06,890
I refuse... your proposal.

347
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,900
Let us go.

348
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:20,010
 Poor thing. He got rejected.

349
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,480
 - How pitiful. 
 - So embarrassing. Geez.

350
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:28,980
Is something wrong?

351
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:32,290
Nothing happened. Let us hurry and go.

352
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,710
 It will be taken away in the end.

353
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:51,430
 Unless you can offer something bigger than Ihwawon.

354
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,640
Something bigger.

355
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:59,490
Something bigger, huh?

356
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:03,360
 Take a good look.

357
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,670
 This is the last one.

358
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:49,270
Goodness, there was so much trouble.

359
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:53,870
They rummaged the rooms and checked each and every one of the scholar's identification tags.

360
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,910
They also came by Ihwawon.

361
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:58,720
By the way, who is that man?

362
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,120
He did not look like an officer of the Hanseongbu.

363
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,160
But he seemed to be their company.

364
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:10,200
I think they said he used to be a eunuch who served the king.

365
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,350
After that day, he frequents Buyounggak, too.

366
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:16,850
He drinks every day with courtesans.

367
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:23,260
A eunuch... is looking for a traitor?

368
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,820
Are you not curious?

369
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:48,440
Why Lee Seol came to Hanyang... when the place is filled with people who are after his life.

370
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:56,080
Lee Seol is warning us right now.

371
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:00,640
Warning us that he will come to take this seat soon.

372
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,580
Your Majesty... today is a joyful day.

373
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:07,270
Please do not worry your mind.

374
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:09,440
We never know.

375
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,940
He might be quietly building an army somewhere.

376
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,970
Lee Seol is a traitor.

377
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:19,480
Even if he has an army, your humble servant will eradicate it by the roots.

378
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,230
I will take your word, Left State Minister.

379
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:29,720
We must get rid of Lee Seol quickly... in order to secure the prince's future.

380
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:10,700
Stop there.

381
00:38:15,298 --> 00:38:17,950
Where does the court lady go, that only the palace maids remain?

382
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:22,050
Well, Court Lady Yoon is gravely ill, so she has left the palace.

383
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,890
Gravely ill?

384
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,080
Is it really okay to do this?

385
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,530
If things go wrong while we kidnap a virgin who is not even a widow...

386
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:36,140
Does she have parents or siblings who will protect her?

387
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:39,320
- How could things go wrong? 
 - Okay.

388
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:24,380
Why did you approach me so quietly?

389
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,380
Gosh, my heart dropped.

390
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,900
Why are you so lost in thought?

391
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,610
I lost my voice from calling you.

392
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:32,760
- See? It is gone. 
 - Goodness.

393
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,900
The alcohol must be to blame.

394
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,060
You drink every other day when you have the state exam to take.

395
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,530
And you think your voice will be fine?

396
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:40,710
Are you nagging me right now?

397
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,900
It is nice to hear for some reason.

398
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,110
What is this now?

399
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:48,130
What do you mean "this"? His name is Boksil.

400
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,020
- Boksil? 
 - Yes.

401
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,990
Cute, is he not?

402
00:39:53,697 --> 00:39:55,690
There was an empty dog house on the premise but no dog.

403
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:58,390
- So I brought one. 
 - Who said you can?

404
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:00,490
My god, you do not even pay the rent on time.

405
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:02,660
We just got one more mouth to feed.

406
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:07,160
Boksil, you need to mind your manners. She is the innkeeper.

407
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:11,030
"Sister, please take me."

408
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:14,900
Boksil... I am letting you go for your name.

409
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,270
His name?

410
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:18,040
It was Boksil.

411
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,140
The name of the dog I used to raise.

412
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,680
Really?

413
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,430
This is totally fate. We are fated to raise Boksil.

414
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,160
"Sister, wait for me."

415
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,700
Dan Oh— Dan Oh!

416
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,840
- Hey, tonight is the chance. Okay? 
 - Yes.

417
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,230
- I do not want to get wet, so carry me. 
 - Yes.

418
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,690
You there!

419
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:45,040
I advise you not to cross.

420
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,260
You will be crossing over into the netherworld.

421
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:50,360
- What a crazy bastard we have here! Hey... 
 - Yes.

422
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,000
- Hurry up and cross. 
 - Y-Yes.

423
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,890
I am telling you to go over first. Go.

424
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:11,100
That crazy bastard!

425
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,890
Hey, hurry up and cross!

426
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:15,320
Hurry up and take the lead!

427
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:19,700
All right, hurry up.

428
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,370
H-Hey!

429
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:28,640
We will go get more people.

430
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,230
Hey! Where are you going?

431
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,880
Hey!

432
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,640
Where are you going? Hey!

433
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,400
Hey! Where are you all going?

434
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,710
H-Hey! Hey!

435
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:51,620
Look here. Please spare me.

436
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:56,480
I am the second son of the Ong family, one of the most wealthy farmers of Jungchon.

437
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,750
What do you want?

438
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:00,260
I will give you anything. Okay?

439
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:03,030
H-Hey!

440
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,950
Do you know who I am?

441
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:07,860
How will you take responsibility for this?

442
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,160
Instead of bossam today, 
  (Means braised pork, same spelling/sound as kidnapping)

443
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,940
I must make radish kimchi today. 
  (Name of this kimchi sounds like "bachelor" in Korean)

444
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,140
 I will withdraw my proposal.

445
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:36,360
 I will not ever seek you out, so please give him a good word for me.

446
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,240
 I am so scared of that man.

447
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,200
That man?

448
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:49,000
Wh-What does it... say?

449
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:52,460
O-Oh, here.

450
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:55,820
That man... yes.

451
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:58,270
He...

452
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:04,140
Yes.

453
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,200
Gosh...

454
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:19,290
For Brother Yoo Ha's character... he would not use his fists.

455
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:21,970
Brother Shi Yeol?

456
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:25,350
He would have been the one who got beaten.

457
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:28,910
That means the only one left is...

458
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,600
His martial skills were unlike the others.

459
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:42,240
Could it be?

460
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:46,130
Have you made an enemy with the ground?

461
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:49,410
Where have you been?

462
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:53,340
Could it be... you did not come in last night?

463
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:56,690
Do I need to report stuff like that, too?

464
00:43:56,690 --> 00:44:00,200
Well, you do not have to, but I could ask.

465
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:02,970
Excuse me.

466
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:08,530
Brother, was it you, by any chance?

467
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:11,950
- What was? 
 - Sir Ong.

468
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:15,220
Just how much did you scare him?

469
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,550
S-Sir Ong? Who is that?

470
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:20,710
You really were not the one who did it?

471
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:25,050
I am not free enough to meddle in someone else's marriage.

472
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:26,940
You saw it all at the market, right?

473
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,800
Since you mentioned marriage.

474
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:34,480
You are the only one in this house... whom the reckless Sir Ong would fear.

475
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,260
No way.

476
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,650
That was the case, though.

477
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:41,270
Well, if you say it was, I guess it was.

478
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:45,830
By the way... why would you, Brother...

479
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:47,750
Do not get the wrong idea.

480
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:49,790
I did not do it for your sake, Dan Oh.

481
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:52,500
- For whom, then? 
 - The thing is...

482
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,470
Th-The sujeonggwa tasted good.

483
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:01,090
Sorry?

484
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:25,790
Here.

485
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:28,010
Eat it on the way.

486
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:32,800
You did not eat breakfast.

487
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,740
Thank you for the food.

488
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:39,010
Also, take this.

489
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,930
Could you not refuse and just accept it?

490
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:51,000
It is not that much money, either.

491
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,100
I thought you might be able to cover the byeonri for now.

492
00:45:56,170 --> 00:46:01,150
It is because I want to stay at Ihwawon for a long time.

493
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:08,830
I will try to take care of it.

494
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:11,620
So you can stay at Ihwawon for a long time.

495
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:19,510
By the way, how did you know it was from me?

496
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:22,360
Come on. Who else would?

497
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,680
It is obvious to anyone with eyes.

498
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,800
 Brother!

499
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:19,630
 I will need to broom again.

500
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:29,040
Brother, you are... a really kind person.

501
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,210
You broom the yard when the flowers rain, too.

502
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,160
In that case... you should accept this as well.

503
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,990
I also have a sense of shame.

504
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:41,590
What kind of innkeeper borrows money from her guests?

505
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:44,000
Am I just a guest to you?

506
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,540
I am saying the inn is my responsibility.

507
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:51,580
No matter how close we are, you cannot do my work in my place every time.

508
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:53,360
All right.

509
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,570
I was being too selfish.

510
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:56,990
Not at all.

511
00:47:56,990 --> 00:48:00,000
I will gratefully accept your heart only.

512
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,020
- Anyhow, are you going somewhere? 
 - Yes.

513
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:06,200
I am going to visit my head family. I will be back quite late.

514
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,610
I see.

515
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:09,480
Please have a safe trip, then.

516
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,330
I will be back.

517
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,070
You are here? Take a seat.

518
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,470
We are on the third page.

519
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:37,240

520
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:41,250

521
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:45,360
"A young lord tries to rule the world, calling himself a king.

522
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,820
During the first year of the young king's reign, a huge series of imprisonment takes place

523
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,780
and there will be rivers of blood."

524
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,700
The young king it mentions...

525
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:55,150
- Could it be? 
 - His Majesty had a son after more than a decade, right?

526
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:57,871
The rebellious monarch got his revenge.

527
00:48:57,871 --> 00:49:01,141
Since he got a son who will inherit the throne, it will be a matter of time until

528
00:49:01,141 --> 00:49:03,010
he finds and gets rid of the "jade dust."

529
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:07,982
Frankly, the "jade dust" is like a speck of dust to His Majesty.

530
00:49:07,982 --> 00:49:10,000
Just how badly would he want to dust it off?

531
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,690
I was residing at Buyounggak a few days ago.

532
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:16,600
Hanseongbu officers suddenly barged in looking for the traitor.

533
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,810
Then, could that be the...

534
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:23,300
I also went to the tavern yesterday and they were looking for the traitor there, too.

535
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:27,070
He is trying to find and get rid of the "jade dust."

536
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:35,410

537
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:19,830
I am done for the day.

538
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:21,240
Huh?

539
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,030
I will be on my way now, too.

540
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,880
One more round and I can pay for three months' rent.

541
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:40,320
Are you the host of Buyounggak, who is rumored to be the heavenly beauty?

542
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:53,690
I heard you are staying at Ihwawon.

543
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:56,470
That is true. Did the word spread that far?

544
00:50:56,470 --> 00:51:00,210
How is living at... Ihwawon?

545
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:03,150
It would be nice for it to be as bustling as this place.

546
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:05,240
But it is very quiet.

547
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:10,100
I guess there are not that many guests staying at that place?

548
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,210
Compared to this place, there are not many.

549
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:14,530
However, there is a lot of trouble.

550
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,030
Trouble?

551
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:21,050
Since three young scholars are staying there, there are small issues.

552
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:27,080
How are the scholars you are staying with?

553
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:30,930
There must be many compromises to make if you live together.

554
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:32,590
There are a lot.

555
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,540
However, you seem to have a lot as well.

556
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:36,180
Pardon?

557
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:38,040
A lot of what?

558
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:41,010
Interest in Ihwawon.

559
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,080
You seem to be deeply troubled.

560
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:04,990
Please do not feel rushed.

561
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:09,770
A figure who spent more than 10 years in hiding... will not get caught so easily.

562
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:12,920
That is why I must get him.

563
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,520
Without fail, this time.

564
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:23,780
If the "jade dust" is caught, what will happen to him?

565
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:29,140
Since he is the traitor of the age, he will kneel in front of His Majesty. Right?

566
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:32,640
The "jade dust" will not be able to meet His Majesty.

567
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:39,740
 Because I will kill him before that.

568
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:48,210

569
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,250
How does it take forever for you to get dressed?

570
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:57,760
What are you doing here?

571
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,170
I was waiting.

572
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:00,950
To cheer for you, Brother.

573
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:04,750
Just do not get in my way. Move aside, so I can go.

574
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:17,650
Pass with a top score! You know, right?

575
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:23,040
The reputation of our prestigious inn, Ihwawon... lies on your shoulders.

576
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,780
I will consider it.

577
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:28,450
What do you mean you will consider? You have to pass.

578
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:30,720
Just pass if you can.

579
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,320
Her fingers will give if she has to twist another yeot. 
  (Korean traditional confectionery)

580
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:38,490
You made this yourself?

581
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:41,220
Of course. This much is easy.

582
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,930
You know my cooking skills.

583
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:52,870
Make sure to eat the yeot and pass!

584
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:10,280
It is now time.

585
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,630
- Go ahead and start. 
 - Yes.

586
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:30,440
We will now begin the Periodic State Martial Exam!

587
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:39,970
There!

588
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:44,050
♫  How beautiful, I hug you as I close my eyes  ♫

589
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:45,010
There!

590
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:49,110
♫  You always bloom  ♫

591
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:53,300
♫  All the roads I will have to walk  ♫

592
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:58,200
♫  I want to walk them all with you  ♫

593
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:01,700
♫  Yeah  ♫

594
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:06,360
Bullseye!

595
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:20,040
What brings you, ladies, here?

596
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:23,340
We came to take a look at our new home.

597
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:36,220
I heard it was spacious, but the rooms are smaller than I thought.

598
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:37,750
Small, my foot.

599
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:40,770
Also, who said you could take a look around right now?

600
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:42,980
Stop being so stubborn.

601
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:46,950
This place will soon become Buyounggak anyway.

602
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:50,690
Have you found a new place to live yet?

603
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:54,730
Miss...

604
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,490
It's a little too small...

605
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:01,280
Wait a moment.

606
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,540
Can we let them be like that?

607
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,850
Even courtesans think this place is their home now.

608
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:08,610
Do not worry. I will take care of it.

609
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:10,570
But there is no way out of this.

610
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:12,590
You also know well, Najudaek.

611
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:15,520
I can never give up Ihwawon.

612
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:20,110
- So— 
 - I know... why you are trying to protect Ihwawon.

613
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:21,960
I know, but still...

614
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,530
That is why. Please do as I say.

615
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:27,450
Please, I'm begging you.

616
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:34,410
Just get rid of me instead.

617
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:35,540
What do you mean by that?

618
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:39,930
This rotten body is so old now, so you will not get much money for it.

619
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:42,230
- But you will at least be able to pay— 
 - Najudaek.

620
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:44,210
Miss...

621
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:48,660
I have been... a servant of this family since birth.

622
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:50,450
This is my fate.

623
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:55,890
- So— 
 - Najudaek... you were a mother to me when I lost my parents.

624
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:58,900
Never for a moment was it otherwise.

625
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:04,430
So, please... do not even mention such a thing again.

626
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,530
Fail!

627
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:22,310
Next up, Sang Yoon of Kangsan Kim family!

628
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:24,410
Get ready!

629
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:27,120
Start!

630
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:32,200
- Oh no! 
 - M-My goodness.

631
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,480
Fail!

632
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:42,670
Are you not Left State Minister?

633
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:44,440
What brings you all the way here?

634
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,650
You are all doing great work.

635
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:47,680
Would I be allowed to spectate?

636
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,140
I am curious about this year's martial exam students.

637
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:51,890
Oh, yes.

638
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:54,540
Please come take a seat here.

639
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:06,000
Next, San of Jinju's Kang Family! Get ready!

640
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:11,470
Start!

641
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:30,460
Wh-Whoa, he is going to fall.

642
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,690
Pass!

643
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:05,640
I heard men are lining up for Hong Shim after she saw the virgin ghost by the well.

644
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:06,910
I also heard that.

645
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:12,220
That is all because of the virgin ghost's grudge since she died without knowing the taste of men.

646
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:15,000
Can we really see her if we go to the annex?

647
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,700
- Of course. 
 - Let's go.

648
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,260
You cannot go there.

649
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,020
That place is—

650
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:33,120
It is indeed quite scary.

651
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,570
Should we just go back?

652
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:37,180
It is okay. Just follow me.

653
00:59:42,490 --> 00:59:45,360
- Scholar Kim! 
 - I told you! It is already working.

654
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:48,190
- Come out right away! 
 - Sorry?

655
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:50,430
Do not look back!

656
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:52,170
Scholar Kim...

657
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:54,430
Look at me.

658
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:56,100
Come closer.

659
00:59:56,100 --> 01:00:03,480
- Hurry. 
 - Gosh, Scholar Kim... did you miss us that badly?

660
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:07,420
How ignorant of us.

661
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:19,430
G-Ghost—

662
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:24,860
Move! Move!

663
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:55,430
A ghost! It is a ghost!

664
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,510
Is something wrong?

665
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:13,010
Where is she going this late at night?

666
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:21,100
Anyone there?

667
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:33,370
I came to meet Chief Administrator Jang.

668
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:50,080
 What exactly is this place?

669
01:02:11,301 --> 01:02:15,250
You could not have already gotten 100 silver ingots.

670
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:16,740
I did not.

671
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:20,830
Then... did you come to hand over your house?

672
01:02:20,830 --> 01:02:26,740
I cannot... hand Ihwawon over to you.

673
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,930
What did you say?

674
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:33,920
Instead... I will hand myself over.

675
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:43,650
One hundred silver ingots are more than enough to house the most famous courtesans in my annex.

676
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:47,910
I am not a courtesan who sells laughter.

677
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:49,930
You cannot compare me to them.

678
01:02:49,930 --> 01:02:52,500
How arrogant.

679
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:55,970
What value would a mere being like you have for me?

680
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:05,350
Will it be... enough if I find him for you?

681
01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:11,450
How do you know whom I am looking for?

682
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:16,690
I heard... he is called by this name.

683
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:21,530
The "jade dust".

684
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:26,510
Deposed crown prince's son who disappeared.

685
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:28,410
Lee Seol.

686
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:49,830

687
01:03:55,120 --> 01:04:02,130

688
01:04:09,190 --> 01:04:11,730
 Dan Oh is looking for the "jade dust"?

689
01:04:11,730 --> 01:04:12,940
 Where did you say you're going?

690
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:15,720
 To Gwacheonhyeon. I must go.

691
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,400
 Well, then. Let us go together.

692
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,850
 I came because of you. Worried that you might get hurt.

693
01:04:20,850 --> 01:04:22,870
 Do you want to marry me?

694
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:25,160
 Has it even crossed your mind?

695
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:27,960
 Where he could be and in what shape?

696
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,170
 What is your true goal?

697
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:32,250
 The one who can find him the best is me.

698
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:35,143
 Countless people died looking for the "jade dust".

699
01:04:35,143 --> 01:04:39,760
 Do not find him. Stop looking for the one you are trying to find right now.
