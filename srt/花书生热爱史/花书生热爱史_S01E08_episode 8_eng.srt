1
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,860

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,700

3
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,530

4
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,160

5
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,160

6
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,820

7
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,010

8
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,330
Please allow me to ask you in return.

9
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,970
Why did you join Mok In Hoe?

10
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,950
Please tell me.

11
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,000
Do you wish to sit on the throne and rule the land?

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,470
How could I desire to rise to the throne?

13
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,360
I have never wished for such a thing.

14
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,170
So do not try to use me for political conflict.

15
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,480
Could I not use you just a bit?

16
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,850
Instead, feel free to use me as well.

17
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,930
A world where the poor and the lowly can also work to make their dreams come true...

18
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,140
That is what Mok In Hoe is trying to achieve, is it not?

19
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,910
I will realize that goal for you.

20
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,920
There is a solution that is the most treacherous but the quickest.

21
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,380
It is taking the throne.

22
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,820
Innkeeper Yoon.

23
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,190
How have you been?

24
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,770
Chief Administrator wishes to see you.

25
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,260
You better surrender and follow us.

26
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:15,900

27
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:27,210
I enjoyed... having you as a company.

28
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:33,520
Since I began living as a ghost, I have never talked to anyone but my family.

29
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,890
You must have been very lonely.

30
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,980
Dan Oh was always worried because of me.

31
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,520
She was afraid Chief Administrator might find out that I was alive.

32
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,120
So she made me hide in the annex.

33
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,410
So... is that why you'll leave for the temple?

34
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,130
Yes.

35
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,040
I can no longer prevent her from living her life.

36
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,190
How about you?

37
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,500
How about the fact that you have to hide in a temple forever?

38
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,290
Is that not a pity?

39
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,740
Excuse me.

40
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,850
I am here to see Maiden Dan Oh.

41
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,330
I heard she works here.

42
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,950
Do you know Miss?

43
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,880
She is in big trouble!

44
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,840
San!

45
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,900
Kang San!

46
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,890
Jung Yoo Ha!

47
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,040
Are you all sleeping?

48
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,470
What is this? Why the fuss in the middle of the night?

49
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,000
Ahjussi, I think they took Dan Oh.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,530
I went to the tavern to see her, but the Hanseongbu officers showed up and—

51
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,650
By Hanseongbu, did Chief Administrator Jang...

52
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,330
What did you say?

53
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,740
This was found when we searched you.

54
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,230
What is this?

55
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,430
It is a compass.

56
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,600
I heard it is useful when you travel.

57
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,560
So I bought it at a store.

58
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,630
You underestimate me.

59
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:47,560
This is not something worthless you can buy anywhere.

60
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,740
Jade. The name is Pyeong.

61
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,860
It is a precious name that can only mean one person.

62
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,480
Lee Pyeong.

63
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,240
This used to belong to the deposed crown prince.

64
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,790
How did a lowly thing like you end up with this?

65
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:23,310
You must have... indeed found the "jade dust".

66
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,870
How dare you play me?

67
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,670
Even if I told you the truth, you would never believe me.

68
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,350
You already doubt me.

69
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:45,260
You should just kill me.

70
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,750
You want me to kill you?

71
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,420
Is the "jade dust" that important to you?

72
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:54,620
I am sure... you will not believe me.

73
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:00,120
I will make you say something trustworthy to me.

74
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:12,530
I will cut your throat in public for committing treason today.

75
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,070
Why are you all out here?

76
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,980
What took you so long? All hell has broken loose right now!

77
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,630
San.

78
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,680
Listen to me without getting too upset.

79
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,740
Dan Oh... has been captured.

80
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,850
I... just knew him as a child!

81
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,830
Tell me all the details. If you try to be clever—

82
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:00,330
Several decades ago, it was at my father's funeral.

83
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:06,960
That day, young Lee Seol broke into Ihwawon and I helped him hide.

84
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,380
He gave me that compass to express his gratitude then.

85
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,630
On the day of Yoon Won's funeral was—

86
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:22,130
It was the day the deposed crown prince died and his eldest son Lee Seol ran away.

87
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:27,890
If you are telling the truth, the "jade dust" must owe his life to you.

88
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:32,170
It was too long ago to say that.

89
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:37,090
If so... who came to the temple that day?

90
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,460
Was it Lee Seol?

91
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,180
I do not know.

92
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,780
I have never seen the "jade dust" again since then.

93
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,810
Why would I not have told you if I had found him?

94
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,130
I would not know.

95
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,280
If you knew as a child, you could have grown fond of each other.

96
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,460
I am not stupid enough to hide a traitor.

97
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:14,020
Why would I volunteer to become a traitor because of someone I knew as a child?

98
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,900
 What are you doing here?

99
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,010
 Stop right there!

100
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,080
Leave him.

101
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,450
You are His Excellency Jung Yoon's son with the concubine.

102
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:41,360
How could the chief administrator of Hanseongbu kidnap a young woman?

103
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,250
- If people find out— 
 - This is too great of a matter for you to get involved.

104
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,000
You should leave now.

105
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,540
I need to get involved!

106
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,110
You took Ihwawon from her.

107
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,270
Do you need to interrogate her further?

108
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:07,170
It looks like you care about Dan Oh greatly.

109
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,510
You ran over here looking so pale.

110
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,690
Thinking about it, you were at the temple that day—

111
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:18,150
I will pay off her debt. Please let her go.

112
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:26,700
All of this happened because of a hundred silver ingots.

113
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,080
I do not know what to say.

114
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,380
You gave so much money to Chief Administrator because of me—

115
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,100
Do not mention it.

116
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,490
I did it so I could be at ease.

117
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,220
Let us go.

118
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,940
I did not think you would let her go so easily.

119
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,040
You even gave her Ihwawon back.

120
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,240
Thanks to that, I have a decoy under my foot.

121
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:50,870
That child must be set free in order to catch Lee Seol and Watchman.

122
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:57,870
If Yoon Dan Oh had saved Lee Seol's life, I am sure he will show up again.

123
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,280
You were with Young Master Yoo Ha!

124
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,430
Goodness, thank you!

125
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,700
Where is Sister?

126
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,520
She is in her room.

127
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,610
She has not slept at all.

128
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,150
She has been waiting for you.

129
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,580
What took you so long?

130
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,620
I have been waiting for you all this time.

131
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,430
I thought I should at least say goodbye.

132
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,030
Sister!

133
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,540
Take this.

134
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,060
Hurry.

135
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,340
I was going to give it to you when you got married.

136
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,420
Sister, hold on!

137
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:10,050
We... can go back to Ihwawon!

138
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:14,060
Brother Yoo Ha paid off my debt for me.

139
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,870
That is a relief.

140
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:20,310
But... nothing will change even if I went back.

141
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,020
I still need to live as a ghost.

142
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,930
I will get going now.

143
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,320
Najudaek,

144
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,130
please take good care of Dan Oh.

145
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,540
You should get to work now.

146
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,150
Let me pour you a drink.

147
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,930
Treat him well.

148
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,660
I will get going then...

149
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,070
I have something I want you to do in secret.

150
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,150
Feel free to tell me, sir.

151
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:01,980
Become friends with Yoon Dan Oh.

152
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,730
Those rotten scoundrels at Buyounggak!

153
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,380
When did they remove the sign, anyway?

154
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,530
Ahjussi, we are back.

155
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,450
Goodness! There you are!

156
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,200
I am glad to see you, too, Najudaek.

157
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,770
I missed your cooking so much.

158
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:36,520
- Are you serious? 
 - I saw you enjoying the food.

159
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,920
You were so impressed with Buyounggak's cook.

160
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,300
Of course.

161
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:45,560
Looks like you got a little plump, too!

162
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,430
You little...

163
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,890
Looks like you got plump just on your lips!

164
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,550
San went to martial arts training.

165
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,070
I thought you might be curious.

166
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,110
I see.

167
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,180
Brother,

168
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,780
- could I talk to you for a second? 
 - Oh, yes.

169
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:21,140
Is... Lady Hong Joo not coming back?

170
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:25,380
No. She was more determined than I thought.

171
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,700
She can get married now!

172
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,270
He was right here all this time. We were looking too far away.

173
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:38,050
You mean, Miss?

174
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:42,410
I got it as an inheritance when Mother passed away.

175
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,240
I wanted to put it to good use.

176
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,250
But... do you really want to pay me back?

177
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,510
Yes. I will pay you back little by little.

178
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:54,490
There is the monthly rent, and if I get paid from the tavern—

179
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,740
It would take forever to pay back a hundred silver ingots.

180
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,900
Well...

181
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,860
I might not be able to pay you a lot at once but at some point—

182
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,010
Okay.

183
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,280
Go ahead and pay me little by little.

184
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,970
Often. Here and there.

185
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,730
Here and there?

186
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:16,950
I might see you twice a day like this.

187
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,950
When did you come back?

188
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,090
You should have told me that you were here.

189
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:45,170
Why are you using a real sword again?

190
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,090
What dangerous thing will you do?

191
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,500
Sit down.

192
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,350
You must be tired from training.

193
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,760
I am okay.

194
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:34,430
You must have... worried a lot last night, too.

195
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,880
- Because of me. 
 - Worry?

196
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,300
Why would I?

197
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,530
Pardon?

198
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,520
By the way, what are you doing here?

199
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,000
Can you walk around in Hanyang like this?

200
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,740
The thing is... I get to come back to Ihwawon.

201
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,930
That is good.

202
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,060
But what will you do with Chief Administrator?

203
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,240
It worked out.

204
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,550
Brother Yoo Ha helped me.

205
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,120
Is that so?

206
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,470
Yoo Ha must have done something great.

207
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,490
Do not worry.

208
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:09,920
I did not say a word about Watchman.

209
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,130
Do you still think I am Watchman?

210
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:28,410
You said Watchman is a shadow who protects Lee Seol. Right?

211
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,940
Instead of a shadow,

212
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:41,550
can you not just be Kang San, a military service applicant?

213
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:48,420
Instead of protecting Lee Seol, can you not protect yourself instead?

214
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,450
I will.

215
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,850
I am trying to protect.

216
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,080
Steadily.

217
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,570
Do not just be steady. Be enthusiastic!

218
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,470
- If you do not do that— 
 - If I do?

219
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,720
I will blame you!

220
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:09,900
Until that bamboo blossoms.

221
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:14,440
Do you mean you will think of me for that long?

222
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,500
It would take about a hundred years for bamboo to blossom.

223
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,260
Do not laugh! I am serious.

224
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,810
When the time comes, I will tell you everything.

225
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:33,220
Without hiding anything.

226
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,200
Everything.

227
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,660
Will that day even come?

228
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,120
The day I put on the hat given by the king for passing the state exam,

229
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,460
I will tell you then.

230
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,270
It will not be so easy to pass the state exam.

231
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,250
You are so arrogant.

232
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,570
It will be easier than making you stop doubting.

233
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,570
Ban Ya!

234
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:08,160
Why are you coming out of my room?

235
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,730
I have been staying there while you were gone.

236
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,700
- I am here to collect my things. 
 - I see.

237
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,400
Did you get everything?

238
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,100
Yes.

239
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,070
I am sorry about all the trouble.

240
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,690
Do not mention it.

241
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,560
I am just happy to see you again.

242
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,160
Thank you for saying that.

243
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,180
Talk to me casually.

244
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,090
We agreed to become friends if we saw each other again.

245
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,800
How could I...

246
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,360
There is still a difference in class.

247
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,430
Being friends is not a big deal.

248
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:45,040
If you come by to chat and share drinks, that would make us friends.

249
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,580
Chatting and drinking.

250
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:54,100
If it is something like that, I would be happy to.

251
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,330
Visit Ihwawon often.

252
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,730
- Would that be okay? 
 - Of course!

253
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,900
Anytime.

254
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,830
Your Majesty, I came here to ask you a question.

255
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,960
What is it?

256
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,120
It is about the Watchman.

257
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:25,450
Some say the Queen Mother's Palace funds him. Is that true?

258
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,920
It is.

259
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,900
Why do you just sit and watch, then?

260
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:34,050
I once pushed Queen Mother to come clean about Watchman.

261
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:39,740
And she bit her tongue and tried to commit suicide.

262
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,800
The palace was turned upside down then.

263
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:47,830
Court Lady Kim of Queen Mother's Palace seems suspicious.

264
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:53,350
I heard that she has been leaving the palace often.

265
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,890
Court Lady Kim?

266
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:02,380

267
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:07,510
Why is Mr. Yook Ho not coming? He must need exam papers, too.

268
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,740
He is not feeling very well.

269
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,930
He gets sick whenever the exam approaches.

270
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,390
Is that so?

271
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:17,030
There was a reason why he got such poor scores.

272
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,660
Oh?

273
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,550
You put the sign back on.

274
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:24,210

275
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,360
You are so attentive.

276
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,260
You always take care of even small things like this.

277
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,890
What?

278
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,270
Let us go!

279
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,340
Gosh! That temper.

280
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,980
Let us go before he starts complaining again.

281
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,360
The place looks a bit empty today.

282
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,460
Yoo Ha is growing on me.

283
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,660
What do you mean?

284
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:59,470
He was generous enough to take Ihwawon back at once.

285
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,010
Look at him now, too.

286
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:03,310
He is grabbing that expensive rice cracker like that.

287
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:06,730
He is a man of wealth, unlike us.

288
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,020
What a shame.

289
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,630
If I were a woman, I would have been Dan Oh's rival.

290
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,340
It would have been so fun!

291
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,920
Fun, my foot.

292
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,370
By the way,

293
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:21,080
Mr. Yook Ho and Najudaek are so eager to make those two a pair.

294
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,230
They would push them to get married in an instant.

295
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:27,500
What? No way!

296
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,200
Goodness, you could start a fire with those eyes.

297
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,980
What? Do you hate it that much?

298
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,250
Try some of these.

299
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,970
- Brother Yoo Ha bought these— 
 - No!

300
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,410
I hate it!

301
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:38,990
Pardon?

302
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,100
Forget it if you do not want it.

303
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,960
He has been so grumpy since earlier.

304
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,310
You are right. What is wrong with San, anyway?

305
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:57,460
Is it because he is heartbroken? Sweets are the best at times like that.

306
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,750
- Try some! 
 - Could you shut your mouth?

307
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,140
What is going on?

308
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,550
What?

309
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,050
Let us check it out.

310
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,980
What are they getting executed for, anyway?

311
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,350
They apparently had some forbidden book.

312
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,030
 I changed it like this. How is that?

313
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,390
 I think that would be okay.

314
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,610
Hey!

315
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:53,310
Let us go.

316
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,420
Let us go.

317
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:03,360

318
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,580
Do you still have that thing?

319
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,730
What?

320
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,750
- Three secret something. 
 - Why?

321
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,060
- What if I did? 
 - You saw it, too!

322
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,800
People's throats are getting cut off because of that—

323
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,570
Of course, I saw it.

324
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,030
The country is going insane.

325
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:21,000
I know.

326
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,400
Be careful not to get swept away by this crazy world.

327
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,580
We took good care of the body.

328
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,800
When the weather clears up, we will bury him in a sunny spot.

329
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:48,000
You would... be able to have a funeral for Scholar Kim then.

330
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,340
Thank you so much!

331
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,770
Thank you!

332
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:59,810
The king is crazy.

333
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,490
I guess he will accuse the whole country of being treacherous.

334
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:05,790
I wonder how far the king's madness will go.

335
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:08,200
I am very afraid.

336
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:17,650
 Rise to the throne?

337
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:23,400
 You are partially to blame for Joseon's condition since you did not advise the king properly.

338
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,060
 It is my fault for tolerating the immoral king all this time.

339
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:33,700
 But I cannot allow the inhumane king to destroy this country.

340
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,300
 What do you mean by that?

341
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:40,480
 The prince is not Royal Consort Park's biological son.

342
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,360
 He made the fake prince a future crown prince.

343
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,550
 The royal line will certainly end down the road.

344
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,860
 And if the royal court finds out about this—

345
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:50,790
 The palace and the country will be in distress.

346
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,800
 But how could I possibly take the throne—

347
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,090
 You were born valuable, so be used for a valuable purpose.

348
00:26:56,090 --> 00:27:00,060
 Moreover... you have people who trust and follow you.

349
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,560
 Mok In Hoe does not know who I am.

350
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,500
 They will find out soon.

351
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:09,960
 They... will open your path to the throne.

352
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,600
 Please take on this great cause.

353
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,110
 Great cause.

354
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:23,050
 Great cause...

355
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,340
Brother.

356
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,630
Have you not seen Bokshil? I have not seen her for days.

357
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:46,140
You did not know? Bokshil ran away at night.

358
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,190
- Just like you. 
 - Pardon?

359
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,730
Bokshil ran away from home?

360
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,740
She has nowhere to go.

361
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,160
I guess she is having a love affair or something.

362
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,000
She was going to the mountains and fields with the dog next door.

363
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,890
Just like you-know-who.

364
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:02,740
You must have nothing to worry about.

365
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:07,220
You didn't care if I disappeared or not.

366
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,770
Well...

367
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,700
The sign...

368
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,340
I heard you put it on.

369
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,240
Why did you not say anything?

370
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,760
You made me get the wrong idea.

371
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,640
This is still an inn.

372
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,550
It would not be proper not to have a sign.

373
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,280
Right.

374
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,800
You know, the "jade dust"...

375
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:54,660
You have... seen him, right?

376
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,140
What?

377
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:01,770
Could you tell him this if you get to see him?

378
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:05,920
That I am sorry I could not keep the secret as I promised.

379
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,730
Secret?

380
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:22,200
Actually, the "jade dust" has been to Ihwawon before.

381
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,930
Is that so?

382
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,820
It was when we were very young.

383
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:33,700
He was trembling his little body inside that dog house.

384
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,200
 He was afraid he might get caught.

385
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:48,500
If so, you must have saved the "jade dust's" life.

386
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:52,140
I was actually the one who was comforted.

387
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:59,240
The day Father passed away, I was able to hang in there because of the "jade dust".

388
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:04,780
That is why I feel bad... that I let him take the compass.

389
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:07,400
Compass?

390
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:15,800
The "jade dust" told me that he was giving me the most valuable thing he had.

391
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:20,460
I guess he was grateful that I had saved him.

392
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,000
I did not know then.

393
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,400
But I know now.

394
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:34,300
A parent's keepsake means the world to a child who lost his parents.

395
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,500
He gave his everything to me.

396
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:44,100
I let Chief Administrator take such a precious thing.

397
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,000
Well done.

398
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,700
He probably thinks it was the right thing to do.

399
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,400
I am saying the "jade dust" probably wished for the same thing.

400
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,990
I was curious from time to time.

401
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,500
He must be an adult by now... I wonder how he has grown up.

402
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,300
How do you think he turned out?

403
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,200
He was handsome even as a child.

404
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,400
If he matured without big change, he should be quite handsome—

405
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,400
Please leave out this part.

406
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,000
I cannot believe the stuff I am telling you...

407
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,800
You must be the one who told Left State Minister about me.

408
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,400
Since you are also the one who gave me the Crown prince's will.

409
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:14,700
If your identity is exposed, Scholar Jeong... your life will be in danger.

410
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:19,600
At least for your own safety... it is proper for you to take the throne.

411
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,700
I cannot pursue the throne just for my own safety.

412
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:28,300
You grew up in sorrow among regular people when you are a noble being.

413
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,000
I trust that sorrow.

414
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:38,400
You are the only one... who will embrace the people's hearts with sincerity.

415
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,800
To our next meeting... please bring the inheritance.

416
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,000
By inheritance, you mean...

417
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,600
I mean the keepsake... the crown prince left to you.

418
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,400
How have you been, Maiden?

419
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:05,100
Wait... what are you doing here?

420
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,000
Giving me the cold shoulder as soon as you see me?

421
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,800
- Let us go inside— 
 - It is forbidden to men, so leave, please.

422
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,600
My ankle must be tired from hiking such a tough mountain for the first time.

423
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,700
I do not think I can go back like this.

424
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,300
Did you sprain it?

425
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,400
Stand up for now, please.

426
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,200
I absolutely do not think I can stand up at all.

427
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,800
It hurts.

428
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,100
Then just for a moment...

429
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,600
It hurts a lot.

430
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,600
Could you give me a hand?

431
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,150
You can use that.

432
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,000
How can you smile like that after getting hurt?

433
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,200
It is because the monk's robe does not fit you at all.

434
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,100
Since your pain went away, just finish your meal and go back down.

435
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,900
I do not have the energy to lift the spoon.

436
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,400
I think I will just lie down and rest.

437
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,400
Scholar Kim...

438
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,900
Just think about it.

439
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,200
If I wander the mountain with a sprained ankle and

440
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:50,400
run into wolves or wild dogs, I cannot even run away. Oh, my...

441
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,800
There you go with your words.

442
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,300
Goodness, I do not even want to think about it.

443
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,600
How can I cause such sorrow in your heart?

444
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,800
Just rest for a little while.

445
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,100
Only for a short while. Okay?

446
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,300
What a daring woman.

447
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:44,000
She comes here to earn pocket change?

448
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,500
What if she gets taken away again?

449
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,400
Is that true?

450
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,700
The scholar who gave Ban Ya her first night is from Ihwawon?

451
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,900
Yes, I am telling you it is true.

452
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,100
Gosh, what was his name?

453
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,200
Was it San of the Kang family?

454
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,400
No way.

455
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,000
How can Scholar Kang San be with Ban Ya...

456
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,200
I also want to try delving into the insides of such a handsome man.

457
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,400
- Whoa! 
 - It must be splendid. Right?

458
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,600
You must be back in Hanyang, huh?

459
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,500
I heard you went bankrupt and got kicked out.

460
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,000
It is, as you can see.

461
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,200
I will never be leaving again.

462
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,600
What the heck?

463
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,400
I am going now.

464
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,200
Did you come for a day drink at such an early hour?

465
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,600
I am only waiting for someone.

466
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,400
You can come whether it is day or night.

467
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,400
I will be the first one to serve you.

468
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,100
To be honest... other courtesans

469
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:00,800
know you were the man who gave me my first night.

470
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:06,000
However, I did not get any token of gratuity, so my reputation is...

471
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,600
You want a token of gratuity from me?

472
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,100
Even the smallest thing is okay.

473
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,600
It just has to be anything you have.

474
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,400
Go and get yourself clothes or something.

475
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,120
Thank you, Scholar Kang.

476
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,600
By the way, what is your original name?

477
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,150
Ban Ya must be your courtesan name.

478
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,900
It is Lim Seo Hyeon.

479
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,900
Seo Hyeon, huh?

480
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:47,000
Your father gave you a great name.

481
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,300
I will buy my freedom as soon as possible and get my name back.

482
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,500
That is my only wish.

483
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,200
You will definitely make that happen.

484
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,200
Scholar...

485
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,800
Soo Hyang would like to pour you a drink.

486
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,900
It is fine.

487
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,700
You, over there.

488
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,800
Yes, you come and pour me a drink.

489
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Were you... talking to me just now?

490
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Yes.

491
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,800
You look better than most courtesans.

492
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:32,400
If mopping is hard, should I help you with your first night?

493
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,000
Wait, Scholar...

494
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Despite her shabby appearance,

495
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,800
she is still a lady of a noble family.

496
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,300
She is not a low class?

497
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,200
Soo Hyang, you must be joking.

498
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,000
Just pour me a drink.

499
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,900
I will pay you handsomely in tips...

500
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,700
Maiden.

501
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,500
Will one glass do?

502
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,700
Fill it to the brim.

503
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,000
Has she gone mad?

504
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
- What are you doing? 
 - I do not need your tips.

505
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,600
Go buy yourself clothes.

506
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:19,300
You look like a toddler who is not even potty-trained.

507
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,600
It seems to me that you lost here.

508
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,900
How dare you shabby-looking thing—

509
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,200
Who are you?

510
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,600
Are you that bitch's pimp?

511
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,400
Get lost.

512
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,000
If you come back, I will break your useless head, too.

513
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,900
Let go.

514
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,400
Let me see you. Are you okay?

515
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,500
- You! 
 - Brother, behind you!

516
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,300
Move aside. Make way!

517
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:24,510
I heard you got badly injured.

518
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,400
Please take a good look.

519
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,300
He is a warrior, so his body is his best property.

520
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,400
Please take off your clothes first.

521
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,200
What are you doing?

522
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,200
You must show him your injury if he is to treat it.

523
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,500
Why? You're going to watch, too?

524
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,100
- Well then... 
 - O-Oh... no!

525
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,600
I will remain outside.

526
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,500
Don't worry.

527
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:04,300
Nothing is broken, so it will heal soon.

528
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,800
I will be relieved if that is the case.

529
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,800
Why did you go to Buyounggak and get mixed up in someone else's business

530
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,600
Someone else's business?

531
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,800
The distance between us has grown in mere moments.

532
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,400
Right. It is not that you had no business.

533
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,800
You went to flirt with women first thing in the day, right?

534
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,200
What do you mean, flirt?

535
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,000
I have no idea what you are going on about.

536
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,200
I mean, the final exam for martial arts is tomorrow, is it not?

537
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,600
Would you even be able to pass when

538
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,300
you are so drunk in women, right before the exam?

539
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:37,200
You already forgot about the promise... you made with me, did you not?

540
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,390
What in the world are you saying?

541
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,700
Say it properly, so I can understand.

542
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,750
I heard...

543
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,000
you gave Ban Ya the right to put her hair up. 
  (Spending the first night.)

544
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,600
I heard everything the courtesans said.

545
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,200
What?

546
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:06,800
I only saved her since she was in danger.

547
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,200
Th-Then... what I heard was...

548
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,400
Not true.

549
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,000
Do not worry.

550
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,400
Although I cannot buy you sweets, I will keep my promise.

551
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,200
Sweets? What are you talking about?

552
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,600
I am not one to fail because of a mere arm injury.

553
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I was not telling you to keep your promise right away.

554
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,800
- After your shoulder heals... 
 - Forget it.

555
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,300
Someone lavished silver ingots on someone else's business.

556
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,000
I should at least wear the hat given by the king.

557
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,400
Did he leave already?

558
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,600
Without saying goodbye?

559
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,380
What is all this?

560
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,600
It is Ihwawon.

561
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,200
I thought you might miss this.

562
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,500
I have no intention of going back to Ihwawon.

563
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:34,910
That resolution of yours... is very similar to Dan Oh's.

564
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:37,900
Dan Oh is the one who takes after me.

565
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,700
The sun will set soon. Please make your return.

566
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,900
And do not come back here again.

567
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,700
All right.

568
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:51,100
Since you insist, I will take my leave now.

569
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,600
Everyone is waiting for you.

570
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,500
Dan Oh...

571
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,500
Najudaek... and Mr. Yook Ho, too.

572
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:18,600
So if you ever change your mind,

573
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,600
feel free to come.

574
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:51,860

575
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:55,800
Seeing how you are at the temporary palace...

576
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,200
Your Highness must be feeling ill.

577
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,600
How can I be in good health?

578
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:05,800
I am a mother who lost two sons,

579
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:13,100
and a failure of a mother who could not even stop her son from killing his brother.

580
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:17,000
Please do not say such a tragic thing.

581
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,600
Your Highness...

582
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:22,000
do you, perhaps, have a secret order...

583
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,400
to give to a retired eunuch?

584
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:34,400
I guess you have survived so far... thanks to your keen insights.

585
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,200
However, I no longer belong to the Eunuch's Bureau...

586
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:42,900
so orders alone are not enough to move me.

587
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:47,400
In that regard, I will not disappoint you.

588
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:55,400
Although I failed as a mother, I will not fail as a queen mother.

589
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:01,100
My son, Chang, will not last long.

590
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,400
After a tyrant is gone,

591
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:11,400
establishing a proper kingship... would that not be a queen mother's duty?

592
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:29,400
I heard you did not open your mouth the entire time.

593
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:34,400
You are just as stubborn as my mother, you wench.

594
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,400
I shall kill you if you do not talk.

595
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,700
I killed my own blood...

596
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,400
You think I will not kill you?

597
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,500
I do not know.

598
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,200
I cannot say anything.

599
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:54,100
I cannot put the Royal Family in danger—

600
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:19,000

601
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,300
I wish we took the state exams every day.

602
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:30,100
It is a shame to finish a spread like this in one day.

603
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,800
It must have been tough to prepare all this food since morning.

604
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,800
- Thank you for the food. 
 - Sure, Ahjussi.

605
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,500
Eat up to your heart's content and do well on the exam.

606
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,800
Why did you give him chicken porridge?

607
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,500
What if he eats porridge and does poorly? 
  (Korean superstition)

608
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,500
Whether he makes porridge or rice out of it,

609
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:51,800
he needs good digestion first to take the exam.

610
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,200
Goodness, Najudaek...

611
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,600
Here comes His Majesty!

612
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:20,400
Then, we shall begin.

613
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,400
Gun An of the Yoon family, prepare yourself!

614
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,900
It is going to take forever to proceed one by one.

615
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:31,600
Just divide them into two teams and make them compete.

616
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,800
Your Majesty,

617
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,700
if we hold a competition without any preparations, there will be tons of injured men.

618
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:40,000
Are my future warriors really that fragile?

619
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,900
However...

620
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:47,600
I hate watching boring fights.

621
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,800
Do not hold back.

622
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:54,600
If you lose the competition... it means you failed.

623
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:58,000
If we lose, we fail?

624
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,600
He is telling us to fight with our fists, is he not?

625
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,000
I expected a lot when I heard His Majesty would be watching in person...

626
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,300
Gosh, what the hell is going on?

627
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,000
Good luck with your exam.

628
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,800
First place will be good enough for me.

629
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,200
I will do my best.

630
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,400
Thank you for the meal today.

631
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,300
You must be tired. Go take a break.

632
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,000
All right.

633
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:26,000
You are quite enjoying that.

634
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
You are not being fair.

635
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,300
You tell me to enjoy the sweets and tell Yoo Ha to take first place?

636
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:34,400
You should not harm Ihwawon's reputation, at least.

637
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,200
You know you all have to pass, right?

638
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,200
This is what I think.

639
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,200
With my looks, if even my academics are outstanding, would that not be unfair?

640
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,200
Please give it a try, at least.

641
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,000
- Use all unfair means you have. 
 - Wake up, Dan Oh.

642
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,100
Never mind me. It would be impossible for everyone to pass.

643
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,960
Here, have this.

644
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,790
Relax. It is not like this is your first time.

645
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:07,480
Who said I am nervous, huh?

646
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:11,320
I am fine. I am totally fine.

647
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:17,820
If you fail again this time, it means you did poorly after eating porridge.

648
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:21,020
Najudaek! Why would you jinx me like that?

649
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:26,120
If you happen to fail, it is all my fault for making the porridge...

650
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,940
so take those chips off your shoulders.

651
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,800
All right.

652
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,800
This time, I should really...

653
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,710
certainly, and finally pass...

654
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:40,440
All right, all right. Stop talking and copy me.

655
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:43,400
Breathe in, breathe out.

656
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:55,500
I'm going to see the scholars off and do some grocery shopping.

657
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,120
All right, take care.

658
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,070
- I'm leaving, Dan Oh. 
 - Have a safe trip.

659
00:50:58,070 --> 00:50:59,860
I will be back.

660
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:20,230
I wonder if his exam is going well.

661
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:22,970
He should not overexert himself.

662
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:26,790

(An obscure compilation of speeches and records of major political conversations dating back to Confucian China.)

663
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:34,340

664
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:36,550
Three Secret Prophecies of Joseon?

665
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:39,690
Why is this here?

666
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:43,620
He will be in trouble if he is found with this.

667
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:51,020

668
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:27,040
Catch!

669
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,420
Pass!

670
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:57,340
Raise your head.

671
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:04,130
You look pale. Are you hurt?

672
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:06,190
It is a light injury.

673
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:08,770
Please do not worry yourself.

674
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:31,290
Since you have eased my boredom... I shall grant you one request.

675
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:33,720
Is there anything you desire?

676
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,190
Yes.

677
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:38,010
May I dare share it with you?

678
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:39,950
Go ahead.

679
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:44,460
I wish... to serve you up close.

680
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:53,090
You mean as a Royal Guard?

681
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:57,290
What greater glory could a warrior ask for?

682
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:01,520
I will serve you with all that I am.

683
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:54,150
You did... pass the exam.

684
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:00,840
What did I say?

685
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,020
I am not someone who will fail.

686
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,540
Yes.

687
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:08,150
I knew you would succeed.

688
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,360
You look very pale.

689
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:17,120
Did you overexert your shoulder?

690
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,030
I am fine.

691
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:22,000
Fortunately, the exam was not difficult.

692
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:30,390
The scholars are still at the examination site.

693
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:32,260
Najudaek also went to buy groceries.

694
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:34,150
I see.

695
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:36,590
I knew it was too quiet.

696
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:45,810
It is... just you and me here...

697
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,100
Just the two of us.

698
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:57,280
Now that you have worn the hat given by the king, please keep your promise.

699
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:11,850
What is... all this?

700
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:20,230
 If I see you again next time, I will tell you.

701
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:22,610
That is what I said.

702
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:30,000
That I would tell you if I see you again... who I am.

703
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:40,500
Many years ago, the child who hid in the dog house in fear...

704
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:44,720
was me.

705
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:54,760
I am... I am Lee Seol.

706
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:18,970

707
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:23,320

708
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:27,640
♫  Melting in again, baby your love  ♫

709
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:31,000
♫  Drowning in my imagination  ♫

710
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,120
♫  Dazzles my eyes, like the sunlight  ♫

711
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:38,480
♫  Lost in a dream that is you  ♫

712
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,420
♫  When I'm walking for countless nights  ♫

713
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:42,230
 You must not join the Royal Guards.

714
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:45,210
 What if I give in to his threats and spill everything?

715
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:47,790
 If you find out who Lee Seol is, let me know.

716
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:50,530
 I will reward you with a proper government position.

717
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:52,230
 Why are you always kind to me?

718
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:55,010
 Somehow, I see myself in you. We are quite alike.

719
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:57,250
 Tens and thousands of people are dying.

720
00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:01,140
 Subjects speaking the truth to the king are being executed with their family.

721
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:03,190
 Can you bear to just watch this?

722
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:06,320
 There is only one throne, but there are three kings?

723
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,760
 I will go to the Royal Palace.

724
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,890
 That is my reason for living and my duty.

725
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:16,350
♫  I can't stop, I'm drowning in you  ♫
