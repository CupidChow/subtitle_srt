1
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,140

2
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,760

3
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,350

4
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,820

5
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,160

6
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,710

7
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:52,280
What is all this?

8
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,540
I told you then

9
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:02,520
that I would tell you if I see you again... who I am.

10
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,430
Many years ago,

11
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:16,010
the child who hid in the dog house in fear... was me.

12
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,060
I am...

13
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,860
I am Lee Seol.

14
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:03,490
What... did you say?

15
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,050
Brother, you are...

16
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,950
Lee Seol?

17
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,440
The reason...

18
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,980
The reason I could not tell you all this time is...

19
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,720
Look who is here!

20
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,150
What?

21
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:30,390
Looking at the Eosahwa, you must have must have passed the exam!

22
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:38,960

23
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,630

24
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,910
By the way, you do not look so well for some reason.

25
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,110
Goodness! He must still be nervous!

26
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:57,240
His Majesty apparently came to the exam site!

27
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,580
You make Ihwawon proud.

28
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,350
How long has it been since we had someone who passed? Do you not agree, Dan Oh?

29
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,530
Yes, yes. It is true.

30
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,510
Do you mind if I try on the Eosahwa?

31
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,980
I am getting the energy of success from it!

32
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,890
- Try it on. 
 - My gosh!

33
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,610
What do you think?

34
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,310
Does it suit me?

35
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,400
Goodness! Here is the first-place scholar!

36
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,640
It suits you so perfectly!

37
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,230
I have a good feeling this time.

38
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,180
I wrote down the answer without any hesitation.

39
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,860
Should I tell the people in my hometown to kill a pig for me?

40
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,950
Just get a government position!

41
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,150
If so, I will catch a wild pig, even!

42
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,020
Oh, right...

43
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,960
Here, here.

44
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:53,090
Scholar Yoo Ha must have done a good job. Right?

45
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,190
It was not too bad.

46
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,590
Did Shi Yeol not come with you?

47
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,200
Do not get me started.

48
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,420
- You know, he— 
 - What about me?

49
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,450
What kind of... a person gives up in the middle of the exam?

50
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,620
What do you mean, give up?

51
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,550
I put my brush down early because the question was boring.

52
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,660
I saw you handing in a blank paper without a drop of ink on it.

53
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,210
The blank paper is my answer.

54
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,930
How could there be only right answers in this world?

55
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,920
You are unbelievable.

56
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,970
By the way, San started dressing arrogantly while I was gone.

57
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,360
You are dressed like a royal inspector.

58
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,520
Let me excuse myself.

59
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,490
There is no one else here.

60
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,710
You can speak freely.

61
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:28,370
I still... cannot believe it.

62
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,390
That you are the deposed crown prince's son, Lee Seol.

63
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:44,800
It is such a relief... that you were safe and sound like this.

64
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:14,350
♫  The dark night sky is filling up with you while everyone is asleep  ♫

65
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:24,370
♫  You were smiling in my arms  ♫

66
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:29,360
♫  I can't forget about it  ♫

67
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,900
♫  At night, when the moon is up...  ♫

68
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,790
You must have been...

69
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,930
holding back your whole life like this.

70
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:48,370
♫  All of our memories are getting vivid  ♫

71
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,350
♫  Please stay with me by my side  ♫

72
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:58,030
♫  I've always been waiting for tonight  ♫

73
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:03,420
How did you hang in there by yourself all this time?

74
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,950
Dan Oh.

75
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:09,130
I was hoping you were not...

76
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,640
being chased like that night.

77
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,210
♫  Please be by my side. I will be...  ♫

78
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,800
Now I understand...

79
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,640
how foolish I have been.

80
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:29,800
I brought you to Ihwawon and suffocated you.

81
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,410
Even if you did not run away with my bag,

82
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,610
we would have met again, anyway.

83
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,650
It was not a coincidence that we met at the tavern that day.

84
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,130
♫  I can't reach you  ♫

85
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,240
I came to you...

86
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,100
♫  Hold onto the memories that have stopped  ♫

87
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,170
whom I have missed dearly.

88
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,340
♫  I will wait for you  ♫

89
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:02,970
♫  At the place I have always been watching  ♫

90
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:19,770
Tell me... what your plan is going forward.

91
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,410
You must have a reason for trying to get a government position.

92
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,160
You promised me.

93
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,800
That you would tell me everything the day you put on the Eosahwa.

94
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,800
I will go to the palace.

95
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,880
Why, all of a sudden...?

96
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,800
Although I have been chased my whole life,

97
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,570
I am the oldest son of the Crown Prince in this country.

98
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,810
I will join the Royal Guard and punish the king myself.

99
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,690
What if your cover gets blown by entering the palace rashly?

100
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,560
You will lose the life you have been protecting all this time.

101
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,670
You risked your life to protect Ihwawon, too.

102
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,130
This is just like that.

103
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:20,670
I am trying to protect the palace I grew up in from the traitor who is blinded by greed.

104
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,420
Enemies will be everywhere in the palace.

105
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,280
Can you please reconsider...

106
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,400
Both of my parents passed away,

107
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:35,120
and all of their followers and their families were killed.

108
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:41,420
I cannot ignore the ones who got killed only to protect myself.

109
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,580
That is the reason I am alive

110
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,610
and it is my duty as the eldest son of the crown prince.

111
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:56,570
But... it is too dangerous.

112
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:03,090
You saved my life. I will not give up on it and waste it.

113
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,800
Do not worry.

114
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,100
 Please bring me the keepsakes.

115
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:23,390
 They are the keepsakes Crown Prince left.

116
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,560
 This letter is Crown Prince Lee Pyeong's request to his son

117
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,550
 and a piece of evidence to prove your identity.

118
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:54,180
 If I rise to the throne and things quiet down, I will call you to the palace.

119
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,520
 Please be strong and live until then.

120
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:02,790
 All I can give you right now is this name.

121
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,360
 My Son, Gyeom.

122
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,230

123
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,350
You are Merchant Jang, are you not?

124
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,700
I am.

125
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,000
I am looking for a ship that goes to China.

126
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,450
I was wondering if there is room on your ship.

127
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,530
Room?

128
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,660
By the way, what is the reason?

129
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,370
I will pay you handsomely.

130
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,920
If there is, please contact Ihwawon, which is on the edge of Jungchon.

131
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,640
I will.

132
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,720
She asked Merchant Jang to find a ship for her.

133
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,630
Yoon Dan Oh is trying to go to China?

134
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,440
Well done.

135
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,980
Continue to keep an eye on Dan Oh.

136
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,990
Yes, sir.

137
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:44,460
You will be free from your bondage soon.

138
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,120
As long as you find Lee Seol.

139
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,400
By Lee Seol...

140
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,760
Do you mean the deposed crown prince's son?

141
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,810
Looks like you have heard of that name, too.

142
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,560
I just overheard some rumors...

143
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,340
I supposed he had not been caught yet. Right?

144
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:21,040
 Feel free to come whenever you change your mind.

145
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,050
 It is cowardly to hide because you fear being a burden.

146
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,370
 What do you mean cowardly?

147
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,120
 - This is for Dan Oh— 
 - It is not for Dan Oh!

148
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,490
 You are making her guilty so you can feel better.

149
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,450
 She would be blaming herself for not being able to protect you.

150
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:57,390
 If I were her, I would want my only sister...

151
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:03,140
 to be supportive, and not be a burden.

152
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,510
Sending you to the palace does not sit well with me, Your Highness.

153
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:23,790
You and I are the ones who survived.

154
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,870
We must do our duty as the ones who are left behind.

155
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,060
There is only one reason why

156
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,280
I did not die with my master as the crown prince's royal bodyguard.

157
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,520
It is because of Crown Prince's order to protect you.

158
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,370
Please... be careful.

159
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,900
I understand.

160
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,620
You will be alone in the palace.

161
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,420
No matter how impressive Watchman is,

162
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,050
it will not be easy to beat the guards and enter the palace.

163
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,920
I need to meet the Watchman. I want you to find him for me.

164
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,400
Why do you wish that?

165
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,730
- Watchman is... 
 - Dan Oh found out...

166
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,860
who I am.

167
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,700
If Watchman finds out about that,

168
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,600
he might try to kill her because he thought I was in danger.

169
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,980
- It will not be easy to find Watchman right now. 
 - If so,

170
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,080
what should I do with Dan Oh?

171
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,720
Your life is at risk more than anyone's right now.

172
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,120
I am used to it.

173
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:27,140
But... Dan Oh is not.

174
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,610
Where are you running to?

175
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,870
It was you.

176
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,100
I thought someone was following me.

177
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,330
You should not have been walking around at night.

178
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,130
Let us go in.

179
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,150
Are you that anxious?

180
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,390
Were you so afraid that you ran like that?

181
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:21,660
Chief Administrator... might still be chasing after me.

182
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,590
Dan Oh.

183
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,530
What if I tell him everything because I can not withstand his threats?

184
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,340
- If that happens... 
 - Even if that happens,

185
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,200
I will not blame you.

186
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,660
You cannot join the Royal Guard.

187
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,380
Please reconsider it.

188
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:44,510
You will not be the only person who gets hurt if they find out who you are.

189
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:50,790
Everyone at Ihwawon will... end up dying as well.

190
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,380
You should leave far away instead.

191
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,120
I am looking for a ship that goes to China.

192
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:02,150
If they get in even the slightest danger, I will leave without looking behind.

193
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,500
Trust me.

194
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,970
I will not put you and them in danger.

195
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:17,280
But you still should be careful for now and

196
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,020
do not walk around alone late at night like this.

197
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:24,060
I would like you not to leave Ihwawon at all.

198
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:27,240
Locking up does not steer thieves away.

199
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,050
If they wanted to, they could climb the wall and come in.

200
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,130
I wish I could make the walls reach the sky.

201
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:38,110
So no one can dare climb it.

202
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,850
Who are you? You cannot come in here.

203
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,100
Maiden Hong Joo, what happened?

204
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:10,290
I... am back now.

205
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,050
Are you really?

206
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:16,110
Can we stay together now, then?

207
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:19,430
You were right.

208
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:25,840
I wanted to run away because I hated myself for not being helpful at all.

209
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:29,510
You were helpful just now.

210
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,540
Pardon?

211
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:35,540
Seeing your face made me forget all of my worries.

212
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:41,080
Anyway, you became very masculine while you were away.

213
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,770
I dressed like a man just in case I might get caught.

214
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,600
I look a bit awkward, do I not?

215
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,160
It suits you well.

216
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,390
Feels like we have been friends for ten years.

217
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:54,850
Shall we have some rice wine at the tavern, then?

218
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,830
I have not even seen Dan Oh and Najudaek yet.

219
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,300
No one was here when I arrived.

220
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,150
I should not be here like this, then.

221
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:07,260
Let me go find those two right now!

222
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,330
My Lady! You came back!

223
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,380
Shall we sit?

224
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,260
Did you come all the way here alone?

225
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,140
You should have called me!

226
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,240
I would have run to you immediately!

227
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,720
I came safely.

228
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,120
I bought these clothes just in case, too.

229
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,660
Goodness! My scholar!

230
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:59,860
I wonder if you made many ladies cry on your way here!

231
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,380
You are really back, right?

232
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,620
You will not disappear suddenly. Right?

233
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,150
No.

234
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,640
I will not go anywhere anymore.

235
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,400
I will find what I can do here.

236
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,010
I will no longer be a burden to you.

237
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:19,620
I always tell you this, but you have never done that.

238
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,110
I am so glad you are back!

239
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,850
Come here.

240
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,870
Let me give you both a hug!

241
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,600
Shall we sleep together in the annex tonight?

242
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,710
Shall we?

243
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:41,150
Just wait. I will bring the blankets over!

244
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:53,350
So the deposed crown prince's son gave you that compass?

245
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:57,800
Come to think of it, you were acting a bit strange at Father's funeral.

246
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,960
I just thought you were struggling to face Father's death.

247
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,350
But that was not it.

248
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,920
What should we do now?

249
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:12,000
I need to do something, but there is nothing I can do.

250
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,280
I just... need to watch him hoping he is safe.

251
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,200
You said he has been chased his whole life.

252
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,330
He must know better than anyone how to survive.

253
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,760
Do you really think so?

254
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,620
Of course.

255
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,490
I am sure of it.

256
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,410
Why are you all staring like that?

257
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:50,940
A royal guard! We are just proud.

258
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,370
An extraordinary talent like you is at Ihwawon.

259
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:57,230
If Won knew, he would have been so happy.

260
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,340
He might have wanted you to be his son-in-law.

261
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,930
Sir!

262
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:03,430
Do not make a joke like that.

263
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,810
Shi Yeol, how come you are not saying anything?

264
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,530
I would not know where to start.

265
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,980
Should I say this first?

266
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,170
Since the king is extremely sensitive and violent,

267
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:22,000
I heard the Royal Guard cannot last more than three months.

268
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,480
But San is not an ordinary fellow. I am sure he can last.

269
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,740
Are you wishing him ill will or complimenting him right now?

270
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,800
- Complimenting. 
 - I think he is encouraging me.

271
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,770
Telling me to hang in there.

272
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,840
Right?

273
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,720
Goodness! You might be late on your first day!

274
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,890
Get going now!

275
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:44,240
Then, I will see you later.

276
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:53,530
You are... really leaving, right?

277
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:56,070
I will return safely.

278
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,800
Your Majesty, please stop the unreasonable expansion of the palace.

279
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,390
You are making the farmers work here during the busy farming season.

280
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,580
Not only that, but to afford it,

281
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,260
you even raised interest for Hwangok. 
  (Palace loaning grain to farmers and charging interest)

282
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,650
Left State Minister.

283
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:24,550
Tell me. Should I stop doing this right now?

284
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:28,010
It is for the royal palace's dignity.

285
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,580
It is only right that people follow your order.

286
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:36,560
If people go hungry and run out of money, misfortune will follow.

287
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:41,590
In fact, I am afraid they will revolt out of anger.

288
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:44,090
Please reconsider.

289
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,020
Three Secret Prophecies of Joseon.

290
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,530
It says there, too.

291
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,560
When the people rise up like wildfire,

292
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:58,630
an extraordinary man who showed up in the East will become the king.

293
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:04,910
Come to think of it, you are in Mok In Hoe, too.

294
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:10,460
Otherwise, you would not be saying all this nonsense to me.

295
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,860
Your Majesty! You are mistaken!

296
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:16,370
I was just advising you as Inspector General!

297
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,930
I am certainly not a member of Mok In Hoe!

298
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,360
This is unjust!

299
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,320
Left State Minister, please say something!

300
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,380
You know that I am not a member of Mok In Hoe!

301
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,140
Look here!

302
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,850
Drag him out of here immediately!

303
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,320
Three generations in his family will die for treason!

304
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,950
 Yes, Sire!

305
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,210
Your Majesty!

306
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,410
Your Majesty! Your...

307
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,840
Minister! Minister!

308
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,950
 Minister!

309
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,190
It was so suspicious, was it not?

310
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,940
The way Miss was looking at Scholar Kang San.

311
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,910
It was so sticky and intense.

312
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:03,260
We should hurry up and prepare for a wedding.

313
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:06,290
Goodness! I only have one person in mind.

314
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:10,540
A scholar who uses a brush is better than a warrior who uses a sword.

315
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:14,720
Scholar Yoo Ha is someone who will do great things.

316
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,220
A scholar who uses a brush is right here as well!

317
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,640
How come you are singling out Yoo Ha like that?

318
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:26,170
Well, I am just talking about him as Miss's husband material.

319
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,260
What do you think of me, then, Najudaek?

320
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,700
You did not pass the state exam, but your face shows the passage of time.

321
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,900
I pity you.

322
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,530
Well...

323
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:46,960
My gosh!

324
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,690
I... I will also pass the exam

325
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,850
and become the No. 1 husband material!

326
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:59,390
Chief Administrator wishes to see you.

327
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:02,180
Me? Why all of a sudden?

328
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,080
Come with me.

329
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,290
I heard there was the first round of the state exam.

330
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:14,050
You will have to get a government position this time.

331
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:17,070
You did not bring me here because you were worried about that.

332
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,560
What did you want to talk about?

333
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:24,300
Yook Ho, I know you are the eldest member of Ihwawon.

334
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:31,030
Did you know that Dan Oh has been looking for the deposed crown prince's son to keep Ihwawon?

335
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,000
But I heard she could not find him.

336
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,350
She did.

337
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:39,080
She knows about Lee Seol.

338
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:43,820
That is why she is trying to run away to China.

339
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,930
There is no way.

340
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:51,330
- Why would she— 
 - If she...

341
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:55,220
runs away to hide Lee Seol,

342
00:26:55,220 --> 00:27:00,630
not only her but her whole family will be beheaded.

343
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,750
You also learned and studied under Yoon Won.

344
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,450
Will you just watch

345
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:14,820
your teacher's daughter getting executed for treason and her family getting killed?

346
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:19,710
Tell me if you find out who Lee Seol is.

347
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,660
As long as you do that,

348
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:27,230
I will get you a suitable government position.

349
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:56,880
 Grandmother is waiting! Please hurry.

350
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,230
 Do not run.

351
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:01,150
 What if you hurt yourself?

352
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,580
 All right.

353
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,460
 He is quite heavy.

354
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:13,450
 I think he is all grown up now, Crown Princess.

355
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,810
I knew it was you!

356
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,880
It is nice to see you like this.

357
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,510
It is me, Yoon Goo Nam.

358
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:21,540
At the exam site...

359
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:26,340
I threw you a pole.

360
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,470
Oh, I remember.

361
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,140
Yes.

362
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:35,330
Did you join the Royal Guard?

363
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:37,030
It happened to be so.

364
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:41,290
We showed off impressive teamwork at the exam site.

365
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:44,910
Of course, I did about 80% of it.

366
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,870
This is the map of the palace.

367
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:02,070
Memorize all of it by tomorrow.

368
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:07,350
Are you telling us to memorize these countless pavilions?

369
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:10,500
We are the Royal Guard who serve the king.

370
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:15,050
You cannot miss a single thing.

371
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:24,070
You will receive one hit whenever you get it wrong.

372
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,860
Follow me. We will go to the Royal Council Hall.

373
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,640
I knew things were going too well.

374
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,600
I will get beaten as soon as I enter the palace.

375
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,600
- Be quiet and follow me! 
 - Yes, sir.

376
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:06,590
I really like...

377
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,330
the look in your eyes.

378
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:13,930
It is somewhat familiar, as though I have long seen it.

379
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,690
How insolent.

380
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:23,140
Lower your head.

381
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,690
All right. Which family are you from?

382
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,630
I am from the Kang family of Jinju.

383
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:30,520
Is your injury faring well?

384
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,690
It has almost healed.

385
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,650
Good, good.

386
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:56,180
Is this not... the compass of my older brother?

387
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:01,750
I got it from a girl called... Dan Oh of the Yoon family in Ihwawon at Jungchon.

388
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,350
Yoon Dan Oh...

389
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:06,930
Who is that girl to have such a thing on her?

390
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:10,440
More than a decade ago, she had allowed

391
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,060
the deposed crown prince's son, Lee Seol, to hide at Ihwawon

392
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,130
for a night at the funeral of Yoon Won.

393
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:21,110
She had confessed that she received it from him as a token of gratitude.

394
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,990
Wait.

395
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:30,210
Was not the day of Yoon Won's funeral... the day I brought forth the rebellion?

396
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:35,180
Yes... that is correct.

397
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,890
This is interesting.

398
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:41,950
Yoon Won's daughter has a connection with the deposed crown prince's son?

399
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:54,230
Hwa Ryeong, how much do you know about my father?

400
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:57,750
I do not know much, either.

401
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,160
Right.

402
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,680
You never got to meet Crown Prince in person, have you?

403
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,350
I have.

404
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:12,050
I thought I had not.

405
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,630
But I once did.

406
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,280
 There...

407
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:42,260
 I am deeply sorry.

408
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:49,980
 But who are you?

409
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,090
 Farewell.

410
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:55,780
 You must protect yourself from now on.

411
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,750
 Do you understand?

412
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:03,890
That was the day I was sent to Lord Jeong Yoon's house.

413
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:08,930
A servant boy who used to carry water buckets in Grand Prince Geum Ryeong's house

414
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:11,980
was adopted by a noble family.

415
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,700
It was a joyful day for me.

416
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:20,420
However, his eyes looked quite sad.

417
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:25,720
And he was... the Crown Prince.

418
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,720
Do you resent the Crown Prince?

419
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,370
After I went to Lord Jeong Yoon's house,

420
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:34,210
a rebellion ensued soon enough

421
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:37,350
and Grand Prince Geum Ryeong's household was slaughtered, too.

422
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:43,890
If it were not for Crown Prince's foresight, I would have lost my life as well.

423
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:50,350
If Crown Prince could see how you have grown up,

424
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:53,010
he would be overjoyed.

425
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,340
My life was full of lies.

426
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:05,800
I was born as Grand Prince Geum Ryeong's slave,

427
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,280
raised as Lord Jeong Yoon's son from a concubine,

428
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,530
and now... I am the long lost son of Crown Prince?

429
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,260
I do not know anymore...

430
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,450
who I really am.

431
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:30,940
I have one question for you.

432
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:34,820
Yes. Please ask.

433
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,720
Who is my birth mother?

434
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,890
He did not mention Mother in his will at all.

435
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,470
I heard she was of low class.

436
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:51,110
It is more beneficial for you not to have any interest.

437
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,280
Class does not matter.

438
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,920
Is she not the one who gave birth to me?

439
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:06,020
His Lord is waiting for you.

440
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,960
Please hurry on.

441
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,280
I have decided.

442
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,870
I will rise to the throne.

443
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:42,570
Now what should I do?

444
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:52,520
I will take this hairpin and let everyone in Mok In Hoe know.

445
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,420
That the hidden leader of Mok In Hoe is actually...

446
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:59,610
the deposed crown prince's son, Lee Seol.

447
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:04,310
Therefore, you must take the throne as Lee Seol.

448
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:06,720
What do you mean by that?

449
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,480
What are you talking about right now?

450
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,730
Are you saying to take the throne by borrowing my brother's name, whom I have never met?

451
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:16,870
I am deeply sorry to tell you this,

452
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:20,770
but you were hidden at a young age and could not even receive a royal title.

453
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:22,920
Even if you are Crown Prince's son,

454
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,260
you are an illegitimate son with no knowledge of who your mother is.

455
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:32,000
There is no one who will join forces to sit such a man as the king.

456
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:36,200
However, the deposed crown prince's son, Lee Seol, is a different story.

457
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,440
Mok In Hoe's trust will follow naturally.

458
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,340
To take the throne through falsity...

459
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:46,480
That is mocking the people and Mok In Hoe.

460
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,850
I cannot agree to such plans.

461
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:51,290
Instead... find the real Lee Seol and make him the king.

462
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:54,000
The "jade dust" has not been found anywhere so far.

463
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,740
For more than a decade, he has never shown himself. Not even once.

464
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,790
To waste countless years again in search of the "jade dust"...

465
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:04,390
Joseon is in too much peril right now.

466
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:07,150
Tens and thousands of people are dying.

467
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:11,230
Subjects speaking the truth to the king are being executed with their family.

468
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:16,410
Can you bear to just watch this?

469
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,100
Why are you out here?

470
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,660
I just felt like it.

471
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:40,410
Looks like the Royal Guard give you a lot of work from day one, huh?

472
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:45,490
Yes. All I did was work and come back in one piece.

473
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:53,150
On that day, a funeral lantern was hanging here.

474
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:56,270

475
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:59,520
I went in when I saw the light.

476
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,820
Yes.

477
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:11,040
That is why I was reminded of you every year... on that memorial day.

478
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:17,090
That boy who was hiding and shivering... in the dog house.

479
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:24,740
Wondering about how he is doing now and if he is safe.

480
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:29,740
You might not know,

481
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:33,270
but I have changed a lot.

482
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:36,980
♫  I couldn't tell you, even when I knew everything, 
 although I wanted to  ♫

483
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,920
The boy in the dog house...

484
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,370
who was fragile and powerless to no end is no more.

485
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,290
Dan Oh, you are...

486
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:58,300
the last memory that does not haunt me... even when I reminisce about it.

487
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,940
I have been thankful for a long time.

488
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:07,510
I was not able to... tell you that for a long time.

489
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:17,180
♫  I just look, fearing there will be more distance between us  ♫

490
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:22,710
♫  Cherished in the corner of my heart, so it won't show  ♫

491
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:25,040

492
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,070
Did you make up your mind?

493
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:30,700
I must have your word now.

494
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,600
Your Highness...

495
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:39,160
what is your reason for trying to make me the delivery man for Watchman's funds?

496
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,040
You betrayed the crown prince's son a long time ago.

497
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,480
However, thanks to that,

498
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,360
Watchman slaughtered the Six Swords, who were chasing Crown Prince's son.

499
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:53,980
Would anyone even fathom that you are the delivery man... for Watchman's funds?

500
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:01,370
While you are doing this task,

501
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:05,230
you will also come in contact with Lee Seol's watchman.

502
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:09,530
I must know whether Seol is safe or not.

503
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:12,030
Please wait patiently.

504
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:16,660
The oldest son of Crown Prince will soon enter the palace.

505
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,070
How will he enter the palace?

506
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,800
Did something terrible happen to him?

507
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,300
Could it be... he was arrested by the king?

508
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:32,400
I am saying it will not be too far for him to come back to the palace to reclaim his seat.

509
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,940

510
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,690
The welcome initiation will begin now.

511
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,920
Welcome to the Royal Guard.

512
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,760
Your mission today is these goblets.

513
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:20,860
If you cannot protect a drop of alcohol, how can you call yourself a royal guard?

514
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:24,120
What are you doing? You must receive it as well.

515
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:30,630
- What do I do— 
 - My, my. You are letting it leak.

516
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:33,860
Is he not pouring alcohol into a bottomless pit?

517
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,120
Go ahead and drink.

518
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,870
The scholars will not be able to go home today.

519
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:43,140
I heard the Royal Guard welcome initiation is the best. I guess it is true.

520
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,520
Come on now!

521
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:07,150
Please give Queen Dowager my thanks.

522
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:15,750
Are those kids going to become... Watchmen in the future?

523
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,440
Yes.

524
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:22,580
If they survive until then, that is.

525
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:33,680
There is one thing I must ask you.

526
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:39,460
Who is the son of the deposed crown prince's Watchman?

527
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,790
Even among Watchmen,

528
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:46,770
they do not know who the other Watchman is protecting.

529
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,910
However...

530
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:54,230
they are always a minute's distance away from their lords.

531
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:58,930
During the day... and during the night.

532
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:05,580
A minute's distance, huh?

533
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,010
Gosh, seriously!

534
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:13,940
Gosh, Scholar...

535
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,130
Please try walking.

536
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:18,640
My goodness, please come to your senses!

537
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,140
You cannot, Scholar. You absolutely cannot!

538
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:32,750
Goodness, San, your organs are full of alcohol, huh?

539
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:35,770
- A welcome initiation? 
 - What brings you here?

540
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:38,930
I came to gamble at a gambling house. Would I be here to see you?

541
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:42,480
Move aside. I need to go before it gets cold.

542
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,920
Dan Oh likes this.

543
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,040
You took this to give to Dan Oh?

544
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:52,460
San, how many fingers am I holding up?

545
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:54,970
Do you think I am an idiot?

546
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:57,290
Three fingers, obviously.

547
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,620
You are obviously plastered.

548
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:03,080
If you go home like this, Dan Oh will surely see you plastered.

549
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,580
Please rest up before leaving.

550
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,100
We have many empty rooms.

551
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,700
No need to do that. I can carry him home in no time.

552
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:13,190
How will you carry a drunk, grown man?

553
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:16,180
I have all kinds of hidden powers in here.

554
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,300
Let me show you.

555
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:28,540
- Give me a hand. 
 - Sorry?

556
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:30,220
He's heavy.

557
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,750
Please rest well.

558
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,530
I am so sorry.

559
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:31,980
I thought you might be uncomfortable in your sleep.

560
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:35,310
I am fine, so get out this instant.

561
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:51,300
How can a mole be so red?

562
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:11,290
I am sorry... for being a little rude earlier.

563
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:14,500
I think I was sensitive because I was half asleep.

564
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,170
Not at all.

565
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:19,020
It is my fault for making you uncomfortable.

566
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:21,840
You did not do anything wrong.

567
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:25,930
How are you doing living in this place?

568
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:28,150
Not quite well.

569
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:32,210
There are not that many days when I can breathe easily.

570
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:37,350
If troublesome situations arise in the future, you can let me know.

571
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:39,930
May I do that?

572
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:09,930
You are the only one who knows the face of the grown-up "jade dust".

573
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:13,590
Therefore, His Majesty kept you alive, even to this day.

574
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,750
Confirmation of lineage.

575
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:19,960
That will probably be the last use of this lowly one.

576
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:25,100
In that case, anyone will be believed to be Lee Seol if you just say so.

577
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:29,300
I am going to make Lee Seol the king.

578
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,090
Did you find Lee Seol?

579
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:35,630
Make the man I found... into the deposed crown prince's son, Lee Seol.

580
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:39,450
By that, do you mean to throne a false Lee Seol?

581
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:43,490
His Majesty's mercy for you lasts only until he finds Lee Seol.

582
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:49,420
However, if you take my hand, I will guarantee your safety.

583
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:54,440
I cannot... trust your words on this.

584
00:48:54,440 --> 00:49:00,410
Since lowly ones like me have always been sacrificed... for the sake of greater will.

585
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:03,350
How can I have you believe me?

586
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:14,260
Next time, please invite the one who will become the "jade dust" as well.

587
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:19,050
I will exchange a few words with him, too.

588
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:22,780
And it shall be done.

589
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,330
You kept this all along?

590
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:45,360
They will take you if you read it anywhere so carelessly.

591
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,020
There's no one in the guesthouse.

592
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,030
Mister Yook Ho left with Najudaek.

593
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:50,150
No one's in the rooms, either.

594
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:52,700
Do not read it even if no one is around.

595
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,330
The birds and the rats will hear you.

596
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:55,970
Even the chicken passing by will see you.

597
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:59,160
Am I that untrustworthy to you?

598
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,600
- Th-That is not what I meant— 
 - All right!

599
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:05,050
I will go and throw it out, so no one can see or hear me.

600
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:06,190
Please give it to me.

601
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:08,070
- I will burn it. 
 - Forget it.

602
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:09,980
This is too dangerous to show anyone.

603
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,840
I will throw it out.

604
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:15,480
Why are you being stubborn like a child out of nowhere?

605
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,560
What, a child?

606
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,470
Have you seen such a well-built child?

607
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:24,270
Well, there is one in front of me right now.

608
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:26,430
Give it to me.

609
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:29,110
If someone sees it—

610
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:33,000
- I will throw it out. 
 - Brother, when did you come?

611
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,720
I am the one who got it for San.

612
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:39,150
Therefore, it is right for me to take care of the aftermath.

613
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:42,890
Even you, who is righteous about every matter...

614
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:46,400
Now that I think about it, this was the book you were reading secretly. Right?

615
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,570
Gosh, I had no idea.

616
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:51,340
Well, I did not lie to you.

617
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:54,090
I definitely told you it was not erotica.

618
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:56,680
But you did not believe me.

619
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,330
He probably took a peek out of curiosity.

620
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:00,270
I begged him, saying I was curious.

621
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:02,360
Just go out to the market streets and take a look.

622
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:05,210
So many people died because of this book.

623
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:07,920
Why is everyone so reckless?

624
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,720
Only my heart sinks every time from worrying.

625
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,120
She's right. You should've just read it once and been done.

626
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,350
Why do you still have this?

627
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:17,160
If you didn't get me the book at all,

628
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,320
I wouldn't have read it at all, and it would've been so nice.

629
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:24,600
You two are both the same.

630
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,660

631
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:09,670
I am glad I even went to a place that is forbidden for men.

632
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:12,660
I was worried you might not come back.

633
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:15,040
It was not because of you, Scholar Kim.

634
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,080
As I told you before, I was worried about Dan Oh—

635
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,080
The reason does not matter.

636
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:25,990
Even if it was not for me, you still brought back what I gave you.

637
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:32,710
I kept it... because I would feel bad throwing it out.

638
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:34,050
All right, then.

639
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:36,250
I will take your word.

640
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:46,190
I want to be of help to Dan Oh, but I cannot think of any way to do that.

641
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:53,440
What help would be a maiden ghost who is trapped in the annex?

642
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,020
Let us find a way together.

643
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:59,790
I am sure there is something you can do.

644
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:10,010
Why do you always treat me nicely, Scholar Kim?

645
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,680
Because you remind me of myself.

646
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:20,860
We are quite alike.

647
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:24,230
We are alike?

648
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:33,710
Because I never got to live freely my entire life.

649
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:37,110
Sorry?

650
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:47,980
Think carefully about how we are alike until you go to sleep.

651
00:53:57,910 --> 00:54:01,020
Delivering chicken eggs is not all that easy.

652
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:04,200
I have never walked so much all over Jungchon like this.

653
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,170
So why did you come with me? You did not have to.

654
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:11,290
I can't slack off in managing my debtor.

655
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:14,690
It is a whopping 100 single ingots.

656
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:17,670
You did not want it when I tried to pay you back.

657
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:20,830
It is still nice that you are accepting it like this.

658
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:22,460
Right.

659
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:25,180
You seemed to have gotten close to San lately.

660
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,800
S-Sorry? I have?

661
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:32,110
You two seem to be talking a lot these days, too.

662
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:35,930
Did it seem that way?

663
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:40,260
We just have more and more things to talk about.

664
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:45,080
The more your feelings grow, the more things you have to talk about.

665
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:51,980
By the way, you seem more worried than usual.

666
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:54,230
And more lost in thoughts.

667
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:56,450
Tell me if you have any concerns.

668
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:59,560
I will give you an attentive ear.

669
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:03,350
If I do have concerns, will you really listen to them?

670
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:04,920
Of course.

671
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,650
It's not like it costs money.

672
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:09,740
Go ahead and tell me.

673
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:13,260
Wherever I am and whatever I am doing...

674
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:18,900
if I make an excuse out of 100 silver ingots will you look back at me like today?

675
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:23,110
Not often or frequently.

676
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:27,140
Just once in a while. Like today.

677
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:54,280
He is the person.

678
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:59,560
He will become Lee Seol, the deposed crown prince's son, and take the throne.

679
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:06,880
Please make yourself comfortable, Your Highness.

680
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:30,180
 Lee Seol, the deposed crown prince's son, and

681
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:33,410
 the fake that the Left State Minister is trying to erect as king.

682
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:36,590
 And Lee Chang, who took the throne by force.

683
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:43,430
 There is only one throne... but there are three kings?

684
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,710
That girl is Dan Oh.

685
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:05,500
Sir, what is the matter?

686
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:28,520
Your Majesty, the girl has been brought as you ordered.

687
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:56,480
The female musicians of Jangakwon were not enough, and 
  (Place for royal music and dance performers)

688
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,740
now he even called in a retired official's daughter?

689
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:02,970
I heard she is a noble who runs an inn in Jungchon.

690
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:06,700
She is talking alone with His Majesty in the garden right now.

691
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:09,100
How strange.

692
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:13,130
A noble's daughter runs an inn?

693
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:15,880
Look into the details.

694
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:18,350
Yes, Royal Consort.

695
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,890
Are you Yoon Won's daughter?

696
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:37,060
Yes, Your Majesty.

697
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:39,270
I have something to give you.

698
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:41,550
Come closer and receive it.

699
00:58:54,910 --> 00:59:00,770
Seeing how you are deathly pale, Chief Administrator Jang's report was all true.

700
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:12,420
How dare you!

701
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:15,800
You saved the son of the deposed Crown Prince, Lee Seol.

702
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:39,990

703
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,890

704
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:53,980
 Yoon Dan Oh, I should not have to remember you.

705
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:56,120
 Do you know what I fear more than death?

706
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,280
 It is losing my people again.

707
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:00,170
 Can we really do this?

708
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:03,810
 While you were confined, a lot of time passed outside the walls.

709
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:06,170
 "A wise sage appears in the Year of Yellow Rat."

710
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:08,690
 Lee Seol is trying to show himself in front of the world.

711
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:12,300
 Do not bother discovering what has not surfaced yet.

712
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:15,230
 Do you intend to take the throne as Lee Seol?

713
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:21,270
 Whether to die by Lee Chang's hands or open the doors to a new world, make your decision.
