1
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,840

2
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,840

3
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,350

4
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,200

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,160

6
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,360

7
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,730
I do not care if it was an illusion.

8
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:29,720
Even if what I thought you were was all a lie.

9
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,900
I could not even imagine...

10
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,800
that I would be seeing...

11
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,770
silvery waves like this.

12
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,800
Maiden Yoon.

13
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,080
Just like how I changed since I met you,

14
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,400
you must have changed, too.

15
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,400
You said you want to forget about the past, right?

16
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,900
You should forget, then.

17
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,480
I will do the same.

18
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,000
I am going to try to.

19
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:26,110
♫  Can you hear my heart?  ♫

20
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,230
You're braver...

21
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,030
♫  My heartbeat flows toward you  ♫

22
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,770
...than anyone in this world.

23
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:40,030
♫  Its sound rings so loudly like this  ♫

24
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:47,560
Please promise... just this one thing.

25
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:56,400
No matter what happens, please do not leave before me.

26
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:06,960

27
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,190
What should we do with Yoon Hong Joo now?

28
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,560
We need to confirm first.

29
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:25,170
If she is truly alive, I will cut her throat.

30
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,140

I hate winter.

31
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,120
The daylight is so short.

32
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,800
Please leave now.

33
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,290
What if someone sees us?

34
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,130
You told me not to leave earlier.

35
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,400
I understand.

36
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,660
I will get going now.

37
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:20,420
See you tomorrow after the long night, Lady Hong Joo.

38
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,480
I cannot believe it even after seeing her.

39
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,970
Yoon Hong Joo is alive.

40
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,580
Should I capture her?

41
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,020
We cannot let the rumor spread everywhere.

42
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,050
I have an idea. Just find a plot for her grave.

43
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:05,410
She is alive, but she has already died once.

44
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,760
We just need to put her back where she belongs.

45
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,520
There is a shadow warrior who protects the "jade dust" only.

46
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,790
Was that you?

47
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,990
Do you tend to be careless?

48
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,370
What if someone hears—

49
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,790
Our relationship got awkward.

50
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,580
We cannot even talk honestly.

51
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,590
We were never that comfortable with each other.

52
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,690
We were both hiding too much to do that.

53
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,150
I enjoyed your jokes a lot.

54
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,960
But now I understand.

55
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,010
Your jokes were a way to hide the truth.

56
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,540
Do you want to hear this, too?

57
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,710
The Watchman kills the one who threatens his master

58
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,320
no matter what.

59
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,470
So do not stand in front of the tip of my sword.

60
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:31,110
You still... do not trust me.

61
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,740
Hwa Ryeong was the one who sent the assassin?

62
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,790
Why would she do such a thing to me?

63
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:52,580
She probably has someone else she wants to put on the throne.

64
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,840
What happened at the meeting place was our misstep.

65
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,970
It happened because I was not careful.

66
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,470
Should you not explain first?

67
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,120
About who did such a thing?

68
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,740
I told them off properly. That will never happen again.

69
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,090
Do you believe what he says?

70
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,220
I do not.

71
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,150
But someone told me once that

72
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,790
there is nothing a person cannot do if they are desperate.

73
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:21,880
You probably want to drive the beast off the throne as much as I do.

74
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:27,050
I want to count on... your earnestness.

75
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,980
Would two be better than one?

76
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,120
What are you doing?

77
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,650
Why are you so surprised?

78
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,950
Are you plotting something together or something?

79
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,110
Dan Oh, you...

80
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,500
What are you doing here so early?

81
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,990
What do you mean?

82
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,900
Will you all skip breakfast?

83
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,720
Oh, right. Let's eat.

84
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,250
I told Dan Oh about everything.

85
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,650
About what?

86
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,580
That I like her a lot.

87
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:19,190
You do not have to... tell me how you feel.

88
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:23,610
I am telling you that I did not give up on Dan Oh, too.

89
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,590
What did you say?

90
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,110
What will you do with Dan Oh if you rise to the throne after defeating the king?

91
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,320
- Of course, to the palace— 
 - Do you think she would want that?

92
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,120
She carried all the burden of protecting Ihwawon and Maiden Hong Joo all this time.

93
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:48,460
Do you think a place where you have to breathe carefully suits her?

94
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:54,600
She would be trapped her whole life, burdened by an enormous sense of responsibility.

95
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,000
Is that not too selfish?

96
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,900
Did you say "collaborate?"

97
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:18,580
You are still so innocent even after living a tough life.

98
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,260
Lee Gyeom and I are on the same page.

99
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,950
We will achieve our noble cause together.

100
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,140
You are on the same page now.

101
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:30,920
But once the king is defeated who will be next?

102
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:38,200
Your Highness, no one in the world gives up on the power they have.

103
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:46,590
You must be just afraid to have your brother's blood on your hands.

104
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,360
Yes.

105
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,560
I am afraid...

106
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:59,090
that we will end up pointing our swords at each other.

107
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:08,240
But... I will not be wrapped up in fear.

108
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,350
I will overcome it and move forward.

109
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,310
Just wait and see... how I start the new era.

110
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,910
It looked like they were having a private conversation.

111
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,070
Very secretively.

112
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,730
What did the lowest-ranking royal guard and the head eunuch talk about so extensively?

113
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,500
Did you want to see me, Chief Royal Guard?

114
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,690
I want you to keep an eye on Kang San from now on.

115
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:14,530
I need to know everything he does outside the palace.

116
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,200
Yes, Sir.

117
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,490
What brings you here?

118
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,060
Why else would I be at the King's Palace?

119
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,710
I am here to see His Majesty. Let him know.

120
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:45,470
Are you here to tell him that Head Eunuch is in collusion with Queen Dowager?

121
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,400
It is true, is it not?

122
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,460
There is something I know, too.

123
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,170
Do you want to hear it?

124
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,710
I am talking about the prince.

125
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:03,360
I heard he is not your child.

126
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,310
His Majesty already knows.

127
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,770
How could that be a big deal?

128
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,750
If all the court officials find out, never mind the prince,

129
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,180
even the king would be in danger.

130
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:27,570
Would you really not take that seriously?

131
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,450
Must you insist on going?

132
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:52,460
If the court officials found out exorcism was performed, they would protest again.

133
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,860
They said my life would be in danger unless exorcism was performed.

134
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,340
Kang San, you should come, too.

135
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,340
I will show you something fun today.

136
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

137
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,030
Left State Minister.

138
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:43,340
Thank you so much for finding Seol.

139
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:48,930
Thanks to you, I was able to resolve my deep sorrow.

140
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,800
Did you have a nice conversation with him?

141
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,120
Yes.

142
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,930
He grew up to be so proper.

143
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,720
Life must have been very difficult for him.

144
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:09,030
The only one who could protect him is you, Your Highness.

145
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:15,980
As long as the king is on his throne, the deposed crown prince's son cannot stay alive.

146
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:23,070
In order to get him off the throne, we need a definitive reason.

147
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,180
There is one.

148
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:30,420
It would turn the royal court upside down once the ministers find out.

149
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,290
It is regarding the legitimacy of the prince.

150
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,430
I borrowed a horse again.

151
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,190
Just tell me where you want to go.

152
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:35,750
I am happy to go anywhere since I will be with you.

153
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,800
You wretch! I told you to stay away from the annex!

154
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,530
How dare you do this to Hong Joo—

155
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:01,700
- Sir, it is not like that— 
 - What do you mean it is not? You bastard!

156
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,100
You are a scholar. How could you be so violent?

157
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,190
- Just talk instead, please! 
 - Talk?

158
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:11,190
He would not be here if he understood me in the first place!

159
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,880
This cannot be!

160
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,900
Out of all the scholars at Ihwawon, why him...

161
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,740
What is wrong with him?

162
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,610
He is handsome and...

163
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,370
and...

164
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,810
He is handsome, at least!

165
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:27,110
- Goodness! 
 - Goodness...

166
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:33,510
Why did it have to be a jobless playboy and an idiot who failed the state exam?

167
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,160
That is so hurtful.

168
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,670
I admit I am a jobless playboy, but idiot is kind of—

169
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:41,580
Najudaek was right!

170
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,930
Come here, you bastard.

171
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:46,090
Get out, you bastard. Do not come anywhere near here anymore!

172
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,920
Leave! I will let you live.

173
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,110
I do not want to be without him!

174
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,930
I have been hiding for several years.

175
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,980
As if I am a tree planted in the annex.

176
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,150
I finally...

177
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:05,230
I finally feel like I can breathe.

178
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,000
Thanks to him, who let me see sunshine.

179
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,110
Maiden.

180
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,080
Let us do this, then.

181
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,470
Tell me.

182
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,930
I would do anything as long as you approve us.

183
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:29,610
Pass the state exam.

184
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,520
If you pass the state exam, I will approve your relationship.

185
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,290
What do you mean, pass? Me?

186
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,450
Why? Do you not want to?

187
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:44,390
You have to make a living if you want to get married.

188
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,560
W-What do you mean, get married?

189
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,240
We still have not—

190
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,840
Rising to fame by achieving success.

191
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,960
I will make sure to do it.

192
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,570
Yes.

193
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:02,770
You will be able to do it if you try your best.

194
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,700
You said you live in Ihwawon, right?

195
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,240
Yes.

196
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,700
Does Dan Oh treat you well?

197
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,850
I am living there comfortably.

198
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,200
Let us return to the palace. It is late at night.

199
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,670
The shaman told me not to go home immediately to banish the evil spirit.

200
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,760
Coming!

201
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,840
Why are you so nervous?

202
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,940
Are you afraid I would hurt you?

203
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:20,240
I do not have a lot of drinking snacks... since you came out of the blue.

204
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,160
A shaman told me...

205
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,450
that Lee Seol is pointing his sword at my throat and waiting for the right moment.

206
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:55,270
Do you agree with that, Dan Oh?

207
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,790
If you believe so, I am sure that would happen.

208
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,800
What?

209
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,200
They say, "In Ja Bul Woo, Yong Ja Bool Goo."

210
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:17,800
"Wise men do not worry and brave men have no fear."

211
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,700
How imprudent!

212
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,400
How dare you say that in front of His Majesty?

213
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,200
I am afraid of Lee Seol?

214
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,600
Are you not yet already shivering when it is not even cold?

215
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,000
Pay close attention.

216
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,800
Lee Seol will die and disappear just as the snow melts away.

217
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,800
That day is not too far away.

218
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,800
Is someone inside?

219
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,200
What are you both looking at?

220
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,800
The thing is... His Majesty is here.

221
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,200
They must have better alcohol in the palace.

222
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,800
Why did he come to Ihwawon...

223
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,400
Who are you?

224
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,800
What is your name?

225
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,900
It is His Majesty, the King. Answer politely.

226
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,660
I am Jeong Yoo Ha who lives in Ihwawon.

227
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:57,000
I thought it was just for show, but they do have guests at this inn.

228
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,800
You should rest, too.

229
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,000
It is getting late.

230
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:27,300
I did not expect he would suggest coming here.

231
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,800
You must have been very surprised.

232
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
I am okay.

233
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,400
I actually feel relieved.

234
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:42,280
I thought maybe... the tagger had changed in this game.

235
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,000
The tagger has changed?

236
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Because His Majesty is the one who is being chased in fear now,

237
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,400
not you.

238
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:58,400
I have never heard such brave encouragement.

239
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:04,110
It is not an encouragement. It is what I believe.

240
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:11,820
I believe that you will achieve the noble cause.

241
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:20,190
So, please... rise to the throne safely.

242
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,600
By the way,

243
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,800
what will you do if you become the king?

244
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,600
What is wrong?

245
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,200
Have you not thought about it, by chance?

246
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,500
You will become the father of this country.

247
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,600
You should take time and start thinking about it.

248
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,710
How about you?

249
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,100
What are you planning to do if I become the king?

250
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,200
You should think about it, too.

251
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,900
About what you want to do.

252
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,000
You do not have to worry about yesterday.

253
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,600
It happened suddenly while we were traveling in disguise.

254
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,600
I know. Dan Oh told me.

255
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,500
What are you trying to say standing like that, then?

256
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
The thing is...

257
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,600
I thought maybe you would know something.

258
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,200
About what?

259
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,700
About my biological mother.

260
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,300
- By chance... 
 - No.

261
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,000
I do not know about her, either.

262
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,400
It can be just a small clue, too.

263
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,300
Do you really not know anything—

264
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,700
I do know of someone.

265
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:56,400
I do not know, but he might.

266
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,600
Can you let me meet him?

267
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,330
His Majesty will go hunting in three days.

268
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,800
 (Tawi: A hunt conducted by the king himself)

269
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,300
Where will he go hunting?

270
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,600
It is Mt. Eungbong.

271
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,400
Left State Minister is coming, too. Put extra care into guarding them!

272
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,200
 Yes, sir!

273
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,800
 Hunting.

274
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,000
 This is my chance.

275
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,600
 My chance to get rid of the king.

276
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:39,160
 I will be by your side, Brother.

277
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,450
What are you staring at?

278
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,900
It is nothing.

279
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,700
You... What are you doing here?

280
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,400
You sent out a spy for me.

281
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,200
I needed to look into Mok In Hoe.

282
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,100
Do not get the wrong idea.

283
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,800
I thought you knew who your biological mother was.

284
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,400
You thought I knew? What do you mean?

285
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,100
Is that not why you had the Mok In Hoe meetings here?

286
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,510
By chance...

287
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:44,800
is Hwa Ryeong, the hostess of Buyounggak, my biological mother?

288
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,640
Did you really not know?

289
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,000
Hey, are you playing hooky right now?

290
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,800
Wow, you cannot be serious.

291
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,600
It is a peak hour right now.

292
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,100
What would you do if Hostess found out?

293
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,000
If you cause trouble one more time—

294
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,600
I will not cause trouble anymore, then.

295
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,200
- What? 
 - Keep your mouth shut.

296
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,100
If Hostess finds out, I will know it was you guys.

297
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,800
Why... Why did you nod?

298
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,500
Did you get scared by chance, Mae Wol?

299
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,700
Scared, my foot!

300
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,000
Ban Ya has Chief Administrator on her side.

301
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,800
It will not be good to provoke her!

302
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,000
I think she did get scared.

303
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,100
Why is she yelling at me?

304
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,100
Excuse me.

305
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,500
Do you know who lives here by chance?

306
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,300
Looks like you are not from around here!

307
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,900
It is the famous Left State Minister's house!

308
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,200
I see.

309
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,100
Thank you.

310
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,600
I am so disappointed!

311
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,200
Did you lead Mok In Hoe just to back out like this?

312
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,500
I do not know what to tell you.

313
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:08,000
But I made the decision after much thinking for everyone.

314
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,200
I will visit Queen Dowager and ask for forgiveness.

315
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,800
Please help me to see her.

316
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,200
I cannot!

317
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,700
Left State Minister.

318
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,800
I need to meet with the "jade dust" first.

319
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:28,370
After seeing him, I will make a decision as well.

320
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:53,560
How did your talk go?

321
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:59,130
I was... too harsh on you last time.

322
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,430
I apologize.

323
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,970
Not at all.

324
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:07,400
I am the one who failed to be considerate.

325
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,520
Do not get involved in my affairs from now on.

326
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,340
And stop coming here, too.

327
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:22,580
Do you... still find me... untrustworthy?

328
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:27,610
Although I am stepping down, I am still Lee Gyeom.

329
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:32,730
It does not change the fact that I am an heir to the throne who can threaten the king.

330
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:36,500
The king does not know of your existence.

331
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:40,520
- So... 
 - So he can find out any moment!

332
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:45,700
I am saying... it can be dangerous to be by my side.

333
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:55,860
I do not... want to...

334
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,980
lose you, too, Hostess.

335
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:17,970

336
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:21,750
Left State Minister Shin Won Ho was the one who helped Mok In Hoe?

337
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:24,400
I did not even imagine.

338
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:29,560
Left State Minister asked me if he could see the deposed crown prince's son in person.

339
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,500
He will be at today's gathering as well.

340
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,670
I will arrange a meeting if you would like.

341
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:44,110
Why come with us when we can go by ourselves?

342
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:50,700
It'd be better to be next to you than to be in your shadow since we know everything.

343
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,370
Let him be.

344
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:55,580
It is probably because he still does not trust me.

345
00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:01,410
Also... three is better than two.

346
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,010
For what?

347
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,040
I'm also just as desperate.

348
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:12,500
You need to take the throne in order for Watchman to gain freedom.

349
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,040
Do not take it personally.

350
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:27,140
Doubting endlessly... is my job.

351
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:40,430
We must hurry up and rise.

352
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,880
As the brutal winter comes on top of tyranny,

353
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,280
the entire country is covered with the people's wailings.

354
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:52,380
Once spring comes, we might have to live in houses built on countless graves.

355
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,320
The Royal Court is full of disloyal subjects.

356
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:59,570
Will the darkness fade that easily just from crowning a new king?

357
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,520
Are you saying we must replace the rotten government officials first?

358
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,580
We must first repair the three inspecting bureaus that lost their functions

359
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,730
of advising and correcting.

360
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:20,450
They said a king seeks wise subjects... the more perilous a country becomes.

361
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:24,730
I ask you, gentlemen, who are deeply resolved and righteous, to become

362
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:27,490
government officials and to be the backbone.

363
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:33,310
Yoo Ha was already thinking about it.

364
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,450
About what?

365
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:42,570
How to build a new house on top of a demolished sand castle.

366
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:48,980
 What will you do if you become the king?

367
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:52,300
 You will become the father of this country.

368
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:55,820
 You should take time and start thinking about it.

369
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:59,550
It did not even cross my mind.

370
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:08,690
My goal has always been... fixated on... taking down the king.

371
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:11,760
Breaking down the sand castle comes first.

372
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,960
The hunt at Mt. Eungbong.

373
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,010
Please focus on that for now.

374
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:26,110
If your heart is wavering... your arrow will waver as well.

375
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,380
Is he not the man?

376
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,550
Left State Minister Shin Won Ho.

377
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:59,980
You're Ban Ya, right? What brings you here?

378
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:03,550
Is Chief Administrator present?

379
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:07,820
All right. What is your business?

380
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:12,150
I secretly followed Hostess last night.

381
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:15,920
I saw her going into Left State Minister's house.

382
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,270
All right.

383
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:26,380
Notify me again if you find out anything else.

384
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,040
Yes.

385
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,980
Keep on watching closely.

386
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:42,060
Left State Minister seems to be scheming something.

387
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,970
Yes, Sir.

388
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,960
I was taken by surprise.

389
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,380
For you to be in the palace, the deposed crown prince's son...

390
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,660
I was also surprised.

391
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,660
Because you were the sponsor of Mok In Hoe.

392
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:08,860
The only lord I serve... is this country, Joseon.

393
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:13,270
Please consider my daring act to steal your name as a loyal attempt to

394
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:15,580
save this country from doom.

395
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:21,280
The method was disloyal... but your intention was loyal?

396
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,440
Did you want to see me to give me excuses?

397
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,210
I wanted to see you in person and inquire.

398
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:29,440
What is your will, Your Highness?

399
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,720
Do you... intend to kill the king?

400
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:46,220
You keep doing... what you need to do with Mok In Hoe as usual.

401
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,520
I will see that my will gets done.

402
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:00,310
Right. Did you know about this?

403
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:02,480
I'm older than the two of you by four years.

404
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,270
It is as I expected.

405
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:06,040
You cannot fake everything but your age.

406
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,450
Yes. I was most suspicious that we were the same age.

407
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:12,510
Well, who's the older brother between you two?

408
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:15,610
My birthday probably comes first.

409
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,140
Mine is in spring.

410
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,450
Very early spring, on top of that.

411
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:22,470
That means Kang San is the older brother, right?

412
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,970
We're the same age, so you're not an older brother.

413
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:27,190
We must make it clear, especially since we're brothers.

414
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,840
Even twins differentiate between older and younger.

415
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,940
You were pointing your sword at me the other day.

416
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:35,400
Now, you recognize me as your brother?

417
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,550
Well, I feel so grateful.

418
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,380
Why do you come out from there?

419
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,880
What are you doing over there?

420
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,550
I was cleaning the flower bed.

421
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:52,100
By the way, who are brothers with whom?

422
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,920
You two look nothing alike.

423
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:32,820
Does that mean... you are also royalty, Brother?

424
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:40,040
Wait, then... that talk about pointing swords...

425
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,790
About that, Dan Oh...

426
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:46,040
It's because I've been leading Mok In Hoe.

427
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:56,580
I tried to take the throne, pretending to be Lee Seol.

428
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:03,850
He had no idea about my identity then.

429
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:06,580
We cleared our misunderstandings, too.

430
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:12,080
Wait.

431
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:17,190
You knew about all this, too, Brother Shi Yeol?

432
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,880
I mean, I have always...

433
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,730
been known to be keener than a sword.

434
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:38,950
Hey, hey, hey. Gosh...

435
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:51,490
Maiden Hong Joo, come out for a moment!

436
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,000
What brings you here this late at night?

437
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,400
I must show you something. Only you.

438
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,100
It is impossible, if not right now.

439
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,030
Do you see that red star over there?

440
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,600
I have never seen it that close to a full moon, either.

441
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,100
It is a rare sight.

442
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:37,300
They are so beautiful together... but they will be separated soon. Right?

443
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,730
Make your wish first.

444
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:44,640
Since a rare star is in the sky, your chances would double. Right?

445
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,600
What did you wish for?

446
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,400
Stop asking me and make your wish, too.

447
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,800
Do you not have anything you must accomplish?

448
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:09,400
As for what I need to accomplish... pass the exam and achieve success?

449
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,100
My goodness, Scholar Kim.

450
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,600
Oh, you're coming out now?

451
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,200
It is your day off tomorrow, right?

452
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,100
Yes, I'm so glad.

453
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:42,200
I dislike hunting, but I dislike hiking even more.

454
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,700
Could... you switch...

455
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:50,200
shifts with me tomorrow?

456
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,300
Shifts?

457
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,100
Does it have to be me?

458
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,600
Did you not hear that I disliked it just now?

459
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,400
It is because tomorrow is my father's memorial day.

460
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,000
Can you please help me out?

461
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,300
Gosh, even so, that's...

462
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,300
I can do anything else, but hiking is really—

463
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,800
I polished all the ritual equipment already.

464
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,200
Do you need any other foods?

465
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,600
I will buy them when I am grocery shopping.

466
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,400
Yes, I think what we have is enough.

467
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,400
Since I could not observe it last year...

468
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,200
- I want to make— 
 - Geez, my goodness!

469
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,800
All right, then.

470
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,800
Instead, switch shifts with me one time, too.

471
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,200
Just tell me any time. I'll switch twice, no—

472
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,500
I'll switch twice, no... even three times!

473
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,100
Th-Three times?

474
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,500
You better keep your promise.

475
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,600
You have my word.

476
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,000
There is a gathering on the 15th of this month.

477
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,300
Lee Seol will show himself that day.

478
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,300
There is still a lot of time left.

479
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,800
So many things could happen in that time.

480
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,300
Your Majesty, the soldiers are already thoroughly prepared.

481
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:18,100
The deposed crown prince's son, Lee Seol, will not make it alive past this month.

482
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:23,300
If he... makes it past this month...

483
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,600
will you give up your neck, Left State Minister?

484
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,190
Yes.

485
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:33,750
Please... take this humble one's life yourself.

486
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,820
I will be counting on you.

487
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,000
Chief Administrator seems to have caught on?

488
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,200
Yes, Your Excellency.

489
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:52,000
Someone saw Hwa Ryeong coming here.

490
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,000
All right. You can take your leave.

491
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:27,220
You seem to be out of use now.

492
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,900
M-Mok In Hoe...

493
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:48,800
What did you say?

494
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,000
Left State Minister is the sponsor of Mok In Hoe.

495
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
If you are lying to get out of this...

496
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,800
His Excellency plans to use Mok In Hoe...

497
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:04,400
to make the deposed crown prince's son, Lee Seol, the king.

498
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,400
In that case...

499
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,800
are Head Eunuch and Hwa Ryeong helping him with that?

500
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,300
Yes.

501
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,800
This is a hideout I prepared separately.

502
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,800
To prepare for the unforeseen.

503
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,000
The unforeseen?

504
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,200
I figured you would need a place to hide.

505
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,400
Since you are always in danger when by my side.

506
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,200
Is it...

507
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:58,460
going to happen soon?

508
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:07,200
The rebellion... is now very near. Right?

509
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,600
In case of the unforeseen...

510
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,880
When you say unforeseen...

511
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:35,400
you might not be here, so you prepared all this. Right?

512
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:44,520
I'll be here.

513
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,800
By your side, just like this.

514
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,800
I did not know it would be happening so soon.

515
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,400
The day...

516
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,200
Could it be tomorrow?

517
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:29,800
I thought you would worry endlessly... if I disappeared without a word.

518
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:39,000
Please come back before the sun sets.

519
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:43,600
I must spend the night with you.

520
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,000
I will do that.

521
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:51,200
I will come back before the moon shines.

522
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,700
Right.

523
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,300
You asked me before.

524
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,600
About what I want to do.

525
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,200
Yeah.

526
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,500
Did you think about it?

527
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,400
Yes.

528
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:21,600
There is something I wanted to do for a while, but have not been able to fulfill.

529
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,200
What is it you could not fulfill?

530
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,500
Going very...

531
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,200
very far away.

532
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,900
Far away?

533
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:45,400
At times, Ihwawon felt overwhelmingly suffocating.

534
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,100
No...

535
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,600
my family did.

536
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:00,000
Was it because I struggled so much when I could not protect it well?

537
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:08,300
Brother Shi Yeol... was able to make my sister smile in one try.

538
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,700
I realized it then.

539
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:17,200
My anxiety had made my sister sick.

540
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:22,300
Living confined in hiding... is not really living.

541
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:29,100
Thanks to your anxiety, Maiden Yoon has been safe so far

542
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:32,400
and was able to meet Shi Yeol.

543
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,000
You really think so?

544
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,660
Who took in a guy who wanted to stay and eat for free?

545
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:47,700
So where do you... want to travel to?

546
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,500
Wherever.

547
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:57,000
Traveling the entire country sounds great and

548
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,400
going to see the oceans far away sounds great, too.

549
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,460
I see.

550
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:11,100
I did not know... how you felt.

551
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,000
I did not know at all.

552
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:20,560
♫  I'll say I'll protect you forever  ♫

553
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:25,890
And if you were by my side, I could not be happier.

554
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:32,010
But...

555
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:36,910
right here is nice, too.

556
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:41,300
♫  For some reason, it sounds awkward to me  ♫

557
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:47,170
♫  Afraid that we might become distanced  ♫

558
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:50,900
♫  I'm waiting for you  ♫

559
00:50:50,900 --> 00:51:00,410
♫  Afraid everything will disappear when I reach you  ♫

560
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:06,000
♫  I couldn't tell you again today  ♫

561
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:14,550
♫  Cherished in the corner of my heart, so it won't show  ♫

562
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:19,090
♫  Those words, love you  ♫

563
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:22,850
♫  Enough to stop my breath  ♫

564
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:26,680
♫  As much as I love you  ♫

565
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:37,060
♫  I'll keep you in my arms and say I'll protect you forever  ♫

566
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:42,780
♫  This thorny night I'm spending without you  ♫

567
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:47,040
♫  The moment you came to me  ♫

568
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,140
♫  All of it disappears  ♫

569
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:54,680
♫  Cherished in the corner of my heart  ♫

570
00:51:54,680 --> 00:52:04,020
♫  Those words somewhere in my heart, love you  ♫

571
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:07,710
♫  Enough to stop my breath  ♫

572
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:11,410
♫  As much as I love you  ♫

573
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:22,550
♫  I'll keep you in my arms and say I'll protect you forever  ♫

574
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:33,170
I'll be back... safely.

575
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:20,020
&lt;ㅑ&gt;

576
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:29,860
 Maiden Hong Joo, may I enter for a moment?

577
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:33,810
Yes, come in.

578
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:52,100
They said the jesters would be visiting the market today.

579
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,290
I am looking forward to it already.

580
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:56,820
Well, Maiden Hong Joo...

581
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:59,770
What's wrong?

582
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:03,700
An important matter suddenly came up.

583
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:06,890
Let us go watch the jesters next time.

584
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:12,190
There's no choice if it's an important matter.

585
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:14,850
Take care.

586
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:17,440
It is a huge relief, though.

587
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:30,620
If I missed this beautiful sight of you, I would have been quite disappointed.

588
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:06,690
I am worried you might get hurt.

589
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:18,720
Lower your swords.

590
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:30,720
Chief Administrator Jang seeks to make an urgent report to His Majesty.

591
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:37,900
You can hand it to me.

592
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:40,750
It is a report regarding Lee Seol.

593
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:44,040
I intend to hand it directly to His Majesty.

594
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:58,390
I did not write it down, worried it might get leaked.

595
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:01,160
Leaked to whom?

596
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,890
Left State Minister Shin Won Ho...

597
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:07,240
That man is the sponsor of Mok In Hoe.

598
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:16,980
Shin Won Ho is... attempting to put Lee Seol on the throne.

599
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:22,260
Head Eunuch and... Queen Dowager joined his cause, too.

600
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:26,740
So we do not know how many more spies exist within the palace.

601
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,960
Will you be able to prove what you said?

602
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,130
I have a witness in custody.

603
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:45,640
You can question him when you return to the palace.

604
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:56,500
Your Majesty... should I not also be informed if it is an urgent report on Lee Seol?

605
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,410
Left State Minister...

606
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:03,830
You said you would give your life up to me. Right?

607
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:08,690
I said I would do so if I failed to catch Lee Seol within this month.

608
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:20,590
That is enough for me.

609
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:23,210
I must go back to the palace now.

610
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:45,320
 They are trying to kill me and put Lee Seol on the throne?

611
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,430
Your Majesty!

612
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:52,450
- Escort His Majesty! 
 -  Yes!

613
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:03,230
Let us go.

614
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:05,960
I'll escort you to the gates.

615
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:10,540
You finally came, Lee Seol.

616
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:31,890

617
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:51,210

618
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:54,530
 It was all my fault from the beginning to the end.

619
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:58,580
 Did you kill my son and play around with his betrothed?

620
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:01,680
 Please do not forgive me. Blame me and hate me, please.

621
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:05,860
 If you intend to stay as Ihwawon's hostess, you two will part ways.

622
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:08,800
 Could you live the rest of your life without San?

623
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:13,200
 Lee Seol, I will not have to stand here again if you bring down the king.

624
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,290
 I promise you. I'll come back before the sun sets.

625
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:21,100
 I will not be taken down and come to you safely.

626
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:26,650
♫  My chest is overwhelmed like it's going to burst  ♫
