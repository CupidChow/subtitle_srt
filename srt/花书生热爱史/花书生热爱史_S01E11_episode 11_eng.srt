1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,010

2
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,970

3
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,940

4
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,400

5
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,640

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,200

8
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,000
Show me your face.

9
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,550
It is an order.

10
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,800
Let me... greet you, Master.

11
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,600
Kim Shi Yeol.

12
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,400
Were you... the Watchman?

13
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,560
You have been so near me.

14
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,820
But I did not recognize you.

15
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,400
You need to hide away first.

16
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,340

17
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,300
Do you mean the "jade dust" is among us?

18
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,000
So it was not just a rumor?

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,100
The prophecy was true.

20
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,450
Listen up, everyone!

21
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,640
The "jade dust" is here right now!

22
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,300
If he truly is the "jade dust,"

23
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,800
why has he been hiding his identity all this time?

24
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
People were dying.

25
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,000
So how come you did not show up sooner?

26
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,000
It has been eight years.

27
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,800
I was always curious about you.

28
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,600
Since... I first saw you that day.

29
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,570
Have you been following me ever since?

30
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,960
Yes.

31
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,600
I have been... following your footsteps all my life.

32
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,400
 That way! Follow him!

33
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,400
I guess I was your holding cage.

34
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,300
You probably could not have left my side.

35
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,500
That is what the Watchman is destined to do.

36
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,400
You do not have to worry.

37
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,700
I heard the Watchman is freed if his master becomes the king.

38
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,800
That is going to happen soon.

39
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,900
I could...

40
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,700
only enjoy that freedom if you were safe first.

41
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,400
I know.

42
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,900
If I break, you'd break, too.

43
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,800
I am... not here as the oldest son of the crown prince.

44
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:46,200
I will not reign above you because of my status.

45
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:52,700
The world is changed by one's will, not by his ancestry.

46
00:05:54,200 --> 00:06:00,400
In order to protect your earnest determination to stop the king's tyranny,

47
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,000
I will be ahead of everyone and take the blame.

48
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,600
That is... the reason I am...

49
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
standing here right now.

50
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,450
Watchman.

51
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,540
It was him.

52
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:23,600
He attacked only the vital point concisely and accurately.

53
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,000
What did Jong Soo say before he left?

54
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,600
He apparently said he was leaving to look for someone.

55
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,900
I assume it is the deposed crown prince's son.

56
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:54,600
I have no idea how much Chief Administrator Jang found out.

57
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,400
I took care of your friend, who reported you without leaving any trace.

58
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,600
Did you know?

59
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,300
Yes.

60
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:11,800
I have been secretly... checking his surroundings.

61
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,440
 - Let us go. 
 - Yes!

62
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,400
 Who are you?

63
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,900
 Who are you?

64
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,500
Act normal at Ihwawon.

65
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,100
You can never let them know.

66
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,000
Yes.

67
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,900
Especially... Dan Oh.

68
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,600
Do not worry.

69
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,100
My specialty is to hide or disguise.

70
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,800
Did the deposed crown prince's son show up?

71
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Left State Minister, how did you know what was going on here?

72
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
There is nothing I do not know about in Hanyang.

73
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,800
Especially when it comes to the deposed crown prince's son.

74
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,140
Did Watchman do this?

75
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,150
Yes.

76
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,780
It is just like what happened eight years ago.

77
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,280
Since these people died,

78
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:04,580
no one would know what the "jade dust" looks like this time as well.

79
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,890

80
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,810
Where did Yoo Ha go so early?

81
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,670
He left in a hurry to study.

82
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,770
He is definitely a model student.

83
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,060
I need to catch up to him, too!

84
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,010
You must eat well.

85
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,490
Being healthy will get you halfway there.

86
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,160
Are you okay, San?

87
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,960
Dan Oh was hungover all day yesterday.

88
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,790
I know you are close, but you cannot get drunk together as a man and a woman.

89
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,070
I did not drink with San!

90
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,620
You did not?

91
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,660
What did you two do together, then?

92
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,780
I thought you drank together!

93
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:21,990
I saw him carrying you on his back so carefully as if you were a newborn—

94
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,500
It was not exactly like that.

95
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,990
No, you were carrying her like a newborn baby—

96
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,080
San is incredibly strong.

97
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,830
I am sure she is significantly heavier than a newborn.

98
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,510
L-Let me bring more side dishes!

99
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,380
- Well...
 - There are plenty of side dishes.

100
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:45,480
The table legs might break if you put too much food on the table, Dan Oh!

101
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,730
Your legs will break first, Shi Yeol.

102
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,770
 Brother.

103
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,350
 Please leave.

104
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,580
 You must go far, far away...

105
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,360
 No.

106
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,290
 Do not leave.

107
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,650
 Do not leave and stay by my side...

108
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,200
I cannot enter the palace easily, either.

109
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,630
I am looking for a solution. You must be careful until then.

110
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,470
I know.

111
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,850
Right.

112
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:00,590
Dan Oh already knows... about who you are.

113
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:04,550
I heard you talking secretly at Jukrimwon a while ago.

114
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,280
"I still cannot believe it.

115
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,530
That you are Lee Seol, the deposed crown prince's son."

116
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:15,150
That is what Dan Oh said.

117
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:20,400
No matter what happens, do not hurt Dan Oh.

118
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,130
I cannot hurt the woman Master is in love with.

119
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,040
I am not that foolish.

120
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,390
Hold on.

121
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,210
What did you just say?

122
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:33,380
- Love? 
 - Am I wrong?

123
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,270
- The night Dan Oh got drunk, she said— 
 - Did you see all that, too—

124
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,470
It could not be missed.

125
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,190
You were being affectionate in that open yard.

126
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,370
Keep some distance from me from now on.

127
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:50,360
I thought you were only quick with words, but your eyes are quick, too.

128
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,730
If I keep my distance, I will not be able to guard you perfectly.

129
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,080
I cannot allow that.

130
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,390
You mean you will keep watching me... to see what I do?

131
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:03,350
Looks like... you have a lot of things to do.

132
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,120
No, there is not a lot, but—

133
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,580
Okay, I will give you space from now on.

134
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,310
You do not have to explain yourself.

135
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:57,340
When people get drunk, they lose their minds and make mistakes.

136
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,390
Feel free to act like it never happened. I do not care.

137
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,360
It was... not a mistake.

138
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:29,120
I cannot... just pretend as if nothing happened.

139
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,920
What? Seol was arrested?

140
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,520
He is apparently at the questioning site right now.

141
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,460
Your Highness!

142
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:13,430
Are you here to check if your grandson you have been waiting for has appeared?

143
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,260
Look, Head Eunuch.

144
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,090
Is he really Lee Seol?

145
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,310
He is not.

146
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:51,530
He does not look like the grown-up Lee Seol.

147
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:03,260
Your Majesty, Lee Seol apparently showed up in Seogangbyeon.

148
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,190
What?

149
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,670
Are you ordering me to work as a eunuch again?

150
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,450
You never know how he will disguise and approach me.

151
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,980
You should find him for me.

152
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,550
I will serve you the best I can.

153
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:31,870
The palace guards are guarding the palace securely.

154
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,870
Please do not worry.

155
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:48,860

156
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,590
My arrow will not hit the target since I am disturbed.

157
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,390
You should give it a try.

158
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,580
What are you waiting for?

159
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,420
- Shoot, I said. 
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

160
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,020
Lee Seol would look similar to you if he were to show up in the palace.

161
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,840
He would be around your age, too.

162
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,510
Your Majesty, Chief Administrator Jang Tae Hwa is here.

163
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,230
I heard you missed Lee Seol again.

164
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:55,310
I would be satisfied if I killed you.

165
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,170
Allow me to speak to you, Your Majesty.

166
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:08,990
Until I rip Lee Seol into pieces, I cannot allow myself to die.

167
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,300
While chasing after the deposed crown prince's son,

168
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:16,650
I lost my only son and all of my men.

169
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:24,330
Your Majesty! Please allow me... to avenge him!

170
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,400
Are you back in the palace by chance?

171
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
His Majesty ordered me to.

172
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,400
I have no power to say no to him.

173
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,600
Head Eunuch, do you find this situation amusing?

174
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,400
I am of humble origin, and I deserve to die anytime.

175
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,300
I need to have fun at least to make the most out of my life.

176
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,180
Do you regret it?

177
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,600
If you found me and killed me when I reported you

178
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,400
to Six Swords many years ago,

179
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,800
you would not be going through the trouble now.

180
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,000
No.

181
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,600
You are the one who created this situation, Head Eunuch.

182
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,300
When you came to Ihwawon with Chief Administrator,

183
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:31,600
I was sure I would get caught, but... you did not let him know.

184
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,800
I do not care... why you did that.

185
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,600
Can you help me like you did then?

186
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,090

187
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,300
It has been so long, Scholar.

188
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,800
You got even thinner than before.

189
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,300
I have been busy.

190
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,800
Will you keep following me?

191
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,700
You told me to...

192
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,500
let you know if I am having trouble.

193
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:26,000
Tell me... what you cannot deal with alone.

194
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,400
It is loneliness.

195
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,000
Could you please let me have...

196
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,400
a part of your day?

197
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,500
When I am with you,

198
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,900
even Buyounggak does not feel so bad.

199
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,400
You came so soon.

200
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,300
That courtesan was Sir Im Ji Gook's daughter?

201
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,200
He was an officer at the Office of Special Advisors.

202
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,200
- Did you know him, too? 
 - I did.

203
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,600
When you survived after getting chased by Six Swords,

204
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,800
the court was in chaos.

205
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:28,000
The Confucious scholars sent countless appeals asking not to execute you.

206
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,400
And Sir Im Ji Gook is the one who led them.

207
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,900
Are you concerned about that woman?

208
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:49,600
I feel like my sin got even bigger without realizing it.

209
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,700
There is something I need to tell you about.

210
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,300
Mok In Hoe has been very suspicious.

211
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:02,700
The head of Mok In Hoe calls himself Lee Seol and leads the scholars.

212
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,400
Did Head Eunuch find the Watchman of the deposed crown prince's son?

213
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:38,600
I told him that Watchman does not know who his master is.

214
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,800
I am old now, too.

215
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:48,400
It would be nice if you taught the students like you used to.

216
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,300
How could I be satisfied with other students?

217
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,800
I met an excellent student too early on.

218
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,800
You said I was an unusually annoying student.

219
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:06,200
You certainly were a bit unusual, Your Majesty.

220
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,400
I am sick of being called "Your Majesty."

221
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,100
Since you two finally got to see each other, you should catch up a bit.

222
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,600
They still use a sword like this.

223
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,800
It is too heavy.

224
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,600
Who are you?

225
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,200
I was stuck in the temple all the time at your age, too.

226
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,400
It was so depressing.

227
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,200
Okay. I am feeling generous.

228
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,000
I will choose one person and show him around the market.

229
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,800
Will you, really?

230
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,600
Me! Me! I really want to go!

231
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,900
- Me! Me! 
 - I want to go, too!

232
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:15,400
The one who scratches me even slightly will be the winner.

233
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,200
Do you really mean that?

234
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,600
I won, did I not?

235
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:27,200
Yes, you are His Majesty this time.

236
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,100
You mean it, right?

237
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,700
Your Majesty, let us go check out the market.

238
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,600
Sounds good!

239
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,600
The number of palace guards increased even more.

240
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,400
They are getting anxious because

241
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,000
people are excited about the prophecy regarding the new king.

242
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,500
I heard the inspector of Pyeongando and the military officer of Gyeongsangdo

243
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,200
volunteered to take trivial positions because they could not stand the tyranny.

244
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,400
What do you think about contacting them?

245
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,200
That is an excellent idea.

246
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,200
We desperately need their help to fight the palace guards.

247
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,400
If they find out you are alive,

248
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,400
they will open their arms and take a deep vow.

249
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,000
We will be turning the world upside down.

250
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,300
No one could easily volunteer to do it.

251
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,290
Here.

252
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,900
It is a winter hat.

253
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,800
Try it on to see if it fits.

254
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,400
You did not have to do this.

255
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
What a relief.

256
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,200
I eyeballed it. So I was not sure if it would fit.

257
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,400
Did you make it yourself?

258
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,860
It has gotten cold a lot.

259
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,890
I am sure it will help.

260
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,600
What did I tell you?

261
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,700
I told you the king might want you.

262
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,400
I meant it when I told you to be careful.

263
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,800
I hoped you would not become a concubine.

264
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,200
That is not true.

265
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,000
I do not know where rumors like that come from.

266
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,300
It is a strange time right now.

267
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,200
They say the deposed crown prince's son will become the king, too.

268
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,700
Everyone is so interested in things happening in the palace.

269
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:41,400
Of course. There was that poster in the market, too.

270
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,400
Do you want the deposed crown prince's son to become the king?

271
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,400
You should not say something like that.

272
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,200
What if someone hears us?

273
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,200
He has not shown his face anywhere yet.

274
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,600
Will he really show up?

275
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:04,500
 I cannot ignore the ones who got killed only to protect myself.

276
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,500
 You saved my life.

277
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,100
 I will not give up on it and waste it.

278
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,000
 Do not worry.

279
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,050
Scholar Jeong!

280
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:28,070
I think it is about time for you to move to Buyounggak.

281
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:30,230
If Young Lady Dan Oh becomes the king's concubine,

282
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,240
would she even continue running Ihwawon?

283
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,940
What do you mean by that?

284
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,980
- What will she become? 
 - Have you not heard?

285
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,860
The rumor is already widespread at Buyounggak—

286
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,160
Do not be worried.

287
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:44,300
I will serve you with all my heart every night, in Young Lady Dan Oh's place.

288
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,960
Such a thing will never happen, so go about your business now.

289
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:55,390
- You also come to a place like this, Brother? 
 - Well...

290
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,970
The thing is...

291
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:00,920
And what is going on with that winter hat?

292
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:05,790
I am quite flustered these days by different sides of you.

293
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:13,240
What do you mean, a concubine? It really is not true.

294
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,130
Are you sure?

295
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:18,310
His Majesty did not say anything about it to you?

296
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:24,300
No, His Majesty is not someone who lets people easily into his heart.

297
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,040
The king will not last much longer.

298
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,060
He will soon be taken down.

299
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,860
Could it be...

300
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:45,190
you have joined forces with those who read "Three Secret Prophecies of Joseon?"

301
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,000
Yes, that is correct.

302
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,800
I have joined Mok In Hoe.

303
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,650
Therefore, do not become close with the king.

304
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,740
Mok In Hoe?

305
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,870
I knew that was the case.

306
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,730
You can leave if you have nothing to say.

307
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:29,960
There are so many things to ask. I don't know where to start.

308
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,790
I heard people say Lee Seol is the leader of Mok In Hoe.

309
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,100
Do you believe them, Yoo Ha?

310
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:41,170
I'm wondering if they're misleading the people for no good reason.

311
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:44,790
Do you think I will tell the truth to a royal guard?

312
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:48,710
If we were not friends, you'd already be at the Royal Investigation Bureau.

313
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:53,650
You are loud enough for someone to hear and take you away.

314
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:55,910
Please lower your voice.

315
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:58,400
We were talking quietly.

316
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:11,610
And you kept such a dangerous endeavor a secret from us?

317
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,530
What if things go—

318
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:17,050
wrong and you get Dan Oh in danger?

319
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:20,360
A pot is calling the kettle black—

320
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:28,490
It's hot—

321
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:31,260
Dan Oh, I understand how you feel.

322
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:36,790
Rather than a royal guard who serves a tyrant... an ambitious reformer is better.

323
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:39,790
Just do not fight with each other for no reason.

324
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:42,540
I am sure Brother has his reasons.

325
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,680
Since when were you so understanding?

326
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,390
She tried to stop me ever so eagerly.

327
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,690
Don't worry.

328
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:54,340
I will never let the Ihwawon family be in harm's way.

329
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,330
The scholars are at the men's quarters and

330
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:27,700
I thought my room would be better for us two to talk alone.

331
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,260
Just... the two of us?

332
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,200
Yes.

333
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,460
Well... Brother...

334
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:38,760
I don't know what it is... but let us do it once the sun is up.

335
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,840
You seem to have taken me too lightly from the beginning...

336
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,260
No.

337
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,620
It must be done today.

338
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:50,190
Wait... What exactly are you getting at?

339
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:54,990
I heard a lot of people...

340
00:34:54,990 --> 00:35:00,200
want the deposed crown prince's son to take the throne.

341
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,270
Seeing how even Brother Yoo Ha is a part of it,

342
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:10,340
I guess it is not just a foolish wish.

343
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,320
Dan Oh...

344
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,300
I know what you are worried about.

345
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:24,000
However, I cannot promise I will do nothing just to ease your worries.

346
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,620
Since I can not keep it.

347
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,500
I know.

348
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:34,410
Who am I to dare interfere with...

349
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:37,640
Your Highness's greater will?

350
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:46,910
♫  On the night the moon rose, the day you quietly reached me  ♫

351
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,240
I am going to try and believe in you.

352
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,160
♫  All of our memories  ♫

353
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,100
Since you said you would not fail them meaninglessly,

354
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,880
please keep that promise above all others.

355
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,120
♫  Please stay with me  ♫

356
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,330
Why did you change your mind?

357
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,310
You were telling me to leave before.

358
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:08,220
If the path you are trying to take cannot be turned around,

359
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,480
do not be lonely, at least.

360
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,310
♫  Even if it hurts, I can cherish you  ♫

361
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:20,930
I will be with you...

362
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,100
by your side.

363
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:28,550
♫  At the place I have always been watching you  ♫

364
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,150
Repeat what you just told me.

365
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:47,670
Head Eunuch is the one Queen Dowager had met in secret last time?

366
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:51,810
Yes, I clearly witnessed it with my own eyes.

367
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:55,370
Did you not get to hear what they talked about?

368
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,860
She told us to go away.

369
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:01,950
When he was leaving after meeting Her Highness...

370
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:06,620
he had what seemed to be a bundle of money in his hand.

371
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:10,760
You can go back to your station.

372
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,250
His Majesty executed Court Lady Kim, who was more or less

373
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,410
the right arm of Queen Dowager.

374
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,700
I am sure she needed a replacement.

375
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,450
If it is a bundle of money...

376
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:33,640
she must have entrusted Head Eunuch with the funds for the Watchmen.

377
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:38,190
Find Lee Seol through the Watchmen?

378
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:43,060
It is a strategy only Queen Dowager can come up with.

379
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,740
 Watchman...

380
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:49,390
 It is a perfect chance to get you.

381
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,360
Maiden Yoon!

382
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:21,190
Why did you bring me here?

383
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,950
I do not see a single exam applicant.

384
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,050
Today, instead of customers...

385
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,820
look at the scenery.

386
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:40,930
This is one page of... the years of fine seasons you missed.

387
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:20,760
The sound of water is so clear.

388
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,160
Not as clear as your voice.

389
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,980
Since you barely used it all this time...

390
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,620
it is clear without a flaw...

391
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:36,110
and beautiful.

392
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:54,820
Foliage is better than flowers, for sure.

393
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,790
Do you not think so?

394
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:16,090
Write down everything... you did not get to do all this time.

395
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:18,020
Why?

396
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:21,930
Will you grant all of them for me?

397
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:24,570
I also have many things I never got to do.

398
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:30,620
I think it will be fun to... do them together with you.

399
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,400
Even if Lee Seol is being guarded by the Watchman,

400
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,500
you will catch him in the end, Sir.

401
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,200
Please do not be too distressed.

402
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:01,500
Lady Dan Oh has found some sort of clue, has she not?

403
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,000
What do you mean?

404
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I heard she frequents the palace.

405
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,800
She used to look for a man with a red mole at Buyounggak.

406
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:16,100
I just wondered if she found out anything.

407
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:22,800
I did not know you had such an interest in Lee Seol.

408
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,600
Forgive me if I overstepped my boundary.

409
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,600
I am deeply sorry.

410
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,100
I will bring something to clean it up.

411
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,400
 There's no way Scholar Kang San is...

412
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,200
Why do you look so down?

413
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,200
It's because of Dan Oh, isn't it?

414
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,600
Sir?

415
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,400
You said to act naturally at home.

416
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,600
Sir...

417
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:42,400
Can I... really protect Dan Oh?

418
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,200
She would survive a war by selling porridge.

419
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,400
What are you so worried about?

420
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:51,900
You seem to have grown very close to Maiden Hong Joo.

421
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,000
Yeah.

422
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,300
I've never met a woman like her.

423
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,600
I want to do everything for her.

424
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,500
Have you shared a lot of conversations?

425
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,800
She seems to have a long story.

426
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,800
Seeing how she lives alone, confined in the annex.

427
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,200
I'm waiting for her.

428
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,600
She'll open up once she trusts me.

429
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,400
Anyway, this is a secret from Dan Oh.

430
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,800
She's worried she spends too much time outside.

431
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,600
I'm not that tactless.

432
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,500
For someone with tact, you really didn't recognize me.

433
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,600
We've shared so many meals,

434
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,600
but it seems you swallowed up your tact...

435
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,000
Your informal words are weapons.

436
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,700
Your mouth is a warrior, too.

437
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,600
Our Maiden Dan Oh says to have some roasted chestnuts.

438
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,800
Our Dan Oh, our Dan Oh, our Dan Oh!

439
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,000
Stop saying that.

440
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,000
It's been getting on my nerves.

441
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,200
Your Dan Oh says to have some roasted chestnuts.

442
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,800
Happy now?

443
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,500
Let us go.

444
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,800
Goodness, hurry and sit.

445
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,400
Have one. It's very sweet.

446
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:18,000
It's still hot. Be careful.

447
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,900
It's sweet... and hot...

448
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,200
The roasted chestnuts have such variety.

449
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:43,400
Yoo Ha, you're... busy these days with studying, aren't you?

450
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,200
Yes, indeed.

451
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,800
There are many books in your room that are hard to get.

452
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,800
Anybody home?

453
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,800
Who is it...

454
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,000
at this hour?

455
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,600
His Majesty has ordered you to come to the palace tomorrow.

456
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,600
I am already looking forward to it.

457
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,200
Our first day to go to work together after I pass the exam with you.

458
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,800
Yes, that would make me glad.

459
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,100
In any case, is there something you have to tell me?

460
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,000
Are you on your way to study?

461
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,400
Gosh, the owner is leaving,

462
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,800
but how about all these lonely books?

463
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,900
You can freely borrow any books you need.

464
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,200
Thank you.

465
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,500
I will return them to you in perfect condition.

466
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,700

467
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:46,570
S-Sir, this book is...

468
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,900
Are you the one who drew this picture?

469
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,200
I did not.

470
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,700
Was it really not you?

471
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,200
Why do you ask?

472
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,900
This is important.

473
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,800
What is this?

474
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,500
I went through much trouble getting this from a physician I know.

475
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,600
I'll see you in the palace.

476
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:17,000
What will His Majesty have up his sleeve this time to summon you?

477
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Do not fret.

478
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,100
I'll be able to find a way out like last time.

479
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,600
You're taking quite the time with Dan Oh...

480
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,200
Sir.

481
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:34,970
San.

482
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,800
Come see me for a moment.

483
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,300
Can I see you after I get off work?

484
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,800
I must leave early today.

485
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,000
It will only take a moment.

486
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,730

487
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:04,200
Dan Oh once told me...

488
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,700
that she saved the son...

489
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:12,300
of the deposed crown prince's son, who hid inside a dog house.

490
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,400
Were you the one who drew this?

491
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,600
Are you really...

492
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,300
Lee Seol, the deposed crown prince's son?

493
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,500
Sir, what are you doing?

494
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,800
Dan Oh is like a daughter to me.

495
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,400
I cannot just watch her get hurt.

496
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:46,100
You are the source of all this trouble, Your Highness.

497
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,000
Your Highness...

498
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,400
I plead with you.

499
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,600
Please leave Ihwawon.

500
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,800
Sir is right.

501
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,500
I am always the source of trouble.

502
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,800
I am often filled with these thoughts...

503
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,000
If I had not come to Hanyang...

504
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,400
Do you want to give up the throne, perhaps?

505
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:50,340
I see you left early to come here.

506
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:53,670
But what is this place?

507
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:57,120
It's a secret hideout I had prepared a long time ago.

508
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:02,670
If something happens to me...

509
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:09,260
Shi Yeol, you must bring Dan Oh and the Ihwawon family here safely.

510
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:11,990
I am a Watchman who tends to Your Highness's safety.

511
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:13,920
I cannot fulfill such a request.

512
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,650
It's not a request. It's an order.

513
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:21,520
Whatever happens, my life cannot come before yours.

514
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:26,390
Please protect the Ihwawon family.

515
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:29,560
That includes you.

516
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:33,170
And...

517
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:37,100
just in case...

518
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:40,860
if Dan Oh happens to be followed...

519
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:52,180
 The extraordinary man will appear with the blizzard from the north.

520
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:55,670
 The entire world will be enveloped by pure white.

521
00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:01,720
Do you intend to add sentences to "Three Secret Prophecies of Joseon?"

522
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,100
The rumors have already spread,

523
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:10,400
so we must leave evidence that Lee Seol, the deposed crown prince's son, is that extraordinary man.

524
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,100
If the real Lee Seol appears,

525
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,720
what will you do?

526
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:19,090
I consider Prince to be king material.

527
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:25,580
Unless Lee Seol is more remarkable than him, my mind will not change.

528
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:30,230
 In the end, you're saying you'll compare the two.

529
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,540
 Your Excellency.

530
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,290
Please enter.

531
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:48,720
Hwa Ryeong, you were here, too.

532
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:53,390
Please have a seat.

533
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:57,650
 It suits you well.

534
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:04,230
You must be busy preparing for the rebellion.

535
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:07,650
Please do not hesitate and tell me if you need anything.

536
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:11,180
- I will help you in any way I can. 
 - Thank you.

537
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:16,310
Your Highness, are you close with the hostess of Ihwawon?

538
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:18,330
Why are you asking that all of a sudden?

539
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:22,900
I heard the king often summons her to the palace.

540
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,560
She was summoned today as well.

541
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,190
Do you know the reason?

542
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:31,410
The king is keeping an eye on Ihwawon.

543
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:33,570
It could cause you trouble,

544
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:36,900
so please keep your distance from that woman.

545
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:04,680
Your Majesty, I have something I would like to ask you.

546
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,180
Go ahead.

547
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:10,510
What are you planning to do with Yoon Dan Oh?

548
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:17,060
I am planning to do something fun with Yoon Dan Oh tonight.

549
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:35,510
Yes.

550
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:37,530
Sit down.

551
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:54,040
This will be the first... and the last time I ask you.

552
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:59,400
Are you still unwilling to report Lee Seol?

553
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,010
When you say "report,"

554
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:05,840
are you implying this lowly one knows Lee Seol?

555
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,810
You are trying to deceive me until the very end.

556
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:12,080
How could I dare deceive you, Your Majesty?

557
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:16,380
No matter how many times you ask me, my only answer will be...

558
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:21,860
"I do not know who Lee Seol is."

559
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:24,000
That is all.

560
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:35,750
It does not... matter even if you do not know him.

561
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:41,360
Lee Seol knows you, does he not?

562
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:47,350
Enjoy this.

563
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:52,100
When will you ever get to see this kind of banquet again?

564
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,620
All of you shall get disguised and follow me.

565
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:30,610
What is the matter, sir?

566
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:32,600
Just do as I say.

567
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:42,320
We have prepared two carriages.

568
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,550
Let us go.

569
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:48,410
I would like to at least... leave in comfort.

570
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:15,140
 If you attempt to kill Yoon Dan Oh, Lee Seol is sure to appear.

571
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:19,210
 If he does not appear, then kill the wench.

572
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:30,430

573
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:42,890
Who are you?

574
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:45,000
Why are you doing this?

575
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,420
It's the Watchman.

576
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,260
Attack!

577
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,040
Stop right there!

578
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,350
Why would the Watchman want to hurt me?

579
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:51,870
Do not worry.

580
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:56,690
This was my plan to help you escape from the king's grasp.

581
00:57:57,930 --> 00:58:00,180
I see.

582
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,920
I do not wish to lose any more of my people.

583
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:31,400
That is the only reason why... I wish to rise to the throne.

584
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:38,970

585
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:42,360
Dan Oh, without you...

586
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:47,330
I cannot achieve anything.

587
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:53,250
♫  The days I couldn't hope for  ♫

588
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:56,400
Just a moment...

589
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:01,590
Let us stay like this just for a moment.

590
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:07,750
♫  I only grow more distant from you  ♫

591
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:15,520
♫  This love that can't be seen  ♫

592
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:22,590
♫  These feelings I can't show you  ♫

593
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:30,500
♫  The fact that I can only look at you  ♫

594
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:38,100

595
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:45,340
♫  Do I just need to keep waiting?  ♫

596
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:50,360
♫  Can you hear my heart?  ♫

597
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,960
 The well-being of you and your family rests in my hands.

598
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,760
 Dan Oh, you will have to side with His Majesty.

599
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,920
 If this lowly one's life is in danger, you must save me, Your Highness.

600
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,770
 It is problematic if you are this pretty.

601
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:05,470
 What I really desire is you.

602
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:07,410
 It is your safety, Dan Oh.

603
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:09,770
 His Highness will surely become one of the two.

604
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:11,590
 Will you be able to handle this path?

605
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:15,630
 If Dan Oh falls in danger, please go ahead and expose my identity.

606
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:19,670
 Please allow your grandson to greet you.

607
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:23,100
 - Is it you, Seol? 
 - Yes, Royal Grandmother.

608
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:27,350
♫  This unbreakable love  ♫
