1
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,840

2
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,840

3
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,270

4
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,490

5
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,300

6
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,440

7
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:54,670

8
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,520
The deposed crown prince's son Lee Seol escaped!

9
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,890

10
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,900
What are you doing? He must be killed before sunrise!

11
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,650
That is the final goal of this great mission!

12
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,167
 Yes, sir!

13
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,670
Go!

14
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,330

15
00:01:41,717 --> 00:01:44,083
Who are you?

16
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:45,750
Are you asking my name?

17
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,003
Of course!

18
00:01:48,003 --> 00:01:51,603
You are the one who snuck in while we were in mourning.

19
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,100
You are the first person who has asked what my name was.

20
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,053
You are saying you do not want to tell me, right?

21
00:02:01,683 --> 00:02:05,520
By the way, did you get hurt?

22
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,030
Can you come out?

23
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,610
Boksil!

24
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:25,610
Eat slowly.

25
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,230
There is a lot here.

26
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,270
Did you see a boy running this way?

27
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,730
I-I did not!

28
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,730
D-Do not come close!

29
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,330
Boksil is really aggressive.

30
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,800
If you touch him while he is eating, he bites people, too!

31
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,400
I am serious!

32
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,150
I cannot be responsible if you get bitten!

33
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,690
They are gone.

34
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,330
Why did you save me?

35
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,410
You do not even know my name.

36
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,590
Because you were the first.

37
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,920
I am relieved, though.

38
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,410
At least there is one person...

39
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:25,840
who came by to see my father.

40
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:34,670
Did you send someone away, too?

41
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,800
Your father?

42
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,730
Or your mother?

43
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,150
Both of them.

44
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,850
I have no one left!

45
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:34,530
If I see you again next time, I will tell you.

46
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,270
Tell me what?

47
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,750
My name.

48
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:01,490

49
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,640
That will be three nyang.

50
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,250

51
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,180
It is a nice and cool day.

52
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,960
Have you heard this, by chance?

53
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,017
What is it?

54
00:06:13,017 --> 00:06:16,487
There is apparently a haunted inn in Jungchon.

55
00:06:16,487 --> 00:06:17,400
Haunted?

56
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,170
There was a handsome scholar in Youngnam.

57
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,720
But he got lured by a maiden ghost when he stayed at the inn.

58
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,370
He could not even take the state exam and...

59
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,850
D-Did he die?

60
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:32,540
The lonely maiden ghost chose him to accompany her to the netherworld!

61
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,600
Seriously!

62
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,550
Welcome!

63
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,500
It is three nyang.

64
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,400
Where are you going?

65
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,090
Will you be on your way to the netherworld while trying to take the state exam?

66
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:58,096
This is a path of Namtaeryeong that is known to have tigers.

67
00:06:58,096 --> 00:07:02,776
You can never... walk on it alone.

68
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,910
That will be five nyang.

69
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,630
Be careful.

70
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,050
It's the end of the world.

71
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,960
They charge five nyang just for walking up the hill together.

72
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,260
Are you headed to Jungchon?

73
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,290
Both of us should be careful.

74
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:39,630
The maiden ghosts target handsome men, apparently.

75
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,440
- Gosh! 
 - What was that?

76
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,810
I am an officer of Gwacheon!

77
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,750
I will shoot you unless you make way!

78
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,370
T-That is him! The tiger of Mt. Gwanak!

79
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,470
If you give us everything you have, I will at least make way for you!

80
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,130
We will make way!

81
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,240
Here we go!

82
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,630
Looks like they'll take everything we have.

83
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,320
Be careful!

84
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,250
- Catch him! 
 - What are you doing?

85
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,360
- Catch the bastard! 
 - Catch him!

86
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,450
Come here!

87
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,320
Hey!

88
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,580
Boss!

89
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,210
Hey you, get lost.

90
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,420
Dong Shik! Sam Shik!

91
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,140
- Hurry! 
 - Let's go!

92
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,430
Hurry up! Be careful!

93
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,160
Hey!

94
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,820
Bastards!

95
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:49,250
If only I did not get caught in the trap...

96
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,370
Hand them out.

97
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,150
Wait...

98
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,130
Thank you.

99
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,770
Thank you!

100
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,710
Come this way, everyone!

101
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,630
 Look here! Welcome!

102
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,690
 Gosh!

103
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,720
With Ihwawon, you will pass the state exam!

104
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,170
Let us go to Ihwawon together!

105
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,500
Scholars!

106
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,840
Ihwawon guarantees that you will pass.

107
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,810
Please come to Ihwawon, sirs!

108
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,350
- Ihwawon? 
 - Yes!

109
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,320

110
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,230
They produced successful exam takers for five generations, apparently.

111
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:41,120
She is lying again!

112
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:47,640
Have you not heard about... the haunted house on the outskirts of Jungchon?

113
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,100
- You mean, this house? 
 - Yes!

114
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,670
Have you not heard of a fair competition?

115
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,360
- Fair! 
 - "Everyone tries to survive."

116
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,660
Fair, my foot!

117
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,680
You are mistaken.

118
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,730
Ihwawon guarantees everyone to pass,

119
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,210
allows only the selected few, and provides food and lodging!

120
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,890
We customize everything for you—

121
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:15,130
You will definitely suck all my energy out!

122
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,620
- Damn you! 
 - Hey!

123
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,230
Maiden.

124
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,810
Why are you suffering so much?

125
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:36,070
All your troubles will be gone if you marry me.

126
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,520
Gosh! Sounds like a dog barking.

127
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,400
How much do you want?

128
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,580
Tell me.

129
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:48,000
How much will it take... for you to accept me as your husband?

130
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,680
Maiden!

131
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,590
Maiden!

132
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,280
Sir!

133
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,510
It is midday already.

134
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,940
Will you not go home?

135
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,710
You look pretty in the morning, too, Ye Hyang.

136
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,600
You look like a peony.

137
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,380
Gosh, do not be silly...

138
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,650
See you again, then.

139
00:12:46,317 --> 00:12:48,010
You should pay for the backlog of drinks you owe.

140
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,510
Goodness! What should I do?

141
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,420
I rushed out the door today.

142
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,480
Please put it on my tab.

143
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,780
You will not leave in one piece unless you pay me.

144
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,310
You are so uptight.

145
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:16,050
Hey! Look!

146
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,840
Look!

147
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,650
What are you, an oak tree? 
  (An idiom that says no tree could stand after ten strikes, referring to persistence)

148
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,613
How many strikes will it take for you?

149
00:13:31,613 --> 00:13:32,930
Do not strike.

150
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,430
Even if you strike a thousand or ten thousand times, I will not fall for you.

151
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,310
I did not want to damage you before marriage.

152
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,650
I could smell the rotten smell from a mile away!

153
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,300
Stop with the rotten pick-up lines.

154
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:52,630
You refuse to listen. You are giving me no choice.

155
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,260
Hold my hand when I am offering it to you.

156
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,330
There is no man better than me.

157
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,540
Are you out of your mind?

158
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,430
I do get that often.

159
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,830
But I am not there yet.

160
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,960
You bastard!

161
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,860
Look at you!

162
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,280
Did you dodge my punch?

163
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,290
You bastard!

164
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,370
Hey!

165
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,760
Consider yourself dead today!

166
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,120
- Hey! 
 - Oh no!

167
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,150
 Sir Ong!

168
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:54,340
I almost killed him because I thought he was a beast.

169
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:03,480
Do they not look exactly like the three little pigs?

170
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,310
Fine, let us see the end today!

171
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,450
I will show you how scary pigs can be.

172
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,720
Sounds good!

173
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,700
Let us put an end to this today!

174
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,440
Go!

175
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,000
Hey! Catch them!

176
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,770
- Hey! 
 - Catch them!

177
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,980
Hey!

178
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,680
 - Come here! 
 - Get them!

179
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,470
 - You bastards! 
 - Catch them!

180
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,380
 Catch them!

181
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,340
Hey! Hey!

182
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,600
Hey! Move!

183
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,480
Do not look at me like that.

184
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,770
It is okay. All of this was my plan to save you.

185
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:00,000
Including the part where I saved you?

186
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,710
I expected that as well.

187
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,600
Should you not see a physician?

188
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,180
It was just a soft punch.

189
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,000
It will only ache for a moment.

190
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,150
Did you hurt yourself?

191
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,220
I am okay.

192
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,800
Goodness! Looks like you received a report.

193
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,220
You should have come sooner.

194
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,030
They already ran that way.

195
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,850
You had a drink at a brothel today, did you not?

196
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,690
Yes, I did.

197
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,880
It was not him!

198
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,340
He is the one who saved me—

199
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,030
We got a report for drinking without paying.

200
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,580
It is okay! It must be a misunderstanding!

201
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,430
Just be on your way, Maiden!

202
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,620
Go home!

203
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,200
Come sit here.

204
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,040
Jackpot.

205
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,780
He could have held me.

206
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,560
Are you taking the military service exam?

207
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,440
What are you, a leech?

208
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,820
Did you find a room to stay in?

209
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,160
Ma'am, I will have soup and rice.

210
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,070
Okay.

211
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,200
- If you have not found it yet... 
 - I will have rice wine, too.

212
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,760
Yes.

213
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:11,460
Come to my house... tonight.

214
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,370
You have no shame.

215
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:17,390
Are all women of Hanyang like this? 
  (Old name for Seoul)

216
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,183
You look like an important person.

217
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:25,303
It might be uncomfortable to stay in a shabby tavern like this.

218
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,660
Look! Where are you going?

219
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,440
- Are you going to the outhouse or something? 
  - Welcome.

220
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,630
"When a crow cries on the pine tree of the Royal Ancestral Shrine

221
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,360
and the weather is rainy and cloudy,

222
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,690
a new dynasty begins."

223
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,500
There you are!

224
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,090
Yes, Brother Yoo Ha. 
  (Older version of "oppa," meaning older brother or older male friend)

225
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:41,160
Did we not make eye contact earlier?

226
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,430
Brother, did you really not read my eyes?

227
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,640
What were you trying to say with your eyes, Dan Oh?

228
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,400
"Do not bother an eating dog and a reading scholar."

229
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,960
I was determined not to bother you.

230
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,100
What? A dog?

231
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,340
Please only focus on the reading scholar part.

232
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,590
By the way, what were you reading?

233
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,750
It was just "The Analects."

234
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,720
Where did you go this morning?

235
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,780
It felt stuffy just staying inside.

236
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,830
So I went out for a walk.

237
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,930
A walk?

238
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:17,250
Dan Oh, I do not want you to overwork yourself—

239
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,200
- Brother. 
 - Yes?

240
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,920
I am... really curious what that book way at the bottom is.

241
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,750
But I am not asking.

242
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,950
So we should try to keep each other's secret.

243
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,490
All right.

244
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,730
I understand everything.

245
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:38,970
You are now an adult, too.

246
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,110
Hold on.

247
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:44,640
What do you understand, exactly?

248
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,540
Men's... curiosity?

249
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,400
Well...

250
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,880
Dan Oh, let me clear the misunderstanding first!

251
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,740
Dan Oh!

252
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:09,940
Ma'am, have you seen my bag that was over there?

253
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,450
The thing is...

254
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:14,790

255
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,950
 There is an inn called Ihwawon.

256
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:20,840
 She took your bag, so you come and stay with them.

257
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,770
Is anyone here?

258
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,830
Anyone here?

259
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,910
It was you.

260
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:57,110
The thief.

261
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:27,030
Are women this pushy in Hanyang?

262
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,750
Pardon?

263
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,660
We will not become a pair just because you ran with my stuff.

264
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,850
It only happens in fairy tales.

265
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:36,460
"Pair?" What pair?

266
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,010
Pair of shoes? Pair of socks?

267
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,890
Are you kidding?

268
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,960
Give me my stuff now.

269
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,040
So...

270
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:55,200
You are the fairy... and I am the lumberjack? 
  (Referring to a Korean folklore)

271
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,420
Do I need to call the owner to get my stuff back?

272
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,830
Well...

273
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:04,550
Looks like there was a misunderstanding.

274
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,480
- I am... 
 - My Lady!

275
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,030
Gosh! My Lady!

276
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,543
I told you I would do it. Did you already go up there?

277
00:23:12,543 --> 00:23:16,443
I already fixed it. It won't leak anymore.

278
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,960
Thank you, Buddha!

279
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,690
Gosh! We finally have a guest!

280
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,410
Gosh! Let's go, let's go...

281
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,130
- Come here. 
 - What are you doing...

282
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,280
No?

283
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:57,050
"Ihwawon, an inn for foot travelers, visiting to take the state exam.

284
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:02,840
100% success rate. Limited guests. Lodging and food provided."

285
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,380
I was just looking for a customer.

286
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,790
But I ended up becoming a lumberjack myself.

287
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:10,990
I still will not dismiss the fact that you ran off with my stuff.

288
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,400
I did not run. I was just keeping it safe for you.

289
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,290
If it were not for me, it would have disappeared already.

290
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,730
How shameless.

291
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:21,030
Consider yourself lucky for not being taken to the government office.

292
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,530
- It is one nyang per night. 
 - What?

293
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:29,200
It is already late. You should stay with us.

294
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,330
How could I sleep among the bandits?

295
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,950
There would be no vacancy anywhere right now, anyway.

296
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:38,290
The curfew bell will ring soon, too.

297
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:42,660

298
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,920
Just come on in.

299
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,240
It is one nyang and five jeon... per night.

300
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,310
But you just said one nyang!

301
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,250
The curfew bell rang!

302
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:08,860
Your feet are tied and this is the only place you can stay.

303
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,060
You have very good business skills.

304
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,610
I get that often.

305
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,950
Let us go in now.

306
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,150
Gosh, Maiden!

307
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,630
I get to see you again.

308
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,650
You are...

309
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,220
I got bruised all over while helping her.

310
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,610
I think I need to rest because I got injured greatly.

311
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:43,010
I was worried about you, too.

312
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:46,250
By the way, we cannot go to a physician due to the curfew...

313
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,750
Gosh, I do not need a physician.

314
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:54,510
If I get a good rest, I will completely recover.

315
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:59,700
So I was wondering... please let me stay here a few days.

316
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:05,690
I have no money now, but I will make sure to pay for the room later.

317
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:13,120
Good sir. Ihwawon with a long extensive history has an old tradition.

318
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,950
What is it?

319
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:17,010
Prohibit...

320
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:19,500
credit...

321
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,290
transactions.

322
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,740
Did something happen earlier today?

323
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,440
It was not a big deal, but...

324
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,310
It was a big deal!

325
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,110
You are hurting my feelings if you say so.

326
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,900
I am disappointed as well.

327
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,740
You are asking me to charge you on credit because you are wounded.

328
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,420
Look at this.

329
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,560
I think my cheek is still very swollen.

330
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:43,020
Just one night, then.

331
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,590
Pay daily in installments if you do not have any money.

332
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:50,980
Also, I have a request.

333
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:55,670
Feel free to look around anywhere, but please do not go to the annex.

334
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,540
That is all you need to remember.

335
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,700
Are you hiding something in the annex or something?

336
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,910
Red ginseng? Wild ginseng? What else?

337
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,730
Sir

338
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:07,190
- would you like to sleep outside? 
 - I got it.

339
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:10,990
I will not look for wild ginseng. Only you should have it.

340
00:27:11,917 --> 00:27:14,830
I want you to promise me, too.

341
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,900
You have my word.

342
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,200
Your shoulders are as wide as the Royal Palace.

343
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,610
Is it because you are a warrior?

344
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,840
I am Yoon Yook Ho, who is staying next door to you.

345
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,070
I thought I could teach you a lot as a former scholar.

346
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,880
As you know, I am a warrior.

347
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,820
Also, I am only planning to stay one night.

348
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,640
Breakfast is from 7:00 to 9:00, lunch is from 11:00 to 1:00, dinner is from 5:00 to 7:0, and the curfew is from 9:00 to 11:00.

349
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,810
Study freely but be quiet most of the time.

350
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,840
The main building is okay, but the annex is off-limits. Here is the key point.

351
00:28:16,843 --> 00:28:19,623
Three nyangs for five nights. Pay in advance for three months worth.

352
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,930
Is that part of the state exam?

353
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:25,480
You are good at memorizing.

354
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:30,350
I can win first place when it comes to memorizing.

355
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:33,040
But my stomach gets upset whenever it is state exam season—

356
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,150
Hold on.

357
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:37,040
If it is three nyangs for five nights...

358
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,390
It is considered very affordable in Jungchon.

359
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:44,390
 It is one nyang and five jeons... per night.

360
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,500
She made me pay for 15 days in advance?

361
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,920
- What a crook she is! 
 - What?

362
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,100
Who is a crook? Huh?

363
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,690
What?

364
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,610
Do you like the room?

365
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,820
I am sure you like it.

366
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,630
It looks way bigger than mine.

367
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:09,280
Goodness, I am glad you came!

368
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,130
I think I could teach you something, too.

369
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:14,500
You are him.

370
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,350
"Him"?

371
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:19,730
The living legend who is studying for the state exam for over a decade.

372
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:22,620
Over a decade? Legend?

373
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:26,130
I thought it was a rumor, but you actually exist.

374
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,410
I am truly surprised.

375
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,490
Enjoy, everyone.

376
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,440
Thank you.

377
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,880
Right.

378
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,450
I heard that this is a famous inn that had a huge number of successful exam takers.

379
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,980
Is that true?

380
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,840
I saw the huge sign at the front door.

381
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,960
- There was a successful exam taker. 
 - Who was it?

382
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,710
- My father. 
 - Wow, of course...

383
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:01,590
Your father was as impressive as you, Maiden.

384
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,160
Who else is there?

385
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,410
There are not that many side dishes.

386
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,700
There is plenty of soup, so if you want more—

387
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,390
I didn't mean the soup.

388
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:17,780
Who else is there? Successful exam takers.

389
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,420
Why do you keep talking to me formally?

390
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,430
Feel free to speak informally.

391
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,790
I think you are the same age as Brother Yoo Ha.

392
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,050
I will feel free to call you "brother" as well.

393
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,430
Brother?

394
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,260
Well...

395
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,100
I don't mean anything by it.

396
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,880
Let us be comfortable since we are staying under one roof—

397
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,990
It is suspicious how you pretend to be friendly.

398
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:45,000
I will bring more soup.

399
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,600
All right.

400
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,620
Do you want to hear a secret?

401
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:57,920
There is no one else.

402
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,550
He is the only one.

403
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:03,670
You all have been fooled by Dan Oh.

404
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:13,610
Of course, when her father was alive,

405
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:16,330
Confucious scholars frequented from time to time.

406
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:18,950
I was one of them, too.

407
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,510
That was before this became an inn.

408
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:25,550
How did she start running an inn?

409
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:30,100
It is kind of unusual... for a daughter of a noble family to become an innkeeper.

410
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,890
She had no choice in order to survive.

411
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:37,000
This house is the only thing her father left.

412
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:08,650
Sir, are you in there?

413
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,460
Why does he not carry a real sword?

414
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:41,150
Can you train with a wooden sword like this?

415
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,030
Well...

416
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,650
You should have told me.

417
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:20,650
Pardon?

418
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:24,250
If you wanted my sword that badly.

419
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,650
What if I do?

420
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:27,950
Will you give it to me?

421
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:30,050
I will hide it!

422
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,150
Do not worry.

423
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,550
I did not come here because I wanted it.

424
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:39,050
- So you are not a thief? 
 - No!

425
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,850
- Do I look like a thief to you— 
 - Are you a crook, then?

426
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,450
What?

427
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:47,450
I heard how much the rooms cost.

428
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,450
How did 15 nights become just one night?

429
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:52,850
If so, why do you not stay for 15 nights?

430
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:55,850
You will find out... the true value of Ihwawon, then.

431
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,450
What?

432
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:02,550
Let us go out. I hate having intruders in my territory.

433
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:06,450
Well, as for that, I do have a lot of things to do here, too.

434
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:08,150
Including cleaning.

435
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,250
You do not look very thorough.

436
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:13,350
I do not know if you would be good at cleaning.

437
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,850
I guess you did not know.

438
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,650
That is my specialty.

439
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:22,950
Would you like me to... be thorough?

440
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:25,550
- What? 
 - I meant cleaning.

441
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:28,250
Did you think I would break your arm or something?

442
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,850
You really are argumentative.

443
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,350
I usually win.

444
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,350
You are happy, too. Right?

445
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,850
We hit the jackpot last night.

446
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:48,450
Jackpot?

447
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:50,650
I mean Scholar Kang San!

448
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:53,450
He looks so elegant.

449
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:55,650
I am sure he will not miss a single payment.

450
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:59,050
Elegant? He is just normal looking.

451
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:01,050
I would say he is exceptional!

452
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:04,350
He would be more than enough talk of the town among ladies.

453
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,450
You lost a sense of taste.

454
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:09,250
Now you lost your taste in men, too.

455
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:15,250
We need to send two packages of eggs to Buyounggak.

456
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:18,050
They have more customers these days.

457
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:24,350
I guess other inns are filled with customers.

458
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,080
Slowly! Be careful!

459
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:38,490
Be careful, Your Highness!

460
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:55,050
You do not seem to be in labor yet.

461
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:58,250
Have you not heard what the monk said?

462
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:01,750
After this month, I will not be able to give birth to a son.

463
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:06,850
But still, we cannot force the fetus out.

464
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:09,850
I will, for sure...

465
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:12,350
For sure, give birth to a son.

466
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:17,250
I cannot disappoint His Majesty, who is looking forward to having a prince.

467
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:19,150
Please do not worry.

468
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:22,750
The fetus will surely be a son.

469
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:33,050
We must make preparations.

470
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:35,250
Just in case of the unlikely.

471
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,890
Y-Yes.

472
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:06,650
You will soon have a child.

473
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:09,050
Will I have a son to carry on my family name?

474
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:10,850
No, you will not.

475
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:15,490
Is there any way?

476
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:33,850
In your fate, you do not have a son.

477
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,450
How dare you!

478
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,250
- How impertinent. 
 - It is fine.

479
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,350
Let us go.

480
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:43,150
Moreover, there is an important matter.

481
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:47,950
Your own life...

482
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:53,250
it is at great peril right now.

483
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,850
What did you say?

484
00:37:56,850 --> 00:38:03,050
Do not look... for the person you are looking for right now.

485
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:08,150
The one making you tremble in your dream.

486
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:14,150
That person will... devour you entirely.

487
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:24,050
The melodies from your geomungo is so sorrowful, 
  (Traditional Korean musical instrument)

488
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:26,850
I was almost brought to tears.

489
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:33,650
Your Majesty... my ears are pampered by such heavenly sounds.

490
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,750
Shall I pamper you elsewhere, too?

491
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:48,650
 Your Majesty, Left State Minister Shin Won Ho is here.

492
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:52,450
I was finally about to enjoy myself.

493
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:00,850

494
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:08,150
Is Lee Seol, the deposed crown prince's son, yet to be found?

495
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:12,650
I am deeply sorry, Your Majesty.

496
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:16,050
Left State Minister, you have aged quite a lot, too.

497
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:18,650
Not being able to find such a young brat for this long.

498
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:21,050
It is your lacking humble servant's sin.

499
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:24,150
Please reprimand me strictly.

500
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:32,550
Three months ago, a young man visited the grave of the deposed crown prince, Lee Pyeong,

501
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:35,450
on the anniversary of his death.

502
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:39,250
He was thought to be Lee Seol, so he was chased promptly.

503
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:43,050
But we lost him in Jungchon.

504
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:45,550
Lee Seol appeared in Hanyang?

505
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,250
Yes.

506
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:51,050
Amidst the crowd of scholars who gathered from all over the country

507
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:56,350
for the upcoming state exam, he seems to have hidden himself.

508
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,960

509
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:33,250
How are things with Lee Seol?

510
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:39,050

Even the inns, taverns, and brothels of Jungchon are being searched.

511
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:42,450
You must not make a mistake the second time.

512
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:46,650
If you lose Lee Seol again like that time...

513
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:49,450
Such a thing will not happen.

514
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:51,450
I will take your word for it.

515
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:54,950
You must have also realized something from what happened that day.

516
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:04,050

(Regional capital of Joseon, now center of Seoul. Hanyang &gt; Hanseong &gt; Seoul)

517
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:07,750
 Sir! It is Jong Su.

518
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,450
Come in.

519
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,650
He is here.

520
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,650
To what do I owe this pleasure, Head Eunuch?

521
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:35,650
What do you mean Head Eunuch?

522
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:38,550
It has been over a decade since I left the Royal Palace.

523
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:41,250
You can speak comfortably, please.

524
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:13,650
You are here, Chief Administrator.

525
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:16,850
The list of names?

526
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:19,450
I have prepared it.

527
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:36,850
I have recorded the personal information of scholars who stayed at Buyounggak.

528
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:54,150
What about that man?

529
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:00,050
He is not the one.

530
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:02,550
His eyes and lips...

531
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:04,850
None of them match.

532
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:15,850
Yes.

533
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:18,750
There must be a reason when they tell you not to go.

534
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,550
Mister, there was just now...

535
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:46,650
I told you not to even go near the annex!

536
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:48,650
Hurry up and go back down!

537
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:03,650
My goodness, Scholar!

538
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:05,050
If you are curious about your future,

539
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:08,850
you need to visit the shaman, not this bookstore.

540
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,450
Is it really not here?

541
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:12,950
- No. 
 - It is not here.

542
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:18,350
If it was easy to find, how would it be called Chamwiseo?

543
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:22,750

544
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:25,250
- Do you know about that book? 
 - Of course.

545
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:27,350
Which one are you curious about?

546
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:32,750
Joseon's future or... your future?

547
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:39,050
How can Joseon's citizen be free from Joseon's future?

548
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:46,150
Compared to your ambition, your sword looks a little shabby.

549
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:51,550
- What did you say? 
 - You think you can pass the military exam with that sword?

550
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:54,850
I am finding a way to win without slashing.

551
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:58,650
Winning without slashing?

552
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:01,550
Is there such a way?

553
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:04,750
Or rather is there such a world?

554
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:09,250
There is not.

555
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:14,950
Therefore... I want to try living in one.

556
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:29,050
By the way, how did you learn about Chamwiseo?

557
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:34,550
I heard people suffering from tyranny rely on such auspicious books.

558
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:40,450
If you really want to read it, I can get it for you.

559
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:42,550
Will you do that for me?

560
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:46,450
Let go of me!

561
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:48,050
My baby is in there!

562
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:50,150
What baby is in a brothel?

563
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:52,050
They said they would give me a few days.

564
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:55,250
Let me at least breastfeed the baby.

565
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:57,750
I know nothing of this, so get lost!

566
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,450
Let us go.

567
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:08,150
Are you okay?

568
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:13,650
How are you here?

569
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:16,250
- Young Master... 
 - You know her?

570
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:19,450
She is a servant of my head family, whom I freed from being of low class.

571
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:21,450
Anyhow, what is the matter?

572
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:24,650
My husband owes a gambling debt at Buyounggak and

573
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:28,450
they took my baby, who is only an infant.

574
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:31,450
What are they going to use a baby for at an inn?

575
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:37,050
Young Master, please help me.

576
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:52,250
My hands are strikingly great today.

577
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:54,350
I apologize to you all.

578
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:59,850
It will be used to pay for this month's rent.

579
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:02,150
- I did not think of you as such— 
 - Why?

580
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:04,050
Will you be leaving?

581
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:05,850
No, what I mean is...

582
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:08,650
You are even prettier at this angle.

583
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:22,850
It is.

584
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:24,450
It is them.

585
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:26,850
What brings you, people, to a place like this?

586
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:29,350
- In fact, we are— 
 - Why else would we come to Buyounggak?

587
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:31,450
We came to gamble.

588
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:44,150
I was wondering where all the light went... and they were gathered there.

589
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:45,350
How bright.

590
00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:47,850
It is absolutely bright.

591
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:50,050
I like the one on the right.

592
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:54,050
I want to be struck by his sharp nose-line.

593
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:56,950
I like the middle one.

594
00:48:56,950 --> 00:49:00,850
I want to fall into his jewel-like eyes.

595
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:14,650
Pleased to meet you.

596
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:17,350
My name is Mae Wol.

597
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:20,850
We want to play by ourselves.

598
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:22,850
I apologize.

599
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,980
It would be more fun to play altogether, though.

600
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:40,950
We do not have time for this.

601
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:43,050
We need to find the baby first.

602
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:45,050
Do you want the whole town to know?

603
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:47,050
Stay put.

604
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:55,450
Kang San, it is your turn.

605
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:57,650
Your speech is becoming more and more informal.

606
00:49:57,650 --> 00:50:00,950
Are we not all friends at a gambling table?

607
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,230
I will take off first and look around.

608
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,350
You stay here for now.

609
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:13,650
I am going with you.

610
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:15,850
Stop right there.

611
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:20,550
What exactly... are you two scheming?

612
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,350
What do you mean?

613
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,350
- There is no such thing. 
 - Are you kidding me...

614
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:30,450
If you do not tell us honestly, neither of you is leaving this table.

615
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:47,250
Somewhere in this place... there is a baby who was taken in place of debt.

616
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:56,650
Are you in there?

617
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:02,250
You just need to give care for a few more days.

618
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:05,850
Keep up the good work, then.

619
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,650
Wait.

620
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:31,450
Who are you, and why are you causing such a commotion?

621
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:36,450
From this day forth, your signboard must be changed!

622
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:45,250
What are you doing here?

623
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:47,450
The thing is...

624
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:51,750
I came as a customer and... lost my way.

625
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:02,550
This area is forbidden to customers.

626
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:06,350
Please take your leave.

627
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,450
I apologize.

628
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:40,620
 The baby is gone!

629
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,260
Gosh, that baby is an expensive one!

630
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:59,450
You are dead if we lose the baby.

631
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:22,670
Who goes there?

632
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,760
What the heck is this?

633
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,860
Who is this fool?

634
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:12,790
Hand over the baby unless you want to die.

635
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:03,040
Are you okay? Hurt anywhere?

636
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:07,020
Let us go, then.

637
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:19,510
Gosh, I should not have asked what they came to do.

638
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:22,180
All this trouble just because I asked.

639
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:26,490
Is Dan Oh not out yet?

640
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:29,410
No. San is still inside, too.

641
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:31,170
Just wait a little longer.

642
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:33,730
What if you cross paths?

643
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:40,880
- Brother. 
 - You found the baby. Let us go.

644
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,670
Let us go.

645
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:18,140
Thank you so much.

646
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:20,490
How could I ever repay you for this?

647
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:24,280
Hide for a while. We took him secretly.

648
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,600
Yes, Young Master.

649
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:30,310
Your baby is lovely.

650
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:32,550
He is sure to make many ladies cry when he grows up.

651
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:34,370
Just like me.

652
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:45,980
♫  How beautiful, I hug you as I close my eyes  ♫

653
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:49,130
Wow, I cannot believe what we did.

654
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:51,050
We even saved a baby.

655
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:55,000
Your help was too trivial to be included in the "we."

656
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,460
I mean, was I not the one who paid for the horses?

657
00:58:58,460 --> 00:58:59,780
You only held onto the reigns.

658
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:02,510
I get Kang San, but you, too?

659
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:06,270
You poke at a person's weakness with a peaceful face, huh?

660
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:10,910
It was trivial but a decisive help.

661
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:14,520
By the way, Kang San, are you okay?

662
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,910
Were you struck anywhere?

663
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:18,260
I do not go around getting beaten.

664
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:20,840
Unlike someone.

665
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,820
He is right.

666
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:24,690
He would be the one beating someone else.

667
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:27,750
You have a talent for misconstruing someone's words.

668
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:30,730
♫  Your eyes looking at me with a ray of light  ♫

669
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:32,210
♫  They melted me  ♫

670
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:33,980
Try rotating it around like this.

671
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:38,010
- We never know. 
 - Gosh, I said I am okay!

672
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:43,150
Just make sure you pay for the room on time.

673
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:48,750
Does the innkeeper have to chase you to gambling houses full of male strangers?

674
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:52,010
The male strangers were the problem, huh?

675
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:53,580
Since when was it?

676
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:55,990
What are you hinting at now?

677
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:57,630
Dan Oh.

678
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:59,740
Since when did you like her?

679
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:02,980
♫  How beautiful, I hug you as I close my eyes  ♫

680
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:06,770
♫  You always bloom  ♫

681
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,390
♫  All the roads I will have to walk endlessly  ♫

682
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:10,690
Wait—

683
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,670
Why are you doing this to me?

684
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:14,550
Gosh, seriously.

685
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:16,340
N-No, not me, not me...

686
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:17,580
Easy now. Come along.

687
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:19,660
Hey, Yoo Ha!

688
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:35,200
No suspicious figures were found in this place, either.

689
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,140
Let us go.

690
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:50,390
What is the meaning of this?

691
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:51,840
Young Lady!

692
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,740
Goodnes, you're finally here.

693
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:55,370
Did I not ask about the meaning of this?

694
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:59,090
Why else would creditors come beside to get the payment for the debt?

695
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:00,500
What did you say?

696
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:03,340
Do nonexistent debts fall out of the sky or something?

697
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:05,610
It fell from the netherworld.

698
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:08,760
Your father owed us a lot of debt before he passed away.

699
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,090
One hundred silver ingots.

700
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:16,370
Goodness, how unfortunate.

701
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:20,730
You will have to sell your inn to pay back such a large sum.

702
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:26,320
This is enough for this place. Was it this way to the annex?

703
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,030
Please do not go!

704
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:30,480
I clearly warned you.

705
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,460
I cannot take responsibility even if the vengeful ghost possesses you!

706
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:35,420
I-It is a vengeful ghost like no other.

707
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:38,830
She is known to devour only the men's souls wickedly.

708
01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:42,580
T-That means the inn where the maiden ghost comes out is...

709
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:44,380
Ghost, my foot.

710
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:46,870
Do you trust such bullshit?

711
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,520
You cannot go to the annex.

712
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,570
I shall show you myself.

713
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:53,170
Whether I can or not.

714
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:55,490
You better move aside.

715
01:01:55,490 --> 01:01:59,070
How dare you... lay hands on her?

716
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:02,400
She said you cannot. Get lost.

717
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,080
You should cut it out now.

718
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,690
So you do not regret it later.

719
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:08,630
Who are you, folks?

720
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:11,200
I have not seen you around.

721
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:22,740
Will you be able to recognize his face?

722
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:25,800
I have seen him since he was an infant.

723
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:30,460
How can I forget that face?

724
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:32,410
Leave for now.

725
01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:34,690
How could you be doing this at night?

726
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:39,560
Your pretty faces will get a scar or two if you recklessly butt in someone else's business.

727
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:44,420
Well, let us see you... go ahead and do it.

728
01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:01,380
Ihwawon is the last place.

729
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:03,470
In that case...

730
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:07,720
the deposed crown prince's son, Lee Seol, might be there.

731
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:12,090
Have you seen Lee Seol by any chance?

732
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:15,260
Just once.

733
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:27,860
 Because of that day... I live on today.

734
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:56,000
Credits

735
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,760

736
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,060
 This is the promissory note your father wrote himself.

737
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:20,380
 I will protect Ihwawon, no matter what anyone says.

738
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:21,880
 It will be taken from you in the end.

739
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:25,270
 Unless you can give something bigger than Ihwawon.

740
01:04:25,270 --> 01:04:27,440
 Do not cry. I said do not cry.

741
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,180
 Sister, please take me.

742
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:32,510
 Brother, you are such a kind person.

743
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:35,220
 Lee Seol is warning us right now.

744
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:37,960
 Warning us that he will come to take this seat soon.

745
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:40,490
 I do not keep useless people by my side.

746
01:04:40,490 --> 01:04:43,153
 I will let you know if there is someone even the slightest bit suspicious.

747
01:04:43,153 --> 01:04:46,840
 A eunuch is looking for the traitor?
