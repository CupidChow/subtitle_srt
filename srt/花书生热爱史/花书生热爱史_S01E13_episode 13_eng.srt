1
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,850

2
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,950

3
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,420

4
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:37,310

5
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:41,160

6
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,310

7
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,440
Are you the Mok In Hoe's leader... Lee Gyeom?

8
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:03,910
Tell me... why you did something like this.

9
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:09,980
I wanted to end the king's tyranny as soon as possible.

10
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,780
By even... borrowing your name, Lee Seol.

11
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:21,630
Do you believe that you could defeat the king on your own?

12
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,360
Is that why you are trying to take the throne by leading Mok In Hoe with a lie?

13
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:33,780
No matter how much the world has changed, a lie will never become the truth.

14
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,190
You will have to turn everything back to its original state.

15
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,820
I will not wait long.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,020

17
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,420
Are you okay?

18
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,000
Why did Scholar Kang San point his sword at you...

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,760
Let us go down and talk.

20
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,020

He chose to do that to stop the king's tyranny?

21
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,140
He stole your name.

22
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,760
No matter what the reason was, it is stealing.

23
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,310
Since there is only one throne,

24
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,140
he will end up trying to take your life as well.

25
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:43,440
Father was also killed by his brother.

26
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,100
I never want to repeat that tragedy.

27
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,870
He and I share the same goal.

28
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,530
It is to remove the king and correct the order of the country.

29
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,550
Your Highness.

30
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,010
I will give Lee Gyeom a chance.

31
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,250
You might end up getting attacked.

32
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,450
The enemy's enemy could become my biggest ally.

33
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,960
Do you trust Lee Gyeom?

34
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,980
I want to try trusting him at least once.

35
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:25,190
If he is the man I know, he will make the right decision.

36
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,810
It is your turn to sign, Your Highness.

37
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,420
 Is that why you are trying to take the throne by leading Mok In Hoe with a lie?

38
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,900

39
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:47,360
Scholar Kang San is Lee Seol, the deposed crown prince's son?

40
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,190
So the reason he pointed his sword at you was—

41
00:04:55,190 --> 00:05:00,060
He told me to turn everything back to its original state.

42
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,590
It is too late to go back.

43
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,250
You know that, too!

44
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:13,080
You already got the scholars' signatures and you even met with the Queen Dowager!

45
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,940
I am aware.

46
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:25,170
No matter what anyone says, you are Lee Seol now.

47
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,230

48
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,200
Yoo Ha ended up finding out who I am?

49
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,690
Yes.

50
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:46,660
I asked him to keep it a secret, but will it be okay?

51
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,780
Do not worry.

52
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,880
Yoo Ha will not speak.

53
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,400
I believe so, too, but...

54
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,760
You never get to be at peace, do you?

55
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,500
I always... cause you nothing but trouble.

56
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,720
Do not say such a thing.

57
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,270
I am just relieved that we are together like this.

58
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:33,790
By the way, why are you not preparing for the state exam?

59
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,660
I heard you only failed the first round.

60
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,090
That is what Dan Oh said.

61
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,080
My dream does not depend on the state exam.

62
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,220
You are a promising scholar, but you are not taking the state exam.

63
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,910
What will you do from now on, then?

64
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,580
I want to forget about the past.

65
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,630
I care more about our tomorrow together.

66
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,410
Why do you always avoid situations by making a joke?

67
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,200
I want to know more about you.

68
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,210
I feel the same way.

69
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,960
How about you? What do you want to do in the future?

70
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:27,410
I just want to... live as I am.

71
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:36,280
Not as a lady ghost pretending to be dead, but as alive Yoon Hong Joo.

72
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,530
Using my own name.

73
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,110
I am sure that day will come.

74
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,300
Maiden Hong Joo.

75
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,940
Are you trying to hide now?

76
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,570
I already saw everything.

77
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,980
The rice cake was tasty.

78
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,470
It is nice to share!

79
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,580
Do not look at me like that.

80
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,860
I thought we agreed to feign ignorance.

81
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,490
If it is just... fleeting feelings,

82
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,370
please do not tempt her too much.

83
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:08,290
I am worried... that she might get hurt again.

84
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,720
What if they are not fleeting?

85
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,150
I never felt this way, either. So I cannot explain it, but—

86
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:22,410
Are you... treating Hong Joo sincerely?

87
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,800
Dan Oh,

88
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:29,330
Maiden Hong Joo is as strong as you.

89
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,210
If you keep worrying about her as if she is a child,

90
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,530
how can she go out into the world?

91
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,990
That is true, but...

92
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,370
- Sister is— 
 - I know.

93
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:48,750
But she cannot live as a lady ghost forever.

94
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,600
What is this about now?

95
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,300
Did you know that Father had a son he hid from us?

96
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,200
Did you find Lee Gyeom by chance?

97
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,500
As I thought, you already knew.

98
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,800
Please tell me everything you know.

99
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,300
I heard Lee Gyeom has followers.

100
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,600
Are you referring to Mok In Hoe?

101
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,000
Yes.

102
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
If so, do you know who is helping him?

103
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,900
It is Queen Dowager.

104
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:49,000
She thinks he is the eldest son of the crown prince.

105
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
He did not just lie to Mok In Hoe.

106
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,600
Please be careful.

107
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,500
You might end up getting eaten by the fake one.

108
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,970
The truth does not matter.

109
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,200
If the majority believe it, a lie becomes the truth.

110
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,300
Sir.

111
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,700
What brings you to the palace?

112
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,000
I was invited to Naeyeon.
  (A party at the palace in which mostly women get invited)

113
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,400
I got to run into you like this.

114
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,700
What a joke.

115
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,600
She was waiting for him to come out desperately.

116
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,400
We could have come out sooner.

117
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,600
We had to clean up because of her!

118
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,300
- I know! 
 - It was no coincidence.

119
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,900
Why are you acting innocent suddenly?

120
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,800
Could you set some time aside for me?

121
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,000
Right now?

122
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,800
I waited for you for a long time.

123
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,700
Today is actually my birthday.

124
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,900
I did not want to pretend to be happy

125
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,400
and spend the day meaninglessly.

126
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,600
You should have some, too.

127
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,800
I am okay.

128
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,200
You should take a break today.

129
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,400
I will talk to Hostess myself.

130
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,000
There are red bean rice cakes, too.

131
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,400
When Mother was alive, she used to make them on my birthday.

132
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,200
I am sure they are not as good,

133
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,300
but please enjoy them.

134
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,000
Sir.

135
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,200
Instead of thinking of me as a lowly courtesan,

136
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,200
could you think of me as a woman?

137
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,000
I know, too.

138
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,500
That you have to be qualified to love someone, too.

139
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,330
 But...

140
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:26,590
 you were the only one for me since the moment I first saw you.

141
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:34,800
 You were... a woman to me from the beginning.

142
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
What are you doing?

143
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:03,600
It is just that...my heart belongs to someone else.

144
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,880
Do you have a woman you love?

145
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:19,500
Is that woman Lady Dan Oh, by chance?

146
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,640
That is true.

147
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:30,320
Lady Dan Oh must be happy.

148
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,600
She cannot be just happy.

149
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,920
I am hurting her a lot.

150
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,000
I thought there was thunder!

151
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,570
Why are you letting it out on the innocent cloth?

152
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:59,020
That little cat... was on someone else's stove.

153
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,400
It is a good thing he went somewhere else, is it not?

154
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,000
He would no longer steal our food.

155
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,050
 Meow!

156
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,000
 Meow!

157
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 - Meow!  
 - A woman?

158
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,400
Since when was he so good at making a move?

159
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:30,200
 Although it's hard for you as a noble to lift scholars' ankles,

160
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,900
 it's very easy for me, a courtesan.

161
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,800
Hold on.

162
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,000
What is wrong now?

163
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,200
 Ban Ya could not have seen the red mole, has she?

164
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,740
 Meow!

165
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,400
I cannot read at all!

166
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,000
Why is this cat meowing so loudly, anyway?

167
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,600
What are you doing over there, Sir?

168
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,200
Have you not seen a cat?

169
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,900
I think he went inside the yard.

170
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,000
Right!

171
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,700
He even came into the house, so I shooed him away.

172
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,000
That is a relief.

173
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,500
- Go back in. 
 - Yes.

174
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,600
Come out now.

175
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,200
- I cannot get up now. 
 - Why not?

176
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,300
Will you put a blanket out here and sleep or something?

177
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,890
My legs fell asleep.

178
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,700
I was crouching here for too long.

179
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,100
I cannot walk.

180
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,700
The noodles turned cold.

181
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,400
Because of your icy stare.

182
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,400
Did I make a mistake by chance?

183
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:38,000
Since... when was I a woman to you, Brother?

184
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,700
What?

185
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,800
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

186
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,800
I just... became curious.

187
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,900
You said someone was a woman from the beginning.

188
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,090
Were you at Buyounggak today?

189
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,710
You were...

190
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,600
not exactly a woman...

191
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,300
- So I was not a woman or anything— 
 - A lover.

192
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,790
Lovers. That is what we are.

193
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:51,120
You are... definitely good with words.

194
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,430
I meant it.

195
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,430
It is not working.

196
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:04,910
How much... did you reveal yourself to Ban Ya?

197
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:08,130
What is there to reveal, anyway?

198
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,760
I mean...

199
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,830
Should I say your skin, maybe?

200
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:16,000
Dan Oh.

201
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,710
I kept telling you this, but you are mistaken about that night!

202
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:25,520
We did not touch anywhere from head to toe!

203
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,130
How could I prove my innocence?

204
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,200
Even your ankle?

205
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,520
You did not show her that, either. Right?

206
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,600
What do you mean, my ankle?  Out of the blue?

207
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,780
Please be honest with me.

208
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,460
This is a very important matter.

209
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,850
She did try to take my socks off.

210
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,460
I was so drunk then.

211
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,200
You know, right?

212
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,460
My days in the palace will be difficult if I refuse to drink at the welcome initiation.

213
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:07,060
Yes. I understand.

214
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,200
Get some rest.

215
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:19,260
I do not think she knows.

216
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:40,610
 If Ban Ya saw the red mole, she must have learned that he is Lee Seol.

217
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,160
Will you just leave Lee Seol alone?

218
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,900
I am thinking about how to overcome the current situation.

219
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,360
They say the weak ones have to make the first move.

220
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,600
You need to attack first in order to win this time.

221
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,780
Are you telling me to kill my brother?

222
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,230
Just think about it.

223
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:10,610
Lee Seol even put a sword to your throat.

224
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:14,450
Also, he has the Watchman.

225
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:19,520
If you do not act first, you will end up getting hurt.

226
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,520
I know it, too.

227
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,810
That there cannot be two Lee Seols.

228
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,600
Why do you want to see Ban Ya?

229
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,450
I have a question to ask.

230
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,320
She is not in her room now.

231
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,460
She left to go to Chief Administrator's house.

232
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,460
Chief Administrator?

233
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,030
Why would she go to his house—

234
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,380
Could there be a special reason?

235
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:48,330
He probably called her because he was fond of her.

236
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:57,370
So... have you found out anything lately?

237
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,730
Tell me anything.

238
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,240
I think I gave you enough time.

239
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,440
The thing is...

240
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,450
It is not about Lee Seol, but...

241
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,510
Hostess has been acting very suspiciously lately.

242
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,490
What did you say?

243
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:24,340
Not only does she go out at night often,

244
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:29,940
young scholars frequent her room as if they live there.

245
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,430
What could the young scholars be doing there?

246
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:36,370
It did not seem like they were there to drink.

247
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:38,840
Maybe they are plotting something together.

248
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,950
They're secretive.

249
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,050
One of them is a scholar from Ihwawon.

250
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,510
I heard he is the son of His Excellency Jeong Yoon.

251
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:50,700
- Do you mean Jeong Yoo Ha? 
 - Yes.

252
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,850
I am sure she is plotting something behind your back.

253
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:00,390
Look into it further. Find out what she is up to.

254
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:03,670
Yes, I will.

255
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,740
Ban Ya.

256
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:27,910
By chance, did you really tell Chief Administrator the truth?

257
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:32,500
So, you also knew, Dan Oh...

258
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,950
who Scholar Kang San is.

259
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,990
You were supposed to discuss it with me first.

260
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,280
- You should have— 
 - Do not worry.

261
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,790
I did not say anything.

262
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:55,450
I am looking for silk clothes. What do you recommend?

263
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:58,030
If it is for you, there is a lot inside.

264
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,490
Come in.

265
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,820
It is for a woman.

266
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:08,670
You said you wanted to live as Yoon Hong Joo.

267
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:16,410
You will get a chance to go out into the world in new clothes soon.

268
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,670

269
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,690
 My dear husband...

270
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,510
 My dear husband!

271
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:10,290
 Please open your eyes!

272
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:15,570
 You cannot leave me like this! You cannot!

273
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,100
 That is enough.

274
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,750
 Crying will not do anything.

275
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:35,480
 Being a virtuous woman is the best thing a widow can do.

276
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:41,000
 If your father were alive, he would have told you that.

277
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,310
 Sister!

278
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:50,810
 Think carefully.

279
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,820
It would bother me to just let this go.

280
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,960
I need to check.

281
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,450
Yes, sir.

282
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,220
Gosh, I could have carried it myself!

283
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,400
Is it not heavy?

284
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,690
This is light!

285
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,400
Should I put this in the kitchen?

286
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,290
Yes.

287
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:39,760
I am thinking of making a refreshing dongchimi!

288
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,010
This will be the side dish for the whole winter.

289
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,540
You will make it?

290
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,800
- You mean yourself? 
 - Yes.

291
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,420
Gosh! I wanted to help Miss out.

292
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:58,580
When there is a flower blossoming in your heart, you cannot bring yourself to work.

293
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,060
Hold on.

294
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,450
A flower blossoming?

295
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:09,270
You must be... having a hard time working, too, then.

296
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,910
Seriously!

297
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,000
My goodness!

298
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,110
I will not be able to make dongchimi anymore!

299
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,330
Is Dan Oh inside?

300
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,860
S-She left early in the morning.

301
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,240
She has not returned yet.

302
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,650
I am sure she will come soon.

303
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,570
You are looking for Dan Oh first thing as soon as you come.

304
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,830
 There is something I need to tell you.

305
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:02,270
 Please come to Jookrimwon.

306
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,560
Do not be too shocked.

307
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:34,250
She found out everything about you.

308
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,870
Everything?

309
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,930
What do you mean...

310
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:45,670
Feel free to talk. I will wait outside.

311
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,680
Do not worry.

312
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,320
I will not report you, Your Highness.

313
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,870
Thank you... for saying that.

314
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:09,060
Do not misunderstand.

315
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,720
I'm not doing this because of my feelings for you.

316
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:19,520
My father... died trying to protect the crown prince's son.

317
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,920
As his child,

318
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,130
I cannot let my father's death be in vain.

319
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,320
I am sorry for what happened to your father.

320
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,660
I should have apologized and sought forgiveness a long time ago.

321
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,850
How could that have been your fault, Your Highness?

322
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:42,060
I will reinstate everything to its rightful place

323
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:47,250
and your father's honor will be included as well.

324
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:54,830

325
00:30:54,830 --> 00:31:00,400
I did not know Ban Ya had such a painful past.

326
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,430
It is my fault.

327
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:12,550
I made her lose her family... and completely ruined her life.

328
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:19,570
You said you have a calling... to fulfill as a grand heir. Right?

329
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:25,800
Because countless people lost their lives,

330
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,530
you cannot turn a blind eye to them.

331
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,150
I think...

332
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:36,300
I understand a little bit of what you meant.

333
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:41,610
If I don't bring down the king...

334
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,940
their sacrifices will have been for naught.

335
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,750
I won't let it end up like that.

336
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:12,100
Y-You came back early today.

337
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:18,840
- What about dinner? 
 - I already ate.

338
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,930
See me for a moment.

339
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,690
Then...

340
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:28,370
I'll leave you two to talk.

341
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:37,910
Tell me... what you plan to do from here.

342
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,870
I'll see you at the meeting.

343
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:42,300
Tomorrow at the Hour of the Monkey.

344
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,100
All right.

345
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,230
I'll meet you there.

346
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,910
What did you just say?

347
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,840
Who met whom?

348
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,680
Lee Seol and Lee Gyeom.

349
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,470
Those two have met.

350
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:09,600
But... how did you find that out?

351
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,060
Lee Seol came to see me.

352
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:17,150
He appeared out of nowhere and asked about Lee Gyeom.

353
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:22,630
He even knew Lee Gyeom stole his name to be the leader of Mok In Hoe.

354
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,480
He already found out that much?

355
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,360
There will be yet another slaughter between brothers for the throne.

356
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:36,390
How different would they be from the other royals?

357
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:40,210
I do not know who will die and who will live...

358
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:44,910
but you should be the one to make the final decision.

359
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:47,530
As I had promised...

360
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:50,490
I will make the one you choose...

361
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:53,690
into Lee Seol, Your Excellency.

362
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:04,810
Head Eunuch visited Left State Minister last night?

363
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,990
- Not Watchman? 
 - Yes.

364
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:11,140
He went into Left State Minister's residence and took forever to come out.

365
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,850
Good job.

366
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,740
- Keep watching him closely. 
 - Yes.

367
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,360
Did you call for me?

368
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:37,570
Is there anything new you found about Left State Minister?

369
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:43,100
There was nothing worthy to be reported about.

370
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,080
There was nothing, huh?

371
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,380
Yes.

372
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:50,930
I will tell you right away when any suspicious circumstances are observed.

373
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:54,010
You may take your leave.

374
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:43,620
Did Lee Gyeom send you?

375
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,860
Answer me.

376
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:21,410
Who ordered you to come to me?

377
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:06,810
Kim Chi Woon, was it?

378
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:12,550
Is there still no information about Lee Pyeong's bodyguard Yoon Dan Oh spoke of?

379
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:17,160
We have people searching in each province in addition to Gaeseong.

380
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,000
Besides that, I have something to report.

381
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,610
The former inspector general who was executed for treason...

382
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,610
Are you talking about the one

383
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:29,320
who was telling me nonsense, calling it advice?

384
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,270
Yes, Your Majesty.

385
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,620
According to the Royal Investigations Bureau...

386
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,680
the one who freed that man's old mother after becoming a slave

387
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,290
was Left State Minister, apparently.

388
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,740
Is it treason?

389
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,190
Is Left State Minister Shin Won Ho...

390
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:54,430
trying to commit treason against me?

391
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,980
Kim Shi Yeol...

392
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,640
why on Earth would you be...

393
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,780
What would you like me to do?

394
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,190
Retrieve... your sword.

395
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,110
Will you be okay?

396
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:12,150
I must hear the specifics.

397
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,740
I believed we might be able to join forces...

398
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:27,290
since we have the same goal.

399
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:32,390
Although that belief has just been shattered to pieces.

400
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:35,950
I know it would be hard to believe,

401
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:39,780
- but I did not do this. 
 - Then who did this if not you?

402
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,280
Who would scheme something like this?

403
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,710
And why did you come so early? I said let's meet at the Hour of the Monkey.

404
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:47,090
You said you wanted to meet two hours early.

405
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,680
You sent a letter to me, did you not?

406
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:08,320
 If you do not act first, you will end up getting hurt.

407
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,330
 I know, too.

408
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:13,850
 That there cannot be two Lee Seols.

409
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:17,090
 Therefore, it is right for me to step off.

410
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:19,990
 You are going to give up at this point?

411
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,390
 How will you handle the aftermath?

412
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:27,300
 I will meet Lee Seol at the meeting tomorrow and tell him my intentions.

413
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,600
I think I suspect who was behind this.

414
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,800
I will take care of it without trouble.

415
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,700
I started it.

416
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,500
I will put everything back into place.

417
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,500
I mean it.

418
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:12,300
It's not the purpose I couldn't give up.

419
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:17,000
Mok In Hoe vowed in writing to give up our lives for the sake of taking down the king.

420
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,200
What I feared the most was having their determinations go to waste.

421
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,800
As you said, we have the same goal.

422
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,100
So let me request of you.

423
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,200
Since you showed yourself now,

424
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,200
please lead Mok In Hoe yourself, Grand Heir.

425
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,200
The Lee Seol whom Mok In Hoe follows...

426
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,600
is not me.

427
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:05,000
It is you... Lee Gyeom.

428
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,800
If I stand before them, there is sure to be confusion.

429
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,400
So you have led them for a while now.

430
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:20,000
I will think more about... what we will do from now on.

431
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,000
Also, as for this hairpin...

432
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,800
I do not have the right to take it from you.

433
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,000
It is an inheritance Father granted you.

434
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,400
All right, help yourselves.

435
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:11,400
The two of you are doing great work...

436
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,400
looking for Lee Seol, who has been on the run for over a decade.

437
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:20,000
I am only sorry I fail to relieve your concern every day.

438
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,200
Do not say such things, Left State Minister.

439
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:28,700
If it was not for you, I could not have protected the throne.

440
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,700
You embrace this humble one's flaw with so much grace.

441
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:36,400
Your grace is as vast as the heavens.

442
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,300
Is there anything else you found out about Lee Seol?

443
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,600
There was a suspicious move.

444
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:52,600
I will soon secure the evidence and report to you in a few days.

445
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,600
Your Majesty...

446
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,400
please do not worry about Lee Seol.

447
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:04,900
I currently have a spy who is collecting information in Mok In Hoe.

448
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,700
You ordered it yourself?

449
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,000
At a recent gathering,

450
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,700
Lee Seol showed himself and became their leader, I heard.

451
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:18,200
I am also looking into when the next gathering is.

452
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:22,600
I will raid Mok In Hoe with soldiers.

453
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,200
If that day comes...

454
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:28,700
could you take down Lee Seol?

455
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,300
Yes. Of course.

456
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,800
This time, without fail...

457
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,100
I will catch Lee Seol and bring him to you.

458
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,000
You two are coming together?

459
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,100
Yes. We ran into each other just now.

460
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,900
Your hands must be cold. Give it to me. I'll sweep the rest.

461
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,900
It's okay. I'll do it.

462
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:11,300
Give it to me. Hurry inside and take a break.

463
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,600
My goodness, San.

464
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,900
You think Dan Oh came out to sweep the yard?

465
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,900
She was obviously waiting for you.

466
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,400
Did you get hurt?

467
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,300
Was it your doing, Hostess?

468
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:45,200
Did you try to kill the "jade dust"?

469
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,100
I am very disappointed.

470
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,600
I said I will step down! Why would you...

471
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:55,800
I did not... want to witness another horrendous sight.

472
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,200
It is always righteous people like you...

473
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,900
who get sacrificed in political strife, Your Highness.

474
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:06,000
It was the same for Crown Prince, too.

475
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:14,100
How do you know so well... about Crown Prince?

476
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,600
I have been curious from the beginning.

477
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:21,000
You are hiding something from me.

478
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,000
Could you possibly be...

479
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,900
He had a reputation great enough for even this lowly one to know.

480
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:33,900
Crown Prince's character and knowledge were outstanding.

481
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:39,200
You can take your hands off in this matter, Hostess.

482
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,700
 Who is my birth mother?

483
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:57,300
 He did not mention Mother in his will at all.

484
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:00,800
 I heard she was of low class.

485
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,500
 It is more beneficial for you not to have any interest.

486
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,700
What's wrong?

487
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:36,400
Are you worried about something?

488
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,200
It's nothing.

489
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:43,890
Why are you outside in this cold, Sister?

490
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,700
Is Scholar Shi Yeol still out?

491
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,400
It's so late at night already.

492
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,400
He already came back.

493
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,800
He has been back the whole time, huh?

494
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,400
He could have told me he was back.

495
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,400
But he came home a bit injured.

496
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,100
- He probably needs to rest— 
 - He was injured?

497
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,300
Yes.

498
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:10,000
I heard there was a feud with the ruffians on the way...

499
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,400
Scholar Kim...

500
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:55,400
Maiden Hong Joo...

501
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,500
why are you in front of me?

502
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:04,600
I'm sure this is my room.

503
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,400
Why would you sleep like...

504
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,570
you were dead?

505
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:29,600
Did you rush here yourself, worried I might move on to the afterlife?

506
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,700
I heard you were injured.

507
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,800
Where's the injury?

508
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,200
It's nothing. Just a bit.

509
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,100
How did you get into a feud with ruffians?

510
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,500
You know I have a way with words.

511
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,400
Since they couldn't win with words, they resorted to violence.

512
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,500
I'm sick of those jokes now!

513
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:56,000
I can never really tell... what you're thinking, Scholar Kim.

514
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,400
I apologize.

515
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,200
But it was really a light injury.

516
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,000
Shall we make a bet?

517
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:31,000
You're bound to improve a lot when you get competitive.

518
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,400
A bet? How can I win against you, Brother?

519
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,500
I'll land all three shots in the middle.

520
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,800
You only need to land only one.

521
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,200
All right.

522
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,400
But we still need punishment.

523
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:46,000
- It's still a bet. 
 - Go ahead and choose.

524
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,200
It doesn't matter to me.

525
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:08,080
Please, please, please.

526
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:47,580
Geez, that was so close.

527
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:48,990
You saw it, right?

528
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:51,330
Right. You were a whisker away from winning.

529
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:52,900
We don't know that yet.

530
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:56,120
You still have one more shot to land, too.

531
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:23,280
Wow!  What a great teacher you are.

532
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,080
Did you have to try so hard to win?

533
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,830
♫  ...blindingly next to me  ♫

534
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:31,470
Well, a bet is a bet.

535
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:36,550
♫  After staying up this night filled with shy smiles  ♫

536
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,620
Since we agreed not to go easy...

537
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:41,800
No, I don't want that, either.

538
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,410
Don't go easy.

539
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:46,740
♫  A sorrowful heart falls asleep somewhere deep  ♫

540
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,760
Hurry up, and let's get it over with.

541
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:55,190
♫  Dazzles my eyes, like the sunlight  ♫

542
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:58,510
♫  Lost in a dream that is you  ♫

543
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:02,670
♫  When I'm walking for countless nights  ♫

544
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:06,350
♫  The star that shines on me  ♫

545
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:11,600
♫  Whenever it may be, let me be with you  ♫

546
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,420
What's this?

547
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:17,490
They say the five-colored pouch keeps you healthy for life.

548
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:20,540
It was handmade, so have it with you all the time.

549
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:23,790
Do you trust such superstitions, too, Dan Oh?

550
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:26,520
I need to rely on whatever I can.

551
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:31,180
When a person's desperate, there's nothing he can't achieve.

552
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:33,540
All right.

553
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:38,770
I'll have it with me until I age and my hair turns grey.

554
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:45,810
Even if...

555
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:52,500
in the slightest chance...

556
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,860
this five color pouch has no power...

557
00:52:57,950 --> 00:53:01,130
so nothing gets achieved...

558
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:11,210
Do as much as you can do, don't ever break down.

559
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:38,460
Is it really all right to go outside dressed like this?

560
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:39,890
It's only for today.

561
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:42,200
I found a great place.

562
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:47,530
The migrating birds would be the only ones to recognize you there.

563
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,700
Goodness, it's fine.

564
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,970
The handkerchief looks more precious than my shoes.

565
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,700
- I'll do it myself. 
 - It's fine.

566
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:06,550
What brings you to the tavern?

567
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:08,370
To see you, Dan Oh.

568
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:10,700
You're almost done, right?

569
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:19,710
Dan Oh, do you remember?

570
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:23,660
I had asked you to meet me at Gwangtong Bridge before.

571
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:25,550
Yes.

572
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:30,150
We did not get to talk on that day, right?

573
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:33,750
I must tell you today what I could not tell you that day.

574
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:36,020
Even though it's too late.

575
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,780
Try them on.

576
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:57,880
I was always concerned about your feet stumbling in the cold.

577
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,650
Brother, I am...

578
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:03,140
I know, too.

579
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:07,060
You would not be walking toward me with these shoes on.

580
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:10,460
Still...

581
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:13,530
Even so...

582
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,900
I liked you deeply, Dan Oh.

583
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:23,900
I'm sure you would not know.

584
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:27,410
Just how consoled I was by you.

585
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:30,900
I was able to last this far...

586
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:36,430
thanks to your consideration.

587
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,890
This was why she protected Ihwawon like her own life.

588
00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:50,030
Yoon Hong Joo!

589
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:53,490
That child was alive, after all.

590
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:05,550
How is it?

591
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:08,260
Do you feel better?

592
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:11,380
They said happiness lasts but a moment.

593
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:14,610
I think that moment is right now for me!

594
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:33,610
♫  Because I have been hiding these feelings  ♫

595
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:40,170
Maiden Hong Joo...

596
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:43,090
I'm very different...

597
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:48,460
from what you... think of me to be.

598
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:51,110
♫  I only grow more distant from you  ♫

599
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:54,830
Perhaps, the Kim Shi Yeol you know...

600
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:02,400
might have been made up entirely.

601
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:09,350
But please remember this one thing.

602
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:17,620
Though I may be a different person,

603
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,000
my feelings are...

604
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,600
sincere without a speck of falsehood.

605
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:31,260
♫  Do I just need to wait endlessly?  ♫

606
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:32,790
I love you, Maiden Yoon.

607
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:37,200
♫  Can you hear my heart?  ♫

608
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:46,260
♫  My heartbeat races toward you  ♫

609
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:51,830
♫  Its sound rings so loudly like this  ♫

610
00:58:53,990 --> 00:59:01,020

611
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:13,820
♫  This unbreakable love  ♫

612
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:21,070
♫  The feelings that can't be hidden  ♫

613
00:59:23,470 --> 00:59:29,040
♫  The love that I want to express to you  ♫

 Please do not leave me behind.

619
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:55,120
 If she really is alive, I will end her life.

620
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:58,600
 You're braver than anyone in this world, Maiden Yoon.

621
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:02,450
 Aren't you afraid of getting your brother's blood on your hands?

622
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:05,340
 - I'm afraid. 
 - I'll be with you by your side, Brother.

623
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:07,510
 So please succeed in taking the throne.

624
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:11,230
 Deposed Grand Heir Lee Seol will not make it alive past this month.

625
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:14,500
 If he makes it past this month, will you give up your neck, Left State Minister?

626
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,110
 Do you intend to kill the king?

627
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:19,730
 That day is our chance. The chance to get rid of the king.
