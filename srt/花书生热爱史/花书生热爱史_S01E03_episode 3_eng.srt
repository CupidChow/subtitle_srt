1
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,160

2
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,040

3
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,480

4
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,800

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:44,030

6
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:50,790

7
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:55,040

If it is a traitor, you must find by searching the entire town of Jungchon,

8
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,440
it can be only one person.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,830
The deposed crown prince's son who disappeared,

10
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,690
Lee Seol.

11
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:14,000

12
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,280
You are definitely the daughter of Yoon Won.

13
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,390
You are so useless and fearless.

14
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,420
But... you have nothing to lose, sir.

15
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,500
What did you say?

16
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,180
You would either find the "jade dust" 
 ("beautiful flaw", referring to the deposed crown prince's son)

17
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,393
or acquire Ihwawon.

18
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:36,403
You would get at least one.

19
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,400
How can I trust you?

20
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,670
I have been the owner of an inn for more than a decade.

21
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:47,490
When it comes to an inn in Jungchon, no one is more knowledgeable than me.

22
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,220
If the "jade dust" is in Jungchon,

23
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,740
the one who can find him the most effectively is me.

24
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,070
If so...

25
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,740
you must know how many scholars are staying at Buyounggak, too.

26
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,583
Yes.

27
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,793
There are 59 of them.

28
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,550
There are 51.

29
00:02:11,817 --> 00:02:14,220
You are bluffing way too much.

30
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,550
More customers came yesterday.

31
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,023
We supply eggs to Buyounggak.

32
00:02:20,023 --> 00:02:22,143
So we know well.

33
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,570
I will give you a month.

34
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:35,660
If you cannot find Lee Seol within that time, Ihwawon will forever be mine.

35
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,540

36
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,280
Sir, sir!

37
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,800
Yes, yes!

38
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,180
- Sir! 
  - Is anyone in there?

39
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,160
What is this?

40
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,600
You are...

41
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,450
the owner of Ihwawon!

42
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,800
So, what brings you here?

43
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,550
Did you want to see me?

44
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,160
I heard you frequent Buyounggak.

45
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,050
I thought I might as well stop by.

46
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,350
You want to find the deposed crown prince's son?

47
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,110
I have been bored anyway.

48
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,310
How entertaining this is!

49
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,280
You served the "jade dust" very closely.

50
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,390
You must know what he looks like very well.

51
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,230
If you can tell me anything—

52
00:04:54,230 --> 00:05:02,420
Have you ever even imagined... where the "jade dust" would be and how he would look?

53
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,850
He might be closer than you think.

54
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,810
Or he could be very far away.

55
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,040
No one can know.

56
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:23,080
No matter where he is, I will make sure to find him.

57
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,530
Where has she been anyway?

58
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,140
What? Where did you say you were going?

59
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,600
Gwacheonhyeon.

60
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,430
Even if I leave now, it will take at least a full day.

61
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,400
So it would take two days for a round trip, right?

62
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,950
Are you telling me to eat Najudaek's food for two days?

63
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:06,190
Whoa. I would really, really hate that.

64
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,010
Gwacheon is too far.

65
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,010
The path is treacherous, too.

66
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,780
Yes, Yoo Ha is right.

67
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,710
How will you climb those treacherous hills of Namtaeryeong?

68
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,310
I must go.

69
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,140
It is very important to me.

70
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,970
If so, I will come with you.

71
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,490
Gosh! The state exam is coming up soon.

72
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,800
I cannot let you waste your time like that.

73
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,180
But it is too dangerous for you to go alone.

74
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,990
I heard that the town officers will be accompanying me.

75
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,920
I will be careful and come back quickly.

76
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,040
You might not make it back.

77
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,770
Pardon?

78
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:45,670
There are countless people who get eaten by tigers on those trails.

79
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,480
I sent Najudaek on an errand.

80
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,610
Please explain the situation to her when she returns.

81
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,890
 Oh, right!

82
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,760
 There is one thing I have not told you yet.

83
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,500
 What is it?

84
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:31,260
 I heard the deposed Crown Princess's servant from her residence lives in Gwacheonhyeon.

85
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,500
 Was his name Meok Soe?

86
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,460
 Thank you.

87
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,150
 Thank you so much, sir.

88
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,410
 You do not have to thank me.

89
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,810
 I am curious about what will happen, too.

90
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:57,960
 There are countless people who got eaten by tigers on those trails.

91
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,130
Brother?

92
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,110
What are you doing here...

93
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,930
Just because... I could not focus on the books.

94
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,480
I just wanted to get some fresh air.

95
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,150
Be careful.

96
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,530
There is a snake on the ground—

97
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,630
Where, where, where?

98
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,240
I mean, there might be one!

99
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,580
You are so easily frightened. You did not have to come here.

100
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:54,330
Easily frightened? I was just a little bit surprised.

101
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,090
Hey!

102
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,450
You left me out.

103
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,110
I am disappointed, you know.

104
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,250
Are those what you will wear on this long journey?

105
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:16,000
The thing is... I think my shoes left this earth.

106
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,010
Now you are joining me on this long journey—

107
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,080
Gosh, you do not have to thank me.

108
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,760
As for me, I delight in traveling the eight provinces.

109
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,830
Why did you come?

110
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:31,740
You should be studying instead.

111
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,940
She is thanking me, right?

112
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,940
Very much.

113
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,690
He said countless people got eaten by tigers.

114
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,550
That Kang San is such a liar.

115
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,480
They said it was Gwacheon right after this.

116
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,100
Which way are we supposed to go?

117
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,390
When did you get a compass?

118
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,160
I guess you came prepared since it would be a long journey.

119
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,720
 There are bandits! Run!

120
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,630
 Run!

121
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,710
Look at them!

122
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,950
You said you were going to Gwacheonhyeon, right?

123
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,750
- This is a shortcut. 
 - It is a shortcut.

124
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,470
Thank you.

125
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,600
By the way, why are you helping us?

126
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,380
T-T-The thing is...

127
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,970
- Well... 
 - They seem flustered.

128
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,560
It is definitely suspicious.

129
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,070
We are actually a bit busy. We will get going.

130
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,250
- Let's go. Hurry. 
 - Let's go.

131
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,330
 Hurry! Hurry!

132
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,550
 Hurry!

133
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,110
Let us go.

134
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,810
 Get him!

135
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,340
 We are on the wrong path.

136
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,570
 Guys! It is that mountain.

137
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,070
 That mountain!

138
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,510
 Hong Shik!

139
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:38,070
 Hey, Tiger.

140
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,860
 Scholar, sir.

141
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,380
Do you happen to know a man named Meok Soe?

142
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,910
By chance... have you heard of a man named Meok Soe?

143
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,950
I do not know.

144
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,960
Have you heard of a man named Meok Soe?

145
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,270
He probably lives in the village further up.

146
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,360
Thank you.

147
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,090
I found him.

148
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,370
What is wrong?

149
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,880
I am sure I saw Brother Kang San over there—

150
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,250
No way!

151
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,300
He does not care about other people's business at all.

152
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,400
He could not have come all the way here.

153
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,390
Is that so?

154
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,810
 Come, come.

155
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,940
A woman and two scholars were here. Which way did they go?

156
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,300
I do not know.

157
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,160
I was right, was I not?

158
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,530
It was definitely him.

159
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,750
Were you that worried about us?

160
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,650
I did not know you were such a warm person.

161
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:30,400
Worried, my foot!

162
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,880
Yook Ho sent me.

163
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,180
He did?

164
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,880
Yes! He insisted that I go with you.

165
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,160
He thought it might be dangerous.

166
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,140
He did not say anything like that to me.

167
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,300
You... do not know how to use a sword!

168
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,730
You only know how to spend money.

169
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,380
It is not even a real sword.

170
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,780
You came because you were worried about me, right?

171
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,300
Why would I worry about you?

172
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,190
Yook Ho asked me to—

173
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:05,610
Since when did you listen to Yook Ho?

174
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:09,420
You didn't know but I tend to listen to elders.

175
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,590
But why did you try to hide?

176
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:15,290
- You must have come for a reason— 
 - Yes.

177
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,560
You are right.

178
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,800
I came because of you.

179
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,060
I was so worried that...

180
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,320
you might get hurt.

181
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,550
Is this what you wanted to hear?

182
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,400
N-Not at all!

183
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,180
Hurry up and come.

184
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,270
The sun is about to set.

185
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,810
You look well.

186
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:55,750
Someone must be taking care of you who got kicked out of the palace.

187
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,400
Is it Lee Seol?

188
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,320
Have you met him?

189
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:16,580
If I say anything, I will get killed along with the "jade dust."

190
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,840
How could I answer that?

191
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,960
Do you have any loyalty left in you?

192
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:30,490
Now that the Crown Prince passed away, you are bringing up loyalty?

193
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:38,130
I, Noh Seong Gil, am... merely a peddler without any loyalty.

194
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,610
If you are a peddler, your calculation was wrong.

195
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,980
Do you think Lee Seol would let you live?

196
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,170
I guess... you would never know about that.

197
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,390
If so...

198
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:01,390
I will let you know... about what your future will be like.

199
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,560
Your Majesty! Please calm down.

200
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,500
Move!

201
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,110
If we find the deposed crown prince's son someday, we will need an eyewitness.

202
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,260
This is all I can offer.

203
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,320
It is all right.

204
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:06,080
Now, even a lady from a noble family is looking for the oldest son of the Crown Prince.

205
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,030
I suppose...

206
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:14,240
his name is too mighty to be buried in the past.

207
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,790
Please tell me anything you know about it.

208
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,590
Yes.

209
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,620
When the oldest son of the Crown Prince was a child,

210
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,080
he stayed at his maternal grandparents' residence often.

211
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,300
Until that incident happened...

212
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:40,520
 Your Highness the Crown Princess! Run away!

213
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,760
 - Mother! 
 - Leave.

214
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,030
 - Mother! 
 - Your Highness!

215
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,960
 You must protect the Prince.

216
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,990
 No, Mother!

217
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,660
 You must come with me!

218
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,370
 Mother, please get up!

219
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:25,800
 We have to go! You have to come with me!

220
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,920
 You must come with me!

221
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,350
 Mother!

222
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:31,910
 - You must come with me! 
 - Mother!

223
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:34,270
Since then,

224
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:37,720
the nursemaid raised the young prince.

225
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,660
By the way,

226
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:44,510
how do you know that the nursemaid raised the son of the Crown Prince?

227
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:49,710
It was around when he was about 13.

228
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:54,220
His nursemaid came to see me asking for money.

229
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,670
Money?

230
00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:01,940
She was... planning to have him adopted somewhere.

231
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:07,030
She had to live in hiding all this time because of the men searching for him.

232
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:11,240
So that would have been better for her safety.

233
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,880
Which family was it?

234
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,370
I do not know about that, either.

235
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:18,910
I thought I might get hurt if I knew.

236
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,630
So I did not even ask.

237
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:25,130
Is the nursemaid... still alive?

238
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:30,200
I guess she got ill while being chased around.

239
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:37,410
After she had Prince adopted she could not even last ten days...

240
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:43,100
If so... at least tell me what the Prince looked like.

241
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:55,600
 His dark eyebrows were as fine as a crescent

242
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,490
and his eyes were clear and big.

243
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,400
His nose was sharp and pointy.

244
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,500
His lips were plump and the corners of his mouth pointed up.

245
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,200
If you put all of that together...

246
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,200
- he must be a handsome man. 
 - Yes.

247
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,000
He was a very good-looking boy.

248
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,800
And the thing that stood out the most was... his ankle.

249
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,200
He had a red mole above the ankle bone.

250
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,000
It was dark and vivid.

251
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,400
Did you have a good talk?

252
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,100
Yes.

253
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,600
Thank you for coming all the way here for me.

254
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,100
I will treat you to a meal.

255
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,100
Let us go.

256
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,900
You have no money.

257
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,200
I have enough to get you rice and soup.

258
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,700
How about rice wine?

259
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,400
I could use cold rice wine with rice and soup.

260
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,600
Who did you meet all the way here, anyway?

261
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,000
Well...

262
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,500
A friend of my father lives here.

263
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,900
His friend was a slave?

264
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,100
This is obviously—

265
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:29,300
My father was very open-minded.

266
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,400
Your lies are so creative.

267
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,000
Goodness! Here they come!

268
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,200
Well...

269
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,500
How come it is just you?

270
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,900
Did something happen to My Lady?

271
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,000
 Not at all.

272
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,100
We parted ways because she had an errand in Jungchon.

273
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,800
Do not worry.

274
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,400
We came back safely from Gwacheon.

275
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,100
Yes.

276
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,300
You know something, do you not?

277
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,100
Know what? What do you mean?

278
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,900
Why is Dan Oh acting strange these days?

279
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,700
You even followed us to Gwacheon, which is uncharacteristic of you.

280
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,800
What if I did?

281
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,700
Let me know, too.

282
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,700
I need to know as well.

283
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,900
I do not know, either.

284
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,200
Even if I did,

285
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,300
why do I have to tell you?

286
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,300

287
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,200
It is a red mole.

288
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,800
A red mole?

289
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,000
Have you seen one?

290
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,500
No. I never have.

291
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,600
How about the bottom of a foot? How about a black mole?

292
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,600
Oh! I know a scholar with a red mole on his toe.

293
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,700
The mole looked like a watermelon seed.

294
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,700
It has to be above the ankle bone.

295
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,000
Really?

296
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I am sorry that I cannot help you.

297
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,300
It is okay.

298
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,200
Make sure to tell me if you see it.

299
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,300
I will bring you more yakgwa, then. 
  (Traditional Korean honey cookies)

300
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,600
- Yes! 
 - Yes.

301
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,100
He has a red mole.

302
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,600
A red mole?

303
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,200
I have not seen a man with one.

304
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,000
How about you?

305
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,800
I have not, either.

306
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,900
There are not many men with a red mole.

307
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,800
Now that I think about it, it stands out too much.

308
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,820
Are you taking your present back?

309
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,800
Think carefully.

310
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,100
The first person to tell me gets it.

311
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,390
What are you doing right now?

312
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,600
Anyway, sorry for the trouble.

313
00:25:55,430 --> 00:26:00,570
Last night, you visited Chief Administrator Jang last night, as I hear.

314
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:03,000
I told you.

315
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
That I cannot lose Ihwawon.

316
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:12,900
What is so great about that inn that you would risk your life for it?

317
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:20,000
You have no idea... how reckless and dangerous what you are doing is.

318
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,500
Do not look for him.

319
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,800
Many people died looking for the "jade dust."

320
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,400

321
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,000
Excuse me.

322
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,800
Tell the owner that Ban Ya is here.

323
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,400
Why are you dragging your feet?

324
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,200
Hurry!

325
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,300
My Lady.

326
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,300
Were you still here?

327
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,500
- Yes, I am about to leave. 
 - Yes.

328
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,400
It is okay.

329
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,700
I get mistaken often because of how I look.

330
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:30,100
If you are looking for the owner, turn around and try the room at the end.

331
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,400
It is you.

332
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:54,300
A former aristocrat who became a courtesan.

333
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,300
You look well taken care of.

334
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,900
Looks like you did not suffer enough!

335
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,100
You are a bit stiff.

336
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,000
She must still think she is an aristocrat.

337
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,400
How annoying.

338
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,800
- Say it again. 
 - Hey!

339
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,000
What did you say?

340
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Let go.

341
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,800
Was it Ban Ya?

342
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,700
I heard you could not find a man to put your hair up for you at the last courtesan house 
  (Coming-of-age ceremony for courtesans)

343
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,200
and only caused trouble.

344
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,800
Today is the last day you will misbehave.

345
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,300
You cannot do this to me!

346
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,700
Who do you think you are, wench?

347
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,700
You are a courtesan.

348
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,800
Just accept it.

349
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:05,100
The only reason why I accepted you is because of the Chief Administrator.

350
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:09,800
If you cause trouble again, you will get kicked out with bare feet.

351
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,700
Keep that in mind.

352
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,600
Since when did you walk with me?

353
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,400
From over there.

354
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,000
Why did you not just call me, then?

355
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,600
You were walking ahead. What for?

356
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,300
It is nice to walk together.

357
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,400
It is less boring, too.

358
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,000
I walk alone fine without getting bored.

359
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,500
Orabeoni.

360
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,100
You do not have any friends, do you?

361
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,270
- What? 
 - Goodness!

362
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,740
I do not have many, either.

363
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,330
But you are so...

364
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,130
You do not know me that well!

365
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,970
Right!

366
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:13,320
I heard you did well on the exam.

367
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,870
That Shi Yeol is so talkative.

368
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:18,200
This is all because of my lucky taffy.

369
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,010
Do not forget... that I contributed to your success.

370
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,710
- I have not even passed yet. 
 - Come on!

371
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:28,450
You are obviously going to pass!

372
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,720
What?

373
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,420
Even foreign intruders will get scared and run away from you.

374
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,110
You are the best warrior of Joseon.

375
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,460
What are you doing?

376
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,380
Just wondering if Najudaek is out here.

377
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,810
She left in the morning to look for you.

378
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,470
But you...

379
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:05,360
Why are you spending so much time outside?

380
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,950
Even after staying up all night visiting Gwacheon.

381
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:14,230
I just have very good stamina.

382
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,670
You do not seem to be going around to earn money.

383
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:26,090
Are you... looking for someone, perhaps?

384
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,630
Sorry?

385
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:30,220
Wh-What do you mean?

386
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,480
Not at all.

387
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,010
Whom would I be looking for anyway?

388
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,410
There.

389
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,420
You really like that, huh?

390
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:27,260
My Boksil also liked to feast on this as well.

391
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,130
 Boksil.

392
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,540
 Who are you?

393
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,850
I wonder if that boy is doing well.

394
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,710
My plate is too full to be worrying about someone else.

395
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:53,580
Is that not true, Boksil?

396
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:58,850

397
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:02,450
You want me to find the court lady who used to serve Lady Park?

398
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,870
Why look for a court lady who left the palace?

399
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,410
 Well, then...

400
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,200
 Let us go.

401
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,120
 Hold on!

402
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:29,580
There is something that bothers me so much. I must confirm it.

403
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,870
Yes, Your Excellency.

404
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,880
 Your Excellency!

405
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,760
Take your leave.

406
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,950
You called for me, Left State Minister?

407
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:16,990
Was it a watchman?

408
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:23,620
The one who ruthlessly slaughtered the warriors of Six Swords eight years ago.

409
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,690
Yes.

410
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:30,290
He is a swordsman in the shadows who guards royalty for generations.

411
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:33,790
I heard "jade dust's" watchman is especially skilled.

412
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:37,060
A young man with devilish swordsmanship?

413
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,500
He probably is better now.

414
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:43,410
Since he would have gained muscles from growing up, too.

415
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,720
Your only son was also a member of the Six Swords?

416
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,410
The third generation only son of a family where sons are rare.

417
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,400
What is your true goal?

418
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,930
Is it Lee Seol...

419
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:11,990
or... is it the watchman?

420
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,430
The watchman always stays close to Lee Seol.

421
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:28,280
Whenever his master was in danger, he always showed himself.

422
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:36,740
Finding him is... the same as finding Lee Seol.

423
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:42,400
I do not care what happens to the watchman.

424
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,990
However... make sure to bring Lee Seol alive.

425
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,510
Hurry up and come out.

426
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:32,040
I clearly saw you just now!

427
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,520
Najudaek... long time no see.

428
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,930
Miss!

429
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:39,950
I had a safe trip.

430
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:43,440
Look here. I did not get hurt at all.

431
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:48,110
What business did you have at Gwacheon?

432
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:50,080
The thing is...

433
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,350
Chief Administrator Jang deferred the debt for one whole month.

434
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:55,720
Instead, he gave me a task.

435
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:59,780
How could you be so stubborn when you are always so smart with everything else?

436
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,700
How are you going to get that much money in one month?

437
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,210
The thing is, I have the means.

438
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:08,540
Najudaek, you just count on me and follow.

439
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,410
Miss!

440
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:26,800
I also... want to find another way if there is one.

441
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:31,050
But there is none.

442
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:39,330
Miss...

443
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:50,130
If Ihwawon gets handed over to Chief Administrator Jang, things we did our best to conceal will be exposed.

444
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,800
 What do we do?

445
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:09,360
 Smallpox! She has a bad case of smallpox.

446
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,910
 If you end up getting it as well, it will be a big problem.

447
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,860
 Did I not teach you?

448
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:17,430
 How a widow who lost her husband should set an example.

449
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:22,400
 Do you really wish Hong Ju to take her own life?

450
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:29,580
 She even got an illness like that because she has a needless desire to stay alive.

451
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,210
Everyone will be in danger.

452
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:06,030
I do not have the confidence... to handle the aftermath.

453
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:08,440
I know.

454
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,810
Of course, I know.

455
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:13,960
But I am just so scared.

456
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,810
That you might get hurt.

457
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,350
Have you seen Dan Oh?

458
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:37,250
Gosh, I am starving.

459
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,810
You were all here, huh?

460
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,420
I already had made midnight snacks.

461
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,880
Midnight snacks?

462
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,320
Wait, I am fine.

463
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,410
Najudaek!

464
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,600
I will only accept your kindness.

465
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,200
Eating snacks at night makes me sleepy during my studies.

466
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,000
- I see. 
 - Go on.

467
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:16,900
Thank you so much for going with her... all the way to Gwacheon.

468
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:23,600
Thanks to you, Scholars, I feel so much at peace.

469
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,000
Wait. Why...

470
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,500
Why give me only this much?

471
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:31,700
How could you... express your thanks in this way?

472
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,700
Is it because she put her gratitude into it?

473
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,700
How is a rice ball this big?

474
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,600
I also am thinking of doing some studies.

475
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,000
You are?

476
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,600
As if you would.

477
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,400
Shall we go inside and eat?

478
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,600
Let us go together.

479
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,100
Wait...

480
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,600
This is what I was talking about.

481
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,800
Take your time as you eat.

482
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,100
Dan Oh, are you not hungry? Join us.

483
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,400
I am fine.

484
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,400
Just make sure to put the dishes out after you are done.

485
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,900
By the way, is Dan Oh not acting weird lately?

486
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,500
I think it is because of her debt.

487
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,600
Taking a trip all the way to Gwacheon, too.

488
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,000
What is she going around for, exactly?

489
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,600
I know.

490
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:59,400
Kang San, you...

491
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,500
You seem to know something.

492
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:10,600
I mean... how would you know what Yoo Ha does not know?

493
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,100
Do I look like a good person to you?

494
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,800
I-It hurts.

495
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,600
 He had a red mole above the ankle bone.

496
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,400
 It was dark and vivid.

497
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,000
How am I going to check his ankle?

498
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,800
Is he tired?

499
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,300
Why take a break here uncomfortably?

500
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,800
 His dark eyebrows were

501
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:38,700
 as fine as a crescent and his eyes were clear and big.

502
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:44,400
 His nose was sharp and pointy.

503
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:50,500
 His lips were plump and the corners of his mouth pointed up.

504
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,400
He was clearly talking about Brother Kang San.

505
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,600
 He had a red mole above the ankle bone.

506
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,800
What are you doing right now?

507
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,400
Wh-What do you mean what am I doing?

508
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,200
You were trying to strip me.

509
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,000
Wh-Why would I try to strip you?

510
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,200
I saw everything, though.

511
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,500
You untied the ankle knot and raised—

512
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:29,100
♫  Beyond countless stars, blindingly next to me  ♫

513
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:37,300
♫  After staying up this night filled with shy smiles  ♫

514
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,400
Why would you say such needless things?

515
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,600
You are going to feign ignorance?

516
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,400
I was going to tie your ankle knot because it was loose.

517
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,800
You do not even know what happened.

518
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,000
You should not be slandering me like that.

519
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,800
Just tie your ankle knot.

520
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,200
Brother! Are you busy today?

521
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,500
No, well, not particularly.

522
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,500
You know the Hwang family's fabric shop by the entrance of Jungchon. Right?

523
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:16,400
When you buy fabric from them, they also make clothes out of them.

524
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,200
I am telling you to get some new clothes.

525
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,800
Autumn is on its way.

526
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,500
I have a lot of clothes, though.

527
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,100
I also have five or six autumn outfits.

528
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,100
Is that so?

529
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:31,500
 Autumn clothes! I need those.

530
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,700
Wait!  Why are you coming out of the doghouse?

531
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,900
Boksil just likes me too much.

532
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,700
I am telling you, it just wags its tail at me left and right.

533
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,700
No way. Did you go out to drink again at night?

534
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,900
Do you even have money to buy clothes?

535
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:53,300
It looks like you used it all on getting drunk.

536
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,800
Of course... I do not have it.

537
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,300
But I have you, though.

538
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:02,100
When did you take my shoes? Seriously.

539
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,600
Kang San, you tag along, too.

540
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,500
Let us get one for autumn, huh?

541
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,500
Should I do that?

542
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,000
I need to measure your ankle.

543
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,800
So can I take your sock off, please?

544
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,900
The sock, too? I think this is enough.

545
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,000
That is how the clothes come out custom tailored.

546
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,600
Now.

547
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,700
Gosh, there.

548
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,600
Gosh, there...

549
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,300
Wait, why...

550
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,200
My, now.

551
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,800
Wait.

552
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,300
That is enough.

553
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:10,700
Let us go if you are done.

554
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,600
You will end up getting your toes measured, too.

555
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,500
Wait, the thing is—

556
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,800
Now, then. Please do your best and tailor it.

557
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,500
Make mine with these. Okay?

558
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,600
Y-Yes, yes.

559
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,400
Gosh, I needed their measurements, too.

560
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,100
- Excuse me for a moment. 
 - Yes.

561
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:34,600
Have you seen a scholar with a red mole... on his ankle bone before?

562
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,300
A red mole?

563
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,100
A red mole...

564
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,700
I have not seen one before.

565
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,000
Are you sure?

566
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,400
I heard this is where most of Jungchon's scholars come to get tailored.

567
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,700
Yes.

568
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,600
I always see the ankles whenever I measure them.

569
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,600
I would have remembered if I had seen one.

570
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:55,200
If you happen to see one in the future, please let me know.

571
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,000
Yes, yes. I will do that.

572
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,700
Brothers.

573
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,300
Please go on home without me.

574
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,200
I have a brief stop to make.

575
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,400
You will come home soon, right?

576
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,000
Of course. I will be back before dinner.

577
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,100
I told you.

578
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:25,700
She is really suspicious.

579
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,800
There is indeed one way to look into this.

580
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:57,010
Are you not Ihwawon's scholars?

581
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:58,370
We have been waiting.

582
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,650
We need to ask you something.

583
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:07,240
Dan Oh's father owes Chief Administrator Jang a large sum?

584
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,620
Is that all?

585
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:10,380
Should there be something more?

586
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,290
There is something more.

587
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:14,810
That is what my intuition is telling me.

588
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:18,180
Let us take our leave now. We heard everything.

589
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:23,090
However, why are you all so concerned?

590
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:28,410
If the inn goes out of business, you can just move elsewhere.

591
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:30,980
There is this Buyounggak right here, too.

592
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:39,160
It is because of Young Lady Dan Oh, is it not?

593
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:44,550
As I thought.

594
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:46,910
That was the case.

595
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,590
Men's hearts, seriously.

596
00:50:55,210 --> 00:51:03,920
Lady Dan Oh made a deal with Chief Administrator Jang... in order to protect Ihwawon.

597
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:39,150
Dan Oh is... looking for the "jade dust"?

598
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:46,780

599
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,750
It is for the past due rent.

600
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:04,180
I made use of my sleight of hand.

601
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:10,180
Could it be from...

602
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:13,810
I won. Fair and square.

603
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:17,400
If you had studied like that, you would have already passed with top scores.

604
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,140
- Not happy? In that case— 
 - I am happy.

605
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,820
I am very happy.

606
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:25,750
If you are happy... do you want to marry me?

607
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,730
Well...

608
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:31,000
I do not want to.

609
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:35,880
I was rejected.

610
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:53,670
Why—

611
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,030
Why are you coming home so late?

612
00:52:57,030 --> 00:53:00,460
Brother, you came back later than I did today.

613
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:06,640
By the way... do you know you are a little strange today?

614
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,380
In what way?

615
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:13,550
I guess you can say your eyes are like those of...

616
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:17,260
a dog that needs to poop.

617
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:18,670
What?

618
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,590
Anyhow, what brings you here?

619
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,720
- Do not find him. 
 - Sorry?

620
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:29,420
Stop looking for the one... you are searching for.

621
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:31,040
What?

622
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,290
What in the world are you saying—?

623
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:48,770
I must find him.

624
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:54,520
To protect Ihwawon.

625
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,240
I do not know how much you know, but—

626
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,740
Is Ihwawon that important to you?

627
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:06,010
More than your own life?

628
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:42,390
Here.

629
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:46,560
Hurry up and eat. You barely had anything for dinner.

630
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,380
 Is Ihwawon that important to you?

631
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:54,090
 More than your own life?

632
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:58,220
How stifling.

633
00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:59,890
Why?

634
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:02,360
D-Does it taste that bad?

635
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,660
Gosh, seriously.

636
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:07,660
It feels like I ate a million sweet potatoes.

637
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:12,290
I only boiled them in water.

638
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:14,390
What on Earth could it be?

639
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:16,840
What else?

640
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:19,900
A fool who cannot even boil a sweet potato correctly.

641
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,960

642
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:41,970
You can leave it there.

643
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,890
Here.

644
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:57,360
What is this?

645
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:02,120
A scholar told me to give it to you, Miss.

646
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,050
A scholar?

647
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,520
"If you want to find the "jade dust"...

648
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:37,970
come to the abandoned house next to the guardian tree in Namsangol."

649
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:42,930
Could Lee Seol have...

650
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:03,660
Whatever it is you need to tell me... go ahead, please.

651
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:08,050
It is about the Watchman.

652
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:11,170
Is there anything you know?

653
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:16,460
It is okay.

654
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:19,980
He is looking for Lee Seol under my order.

655
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:23,240
I am deeply sorry, but even the Royal Guards do not

656
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:26,300
know anything about the Watchmen, either.

657
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,950
Do you not even know where they are trained?

658
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:30,450
No.

659
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:32,510
It has been done in secret for generations.

660
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:35,350
There must be someone who funds them, at least.

661
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:37,710
They are funded by the Royal Family's personal funds.

662
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:41,590
But the Queen Mother approves every transaction, not His Majesty.

663
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:45,040
Then His Majesty would not know, either.

664
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,840
Yes.

665
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:50,410
Even Queen Mother does not know the fine details.

666
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:53,200
She only provides the funds.

667
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:57,890
I beseech... you not to look for them.

668
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:00,810
They live in the darkness.

669
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,333
If you push them out into the light,

670
00:58:03,333 --> 00:58:07,843
you might not be safe, either, Left State Minister.

671
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:35,200
Why does it have to be a place like this?

672
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:38,790
 Do not look for him.

673
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:43,110
 Countless people died looking for the "jade dust."

674
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:04,000
Are you him?

675
00:59:05,730 --> 00:59:08,220
Jade dust...

676
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:16,940

677
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:22,720

678
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:40,640
♫  Melting in again  ♫

679
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,170
 I will find Lee Seol, no matter what.

680
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:43,680
 You will realize this while trying to find him.

681
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,280
 What a crazy endeavor it is.

682
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,430
 Why?

683
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:49,710
 We just might end up finding him ourselves.

684
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:51,580
 It might be Lee Seol, the deposed crown prince's son.

685
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:53,230
 You are the first one, Brother.

686
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:55,800
 Is being nosy your talent? You sure are interested in other people's business.

687
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:59,600
 Love blooms, and all hell breaks loose between a man and a woman just from a glance.

688
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:04,180
 Does Yoon Dan Oh really not know who you are, Scholar?

689
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:05,980
 I can tell now.

690
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:10,330
 Yoon Dan Oh, it seems you will not give up until the end.
