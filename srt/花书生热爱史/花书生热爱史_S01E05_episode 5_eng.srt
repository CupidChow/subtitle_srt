1
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,840

2
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,850

3
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,210

4
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,240

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:44,300

6
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:50,280

7
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:57,380

8
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,980
Open the carriage.

9
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,040
Why do you want to look inside an aristocrat's carriage?

10
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,920
I'm chasing after a traitor.

11
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,180
Put down the carriage.

12
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,240
- That way! Chase them! 
  - Yes, sir!

13
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,330
No one was there.

14
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,950
There was no one!

15
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,670

16
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,710
Here you go!

17
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,130
Please hold him.

18
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,190
- Here, here! 
 - Be careful.

19
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,990
Grab a pillow.

20
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,590
Here, here! Put it under him.

21
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,440
My god! I should bring a wet towel first!

22
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,510
There must be medicine in the kitchen.

23
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,700
I'll go instead.

24
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,000
Keep an eye on him.

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,570
He might pass away.

26
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,140
Pardon?

27
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,630
He needs to be treated first.

28
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,830
Don't get the wrong idea.

29
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,080
It's not like that.

30
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,790
Dan Oh.

31
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:50,650
♫  The night's sky is deeply asleep  ♫

32
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,880
Yoon Dan Oh.

33
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,740
It was you again.

34
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,380
It was you...

35
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,590
...this time, too.

36
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:11,190
♫  I can't seem to forget  ♫

37
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:20,580
♫  On the night the moon rose, you quietly...  ♫

38
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,380
Is something going on?

39
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,910
San!

40
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,930
What happened?

41
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,220
I can't believe the descendant of Jumong got shot by an arrow! 
  (First king of Goguryeo, one of the three ancient kingdoms before Joseon. He was known to be a great archer.)

42
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,680
How did he find out so quickly?

43
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,640
Stop making a fuss!

44
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,230
I need to visit the physician now.

45
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,320
It'd be too late.

46
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,530
Do you have licorice and ginger?

47
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,720
Yes, I do.

48
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,940
Tonight will be his toughest night.

49
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,480
I hope he survives it.

50
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,670
Do not worry.

51
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:29,590
San is a strong man. He will hang in there.

52
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:35,340
By the way, how did he get injured so much?

53
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,880
I am not so sure, either...

54
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,930
Najudaek said you came back with him.

55
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,240
The thing is...

56
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,130
He was passed out on the street.

57
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,220
I just brought him here.

58
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,970
Is that so?

59
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,190
Something must have happened.

60
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,930
He carried a real sword for once.

61
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,520
I guess you do not need to make a deal.

62
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,290
A deal?

63
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,600
With someone like you?

64
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,890
All right!

65
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,560
I was told not to find her.

66
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,710
- What? 
 - Yoon Dan Oh.

67
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,780
That girl.

68
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,620
I was told to stay away from her.

69
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,420

70
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,850
Do not force yourself!

71
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,360
You cannot move your body yet.

72
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:00,210
What happened... yesterday?

73
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,060
Dan Oh found you passed out and brought you here.

74
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,410
If it were not for her, you would have been in a coffin by now.

75
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,940
How did you get shot with a poison arrow, anyway?

76
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,550
Did you run into your sworn enemy or something?

77
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,890
Why do I bother asking you?

78
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,810
It is okay as long as you are alive.

79
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,970
Did Dan Oh say anything... else?

80
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,390
Anything else?

81
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,550
She said she happened to see you passed out.

82
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,280
She did not say anything else.

83
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,910
Why? Did something happen to you two—

84
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:47,270
No. It is not like that.

85
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,170
Rest here, then. I will get you some porridge quickly.

86
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:54,520
More importantly... I need to talk to Dan Oh.

87
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,350
She is not home now.

88
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,500
She left early because the Chief Administrator wanted to see her.

89
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:15,910
So... how are things going with finding the "jade dust"?

90
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:20,390
If you have something to say, say it quickly.

91
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:27,730
While you were searching for the "jade dust", have you not been threatened at all?

92
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,060
By whom do you mean?

93
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,730
A Watchman, I mean.

94
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,390
Do you know anything about him?

95
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,480
Yes.

96
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,750
I am aware.

97
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:55,110
That there is... a shadow warrior who protects the "jade dust".

98
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:59,400
Then, did you know that he is a murderer?

99
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:08,700
He has killed so many people that I cannot count because I do not have enough hands.

100
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,310
So be careful.

101
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:18,640
If he knows about you, he will try to kill you first.

102
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,320
Will my turn even come?

103
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:31,500
Even you are alive and well like this.

104
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:37,290
- What? 
 - If you are done talking, I will get going.

105
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:44,420
Let me know if the Watchman comes to you.

106
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,430
He is not the one I need to find.

107
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:54,970
Do not forget that you are running out of time.

108
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,590
You have five days left.

109
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:04,090
What will happen... if I find him?

110
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,130
The Watchman.

111
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,330
What would happen if I found him?

112
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:24,710
If you bring me the Watchman, I will forgive all of your debt.

113
00:11:26,557 --> 00:11:31,600
Do you mean... you will give up Ihwawon?

114
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,470
Finding him means finding the "jade dust".

115
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:40,773
The Watchman is always by the "jade dust's" side.

116
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,300
Are you in there?

117
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,300
 By chance... did he notice me?

118
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:33,240
You haven't left the room for a few days.

119
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,220
Is it because of me?

120
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:46,380
I heard a rumor that there is a lady ghost in this house.

121
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:55,020
There must be a reason why you are hiding by enduring the rumor, right?

122
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,510
My goodness.

123
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,090
I did not come here to question her.

124
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,330
I came to tell you this.

125
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:17,160
I do not think anyone knows that I saw you.

126
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:23,730
They would... just think I saw a lady ghost.

127
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,530
I thought you might worry.

128
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,510
The moon is bright.

129
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:46,460
You should... walk around the yard sometimes, at least.

130
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,060
Brother.

131
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,870
Are you in there?

132
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,020
Where did he go?

133
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,590
He can't move yet.

134
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,760
 Finding him means finding the "jade dust".

135
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:17,370
 The Watchman is always by the "jade dust's" side.

136
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,560
What are you doing in there?

137
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,120
Gosh! T-This drawer... must be broken!

138
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,810
Well, Brother. Please do not tell—

139
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,770
By chance... are you asking me to turn a blind eye?

140
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,480
Yes! That is it.

141
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,770
Nothing is free in this world.

142
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,480
How about this?

143
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,350
There is something you must really need.

144
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,460
Something I need?

145
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,770
What could it be?

146
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,180
You know!

147
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,550
That thing you were secretly reading in the living room once.

148
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,620
Hold on.

149
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,250
- By chance— 
 - I heard "Neighbor Boy Soe Dol's Erotica" is

150
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,650
very provocative at Buyounggak.

151
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,750
You were wrong then and you are completely wrong now.

152
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,520
I never read anything like that!

153
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:38,160
How should I explain this?

154
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,090
You are finally up.

155
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,490
 Did your wound heal a bit?

156
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,990
Seriously, that temper of his.

157
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,470
Fine! I won't go in.

158
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,410
 If you are up, you should eat.

159
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,730
 Do not make Dan Oh worry for no reason.

160
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,340
I guess... you must have your reason, too.

161
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,930
Will you... not tell him?

162
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,710
I happen to have become your accomplice.

163
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:33,110
- How about the erotica? 
 - I said I will not read it.

164
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,370
You mean it, right?

165
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,570
You will not suddenly change your mind, right?

166
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,770
I will not change my mind.

167
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:40,930
Okay.

168
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,730
You are so proper and decent.

169
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:45,220
There is no way you would read something like that.

170
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:50,310
Dan Oh, you... sometimes forget.

171
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,970
I told you.

172
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,880
I would help you no matter what.

173
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,000
Yes.

174
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,040
I appreciate you saying that.

175
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,840
So feel free to talk to me about anything.

176
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,010
All right?

177
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,450
Please just keep the secret.

178
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,100
That is all I need.

179
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,030
Okay.

180
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,570
"Yeon...

181
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:38,990
used her whole body... and lightly..."

182
00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:00,040
"Yeon embraced the officer's shoulders tightly.

183
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,880
He was a warrior on the battlefield,

184
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,270
but he was hopeless in front of Yeon's tears."

185
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,530
Give it.

186
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,280
Give me that!

187
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,960
Was that it?

188
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,340
You have been absorbed into a romance novel.

189
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,980
Well...

190
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,510
This is not one of those romance novels!

191
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:25,320
It is about love that defies class between the warrior and a female physician at Hyeminseo

192
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,030
and...

193
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,450
A kid like you would not understand anyway.

194
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,160
A kid?

195
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,870
You can easily build a well if you combine the tears of the women I broke the hearts of.

196
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:44,130
The well is so deep that it will not dry.

197
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,940
My goodness.

198
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:49,040
There are so many things I do not know about you.

199
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,810
But...

200
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:59,230
even capable physicians struggle with the detoxification of poison.

201
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:02,270
But you managed to cure San.

202
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:05,150
What is your secret?

203
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,130
I just learned by overhearing.

204
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:13,280
All right. Get back to it.

205
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,040
Overhearing?

206
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,910
I heard the king had a son!

207
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,430
The royal bloodline almost got cut off.

208
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,490
What a happy occasion!

209
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:37,370
The former crown prince's sons kept dying off, too.

210
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,150
The male offspring have been so rare.

211
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:42,040
That is why the former king chose that young grandson

212
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,860
as the prince in line for the throne in such a hurry!

213
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:49,800
Although, he ended up getting deposed.

214
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,400
- Drink some! 
 - Okay!

215
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,430
Welcome.

216
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,550
What is the problem?

217
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:33,530
I need to redo the background check on all of the scholars staying at Ihwawon.

218
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:37,480
Last time we checked, nothing seemed suspicious.

219
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,950
The "jade dust" has been hiding his whole life.

220
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,600
How hard could it be for him to change his identity?

221
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:03,140
 Let me know if the Watchman comes to you.

222
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,160
You cannot be out here.

223
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,140
You almost crossed over to the afterlife overnight.

224
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,860
What are you doing here?

225
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,340
You must have a lot of things to do.

226
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,780
I knew it.

227
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,470
Your fever has not gone down yet.

228
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,210
Have some.

229
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:02,140
Do not leave any. Drink all of it.

230
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,140
Dan Oh.

231
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:22,870
Thank you... for that day.

232
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,950
By the way,

233
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:34,390
you should stop there.

234
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:39,950
It would be uncomfortable for both of us, otherwise.

235
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,900
I just...

236
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,580
was worried.

237
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,430
You got injured a lot, too.

238
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:56,400
No more! I do not appreciate it, whether it is worrying or meddling.

239
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,150
It was your first time, was it not?

240
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:03,930
Having someone caring for you when you are sick.

241
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:08,570
Even when you were rotting inside, you always swallowed the pain and moved on.

242
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:12,610
That is why you were acting like you were fine even though you almost died from the injury.

243
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:14,730
How presumptuous.

244
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,380
Do you know that well about me?

245
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:24,080
 Then did you know that he is a murderer?

246
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,730
Let me hear... how much you know about me.

247
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:37,290
 Are you... the Watchman?

248
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:43,430
 Were you... really that scary of a person?

249
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:49,310
If I knew, what would happen, then?

250
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,010
What?

251
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:57,670
I was wondering if there was a reason why I should not know.

252
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:00,340
Your face says you are full of curiosity.

253
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,700
Because it is unusual

254
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,780
for an ordinary military service applicant to get shot by a poisonous arrow.

255
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:10,640
I guess I am not so ordinary.

256
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:15,640
You always only carried a wooden sword.

257
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:19,810
But why did you carry a real sword that day—

258
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,270
Did you not understand?

259
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,770
I told you to stop being nosy.

260
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,790
Have you...

261
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,770
ever killed anyone with a sword?

262
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,000
I have killed countless!

263
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:45,890
So... if something like that happens again,

264
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:53,820
you should run... away from me.

265
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,710
As far away as possible.

266
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,820
Oh my gosh!

267
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,850
Go get some sleep.

268
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,540
I will do the rest...

269
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,440
It is a servant's job!

270
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,430
There is no such thing! I can just do it.

271
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,280
Stop that!

272
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,090
Why did you come so late at night?

273
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:26,980
I was wondering if the light coming in through the window was the moon or not.

274
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:29,660
Pardon?

275
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,990
But it was not the moon.

276
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:35,050
It was you, Najudaek!

277
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:45,300
If you have time to joke around like that, you should go read some more.

278
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,780
I mean, seriously.

279
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:50,120
It is time for you to recognize it.

280
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,710
Recognize what?

281
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:56,240
Just like that full moon...

282
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,380
my heart is getting full every day!

283
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:05,830
Goodness, how could you say that to a lowly servant?

284
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:08,430
What do you mean, a lowly servant?

285
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,740
I never thought of you that way.

286
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:17,010
You are... just a woman.

287
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,990
Oh my gosh!

288
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:24,660
Come on! Come on!

289
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,110
Here.

290
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,230
The Left State Minister told you to bring Lee Seol alive?

291
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:42,580
Yes, Your Majesty.

292
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,490
You had better not be lying.

293
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:49,460
It would cost you even more than your life if you were.

294
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:53,160
How could I possibly tell a lie to you, Your Majesty?

295
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:58,830
Recently, the Royal Guard Unit got ambushed.

296
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,400
Lee Seol.

297
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,440
By the Watchman who protects him.

298
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:10,010
Do you think you can handle him?

299
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:17,210
They say a mountain can collapse if it lacks a basket full of dirt.

300
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:21,100
Your order is like a tall mountain to me.

301
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,630
I will not allow any mistake in carrying it out.

302
00:29:29,136 --> 00:29:32,210
Report to me regarding Lee Seol yourself from now on.

303
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:35,370
I will follow your order, Your Majesty!

304
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:41,180
Allow me to ask you this.

305
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:46,650
If... it cannot be helped,

306
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:52,150
would you allow me... to kill Lee Seol?

307
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,800
Did the talk go well?

308
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,600
Yes.

309
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,600
He told me to make future reports to him in person.

310
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,600
This is an opportunity.

311
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,600
If you wrap up this job nicely,

312
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,800
His Majesty will also reward you greatly for your contributions.

313
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,800
This is all... thanks to Your Highness' grace.

314
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:43,600
Well, now, it is... your turn to keep your promise.

315
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,000
Just give me the word, please.

316
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,800
I will become your sword, Your Highness.

317
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:55,400
Even if that sword is pointed at Left State Minister?

318
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,400
Of course. There is no question about that.

319
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,400
I will be looking forward to it.

320
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,800
It better be one sharp sword.

321
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,800
What is the matter this late at night?

322
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,500
I have an urgent matter to report to you.

323
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,800
It is about a man named Kim Shi Yeol of Ihwawon.

324
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,600
By the way, when are we having the meeting?

325
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,500
A meeting? For what?

326
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,200
A meeting for Bangseoldan.
  (Lee Seol chasers)

327
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,800
We could not talk about the "jade dust" for a while because San came back injured.

328
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,600
Regarding how things have progressed so far,

329
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,400
I just cannot hold back my curiosity—

330
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,800
Later.

331
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,000
Right now, the situation is a little...

332
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,700
Do you have to be so dense and insensitive?

333
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,000
Is common sense something he can learn?

334
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,400
He does not read a single letter in a book.

335
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,400
That was quite harsh, was it not?

336
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,500
You were like a withered leaf of cabbage and

337
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,500
- I hardly brought you back to life. 
 - Sorry.

338
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,900
It is hard to take the greens out of me.

339
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,300
Gosh! Gosh! I said I would carry it.

340
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:32,100
To a scholar, stamina is also a skill.

341
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,600
- All right. 
 - Gosh.

342
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,800
I could not have my walk today.

343
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,200
Oh, my.

344
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,500
You spilled half of them.

345
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,790
There.

346
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:10,210
Such precious meats...

347
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:12,370
Well, thank you for the luxury.

348
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,600
I will go to my room and rest now.

349
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,000
How suspicious.

350
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,200
They definitely have something going on.

351
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,400
What?

352
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,600
Look...

353
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,700
I am a veteran in this field.

354
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,500
I see right through it with my mind reading.

355
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,800
Did you not see it earlier?

356
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,200
Dan Oh had those fervent eyes.

357
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,800
No matter how I think about it, Dan Oh must really love San.

358
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,000
Why would my Dan Oh do that?

359
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,100
Such nonsense.

360
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,700
You are also really...

361
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,400
How are you so ignorant about a lady's heart?

362
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,500
I mean, these things do not come out in books. Right?

363
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,800
Look how excited you are.

364
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,200
You are jumping with excitement.

365
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,700
What do you say?

366
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,600
Should I give you some extra lessons?

367
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,100
Is is burning hot?

368
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,700
I should just not get myself involved with you.

369
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,800
Give it some serious thought.

370
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,400
If this was the state exam, it means you have failed miserably.

371
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,800
Disqualified.

372
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,800
Disqualified!

373
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,100
He was not seeing the "jade dust" here, huh?

374
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,600
Please come back again.

375
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,100
Beautiful, right?

376
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,200
That is the top quality nowadays.

377
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,800
What are you doing? Hurry up and come.

378
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,990
This is how I changed it. What do you think?

379
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,100
I think it will be all right.

380
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,700
How much capital do we have left?

381
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,300
Do not worry about that.

382
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:01,100
I already had a word sent to the elder.

383
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,800
I have been wondering ever since, but who is this elder, whom you speak of?

384
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,500
He must have quite the power if he can afford a place like this for us.

385
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,100
I have not met him in person, either.

386
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,100
We always communicate through letters.

387
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,400
I must meet him in person.

388
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,100
Even small loopholes become variables prior to the completion of great work.

389
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,600
What is the matter this time?

390
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:37,700
Did you get injured or... do you plan to get injured?

391
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,600
Both.

392
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:45,300
I hope it is not the case this time.

393
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,910
There is someone I need you to look into.

394
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:55,100
Who is it?

395
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,800
Chief Administrator of Hanseongbu, Jang Tae Hwa.

396
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,000
Everything about him, including his personal life at home.

397
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,200
I saw there was a pond in Ihwawon.

398
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,600
We will communicate there.

399
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,630
Scholar Sir...

400
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,900
I get to meet you again like this.

401
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,500
Thank you so much for last time.

402
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,570
I heard you are staying at Ihwawon.

403
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,300
Did you look into my background?

404
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,100
You are the first man to me, are you not?

405
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,900
You even helped me spend my first night.

406
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,800
I am honored beyond my means.

407
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,300
So do not pay attention to me.

408
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:49,000
This humble woman has always been paying back both favors and revenge in my life.

409
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,800
- Therefore, to you as well— 
 - Have I made an enemy of you?

410
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,100
If I did, I apologize.

411
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,000
The name is Ban Ya.

412
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,300
Please seek me any time should the need arise.

413
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,100
I would like to pay back the favor.

414
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,500
Are you... feeling better?

415
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,100
Yes, more or less.

416
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,200
Seeing how you are roaming around like this,

417
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,700
you seem to be way better than before.

418
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:43,200
You said you are looking for a way to win without slashing.

419
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,000
I guess you could not reach it in the end?

420
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,400
I had taken quite a liking to your statement.

421
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,500
Since it was reckless and idealistic.

422
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,100
Are men of letters all like that?

423
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,400
Skip the pleasantries and state your business.

424
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,900
How I ended up getting injured...

425
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:08,000
- Is that what you want to know? 
 - No.

426
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,400
Such things do not matter to me.

427
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,800
Not that I care.

428
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,200
However,

429
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,600
if Dan Oh gets hurt because of you...

430
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:23,100
I will be very curious, then.

431
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,950
About who you are.

432
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:32,900
It sounds like a warning for some reason.

433
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,730
You catch on fast.

434
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:36,580
As I thought.

435
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:53,120
 Brother, I am coming in.

436
00:40:56,790 --> 00:41:02,770
Brother S-Shi Yeol said you needed to have the medicine applied.

437
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:06,900
Just... leave it there and go.

438
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:11,100
- It will be difficult to do it yourself. 
 - Just leave it there and go.

439
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,390
Well, then. You can give it a try.

440
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:16,790
♫  Beyond countless stars, blindingly next to me  ♫

441
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:24,250
♫  After staying up this night filled with shy smiles  ♫

442
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,490
♫  You're glimmering in my eyes  ♫

443
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:30,200
The wound is deeper than I thought.

444
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,870
Until you are completely healed, I will—

445
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:37,400
Wh-What I was saying is...

446
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,990
I have the duty as the innkeeper.

447
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:43,140
Also, I cannot ignore a wounded person.

448
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:51,380
I mean, I have nothing to say if you just say this is it.

449
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,970
Just be quiet and do it.

450
00:42:53,970 --> 00:43:01,480
♫  When I'm walking for countless nights, 
 the star that shines on me  ♫

451
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,790
Ow, that hurts.

452
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:16,420
♫  Melting in again, baby your love  ♫

453
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,400
♫  Drowning in my imagination, dazzles my eyes  ♫

454
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,620
♫  Dazzles my eyes, like the sunlight  ♫

455
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:27,000
♫  Lost in a dream that is you  ♫

456
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,880
♫  When I'm walking for countless nights  ♫

457
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,640
♫  The star that shines on me  ♫

458
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:42,430
♫  Whenever it may be, let me be with you  ♫

459
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:17,600
I forgot to have the paper screen replaced.

460
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,860
I am all over the place lately.

461
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,100
It is okay.

462
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:24,160
I will have it replaced soon. Come and eat first.

463
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,020
J-Just... let it be.

464
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,940
But it will be cold at night.

465
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:30,900
It is summer right now.

466
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,900
All right, then.

467
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:36,580
Something is... going on lately, right?

468
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:39,080
What do you mean? Nothing is going on.

469
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,980
I heard from Najudaek.

470
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:45,930
That we might have to leave Ihwawon.

471
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:48,190
Do not worry, Sister.

472
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:49,960
I will take care of it.

473
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,400
Do not do that anymore.

474
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,260
- Sister... 
 - Just to protect me...

475
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,970
I do not wish for you to be in danger.

476
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:58,460
It is nothing like that.

477
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:02,420
- This time around... 
 - If you keep doing as you please...

478
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,770
I also have my means.

479
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:10,280
I cannot help but go to Chief Administrator Jang myself.

480
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:15,760
- I must tell him I am still alive— 
 - Sister, how could you say such things?

481
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:21,070
- We went through so much to save you from that man— 
 - Did I ask to be saved?

482
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,340
I never wished for this.

483
00:45:52,770 --> 00:46:02,120
♫  My love takes gentle steps towards me  ♫

484
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:12,130
♫  In her breezy steps, only her scent lingers  ♫

485
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,070
 Why did you come so late?

486
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:19,700
 Did you put on some flowery makeup since I asked you out to see the flowers?

487
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,950
 I was going to give you this.

488
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,890
 Su, for life, huh?

489
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:31,400
 This ornament will protect you, Dear Husband.

490
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,970
 So please do not get hurt.

491
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:37,400
 "Dear Husband"?

492
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:45,030
 We will be married soon, so I need to start getting used to it.

493
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:53,370
This is the security deposit.

494
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:56,303
When the ship departs, you need to give me twice more.

495
00:47:56,303 --> 00:47:58,233
I will do just that.

496
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:06,760
Since we have established a connection, could you treat me to a bowl of rice wine?

497
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,710
Sure, I can.

498
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:15,510
What on Earth are you trying to do?

499
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:19,950
Will you really leave for the Qing Dynasty?

500
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:21,450
Yes.

501
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:24,110
I am going to run away, given the chance.

502
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:28,810
I wish for no one to get hurt.

503
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:38,750
I really wish for that... this time around.

504
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,950
Gosh, the elder was a monk?

505
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:52,300
- Why all the way to the temple? 
 - I said I do not know what he looks like.

506
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,700
We will know when we see in person.

507
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:56,010
Let us go. Quickly.

508
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:08,480
The scholars have arrived.

509
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,190
I deeply apologize for the sudden letter.

510
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:17,140
Not at all.

511
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:20,560
It must mean the work is progressing well.

512
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:30,130
You may send letters whenever the need arises.

513
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:32,140
Now, then.

514
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:38,190
Would it be okay to ask you for your name, Madam?

515
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,730
Please take it back.

516
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:18,490
I cannot accept this money.

517
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:23,970
Do you not need the capital?

518
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,140
They said great fortunes come with great challenges.

519
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:33,840
How could I trust and accept money from someone who cannot even identify herself?

520
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:45,390
How are you so impatient when you have a great goal to achieve?

521
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:57,100
Please do not be impatient.

522
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:01,880
Elder will soon... be calling for you.

523
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:04,740
Please let us hurry.

524
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,010
Have you met them?

525
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:03,530
Good job. You may take your leave.

526
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,540
Do you have something to say to me?

527
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:20,440
No, I do not.

528
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,430

(An obscure compilation of speeches and records of major political conversations dating back to Confucian China.)

529
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:42,090

530
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:54,100
How about some alcohol to quench our thirst?

531
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:59,300
I need to stop by somewhere. I will go on ahead.

532
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:02,040
Scholar Jeong!

533
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,620
My goodness. What makes him run so urgently?

534
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:06,560
If I recall correctly, is this not the first time...

535
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,570
Scholar Jeong is running?

536
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:13,670
- How pretty. 
 - That is the last one.

537
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:15,130
My, this is the last one, she said.

538
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:17,230
It is definitely for me.

539
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:22,410
I had my eyes on these for a long time.

540
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:25,500
Could you please give them up for me?

541
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,930
Scholar, you are the one who is staying at Ihwawon...

542
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:31,630
My, what a shame, seriously.

543
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:37,130
What do you say about staying at Buyounggak instead—

544
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:41,150
There you go.

545
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,530
To yield? That is not a big deal.

546
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:47,990
Thank you.

547
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:50,150
Thank you so much.

548
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:57,530
Scholar, what is your name, by the way?

549
00:53:57,530 --> 00:53:59,720
Now, then, I hope you sell a lot.

550
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:05,550
Gosh. What the heck?

551
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:16,200
Even you have a day of getting terrible hands, huh?

552
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,490
One more round.

553
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:21,630
We are busting illegal gambling!

554
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:24,480
Everyone put your hands above your heads!

555
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:57,580
Do you really think Watchman will come?

556
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:15,790
He will come for sure.

557
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:18,540
If that man is truly the "jade dust".

558
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:28,480
Did something happen?

559
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,530
How are things so chaotic around here?

560
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:34,060
Hanseongbu came to bust illegal gambling.

561
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,590
It has never happened before.

562
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:37,950
Hanseongbu?

563
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:40,250
Were people taken by any chance?

564
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:42,950
Yes. We were so scared, too.

565
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:44,100
Even the young scholars, too?

566
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:46,540
They took everyone, regardless of class.

567
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:49,150
That is why the place is so empty.

568
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:13,550
I heard there was illegal gambling busting.

569
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:16,990
Was a young scholar brought here from Buyounggak?

570
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:18,280
Busting?

571
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,530
Such a thing never happened.

572
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:21,330
Please look into it.

573
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:23,970
His name is San of the Kang family.

574
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:26,280
I definitely heard he was brought here.

575
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,100
I said such a thing never happened!

576
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:29,900
Try going to the Police Bureau if you want.

577
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:32,930
We are busy, so be gone.

578
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:43,330
She definitely said it was Hanseongbu.

579
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:54,240
Let him be.

580
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:59,280
Who is that man, exactly?

581
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,820
Is he the missing deposed crown prince's son—

582
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,680
Do not be curious.

583
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,530
We just need to do what we were told to do.

584
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:52,370
What is your real name?

585
00:58:57,470 --> 00:58:58,640
 Why?

586
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:02,970
 We just might end up finding him ourselves.

587
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:05,980
 It might be Lee Seol, the deposed crown prince's son.

588
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:08,770
Were you the one, Brother?

589
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:14,350
Then, you wanted to create Bangseoldan... to hide your identity?

590
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:36,980

591
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:42,510

592
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:02,140
 If I bring this to Chief Administrator Jang, he will be killed. Right?

593
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,200
 Do not trust Chief Administrator too much.

594
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,650
 He will never keep silent about your secret.

595
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:10,800
 Could it be that you think I am Lee Seol?

596
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,830
 Could you make some time one day? I have something to tell you.

597
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:16,040
 Who do you think will become the king?

598
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,770
 Who deserves to be on the throne?

599
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:21,170
 Are you not scared? You do not even know who I am.

600
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:22,470
 I know.

601
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:25,113
 I know you are a Watchman, Brother.

602
01:00:25,113 --> 01:00:29,740
 So... please do not get hurt.
