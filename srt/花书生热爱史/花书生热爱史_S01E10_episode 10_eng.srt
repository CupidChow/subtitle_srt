1
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,850

2
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,770

3
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,090

4
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,120

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,170

6
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:47,070

7
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,410
Seeing how you are deathly pale... Chief Administrator Jang's report was all true.

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,220
How dare you!

9
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,590
You saved the son of the deposed Crown Prince, Lee Seol.

10
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:11,950

11
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,800
He was... just a poor child who was trembling.

12
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,280
What?

13
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,060
How insolent.

14
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,710
I will punish you for treason.

15
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:37,630
I heard empathy is the foundation of humanity.

16
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,690
Even if I knew he was the deposed crown prince's son,

17
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:44,470
I could not have ignored him completely.

18
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,930
You are very much like your late father.

19
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,910
Not to mention your stubbornness.

20
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:59,760
Did you know... my father?

21
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,000
Yoon Won, the scholar of Sungkyunkwan.

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,020
He had been my teacher for a long time.

23
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,950
Your father saved you.

24
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:16,050
I cannot punish my teacher's daughter for something you barely remember.

25
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,880
I heard you run an inn in Jungchon.

26
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,800
Yes, that is correct.

27
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:30,370
You must be more worldly than the women who do embroidery while trapped in their rooms.

28
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,380
Visit me sometimes and tell me about the world you see.

29
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,770
That is all I need.

30
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:53,370

31
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,190
This is Royal Consort Park.

32
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,990
I cannot believe His Majesty already gave you a gift.

33
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,790
You are definitely more capable than prostitutes.

34
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,720
What is your name?

35
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,510
I am Dan Oh of the Yoon family.

36
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,610
Yoon Dan Oh.

37
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,030
I hope nothing happens that would force me to have to remember you.

38
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,990
This hairpin.

39
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,430
I recognize it, too.

40
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:55,300
The crown prince had an illegitimate son other than Lee Seol.

41
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:02,100
If he returns to the palace, he was going to use it to prove that he was his son.

42
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,410
That is correct.

43
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,580
He is that royal offspring.

44
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,090
Are you on the same page as us?

45
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:16,400
Are you trying to rise to the throne under the name Lee Seol?

46
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,840
While I hesitated, many people have died.

47
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,440
As long as we can stop the king's tyranny, I would be happy to take the burden.

48
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,730
So, Head Eunuch, you should decide now, too.

49
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:39,950
If you want to be killed by Lee Chang or start a new world with me.

50
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,770
Have a seat.

51
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,410
I will send you messages through her from now on.

52
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:04,570
Hwa Ryeong, I thought you worked for Jang Tae Hwa.

53
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,210
Were you behind Mok In Hoe?

54
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:13,630
I am hoping for a world where even courtesans carry aspirations.

55
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:20,890
Looking at you now, you resemble your mother a lot.

56
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,720
Do you know about my mother?

57
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,340
Crown Prince was very fond of her.

58
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,090
It is obviously the highest quality silk.

59
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:48,640
Why would His Majesty give you something like this...

60
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,040
I know.

61
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,080
I am not really sure, either.

62
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,510
Let us have a talk for a moment.

63
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,210
I am sorry, Sir.

64
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,950
I did not want to make you worry.

65
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,250
Tell me.

66
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,690
Why did His Majesty want to see you?

67
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,810
The thing is...

68
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,370
Do not try to lie to me.

69
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,480
I heard you have been looking for a ship to China.

70
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,010
Is something serious going on?

71
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:47,490
Do you remember... my father's funeral when I was a kid?

72
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,400
How could I forget?

73
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,640
Since there was a tragedy in the country, I could not even pay my condolences.

74
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:04,000
That night, a child came to Ihwawon.

75
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,310
He was trembling in the dog house.

76
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,100
I let him sleep here for a night.

77
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,060
The child said...

78
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,840
he also lost his parents that day.

79
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,690
By chance, was that child...

80
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,130
It was the deposed crown prince's son.

81
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,340
Does His Majesty know, too?

82
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,030
That is why he called you to the palace.

83
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,500
To question you, who the deposed crown prince's son is?

84
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,780
No. He did not question any further.

85
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,970
He made you come but did not ask?

86
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,290
Yes.

87
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:03,250
He... just told me to come back to the palace.

88
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,790
Come back to the palace?

89
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,080
That is even more ominous.

90
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:16,560
The king... can kill you and your family immediately.

91
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,470
By chance...

92
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:24,890
do you know... who the deposed crown prince's son is?

93
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,000
The thing is...

94
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,450
I cannot tell you.

95
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,420
Dan Oh!

96
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,820
I do not want to escape the situation by lying.

97
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:53,220
Could you please... just believe me for now?

98
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,490
I need to find Lee Seol.

99
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,100
I need to find out if he is dead or alive.

100
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,890
If he is alive, what will you do?

101
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,620
The deposed crown prince's son is my only family.

102
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,840
I cannot even know who my mother is.

103
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,630
Yes.

104
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,320
You are brothers who share blood.

105
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,280
But you cannot meet him.

106
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,700
You might end up fighting him over the throne.

107
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,560
If so, the "jade dust" will be your sworn enemy and... the country will—

108
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,830
I... am not like the king, who took the throne by killing his brother.

109
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,070
Even if I meet with "the jade dust", I will not draw the sword.

110
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:52,360
So are you planning to ask him if you could borrow his name or something?

111
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,630
If Lee Seol shows up after I become the king, that would be worse.

112
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:02,200
He has not even shown up yet. Do not try to pursue it!

113
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,160
I am telling you to just let it go!

114
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,510
Think about it.

115
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:12,590
If the true Lee Seol shows up, who will get abandoned?

116
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:22,570
If I were afraid of being abandoned, I would not have even stepped up to do this.

117
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,500
Dan Oh!

118
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,400
Dan Oh!

119
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,600
♫  Words that may seem too light to you  ♫

120
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,600
I am fine.

121
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,500
You were watching the whole time, too.

122
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,460
I thought the king might have hurt you the moment I let go of you.

123
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,600
You are the one who is nearest the king.

124
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,200
The one who is in the greatest danger is also you.

125
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,400
I have always lived that way.

126
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,700
But you did not.

127
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,480
Is that why... you ran here like this?

128
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,250
Do you know what I am more afraid of than dying?

129
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,600
♫  Those words, "love you"  ♫

130
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,900
Losing...

131
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,500
my person again.

132
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:50,700
♫  Holding you in my arms, forever...  ♫

133
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,600
Do not call me...

134
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,300
your person while looking at me like that!

135
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,430
I have been curious.

136
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,000
You must be aware, are you not?

137
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,600
Of what?

138
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,800
Your eyes and words like those.

139
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,800
Do you know... how much you...

140
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,000
What exactly?

141
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,800
Tell me. What were you so uncomfortable about?

142
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,500
If I made a mistake—

143
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,100
You make my heart thump!

144
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,560
Thump?

145
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,000
Miss, are you busy?

146
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,500
I have a favor to ask.

147
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,100
Why are these apples so pretty?

148
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
Are they not?

149
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,600
I picked the ones with the best color.

150
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,700
If it... grew during the storm, it should have a flaw.

151
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:32,000
How could it grow so prettily and smoothly?

152
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,600
It is making me feel perturbed.

153
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,700
Who is it?

154
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:44,300
Which man is making you feel so perturbed?

155
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,900
W-What was the favor you wanted to ask?

156
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,100
This.

157
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,800

158
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,200
"Yeon Yi Jeon"?

159
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,300
Mr. Yook Ho told me to read it.

160
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,400
He said it is a fun book.

161
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,800
By the way, I did not get to tell him...

162
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,300
that I do not know how to read so well.

163
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,400
You did not say you were completely illiterate, huh?

164
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,000
You should have learned when I offered to teach you!

165
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,000
"That moment,

166
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,100
the officer's large hand... held Yeon's hand tightly.

167
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,000
'Do not do that!'

168
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,200
Yeon tried to shake off his hand..."

169
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,700
 Do not do that!

170
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,800
 Do you not like me?

171
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,200
 You cannot do this.

172
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,900
 I mean...

173
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,400
 You can.

174
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,800
"Although it is too late,

175
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,600
Yeon wanted to kiss... his sweet lips."

176
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,000
That is where you stopped.

177
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,400
What about the lips?

178
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,300
My gosh. You got shy at an important moment!

179
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,800
Hurry! Hurry up and finish the rest!

180
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,000
I cannot do it! You should read it alone!

181
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,200
Gosh! My eyes were tainted!

182
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,400
Miss! How about the kiss?

183
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Did they do it?

184
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,100
Just tell me that at least, Miss!

185
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,800

186
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,200
By the way, Yoo Ha is not in his room.

187
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,500
Did he leave early?

188
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,800
Looks like he did not come back last night.

189
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,600
Brother Yoo Ha?

190
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,100
He never stays overnight anywhere.

191
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,100
The first round of the exam is over. He must have gone to a brothel.

192
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,400
- He did not get a chance to have fun. 
 - No.

193
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,000
He does not go to a place like a brothel.

194
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,400
You do not know that.

195
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,200
Yoo Ha is a man, too.

196
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,500
- He might look soft, but... 
 - Do you think everyone is like you?

197
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,900
What?

198
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:23,400
You are making it sound like I live in a brothel or something.

199
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,200
Do you not?

200
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,800
You even put a courtesan's hair up at Buyounggak.

201
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,800
San!

202
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,800
I suddenly have so much respect for you.

203
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,200
Dan Oh!

204
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,800
You know why I—

205
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,000
Geez.

206
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,200
I was being nice...

207
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,600
I explained it to you before.

208
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,200
That is what you get from a handsome man.

209
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,600
I preferred you over Yoo Ha.

210
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,800
I am having a change of heart.

211
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,800
I still prefer you.

212
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,000
I recognized you immediately.

213
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,700
You are cool.

214
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,600
- You are cool! 
 - I said it is not like that!

215
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,380

216
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,400
What are you doing in my room this time?

217
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,800
How is working as a royal guard?

218
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,600
Will you nag me and tell me to quit, too?

219
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,100
Dan Oh is already doing that.

220
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,000
You will not even listen. Why would I bother?

221
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,200
It would be a waste of energy.

222
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,300
You should leave now. I am about to change.

223
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,300
By the way, the royal guard uniform does not suit you.

224
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,200
The colors are too dark.

225
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,000
It does not flatter your good looks.

226
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
What are you saying? Go take a nap if you have nothing to do.

227
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,100
Do not ask me to sleep with you because you are scared.

228
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,700
What is the deal? Sounds like you were disappointed.

229
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,000
Because we could not spend the night together.

230
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,400
I am disappointed.

231
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,200
The sword was nearby. I should have drawn it.

232
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Your wound healed a lot.

233
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,800
You recover so fast.

234
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,000
Are you going to a gambling house at midday?

235
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,800
How could you criticize me?

236
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,300
You even put up a courtesan's hair.

237
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,300
Hey!

238
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,500
You are looking better than the last I saw you.

239
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,800
I heard you joined the Royal Guard.

240
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,500
Why are you still in Hanyang?

241
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,300
You have not gone to your hometown?

242
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,200
Who is he?

243
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,100
I was his childhood friend.

244
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,000
We are like bosom buddies.

245
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Bosom buddies?

246
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
San is such an anti-social person.

247
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,800
Did he have a friend like that?

248
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,200
Stop talking and go on your way.

249
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,100
Okay.

250
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,100
I will leave you to it so you can improve your social skills.

251
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,600
I am in a hurry. Tell me what you want.

252
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,400
Well...

253
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,400
I am thinking of returning to my hometown.

254
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,000
I cannot go empty-handed, can I?

255
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,600
I spent what you gave me last time on improving myself.

256
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,400
I will contact you later. Just wait.

257
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,200
I will give you three days.

258
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,100
I will talk to Chief Administrator at Hanseongbu if you take too long.

259
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,770
The Royal Guard will be demonstrating swordsmanship now.

260
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:18,340
Start sparring!

261
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:13,420
If it were a real sword, you would have gotten cut by a new royal guard.

262
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,140
You should pick up a real sword, too.

263
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,880
Your Majesty, I am afraid you might hurt yourself.

264
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:52,010
Are you not curious... if his skills are compatible with mine?

265
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,200
Go ahead and pick it up.

266
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:00,340
I could have cut you if you were in a real fight, Your Majesty.

267
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,320
Put your sword down immediately.

268
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:25,430
I should... train with you from now on.

269
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:30,920
It has been boring because they let me win all the time.

270
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,340
Let me do it.

271
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:54,160
You were so impressive earlier.

272
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,160
I never made you upset, right?

273
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,650
Right.

274
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,900
Newbies cannot leave first.

275
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,740
You should maintain the weapons, at least.

276
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,680
Polish all of them until they shine.

277
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,750
- I will check them tomorrow. 
 - Y-You want...

278
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:17,550
- Y-You want us to polish all of those, just the two of us? 
 - Come on now.

279
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,630
We are doomed.

280
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:47,070
I was going to find a room with a realtor today because I thought I would finish early today.

281
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,630
You can leave now.

282
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,650
I will finish the rest.

283
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,180
Will you be okay?

284
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,900
There is still a lot left.

285
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,140
I think you are being punished because of me.

286
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,770
You should go ahead and find a room.

287
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,510
Thank you so much.

288
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,930
I will treat you properly next time.

289
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,890
I am off!

290
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:28,920

291
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,360
 Why is it left empty?

292
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,440
 Does it mean there was no guard then?

293
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:03,370
I never had a friend over at home... since I was a kid.

294
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,460
You are always busy with work.

295
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,580
I should be visiting you.

296
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,900
How nice.

297
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:21,260
I sometimes wanted to chat with others, like the ladies at any ordinary private residence.

298
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,270
It is not a big deal.

299
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:28,290
By the way, I heard you were at the palace.

300
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:30,020
Y-Yes.

301
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,370
How did you know?

302
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:38,100
Everyone at Buyounggak knows that you were gifted with silk by His Majesty.

303
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,180
Why did His Majesty want to see you?

304
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:45,170
My father was apparently his teacher.

305
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,550
That is why he wanted to see me.

306
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,480
That is all?

307
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,920
Yes.

308
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:57,770
I guess he felt sad that his teacher's daughter is running an inn.

309
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:01,370
He does not want to spend the night with you, does he?

310
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,150
I do not think so.

311
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,800
Do not rule it out so quickly.

312
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,320
Have you heard of Jangakwon?

313
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,790
Yes.

314
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:13,310
I heard they send courtesans to the palace as musicians and turn them into the king's concubines.

315
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,750
Yes, that is right.

316
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:19,740
A few women at Buyounggak were chosen, too.

317
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:24,880
 Visit me sometimes and tell me about the world you see.

318
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,830
He apparently gets a new woman every night.

319
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:32,580
You might be next. Be careful.

320
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:49,010
You made it!

321
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:53,640
Scholar Jeong, what did you urgently call us about?

322
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,850
Did something go wrong with our meeting plan?

323
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,330
It is not that.

324
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:00,150
There is something I need to discuss with you before the meeting.

325
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:03,510
You said we'd choose the direction Mok In Hoe will go then.

326
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:06,710
Do you have another solution by chance?

327
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,020
I do.

328
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,760
It will help us overcome the current crisis.

329
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:24,010
I am... that solution.

330
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:44,820

331
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,190
The poster is all over the capital.

332
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:57,170
Everyone is wondering who the extraordinary man is and will not stop talking about it.

333
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:01,390
"An extraordinary man will show up in the year 1408."

334
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,320
Lee Seol is about to show himself to the world.

335
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,800
Are you done getting ready?

336
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:19,700
Is this really okay?

337
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,580
I am afraid someone might recognize me...

338
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:31,520
While you were trapped in the annex, the world outside the fence changed a lot.

339
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:36,990
People would just think of you as a pretty man.

340
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:41,220
Also, you said you wanted to help Dan Oh.

341
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,050
I did...

342
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,730
Okay. What should we do, then?

343
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:49,830
I will just do what you want to do.

344
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:56,000
A scholar cannot break his promise.

345
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,650
They say the extraordinary man is the deposed crown prince's son.

346
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:02,100
He was alive?

347
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,410
The thing is...

348
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:10,190
You will dip your nose in the soup at this rate.

349
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:12,420
Put your head up.

350
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:16,030
It is more crowded than I thought.

351
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,340
The market is not even here today.

352
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:21,010
This is how they get customers.

353
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:25,130
There are a lot of exam takers here because this is at the entrance of Jungchon.

354
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,310
Let us drink rice wine first.

355
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:32,050
I should relax a bit.

356
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,720
I did not know you drank.

357
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,620
I do sometimes whenever I feel lonely.

358
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,070
Dan Oh does not know about it.

359
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,570

360
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:07,920
I finally found the home I longed for in this cold and bitter Hanyang.

361
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,950
You must have found a decent place to stay, huh?

362
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:14,490
They give you breakfast and dinner,

363
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:21,080
do all the cleaning for you, and the rent is unspeakably cheap.

364
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,340
I guess you can say it feels like a mother's warm love,

365
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:28,490
even considerate of scholars' financial situations?

366
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:30,870
Just how cheap is the rent?

367
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:32,620
- A whopping amount of... 
 - Amount of?

368
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,600
- An amount of... 
 - Amount of?

369
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,330
Three nyang per month.

370
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,130
Three nyang?

371
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,830
Just where is this place?

372
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:46,230
This place that feels... just like home?

373
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:56,520
 I'm telling you. They make breakfast and dinner for you.

374
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,230
 Is it really true it only costs three nyang?

375
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,510
 It is on the outskirts of Jungchon.

376
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,100
 That's why it's a little cheap.

377
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,080
 I see.

378
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,670
What is the matter, Sir?

379
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,310
Have you spotted a suspicious person?

380
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,470
It is nothing.

381
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:15,100
He just resembles someone.

382
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:19,540
There's no way.

383
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,770
Let's go.

384
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:27,400
If you give the place a try, you won't regret it.

385
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,980
Thank you.

386
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,770
Even today, I looked at so many places, but the rent is so expensive.

387
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:35,060
Let us go and see the place instead of talking about it here.

388
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,540
Whoa, that would be great.

389
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,170
Did you get married?

390
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,900
No, not yet.

391
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,800
Do not go there.

392
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,630
Unless you're trying to marry a ghost.

393
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,120
A ghost?

394
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,690
A maiden ghost lives there.

395
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:01,510
She waits for men day and night. A wicked virgin ghost.

396
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,460
Do you believe that absurd rumor?

397
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,810
It is not a rumor.

398
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,500
Some rumors say that place's oldest daughter—

399
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:11,010
Let's not... talk so lightly about a precious daughter of a family.

400
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:14,700
You should also forget it if you are not interested.

401
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,530
What a fragile being of a man.

402
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,700
Let us go.

403
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:23,960
From what I see... you are not the maiden ghost's type.

404
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,540
So do not get scared—

405
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,580
This means it is all true.

406
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,510
I am fine.

407
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,980
Why do you not ask, Scholar Kim?

408
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,360
About what?

409
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,890
About why I hide away in the annex and live on as a maiden ghost.

410
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,790
I did not like it.

411
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:06,990
People asking me about a past I do not want to talk about and talking about it carelessly.

412
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:12,290
Therefore, I thought it must be the same for you.

413
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:17,620
Do you also have... such a painful past, Scholar Kim?

414
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:23,260
The night is cold.

415
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,690
 What a dimwit you are.

416
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:26,400
 You called Hong Joo even to this place?

417
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,650
 She will become your daughter-in-law, Father.

418
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:32,310
 Please look favorably upon her.

419
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,260
 Thank you for the food, Lady Hong Joo.

420
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,660
 Thank you for the food!

421
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:52,050
 - My. 
 - Let's eat.

422
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,400
 Hey, did you see that?

423
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,540
There will soon be a use for Six Swords.

424
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,170
Do your best in training them.

425
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:20,670
Yes, Sir.

426
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,250
Here! I found it!

427
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,870
Your name, Brother!

428
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,330
Right here. It's here.

429
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:39,910
Yes, I saw it, too.

430
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,760
How fortunate.

431
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,160
Honestly, I thought you did terribly on the exam.

432
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,140
Since you have been acting strange lately.

433
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,280
I have my reasons.

434
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,270
Anyhow, what about Mr. Yook Ho?

435
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,930
Do not be disheartened.

436
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,610
It is not like this is your first time failing.

437
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:06,730
It's there.

438
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:09,620
My name is there.

439
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,110
Wh-Where?

440
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:14,310
- Gosh... 
 - Are you sure it is not a hallucination?

441
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:18,390
He's right!

442
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,970
Yook Yook Ho!

443
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:23,920
- It's right here! 
 - Oh, my goodness!

444
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,190
Yook Ho...

445
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,380
Yook Yook Ho... Yook Yook Ho...

446
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,330
Yook Yook Ho... Yook Yook Ho...

447
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:34,490
Yook Yook—

448
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,780
Oh my! Goodness, Sir!

449
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:40,320
You need to get at least appointed before you die!

450
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,660
You are one foot away from your goal!

451
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,190
Goodness!  There, there.

452
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,170
Come and stand up.

453
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:53,800
You can do anything from now on.

454
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,310
You are the one who said it.

455
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,940
You said I could do anything!

456
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,520
Thank you.

457
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,570
This is all thanks to you, Najudaek!

458
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,810
Thank you.

459
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,470
Thank you!

460
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:16,120
Today's dinner needs to be a grand feast.

461
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,930
When will such a joyous day ever come again?

462
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:23,300
It would multiply my joy if Shi Yeol came to his senses!

463
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,450
Seriously.

464
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:27,100
What would he be doing today, and where?

465
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,800
Would he be gambling?

466
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,410
Whom might you be?

467
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:28,460
I can tell from seeing your face.

468
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,450
Pardon?

469
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:33,100
You are bored because there is nothing at stake.

470
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:38,620
At times like this, thinking about what to bet gives you a fighting spirit.

471
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,620
I have a lot in my possession.

472
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:43,210
What will you be betting?

473
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:47,690
Will you bet Ihwawon?

474
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,930
I am joking.

475
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:04,440
Go ahead and try to beat me. I will reward you greatly.

476
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,380
In that case...

477
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,100
I will risk my life with this move.

478
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:19,500
You are coming too deep into my territory.

479
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,800
Be careful.

480
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:26,200
You cannot win without... going deep into your enemy's camp.

481
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,100
I have lost.

482
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,200
It has been fun.

483
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,200
 What's she so happily smiling for?

484
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,100
Royal Guard shall escort this girl to her home today.

485
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

486
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,790
I will see you again, then.

487
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,100
Kang San, you go ahead.

488
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:15,100
- You may take an early leave as well. 
 - Yes, Chief Royal Guard.

489
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,600
Your Majesty... there are posters within the capital.

490
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,300
The deposed crown prince's son is closing in from all directions.

491
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,300
Why do you only keep a watch on Yoon Dan Oh?

492
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:39,000
She is not a girl who can be easily threatened.

493
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,300
She said she does not regret saving the deposed crown prince's son.

494
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,700
So audaciously in front of my face.

495
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:50,800
However, that child surely knows something about the "jade dust".

496
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,900
That must be why he would be afraid.

497
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:57,600
The more Yoon Dan Oh, that wench, becomes closer to me...

498
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,500
Just wait this one out.

499
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:03,900
Eventually, Lee Seol will end up seeking that girl out on his own.

500
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:07,100
Watchman might act first.

501
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,700
If he kills Yoon Dan Oh...

502
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:16,200
The "jade dust" will once again slip out of our hands.

503
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,700
Watchman will not be able to kill her easily.

504
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:23,400
He thinks of her affectionately and particular enough

505
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,800
to give her his father's keepsake, does he not?

506
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,200
And you are?

507
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,200
Are you not Kang San's friend?

508
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,400
Why are you here?

509
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,700
How did you buy a government position?

510
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,300
Where did you get the money?

511
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,300
This lowly one was crazy.

512
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,800
Because I kept failing the exam due to my ignorance—

513
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,600
Only answer what I am asking about.

514
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,600
P-Please spare me.

515
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,800
You are the one who guaranteed Kang San's background.

516
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,800
Is it, perhaps, related to him?

517
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,200
Th-The thing is...

518
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,900
Yes, Kang San!

519
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,200
I got the money from Kang San.

520
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:28,000
It was in return for hiding the fact he was adopted by the Kang family.

521
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,300
Please spare me!

522
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,300
Were you not afraid?

523
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,600
You never know when His Majesty will have a change of heart.

524
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,400
He was not like that... fortunately.

525
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,200
That is how it seemed.

526
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,000
What do you need to talk about to get this much reward?

527
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,500
I only did well on Go.

528
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,200
You were smiling all the time, too.

529
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,200
Go wasn't the only thing you were good at.

530
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,400
Sorry?

531
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:10,300
You were grinning from ear to ear, ever so impolitely.

532
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:13,000
I saw everything.

533
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,100
When did I ever grin so much?

534
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,000
Do not smile...

535
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:25,390
at just anyone with those eyes.

536
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,380
Where are you going again this late at night?

537
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,800
Nothing happened at the palace, right?

538
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,400
Nothing happened.

539
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,000
I was watching the whole time, too.

540
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,600
I'm glad that she has you.

541
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:51,200
So... about the book you took before...

542
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,000
Did you throw it out?

543
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,400
Yes. I told you I would.

544
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,800
I threw it into the kitchen furnace.

545
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,500
No way... Did you really burn it?

546
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,800
- All of it? 
 - Why?

547
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,200
I guess it contains some other precious stuff?

548
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:11,200
Did you, perhaps... open it up...

549
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,800
to see what's inside?

550
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,400
No, I did not.

551
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,200
Why bother when I know what it's all about?

552
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,300
I burned it up right away.

553
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,700
Without leaving a trace.

554
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,400
Sister...

555
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,300
There's a female physician called Yeon who works at the Hyeminseo.
  (Medical authority in Joseon)

556
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,100
Who is Yeon?

557
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,400
- Is she a new friend of yours? 
 - No.

558
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,000
She's a character in a romance novel.

559
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,100
And it's not about me.

560
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:01,000
That Yeon has... fallen in love with a military officer who's at war.

561
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
A female physician and a military officer?

562
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,300
There must be quite a disparity in their classes, huh?

563
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:11,500
That military officer is a really dangerous man.

564
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:15,600
One who may die any day in the middle of the battlefield.

565
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,400
If they lose the war...

566
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:23,200
Yeon and her family might be taken as hostages.

567
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,200
They should not be together in the end, right?

568
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,300
Since they'll harm each other eventually.

569
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:36,000
I do not know whom your feelings are for...

570
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,100
but would you not regret it if you gave up even before starting anything?

571
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,900
You're right.

572
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,000
I'm sure I'll regret it.

573
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,600
This won't do.

574
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,000
I must drink this today, at least.

575
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,400
You knew I had alcohol hidden in there?

576
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,700
Do you think there's a thing I don't know about you?

577
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,700
All right.

578
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,800
Drink up and forget everything.

579
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,400
Stop worrying about the family, too.

580
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,500
Just think about your feelings only.

581
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,200
Just you.

582
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,200
Just me?

583
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:43,800
Here is the fund you mentioned.

584
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:46,970
Your Highness,

585
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
there is a widespread rumor that the deposed crown prince's son is the extraordinary man.

586
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,900
And they say... Mok In Hoe is behind this rumor.

587
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:57,600
Mok In Hoe, huh?

588
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,200
Find out for me who the leader is.

589
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,800
Yes.

590
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:11,070
By the way... what were you so lost in thought about?

591
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:14,400
What could the king be scheming?

592
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,500
He keeps calling Dan Oh into the palace but does not ask her anything.

593
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,300
Lady Dan Oh knows Your Highness' identity, does she not?

594
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,200
- If she blows your cover... 
 - Not at all!

595
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,800
Dan Oh is not that kind of a person.

596
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:35,310
I must hurry the rebellion.

597
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,900
I have a question for you.

598
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:44,600
Is there a time when all of the royal guards are not around the king?

599
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,900
When I read the guarding log of the Royal Guard,

600
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,400
it was less than a day, but about half a day.

601
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,600
Normally, for the most secretive undercover itineraries,

602
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,300
he does have only Chief Royal Guard with him.

603
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,200
For those times, they do not even leave a separate record.

604
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,600
Such a day happened on New Year's Eve and the 15th day of June.

605
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:04,200
Royal Exorcism Rite takes place on New Year's Eve and

606
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,800
ritual for the God of Agriculture happens on the 15th of June.

607
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:11,000
He could not have left the palace to hold the ritual.

608
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,200
Why did he...

609
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,100
I heard the king...

610
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,600
is deeply into shamanism.

611
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:21,600
Are you saying he embarks on a secret itinerary to visit a shaman?

612
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:26,500
The secret itinerary... That day is our opportunity.

613
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:29,000
Chief Royal Guard Kim Hwan...

614
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,000
we can reach the king... if we can take him down.

615
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,600
What are you doing in front of someone else's room?

616
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:55,560
Brother...

617
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:01,390
This smells like alcohol.

618
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:04,920
Just how much did you drink?

619
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,500
Yes. I had a glass.

620
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:16,130
Because I was worried... and full of thoughts.

621
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,040
I know.

622
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:33,990
My existence must be... a big burden for you.

623
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:41,760
I don't know where Brother Yoo Ha is going every night...

624
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:45,560
I'm worried about Mr. Yook Ho...

625
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:49,320
will get appointed in his sixties...

626
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,030
and Brother Shi Yeol is...

627
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,380
Gosh. Brother Shi Yeol is...

628
00:50:56,380 --> 00:51:00,790
He's just one big problem.

629
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:03,880
And what about Sister Hong Joo?

630
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:08,980
Have you seen such an alive ghost?

631
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:11,970
She's stuck in the annex all day.

632
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:16,430
I feel so bad for her.

633
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:25,870
And Najudaek... sucks at cooking too much.

634
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:30,020
She sucks, but she keeps doing it.

635
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,830
Why does she do that, seriously?

636
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,550
You are really drunk.

637
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:41,710
Let us go inside now.

638
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:45,120
Lastly...

639
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:53,260
with you, Brother...

640
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:04,910
This face of yours... is the biggest problem.

641
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:08,560
Do you dislike me that much?

642
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,520
 Do you dislike me?

643
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:38,930
♫  The night sky, where everyone is asleep, starts getting filled with you  ♫

644
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:48,630
♫  Please stay by my side, I wished for this night to come, every day  ♫

645
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:53,110
♫  Even after countless times pass by  ♫

646
00:52:54,490 --> 00:53:03,180
♫  Please stay by my side so I can feel you, even if it hurts  ♫

647
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:09,870
♫  So I can see you whenever  ♫

648
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:15,300
 You grew up in sorrow among regular people when you were a noble being.

649
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,300
 I trust that sorrow.

650
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:20,910
 A world where the poor and the lowly can also work to make their dreams come true...

651
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:24,660
 That is what Mok In Hoe is trying to achieve, is it not?

652
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:44,450
If you stand at today's meeting, you have to live as Lee Seol for the rest of your life.

653
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:47,170
I will give you one last chance.

654
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:54,480
If it makes you hesitant... please turn back now.

655
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:00,840
I will not regret this.

656
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:16,240
Who is it from?

657
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,780
He said it was from an old friend.

658
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:44,530
 Come to the reed field by the West River with money by the Hour of the Monkey today.

659
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:48,590
 If you keep your promise, I will go straight back to my hometown.

660
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:44,760
Did you, perhaps, come to see that man?

661
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:48,380
Your friend who came from Jecheon.

662
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:06,890
San of the Kang family of Jinju.

663
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:10,110
You have been living a false life so far.

664
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:12,400
You seem to have a misunderstanding.

665
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:17,830
If my background was not clear... how could I have made it to the Royal Guard?

666
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:21,650
- My friend must have mistaken— 
 - He confessed everything.

667
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:25,490
What is your real name?

668
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:36,130
Every single man here... will end up dead.

669
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:38,000
What did you say?

670
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:41,840
If you find out who I am, that is.

671
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:45,810
Do you still want to hear it?

672
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:47,400
How impertinent.

673
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,620
You are the only one who will die here.

674
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:53,630
Stand back. If you do not stop from this point on—

675
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:58,310
Answer me. Are you Lee Seol, the deposed crown prince's son?

676
00:57:01,770 --> 00:57:04,070
Looks like you are.

677
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:06,650
You are Lee Seol.

678
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,600
Watchman!

679
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:27,140
Attack!

680
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:27,650
Show... your face.

681
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:32,330
It is an order.

682
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:15,470
I kneel... before you, My Lord.

683
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:23,920

684
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:29,670

685
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:33,840
♫  Melting in again, baby your love  ♫

686
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:37,200
♫  Drowning in my imagination  ♫

687
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:41,190
♫  Dazzles my eyes, like the sunlight  ♫

688
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:46,930
♫  Lost in a dream that is you, when I'm walking for countless nights  ♫

689
00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:49,390
 I have always been curious, ever since I saw you.

690
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:52,160
 I have been living, following your footsteps, My Lord.

691
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,810
 Mok In Hoe's leader stood before the scholars, calling himself Lee Seol.

692
00:59:55,810 --> 00:59:59,870
 I cannot go on, pretending as if nothing happened.

693
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:01,440
 Have everything written down.

694
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,480
 - The things you couldn't do so far. 
 - Why?

695
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,580
 Will you grant all of them for me?

696
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:08,300
 I do not know how Lee Seol will approach me.

697
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:09,390
 Weed him out.

698
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:12,220
 What did you say? Seol has been arrested?

699
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:14,580
 Please protect the Ihwawon family.

700
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:16,800
 And that includes you.

701
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:22,800
♫  I can't stop, I'm drowning in you  ♫
