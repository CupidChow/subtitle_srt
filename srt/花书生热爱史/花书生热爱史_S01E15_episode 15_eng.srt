1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,800

3
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,600

4
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,140

5
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,500

6
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,000

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,020

8
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,000
Lee Seol!

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,400
You finally ended up...

10
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,230
 Your Majesty!

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,200
 Your Majesty!

12
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,000
 Your Majesty!

13
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,200
 Your Majesty!

14
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,200
 Your Majesty.

15
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,900
 - Your Majesty! 
 - Your Majesty!

16
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,380
 Your Majesty!

17
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,460
We need to get out of this first.

18
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,530
I'll draw their attention. You...

19
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,900
Sir!

20
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,800
B-Blood!

21
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,400
Maiden...

22
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,800
Please take just five steps away.

23
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,500

24
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,600
 Your Majesty...

25
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
 Your Majesty...

26
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,600
You should guard His Majesty, and the rest should follow me.

27
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,400
 Yes!

28
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,400
Look everywhere!

29
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,000
 Yes!

30
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,400
This way!

31
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,100

32
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,400
 I promise you.

33
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,500
 I'll return before the sunset.

34
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,500
 I will not get beaten and get to you safely.

35
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,900
- Look for him! 
  - Yes!

36
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,200
 Lee Seol.

37
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,100
 If you defeat the king,

38
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,400
 I will not be up here anymore, either.

39
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,070
What are you thinking so intently about?

40
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,400
Why did you come here?

41
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,600
I told you not to get involved with my business from now on.

42
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,200
Do you not think it is a shame?

43
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,000
Everything you have achieved so far.

44
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,000
I did not do that.

45
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,200
It was Mok In Hoe's achievement.

46
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,300
The entire Mok In Hoe will turn its back on you.

47
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,700
If the truth gets revealed, you will become completely alone.

48
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,700
It is nothing new.

49
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,800
My life has always been that way.

50
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,900
That is why I will stay back.

51
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,800
I should... I should at least stay by your side.

52
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,940
Madam.

53
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,400

54
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:40,000
 Lee Seol will die and disappear just as the snow melts away.

55
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,900
 That day is not too far away.

56
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:16,000
♫  Even if we run into each other by accident, I will find you first  ♫

57
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,200
♫  I can't hide my heart that's about to explode  ♫

58
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:30,800
♫  I will never let go of your hand in any given moment  ♫

59
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,200
♫  Little by little...  ♫

60
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,800
You must have waited a long time.

61
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,450
My heart was already here,

62
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:44,670
but my body was not fast enough.

63
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:48,450
I am just glad that you came.

64
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,600
Since you came back alive

65
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,340
without disappearing forever.

66
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,300
 Your Highness!

67
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,600
 Your Highness! You need to leave now!

68
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,400
 Your Highness!

69
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,200
 We must catch him no matter what!

70
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,710
I will never make you wait alone again like today.

71
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,260
So do not cry.

72
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:35,890
If you cry, my mind which I have been barely holding onto...

73
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,070
will escape far away.

74
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,330
Did you hurt yourself a lot?

75
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,150
No.

76
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,400
Just slightly.

77
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,400
Chief Royal Guard!

78
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,890
How poorly you must have guarded that His Majesty was ambushed?

79
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:33,530
I have no excuses.

80
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,030
Are you done treating him?

81
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,750
How come he cannot wake up?

82
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:47,210
He bled a lot because the arrow got stuck deep in his chest.

83
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:49,550
His pulse is too weak.

84
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,950
We will have to wait for Heaven's grace.

85
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,550
Wait for Heaven's grace?

86
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,200
Try something!

87
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,130
Bring him back to life right now!

88
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:10,530
How am I supposed to live if you leave like this?

89
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,100
You cannot, Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

90
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,320
Open your eyes, Your Majesty!

91
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,110
Your Majesty...

92
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,140
How is His Majesty's condition?

93
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,420
I need to see him...

94
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,130
You are just a chief administrator,

95
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:42,290
but you try to see His Majesty without royal permission?

96
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,850
You do not even try to hide it anymore.

97
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,870
Do you not understand the situation?

98
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:57,060
The sun is starting to set, is it not?

99
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,090
Go back safely.

100
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:06,520
Left State Minister said not to allow anyone into his bed chamber.

101
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:27,520
Left State Minister and Queen Dowager are on Lee Seol's side?

102
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,580
And Head Eunuch is helping them?

103
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,590
We cannot let Head Eunuch be next to His Majesty.

104
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,760
If His Majesty passes away—

105
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,660
With just one enthronement announcement from Queen Dowager,

106
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,750
Lee Seol will be on the throne.

107
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:45,740
Could you give the throne to the traitor who tried to assassinate His Majesty?

108
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:51,110
As long as I am alive, the owner of the throne will not change.

109
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,400
I will count on you.

110
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,110
Please protect the king's palace.

111
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,810
The pouch!

112
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,490
You must have achieved the goal since you seem okay.

113
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,530
I do not know yet.

114
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:40,570
He did get shot by an arrow,

115
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:43,370
but I need to enter the palace tomorrow and assess the situation.

116
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:46,420
You should care for yourself first. Let me see.

117
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,160
- Did you not hurt yourself? 
 - I did not.

118
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:54,390
You look a bit disappointed that I came back perfectly safe.

119
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,630
I am glad.

120
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,160
I am so glad that you came back.

121
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,970
Okay.

122
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,680
Brother!

123
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,880
You two.

124
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,230
You are becoming closer by the day.

125
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:19,870
We cannot call each other brothers, but we should be friendly.

126
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,220
Do you not agree, Little Brother?

127
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,780
He is acting high and mighty because he was born a season ahead of me.

128
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,890
- Is that okay? 
 - I know.

129
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,820
You are a bit much.

130
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:39,190
You are... returning to work tomorrow, right?

131
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:42,530
It would be strange if I suddenly disappeared.

132
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,720
It will be okay.

133
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,350
Are you a warrior?

134
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,250
You have a lot of scars on your body.

135
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,600
I will get going, then.

136
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,360
- Thank you. 
 - Yes.

137
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:28,530
Please do not tell... everyone at Ihwawon about today.

138
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:33,680
Is that why... you wanted me to be treated in the annex?

139
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,930
- But we still need to tell everyone— 
 - I do not want to upset everyone.

140
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:43,870
It has not been long since Ihwawon found its peace.

141
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,860
Please tell me, at least.

142
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,540
Who sent the assassin?

143
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,490
If I cannot protect you, what would be the point of keeping a secret?

144
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,960
I will just go tell Dan Oh—

145
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,570
I am not sure, either, but...

146
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,960
I think it was Chief Administrator.

147
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,170
Chief Administrator?

148
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:11,470
Why does he want to kill you?

149
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:15,800
His son, Jang Hyeon.

150
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,820
He was...

151
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:22,250
my betrothed.

152
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,680
Did you...

153
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,100
say he was...

154
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,140
Chief Administrator's son?

155
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,860
Yes.

156
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,430
A day before the wedding,

157
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:01,980
he suddenly died because he got stabbed.

158
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,830
You could not even touch Yoon Hong Joo?

159
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,870
How dare you say that to me right now?

160
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,790
She had a man to protect her.

161
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,700
It seemed like they were lovers.

162
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:30,870
 See you tomorrow after a long night, Maiden Hong Joo.

163
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:45,990
He was an amazing swordsman.

164
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,000
Although he looked like a timid nerd on the outside.

165
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,240
He was a swordsman?

166
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,720
Has he been hiding his identity all this time?

167
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,820
Even though I cut his arm, he was unbelievably quick with his sword.

168
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:07,960
If he tried to kill us, we might not have made it alive.

169
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,530
He was unbelievably quick with his sword?

170
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,300
Could he be...

171
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,910
What is wrong?

172
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,820
Find out everything about him.

173
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,940
I need to kill him before Yoon Hong Joo.

174
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,800
Yes, sir.

175
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,910

176
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,500
 The weather is bad, but you look happy.

177
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,050
 Is it that obvious?

178
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,130
 After two days,

179
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,700
 I will get married to the woman I love.

180
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,000
 I am jealous.

181
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,100
 I have to be stuck in this temple and study.

182
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,400
 Would you like a drink?

183
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,890
 Here.

184
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,900
 By the way, what is that ornament?

185
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,800
 You have been touching it the whole time.

186
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,500
 It is cute, is it not?

187
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,000
 My betrothed made it for me, wishing me a long life.

188
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,900
 She must be very worried that I am a military officer.

189
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,450
 I even have a big mission tomorrow.

190
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,800
 I see.

191
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:07,030
 It is fascinating to meet a military officer.

192
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,090
 I am just a low-ranking officer.

193
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,160

194
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,900
Red bean porridge is the best on a cold day like this.

195
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,000
Dan Oh.

196
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:07,340
Please find me a small room somewhere quiet.

197
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,300
A room? Why all of a sudden?

198
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,100
I cannot live in hiding in the annex forever.

199
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,900
- If I find a home far away— 
 - Sister.

200
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:22,500
My Lady, are you trying to get a newlyweds' home even before getting married?

201
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,800
Gosh. Do you like him that much?

202
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,600
You are right.

203
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,600
A newlyweds' home would be nice, too.

204
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,200
Did you become that close to him already?

205
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,600
You want to get a newlyweds' home with Shi Yeol?

206
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,300
Why?

207
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:43,300
Do you not like him that much?

208
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,600
It is not that.

209
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,700
I am happy as long as you are.

210
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,400
You have been through so much.

211
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,600
You were always the one who suffered.

212
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,500
I did not think this day would come.

213
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,000
I am so, so happy!

214
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,900
She said she would find a room and move out?

215
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,300
I guess she does want to get married.

216
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,900
What will you do, Dan Oh?

217
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,400
About what?

218
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,400
San, I mean...

219
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:33,680
The deposed crown prince's heir will not stay at Ihwawon forever.

220
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,320
Yes.

221
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,900
He will be put on the throne at some point.

222
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,400
What would you do if that happened?

223
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,300
I am facing too many obstacles.

224
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,200
I have not thought about that yet.

225
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,600
I am just hoping that he would overcome this challenge safely.

226
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,200
Think about it now.

227
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,200
It is time to do so.

228
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:11,000
Why are you suddenly telling me such a thing?

229
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:19,400
I am saying you do not have to stay in Ihwawon for us.

230
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:25,500
Hong Joo found her path, and Najudaek has me.

231
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,000
Sir.

232
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,800
If...

233
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,800
His Highness accepts you as his queen

234
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,300
and says he wants to go to the palace with you,

235
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,100
you should follow him.

236
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,320
We have not talked about anything like that.

237
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:54,390
If you wish to remain the owner of Ihwawon, you two will part ways.

238
00:24:54,390 --> 00:25:02,100
The king's duty is endlessly burdensome and the palace's fence is impossibly tall.

239
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:12,000
Are you sure... you could live without seeing San forever?

240
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,400
The office is quieter than usual today.

241
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,100
Is something going on in the palace?

242
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,400
- Take him away. 
 - Yes!

243
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,800
Why are you doing this?

244
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,900
His Majesty was ambushed at the hunting site.

245
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,000
Why did you get out of your duty yesterday?

246
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,100
What did you do while you were off duty?

247
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,600
I only did that because of my father's memorial service.

248
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,170
Is that a problem?

249
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:13,000
I know that you are secretly communicating with Head Eunuch.

250
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,100
Tell me the truth right now!

251
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,000
Secretly communicating?

252
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,200
I have no idea what you are talking about.

253
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,000
How could a royal guard who protects His Majesty assassinate him?

254
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Sir!

255
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,560
I heard you wanted to see me.

256
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,620
Is this yours?

257
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,200
What is that?

258
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,500
The culprit who attacked His Majesty dropped it.

259
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,400
 What are you staring at?

260
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:17,280
I have never seen that before.

261
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,500
You said you swapped shifts with Kang San.

262
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,800
Yes, I did.

263
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,300
His previous whereabouts are suspicious.

264
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,600
Tell me everything you know!

265
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,200
This is about finding the traitor!

266
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,800
You will not avoid death if you try to lie.

267
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,400
Well...

268
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,650
The thing is...

269
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,030
 Are you sure you could live without seeing San forever?

270
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,050
Kang San...

271
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,840
could not be the culprit.

272
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:33,790
I would have reported anything suspicious to you immediately if I noticed anything suspicious.

273
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,920
There is no evidence. Let us wrap it up now.

274
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:54,300
Left State Minister is dying to blame the royal guards.

275
00:28:54,300 --> 00:29:00,000
The entire royal guards could be in danger if he finds out about this.

276
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,500
Since you got fired, I will not be seeing you in the palace anymore.

277
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,600
Thank you.

278
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,600
If it were not for you, it would not have ended at my dismissal.

279
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,400
By the way, why did you help me?

280
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:39,200
Why did you... not kill me?

281
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,600
You definitely had a chance yesterday.

282
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,200
Because your death was not the one I was after.

283
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,200
His Majesty is on the verge of death.

284
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,400
But no one is crying genuinely.

285
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,900
What a shame.

286
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:06,600
Trying to protect the king, who lost all respect and dignity,

287
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,680
I could not lose my close friend.

288
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:19,230

289
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:28,650
I heard the king had collapsed during the hunt.

290
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:31,860
Nothing happened to Scholar Kang, right?

291
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:35,260
No... but how did you know?

292
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:39,340
This is Buyounggak. A place where high-ranking officials come and go.

293
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,070
The rumors spread so fast.

294
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:44,200
- You seem kind of excited. 
 - Of course.

295
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,920
Now, Scholar Kang...

296
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,870
No, that is not correct.

297
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:55,500
The deposed crown prince's son should be waiting to become the king now.

298
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,920
It should turn out that way.

299
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,480
He overcame so many ordeals all this time.

300
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,170
You seem kind of gloomy.

301
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:09,770
Are you not going to enter the palace with him anyway?

302
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:13,120
I thought you were all ready to be the queen.

303
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,120
But I guess that is not the case, huh?

304
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,100
What did you say?

305
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:25,130
Relationships between men and women are just like this ripe persimmon.

306
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:28,450
It becomes red and ripe for a season.

307
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:33,680
In the end, it is bound to fall powerlessly.

308
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:38,520
Ban Ya... we agreed to be friends. Right?

309
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,050
I think so?

310
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:45,970
Fistfights are allowed between friends. Right?

311
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,510
For friendship's sake, too.

312
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:51,770
It is already so late. You should go home now.

313
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,470
I, Queen Dowager, come shamelessly in front of you, gentlemen,

314
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:04,710
because I must prevent the authorities of the Royal Court

315
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:07,510
and the Royal Family falling to the ground.

316
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,750
It is a lamentable thing.

317
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:12,900
The prince is not a biological son of His Majesty?

318
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:18,230
Royal Consort Park, the wretched thing, has mocked this country's Royal Court!

319
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:20,150
Mind what you say!

320
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,920
Nothing has been proven right now.

321
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,940
Even if you are a meritorious retainer,

322
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:28,040
are you insulting Queen Dowager, saying she is lying right now?

323
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,910
Let us discuss this matter at a later date.

324
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:37,530
It will not be late to discuss the specifics after His Majesty regains consciousness.

325
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,860
How have you been living all this time?

326
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,330
Why do you ask that out of nowhere?

327
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:12,450
No reason. I have been on the run all this time.

328
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,860
I was wondering how your life was.

329
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,540
I was not on the run.

330
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,150
But I was abandoned instead.

331
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:23,850
I lived my life without ever knowing

332
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:27,810
my home, my brother, my parents, or even my name.

333
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,470
While I was losing everything...

334
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,530
- you were also... 
 - That must have been why...

335
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:41,820
I wanted a world even the poor could dream.

336
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,630
But now I am worried.

337
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:49,450
Queen Dowager will be deeply surprised when she sees us. Right?

338
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,160
I feel like I have wronged my parents.

339
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,970
For I have caused her to lose another child.

340
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:58,930

341
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:02,570
The king is still the only child Queen Dowager has left.

342
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:06,600
You are also the only grandson she has. One she has been waiting for.

343
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,960
I am not the only one. She has you as well.

344
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,620
I mean...

345
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,770
she does not know anything about me.

346
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:19,080
Tell her about yourself properly now.

347
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:25,220
Queen Dowager is sure to be curious about how you have been living, too.

348
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,700
I should apologize to her first.

349
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,390
Though I am not sure if she will take it.

350
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,360
Indeed.

351
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,120
This is...

352
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,840
the sword Crown Prince used to cherish.

353
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,490
Yes.

354
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:08,220
It is what Father gave me as an inheritance.

355
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,790
I have deceived you, Queen Dowager.

356
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:15,500
I will take any punishment.

357
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,630
It is my fault for failing to come to see you sooner.

358
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:22,270
Please grant us your forgiveness.

359
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,790
Although you two make me furious with anger,

360
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:35,940
that must also... have been an attempt to survive.

361
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:43,150
Since you stayed alive and showed your faces to your grandmother,

362
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,910
I will forgive you for that.

363
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,740
Royal Grandmother...

364
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:05,280
Seol...

365
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,170
I have come way too late.

366
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:14,360
Thank you.

367
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:23,080
For not forgetting to come to your grandmother, even if it is late.

368
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,590
Please continue your conversation.

369
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:32,550
I will take my leave now.

370
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,720
Did you say your name is Gyeom?

371
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,710
Yes.

372
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:41,110
I have a lot to hear from you as well.

373
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:47,220
Let us... meet again later.

374
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,820
Are you leaving now?

375
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,270
I should.

376
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,870
It was not my place, to begin with.

377
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:30,920
But please still keep your promise.

378
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,480
A world where even the poor and the lowly can make their dreams come true.

379
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,890
The great will you said you will achieve for me.

380
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:43,210
You still remembered that?

381
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,540
I got here because I was moved by that statement.

382
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:50,550
So please make sure to achieve it.

383
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,210
Yes.

384
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:55,190
I will do that.

385
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,510
I leave the deposed crown prince's son in your care, Left State Minister.

386
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:27,390
Are you... not hurt anywhere?

387
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:31,980
No. I am not.

388
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:38,810
Seol... look at your grandmother here.

389
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:51,370
Not even a single moment... was a fault of yours.

390
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,770
The king only...

391
00:38:54,590 --> 00:39:02,570
he only... met the consequences of his sins.

392
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:08,320
Your grandmother is...

393
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:14,330
just so happy that you did not cave in...

394
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:18,970
and came to me like this.

395
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:23,730
I am sorry...

396
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:28,990
for meeting you like this, Royal Grandmother.

397
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:55,530
You seem to be full of thoughts.

398
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,520
It reminds you of the old days, seeing the kids. Right?

399
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,110
I did not know back then.

400
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:12,630
Just how many lives... I will be destroying and taking with these hands.

401
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:20,380
Think about the lives you saved instead of the ones you took.

402
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,840
Yes.

403
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:36,230
I did protect My Lord... so I will soon put an end to this job.

404
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:42,600
That would mean... it will be hard to meet you like this from now on.

405
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:52,400
I no longer... wish to wield a sword.

406
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,100
Shi Yeol.

407
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,400
Are you not hungry?

408
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,000
 I heard you did not even eat.

409
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,800
I brought some sweet potatoes.

410
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,800
He could not be sick or something. Right?

411
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,200
I do not think so.

412
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,500
I think he needs a break.

413
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,200
Right.

414
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,600
Do you not have something to tell me?

415
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,900
I do not.

416
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:02,400
You will be leaving Ihwawon soon.

417
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:08,200
You do not have any plans or thoughts about the future?

418
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:11,470
Plans or thoughts about the future?

419
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:17,890
 She carried all the burden of protecting Ihwawon and Maiden Hong Joo all this time.

420
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:24,690
 Do you think a place where you have to breathe carefully suits her?

421
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:28,000
I do not have such things.

422
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,900
I asked you an unnecessary question.

423
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,200
You should go inside and sleep.

424
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,830
♫  Beyond countless stars, blindingly next to me  ♫

425
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:56,500
♫  After staying up this night filled with shy smiles  ♫

426
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,100
If somebody sees us...

427
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:02,100
Let us save the long talk for tomorrow.

428
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:05,600
Since somebody might see us.

429
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:15,800
♫  Sorrowful heart falls asleep somewhere deep  ♫

430
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,500
♫  Melting in again, baby, your love  ♫

431
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:23,500
Why are you staring at me so much?

432
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,300
Is there something on my face?

433
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:31,800
Looking at you reminds me of when we were young.

434
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:37,100
Your face was pale... with round eyes.

435
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:41,660
You were cute.

436
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:47,900
Back then, you had a dirty face...

437
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,800
and worn-out clothes.

438
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,300
I cannot be clean when I am being chased.

439
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:01,900
You do not... have to be chased anymore. Right?

440
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,660
No.

441
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,500
In fact, yesterday... I paid a visit to Queen Dowager.

442
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:16,100
Did you have a good talk?

443
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:19,400
It must have been so long since you saw her.

444
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,700
She just gave me a hug.

445
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:27,420
She did not even resent me.

446
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:43,600
But is something terribly wrong with Brother Shi Yeol?

447
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,600
Looks that way to you, too. Right?

448
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,900
Something is wrong, right?

449
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:21,150
What is it?

450
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,900
What is?

451
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:28,300
Everything is going smoothly... but you are the only one with a long face.

452
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:34,100
Just because I am your shadow... must I spend my life following you?

453
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,400
Laugh when you laugh?

454
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,800
That is not what I meant.

455
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,200
You also wished for it.

456
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,900
You said you wanted to find your freedom.

457
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,000
Freedom?

458
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,350
I should not have started in the first place.

459
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,600
A mere being like me.

460
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,500
Shi Yeol...

461
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,800
- What on Earth has happened to— 
 - Please!

462
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:10,350
P-Please leave me alone.

463
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:28,490
It is... just one of those days.

464
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:36,800
It is a day where you... feel like you want to kick even a stone...

465
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,500
on the ground for no reason.

466
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,100
I see.

467
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:49,600
You must also... have one of those days.

468
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,400
What is wrong? What happened?

469
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,000
Do not ask.

470
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
You will get your shin kicked.

471
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,600
I will be kicked?

472
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,000
I asked you all to meet me...

473
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,800
since I thought you should know how things will go from here.

474
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:28,000
The four of us even created Bangseoldan to chase Lee Seol in the first place.

475
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,700
Now that I think about it, that was great.

476
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:34,900
You fooled Dan Oh when you were Lee Seol yourself.

477
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,700
He is quite great.

478
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:40,900
I was totally fooled and thought you were the Watchman—

479
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:44,400
Our Dan Oh did lack the sense and the eyes to read the air back then.

480
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,600
I told her she was wrong so many times.

481
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:51,810
By the way...

482
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,600
who is the Watchman?

483
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:00,700
I found out everything but that.

484
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:06,100
I do not know anything, either... about the Watchman's identity.

485
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,300
I heard he is a very scary person.

486
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:11,000
They say he has killed at least—

487
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,300
Why would you discuss death... on a good day like this?

488
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:22,600
More than ten lives... were destroyed by his hands.

489
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,500
That is what people said.

490
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,800
How is the king's sickness?

491
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,600
If he happens to regain consciousness...

492
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:40,100
Could it change the state of affairs?

493
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:46,000
Queen Dowager is preparing a declaration of the crown to declare a new king.

494
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,300
Once the declaration is made official...

495
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:53,000
the king will be unable to do anything even if he regains consciousness.

496
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,100
That is fortunate.

497
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,800
You will now achieve your goal, Brother.

498
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,700
He needs to stand as Mok In Hoe's leader.

499
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:04,400
I cannot stay as Lee Seol to them forever.

500
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,800
It is still too early.

501
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,600
I will tell them in person once the time comes.

502
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,000
Sure.

503
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,600
Your opinion does matter the most.

504
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:29,100
So... did you look into Kim Shi Yeol?

505
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:32,800
He was aware he was being tailed, so I had a hard time.

506
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,100
There is an abandoned house in Namsangol.

507
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:39,200
For some reason, the owner and scholars of Ihwawon have gathered there.

508
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,700
They all seem to be quite close.

509
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,100
Was there anything else?

510
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:49,200
I discovered a physician who treated him while I looked around,

511
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,600
but other than that...

512
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,200
Good enough.

513
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,200
You may leave now.

514
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,800
Wait.

515
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,090
Bring that physician here.

516
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:05,680
I must confirm something.

517
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,770
There were scars on his body?

518
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:14,210
Where exactly?

519
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:18,380
There was an old stab wound on this arm.

520
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:21,570
And he also had a unique scar on his shoulder.

521
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:24,590
It was a small and blunt shape.

522
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:27,930
It did not seem like a scar from an arrow or pick.

523
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:50,860
By chance... was it in this shape?

524
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:53,780
Oh! It could've been from a spear!

525
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:57,980
I wondered what it could be from. The shapes are similar.

526
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,380
Kim Shi Yeol...

527
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:25,050
Was it you all along?

528
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:34,420
 Were you the one who killed my son and fooled around with his fiancée?

529
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,530
If you had not come today, either,

530
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:08,380
I would have been so sad.

531
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:18,560
Did I do something wrong?

532
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:22,410
No.

533
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:33,840
Do you feel displeased because... I brought up my late betrothed?

534
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,880
Maiden...

535
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:46,530
from beginning to end... this is all my fault.

536
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,870
What do you mean, fault?

537
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:52,070
Why do you—

538
00:52:52,070 --> 00:53:00,540
As you said, I thought I could forget the past and move onward.

539
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:04,390
Do you know...

540
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:14,020
some pasts are too vivid and clear that they cannot be erased.

541
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:20,580
Whatever it may be, we can get through it together.

542
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:25,400
We will not be able to be together even for one moment.

543
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:30,420
I foolishly realized it...

544
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,990
too late that we should not be together.

545
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:42,590
Scholar Kim...

546
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:46,420
Do not forgive me.

547
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:50,630
Resent me...

548
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,880
and hate me.

549
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:57,560
♫  Because I have been hiding these feelings  ♫

550
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:01,460
You said you would not show your back.

551
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:05,400
You said you would not leave me.

552
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:09,470
I have become unsure...

553
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:13,100
I am unsure that I can face you and smile.

554
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,300
Are you saying...

555
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:24,220
your feelings have changed?

556
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,980
They have.

557
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,810
♫  These feelings I can't show you  ♫

558
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:36,540
They should have.

559
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:50,750
♫  Because you're my everything that I can only watch from afar  ♫

560
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:57,930
♫  Do I just need to wait endlessly?  ♫

561
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:04,190
♫  Can you hear my heart?  ♫

562
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:12,930
♫  My heartbeat flows toward you  ♫

563
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:18,340
♫  Although it calls out to you like this  ♫

564
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:27,450
It seems we have finally found the Watchman.

565
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:29,880
Do not lower your guards for a second.

566
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,900
His swordsmanship is greater than any adversary.

567
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,220
Please leave it to us.

568
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:39,130
The Six Swords have prepared ourselves for anything.

569
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:41,170
We are not afraid of a mere Watchman.

570
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:43,670
Will his head suffice?

571
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:46,680
Not one, but two.

572
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:51,560
The Watchman is always by Lee Seol's side.

573
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:55,070
Prepare yourselves. We shall attack them tonight.

574
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:56,830
 Yes, Sir!

575
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:03,100
During tomorrow's council,

576
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:08,900
I will announce your declaration of the crown to take down the current king

577
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:11,430
and declare a new king.

578
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:20,620
I leave this to you, Left State Minister.

579
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:28,380
Please take good care... of the deposed crown prince's son.

580
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:44,500
 I hereby... declare the king dethroned.

581
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:19,720
Just hang them where you can reach them.

582
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,260
If I hang them even an inch higher...

583
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:26,580
I feel like the wishes will have a better chance to come true.

584
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,540
There.

585
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:40,940
There it goes.

586
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,250
Right.

587
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,740
I found them.

588
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:53,270
Something small and brightly shining.

589
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:57,480
You were looking for that all this time?

590
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:02,270
Wait... but how could you have found it?

591
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:05,700
I know there was no jade ring in the first place.

592
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,990
Gosh, you surprised me.

593
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:11,030
I thought you had fallen into the pond again.

594
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:16,730
♫  I can't forget about it  ♫

595
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,130
This is it.

596
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,200
This is my future and...

597
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:30,520
my one and only plan.

598
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:36,190
♫  All of our memories are getting vivid  ♫

599
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:27,420

600
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:37,950

601
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:47,330
 How come you are never on my side, even to the very end?

602
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:49,560
 You should have become a good king.

603
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:53,340
 He will have nowhere to hide once his shadow guard is gone.

604
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:54,590
 It is not my job anymore.

605
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:56,960
 I have already quit being a Watchman.

606
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,170
 I guess Hong Joo does not yet know whom you killed.

607
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:02,820
 Scholar Kim, you did not. Right?

608
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:06,930
 I will always belong by your side, Dan Oh.

609
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:08,560
 I will confess everything.

610
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:14,360
 Jung Yoo Ha is the deposed Crown Prince's son, Lee Seol.
