1
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,130

2
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,900

3
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,280

4
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,520

5
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:41,150

6
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:47,440

7
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,160

8
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,270
When everything is over,

9
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:58,230
then... let us do what you want to do.

10
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,860
You said you wanted to travel far away, right?

11
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,880
We can leave to see the ocean, too.

12
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,300
No.

13
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,600
I will set my dream aside for a bit.

14
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,670
Who will care for the people if the king takes a break?

15
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,660
Become a good king.

16
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:32,310
I am sure... you will become one.

17
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:38,390
Dan Oh, do you think I will become a good king?

18
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:46,260
You never... broke a promise you made to me.

19
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:52,660
Including the promise you made as a kid that you would tell me your name if we met again,

20
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:59,150
and the promise that you would return safely without being defeated.

21
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:06,480
I do not see why he could not protect his people.

22
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:18,950

23
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,340
What...

24
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,980
You look like you saw a ghost.

25
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:51,150
I-I am uncontrollably happy that you regained consciousness!

26
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,760
I will bring the physician right now.

27
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,710
It turns out you dared to plot with Lee Seol.

28
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,220
How could I possibly?

29
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,530
How could I do that unless I am willing to die—

30
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:20,840
I did not return... from death to hear your excuse.

31
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:35,590
What do you want from me, Your Majesty?

32
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,630
Try bargaining for your life.

33
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,740
The only thing you can offer me is the deposed crown prince's son, Lee Seol.

34
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:48,260
Will you extend your pitiful life by giving me Lee Seol,

35
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:54,920
or will you become a loyal subject for all eternity and get buried with him?

36
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,140
You choose to become his loyal subject?

37
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,230
Go ahead, then.

38
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,990
I-I know!

39
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,410
I will tell you everything!

40
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,920
Who the deposed crown prince's son, Lee Seol, is.

41
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,090

42
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,550
Dan Oh.

43
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:43,130
Where I belong is always by your side.

44
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,030
Do not forget it.

45
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,790
This is my promise, too.

46
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,690
 Where is he right now?

47
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,860
Lee Seol is...

48
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,570
Lee Seol is...

49
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,340
at an inn in Jungchon.

50
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,450
At an inn called Ihwawon, he is living among young scholars.

51
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,020
Did you say Ihwawon? The inn Yoon Dan Oh owns?

52
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,520
Yes, that is correct, Your Majesty.

53
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,720
Jeong Yoo Ha.

54
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:41,900
He is... the deposed crown prince's son, Lee Seol.

55
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,750
 Who are you?

56
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,760
 I'm Jeong Yoo Ha, who is staying at Ihwawon.

57
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,870
Is that really true?

58
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,160
Jeong Yoo Ha, that bastard is Lee Seol?

59
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,420
I told you everything without telling a lie!

60
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:15,010
Please let me leave, at least!

61
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,520
Yoon Dan Oh.

62
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,390
She mocked me while hiding Lee Seol.

63
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:31,770
 The fake one has to get caught so we can plan for the future.

64
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:38,530
I will arrest them, bring them to the execution ground, and prove how powerful the king is.

65
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,610

66
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:58,030
Running a big inn like this alone could not have been easy.

67
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:01,150
There is nothing easy in this world.

68
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,550
But being the owner of a place like Buyounggak

69
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:11,140
is apparently the biggest luxury a courtesan like me can enjoy.

70
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,720
It does not seem that luxurious.

71
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,530
You must have been very lonely.

72
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:28,840
If so, become my companion.

73
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,280
What will you be doing from now on?

74
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,490
There is a house I inherited.

75
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,390
I am thinking of living there.

76
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:48,050
I am also thinking of opening a small school to educate children.

77
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,810
They must have a lot to learn from you.

78
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:55,810
Since you are not lacking in either knowledge or character.

79
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:00,820
Sounds like you think of me more highly than I think of myself.

80
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:05,110
I will have to try hard to live up to your expectation.

81
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,920
The winter hat was very warm.

82
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,270
It is a goodbye present.

83
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,020
Are you leaving soon?

84
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:57,220
The path will be a bit treacherous and long.

85
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,800
Would you like to... come with me?

86
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,820
Would it be... okay if I did that?

87
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,340
You will be put on the throne tomorrow.

88
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:41,150
So? You want to leave in such a rush?

89
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:45,400
If the master rises to the throne, the Watchman should disappear.

90
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,990
I was not telling you to disappear.

91
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:52,660
I was telling you... to find yourself, Kim Shi Yeol.

92
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,940
What could it possibly be?

93
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:00,890
What is... upsetting you so much like this?

94
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,600
Please be strong.

95
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,290
I need to know as your friend!

96
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,940
Can you not tell me?

97
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,900
What is it, exactly?

98
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,600
I...

99
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,100
cannot...

100
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,000
stay at Ihwawon another day.

101
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,400
By chance...

102
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,000
did something happen with Maiden Hong Joo?

103
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,700
I...

104
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,000
totally...

105
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,100
destroyed her life.

106
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,500
Destroy?

107
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,700
Do you remember?

108
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,060
Six Swords was chasing after you several years ago.

109
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,800
Among Six Swords,

110
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,800
there was Chief Administrator's son, too.

111
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,680
The one whom I killed with my own hands...

112
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,630
was Maiden Hong Joo's betrothed.

113
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,980
 Is anyone in there?

114
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,400
You are...

115
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,400
His Majesty's condition improved...

116
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,600
Did he regain consciousness?

117
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,300
Yes.

118
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,950
This is a secret letter from him.

119
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,100
 Jeong Yoo Ha, who is staying at Ihwawon.

120
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,600
 He is Lee Seol, the deposed crown prince's son.

121
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,460
That is why the Watchman was at Ihwawon...

122
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:32,650
So everyone was in on it?

123
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,400
 While I am searching for a traitor inside the palace,

124
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,300
 I want you to bring him to me discreetly.

125
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,750
Give this to the Chief of the Royal Guard.

126
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,700
We will go to Ihwawon right now.

127
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,100
We do not care about keeping him alive.

128
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,700
Kill the Watchman as soon as you find him.

129
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,800
If so, what should we do with Lee Seol?

130
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,600
He is also at Ihwawon.

131
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,800
If his protective shadow disappears, he can no longer hide.

132
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,520
♫  Because I have been hiding these feelings  ♫

133
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:58,200
♫  The days I couldn't hope for  ♫

134
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:06,400
♫  They flow dimly by your side  ♫

135
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:12,600
♫  I only grow more distant from you  ♫

136
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,000
Sir!

137
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,400
♫  These feelings I can't show you  ♫

138
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:41,860
♫  Because you're my everything that I can only watch from afar  ♫

139
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,330
♫  Do I just need to wait endlessly?  ♫

140
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:55,210
♫  Can you hear my heart?  ♫

141
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:04,300
♫  My heartbeat flows toward you  ♫

142
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,000
♫  Although it calls out to you like this  ♫

143
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,600
Do not forgive me, Maiden.

144
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:19,500
♫  Although it calls out to you like this  ♫

145
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,340
Shi Yeol!

146
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,800
Will you really leave like this?

147
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,600
Yes.

148
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,200
Are you disappointed?

149
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,600
How could I dare to express disappointment?

150
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,200
Do you have a place to go?

151
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,000
I found a ship that goes to China a long time ago.

152
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,960
You raised your sword just for me.

153
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:03,540
All the guilty conscience you have belongs to me.

154
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:09,900
So do not point your sharp sword toward you.

155
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,700
It is my sin that only I need to be burdened by.

156
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,900
Do not try to share it with me.

157
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,200
Shi Yeol.

158
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,300
I have a favor to ask.

159
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,000
Please protect Maiden Hong Joo.

160
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I think Chief Administrator noticed that she is alive.

161
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,200
Do not worry about things like that.

162
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,900
I will protect her the same way I will protect Dan Oh.

163
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,520
You should go back in now.

164
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,750
Dan Oh must be waiting.

165
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,980
San!

166
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,020
Do not end up like me.

167
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:23,370
Do not become a monster and live like a human!

168
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,400
The Watchman left.

169
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,900
He said he was going to China.

170
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,700
It might be a good thing.

171
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,900
He has been living as a shadow, but he found freedom.

172
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,400
I wish that were the case.

173
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:10,830
But I think he is walking toward deeper darkness because he is trapped in his past.

174
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:19,200
As long as I get rid of the traitorous king, I thought I could protect my people.

175
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,000
The Watchman must need time, too.

176
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I have a bad feeling for some reason.

177
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I feel like the things I am trying to achieve will be destroyed.

178
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,700
You will rise to the throne tomorrow.

179
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,000
Do not worry.

180
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,730
Something is not right.

181
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,400
Sister.

182
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,200
It cannot be.

183
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,400
How could someone's feelings change so easily?

184
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,400
I cannot believe it. I did not think Shi Yeol would leave like this.

185
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,400
Maybe he found another woman.

186
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,400
Otherwise, how could he do this to Miss...

187
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,600
Search everywhere!

188
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,800
What is going on?

189
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,300
Why bring the soldiers in broad daylight—

190
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,580
I do not see the scholars.

191
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,910
The inner quarters are empty, too.

192
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,290
There is only one place left.

193
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:17,330
Not the annex! The annex is...

194
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:21,960
You will have to be responsible for this.

195
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,620
Chief Administrator.

196
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:54,340
Please calm down. I will explain it in detail!

197
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:59,620
- My sister is— 
 - Yoon Hong Joo is... already dead.

198
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,160
Her breathing alone is a crime.

199
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,860
How could you say it is a crime to want to live?

200
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,140
- Dan Oh. 
 - I was always afraid that this day would come.

201
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,770
I understand now that it is here.

202
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,070
I should not have hidden her.

203
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:19,280
She hid even though she did nothing wrong. So, she is disgraced and treated like a criminal!

204
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,640
Disgraced?

205
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,950
I have not started anything yet.

206
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:48,400

207
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,580
Why are you both out here?

208
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,820
- Where is Dan Oh? 
 - Sir!

209
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,480
We are in trouble!

210
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,060
The Misses...

211
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:10,460
Chief Administrator took Dan Oh and Hong Joo away.

212
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:14,450
Where to? Where are they right now?

213
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,810
To a deserted house in Namsangol.

214
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:21,090
Unless you, Yoo Ha, and Shi Yeol all come, he will take their lives—

215
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:25,350
Did he... bring six soldiers with him, by chance?

216
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,810
Yes, he did.

217
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:30,140
What should we do now?

218
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,560
You two cannot be here, either.

219
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,150
You know an inn named Choonhwagwan in Jungchon, right?

220
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,060
I do.

221
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:40,190
Go there and look for a man named Kim Chi Woon. He will help you.

222
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,520
Sir!

223
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,540
I cannot live if something bad happens to the Misses!

224
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,530
My Misses...

225
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,310
Do not worry.

226
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,530
I will make sure they do not even lay a finger on them.

227
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,330
Is something going on?

228
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:05,420

229
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,760
Where is Shi Yeol?

230
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,010
Did he not say all of us should come to save them?

231
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:13,500
I am the one he is after. You should stay here.

232
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,710
Dan Oh is there.

233
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:19,290
Will you be able to stay put yourself?

234
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,580
Brother!

235
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:54,060
How come there are only the two of you? Where is Kim Shi Yeol?

236
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,680
He left Ihwawon.

237
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,910
He will not come.

238
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:01,870
Let go of Dan Oh and Hong Joo first.

239
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:04,580
- Let us talk afterward— 
 - How could I do that?

240
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:09,720
Since you are missing one person, you should pay for it.

241
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,990
I heard you were looking for me.

242
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:32,510
- Who are you— 
 - Kang San sent us here.

243
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,530
Scholar Kang San already went there?

244
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:47,620
If Chief Administrator found out everything, they will all be dead. Right?

245
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,040
I am not sure what you mean.

246
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,020
Kang San...

247
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:57,370
The fact that he is the deposed crown prince's son.

248
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,860
Brother!

249
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:49,050
You cannot defeat them with just that one sword of yours.

250
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,740
You should go and sleep a bit.

251
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,460
He said this was the deposed crown prince's hideout.

252
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,740
I am so worried.

253
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,860
Do you think Chief Administrator will leave the Misses alone?

254
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:15,990
He even found out that Lady Hong Joo is alive!

255
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,150
Just wait.

256
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:24,320
If you wait a bit, they will come back as if nothing happened.

257
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,930
I am so disappointed in you, too.

258
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:32,160
Why did you hide it from just me?

259
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,880
The fact that Scholar Kang San is the deposed crown prince's son.

260
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,800
Najudaek.

261
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:40,620
The thing is...

262
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:45,390
Because it is an important matter lowly people like me should not know about?

263
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:48,590
You still should have told me!

264
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,460
My Misses are everything to me!

265
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,760
This is why I did not.

266
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,530
You are someone endlessly precious to me.

267
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,800
I did not want you to cry like this.

268
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,060
There.

269
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,700
Are you hurt at all?

270
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,400
I am not.

271
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,870
Are you okay?

272
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:35,090
Yes. I am okay.

273
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,750
You should not have come here.

274
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,380
You knew it was a trap.

275
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,630
So, Yoo Ha, I told you to stay home.

276
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,190
You should not have followed me.

277
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,600
It is not the time to joke around.

278
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,020
Are you becoming like Shi Yeol?

279
00:27:56,030 --> 00:28:01,730
Did Shi Yeol... really leave?

280
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:04,900
Yes, probably.

281
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,950
Will you be okay?

282
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:10,320
I think they are waiting desperately for Shi Yeol.

283
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,980
I know.

284
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:17,280
We need to find another solution.

285
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:25,610
Will the Watchman really show up?

286
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,060
Lee Seol is here.

287
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:34,340
The Watchman will definitely come.

288
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,580
I looked for you everywhere.

289
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,780
I made up my mind.

290
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:16,470
Please leave if you are trying to stop me.

291
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,300
The situation is not good.

292
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:23,720
The Chief Administrator took the Ihwawon ladies, so His Highness went to rescue them.

293
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,320
But you have to be there to save everyone.

294
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,810
That is none of my concern anymore.

295
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:43,970
I already... gave up on my duty as the Watchman.

296
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,030
How long do you intend to keep us confined like this?

297
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,070
Just stay quiet.

298
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:43,950
Do not hasten your fate.

299
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,790
Will you meet His Majesty for the last time?

300
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,830
I changed my mind.

301
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:32,580
I delivered your secret order to the Military Training Commander.

302
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,290
We will be mobilizing soldiers should the need arise.

303
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:38,620
It looks like I do not need to worry.

304
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:42,420
Since you are working so swiftly like this.

305
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:59,960
I will dictate Queen Dowager's declaration in her place.

306
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:11,550
Who else would be the one to stabilize the chaotic Royal Court and

307
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:16,470
reinstate Joseon to its rightful state, but Lee Seol, who has

308
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:19,160
the trust of thousands of people?

309
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:24,400
Hence, I restore the deposed grand heir to his—

310
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,390
He's still alive?

311
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:56,840
All the traitors gathered in one place.

312
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,550
Arrest them.

313
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,860
Arrest them!

314
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,650
 Yes!

315
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:41,020
Did you wish for your son to die as well, Royal Mother?

316
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,800
- Close down the palace gates! 
  - Yes!

317
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,410
Pour me a glass.

318
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:28,480
I could not even go to work today. I will just drink my day away.

319
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,020
Did they block the palace gates, so you could not even go to work?

320
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,680
I have been a royal physician for many years now.

321
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,360
But this is the first.

322
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,410
There must be havoc in the palace or something.

323
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,970
I will bring you some more food.

324
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:58,190
 This is Ban Ya. Please excuse me for a moment.

325
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,090
You seem to be in a hurry.

326
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,550
What is wrong?

327
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,750
I heard they closed the palace gates.

328
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:15,550
I was wondering if you knew anything, Hostess.

329
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,100
Did Chief Administrator want you to probe me this time?

330
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,620
It is not like that.

331
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,920
I was only worried.

332
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,780
I do not know who you are worried about...

333
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,420
but we do not have a say in the Royal Court's matter.

334
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,210
- Hostess... 
 - Take your leave.

335
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,360
Right now.

336
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,950
Make a sound, and you will die.

337
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,580
Do not be foolish.

338
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,960
I must try anything I can.

339
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,640
I must admit you have some guts.

340
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,590
No wonder you even joined the Royal Guard.

341
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,660
I told you this, did I not?

342
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,520
Kim Shi Yeol will not be coming.

343
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:23,900
Watchman does not live and die with his lord?

344
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,460
You want me to believe that?

345
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:28,360
Even if you do not believe it, it cannot be helped.

346
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,190
I told you the truth.

347
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:35,790
If he won't come, what can I do?

348
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:38,450
All of you will need to die.

349
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:46,000
Who knows? That will perhaps hurry Watchman's steps.

350
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:50,380
Whom should I kill first?

351
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,480
Yoon Dan Oh...

352
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,620
That wench would be great.

353
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,480
There is nothing you can do.

354
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,220
Do not waste your efforts and lower your sword.

355
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:11,410
The one you want is the deposed crown prince's son, Lee Seol.

356
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,920
There is no need to sacrifice everyone to catch the deposed crown prince's son.

357
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,690
Anyone here?

358
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:33,600
This is Buyounggak's hostess. Is no one there?

359
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,980
 Shi Yeol, I am leaving you a letter, just in case you come back to Ihwawon.

360
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,750
 Dan Oh and Hong Joo have been taken by Chief Administrator Jang.

361
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:07,920
 Once you see this letter, go to the abandoned house in Namsangol.

362
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,290
 Yoo Ha, San, and Shi Yeol...

363
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:13,620
 He said all three of you must come to save those two.

364
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,740
 I beg of you.

365
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,190
San!

366
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,010
San!

367
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:24,850
You are Buyounggak's hostess, are you not?

368
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:27,320
- Yes. 
 - What brings you here?

369
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:29,930
Where are the others?

370
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:31,660
I do not know.

371
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:35,190
Ihwawon seems to be completely empty.

372
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:37,130
You should hurry up and leave, too.

373
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:39,400
It is dangerous to be here.

374
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,060
Excuse me...

375
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:48,740
I-Is there something wrong at the palace?

376
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,030
Did His Majesty regain consciousness?

377
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,580
That is right.

378
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,580
If you let them all go...

379
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,510
I will go without resistance.

380
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,100
You cannot do that!

381
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,840
Please...

382
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,560
Please do not do that.

383
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:32,340
Deposed crown prince's son, Lee Seol, whom you have been searching for years...

384
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:37,390
I am he.

385
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,320
Lee Seol...

386
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,600
You always... hide behind someone else.

387
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,400
I had already known.

388
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,700
Jeong Yoo Ha, you are the deposed crown prince's son, Lee Seol, are you not?

389
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,200
Did you hate me that much?

390
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,400
Enough to kill your own son you gave birth to?

391
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,800
After I gave birth to you, all the days were tainted with regret.

392
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,600
I should have disciplined you early on without sparing the rod.

393
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,400
Not having done that is my only sorrow.

394
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,700
How come you are never on my side, even to the very end?

395
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:49,000
You should have become a good king.

396
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,400
I would still have considered you my son...

397
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,700
even if I could not forgive you, then.

398
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,400
This place is your grave now, Royal Mother.

399
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,800
Please do not step a foot outside.

400
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,900
King!

401
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,500
Just... kill me instead.

402
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,300
You should stay alive and see.

403
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:30,400
The grand death of your dearly cherished grandson.

404
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,700
You seem to be mistaken.

405
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,600
- That man is... 
 - You are right.

406
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,900
I am Lee Seol.

407
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,100
What are you doing right now?

408
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,500
I am also the one who leads Mok In Hoe.

409
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:58,800
I attempted to take the throne with them.

410
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,800
He is not. He is definitely not!

411
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,600
Do not say one more word.

412
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,300
You think I will be thankful for this?

413
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,500
I can prove it.

414
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,500
- The fact that I am Lee Seol. 
 - Jeong Yoo Ha!

415
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,000
Please do not do this.

416
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,200
There is a way to confirm.

417
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,200
If Lee Seol is on his last breath...

418
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,180
Watchman will appear out of nowhere.

419
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,760
I will tell you everything!

420
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,400
Hostess, why are you here?

421
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,600
Hurry up and go back!

422
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:51,800
I know well about Scholar Yoo Ha.

423
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,300
- This man is— 
 - Hostess!

424
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,900
This man is...

425
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,400
- This man is not Lee Seol— 
 - I already wasted too much time...

426
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,400
to go along with your tricks.

427
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,100
Hostess! Hostess!

428
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,100
Left State Minister...

429
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,800
I am deeply disappointed.

430
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,600
You are the one I trusted the most.

431
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:05,160
How do you think I felt...

432
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:10,860
having to overlook your acts of depravity?

433
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:16,810
Although this humble one failed to stab you...

434
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:20,560
someone will surely make it happen.

435
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:30,800
I guess facing death naturally makes you spew nonsense.

436
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,200
I will rip you apart limb by limb and scatter it all over the country.

437
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,600
Will you do that for me?

438
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,100
That is what I wished for.

439
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:46,700
Then, all the people will find out about your acts of brutality.

440
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:58,250
I must rip apart that mouth of yours first.

441
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,600
No, you cannot...

442
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,400
You cannot grow faint...

443
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,000
Watchman!

444
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I stayed alive all this time to see your face.

445
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I must see your true identity hidden behind that mask today.

446
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,530
I knew it was you.

447
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:56,100
My revenge will finally be fulfilled today.

448
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:52,530
It is such an absurd fate.

449
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,000
The fate of Yoon Hong Joo and you...

450
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,900
That girl...

451
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,400
Shut your mouth.

452
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,600
I guess Hong Joo does not yet know...

453
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,900
whom you killed.

454
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:19,300
Among the countless people who lost their lives by your hands...

455
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,600
my son was one of them, too.

456
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,000
He was also...

457
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,300
the betrothed of that wench, Yoon Hong Joo.

458
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,800
Scholar Kim...

459
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:48,460
That is not true. Right?

460
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:58,810
I truly feel sorry for her.

461
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:05,350
Having feelings for the man who killed her betrothed.

462
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:26,800
Stop at this point.

463
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:30,220
I will let you go alive, then.

464
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:32,450
Kill me.

465
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:36,010
She must also know...

466
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:42,410
your true colors, which is no different than a homicidal maniac.

467
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:54,800
Mother...

468
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:15,970
I am such a poor mother...

469
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:19,130
who only gives you suffering...

470
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:21,830
even until the last moment.

471
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:28,350
You said you would be by my side, did you not?

472
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:31,850
We finally got to meet...

473
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:36,590
We finally got to meet like this...

474
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:39,560
You were too good of a son...

475
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:44,510
for a lowly one like me.

476
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:49,650
Thank you for becoming such a great man.

477
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,540
You cannot...

478
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:55,210
You cannot...

479
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:58,020
You cannot leave like this.

480
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:04,540
I was happy every day that...

481
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:06,690
I got to meet you again like this.

482
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:08,530
Therefore...

483
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,180
please do not be in pain.

484
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:13,920
Mother...

485
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,930
Mother, please...

486
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:18,510
- Please... 
 - Gyeom...

487
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:21,380
My son...

488
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:24,630
Please...

489
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:30,280
be happy.

490
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:54,950
Mother...

491
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:59,020
Mother...

492
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,620
Scholar Kim...

493
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:26,290
please tell me.

494
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:31,090
You did not. Right?

495
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:36,100
She is saying she wants to know.

496
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:39,050
Whom you killed.

497
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,370
Please say you did not.

498
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:48,300
Say it is all a misunderstanding.

499
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:51,980
Please tell me one word.

500
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,610
Hurry...

501
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:11,930
I am sorry...

502
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,020
Maiden.

503
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,000
You must escape!

504
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:36,350
Chief Royal Guard is on his way here with the Royal Investigation Bureau.

505
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:41,890
Though my sword might have dulled from the years...

506
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:45,010
would my resourcefulness have become rusty, too?

507
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:57,500
Dan Oh, take Maiden Hong Joo with you and go.

508
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,890
No.

509
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:01,820
I do not want to. What about you, then?

510
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:10,050
I will bring everyone and follow you soon.

511
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:23,430
Sister...

512
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:24,930
Sister, we must go.

513
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:27,600
Come. Sister!

514
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,360
We must go now. Let us hurry and go.

515
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:26,010
Go ahead.

516
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:27,690
We do not have time for this.

517
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:31,710
- If we do not go now, we will all— 
 - They think I am Lee Seol.

518
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:36,350
If I get caught... they will not pursue you that hard.

519
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:38,790
What kind of nonsense is that?

520
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:41,700
I will be the one to get caught. Hurry up and stand up.

521
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:45,330
The king will believe it without a doubt, too...

522
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:47,490
that I am Lee Seol.

523
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:49,360
Yoo Ha...

524
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:04,280
There is no time. Hurry!

525
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:08,930
Let us go.

526
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:10,930
We must go.

527
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:39,660
Go ahead.

528
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:40,780
Jeong Yoo Ha...

529
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:43,830
Please take care of Hostess' corpse.

530
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:46,240
I beg of you.

531
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,840
This is not right. It is absurd.

532
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,200
- Hurry up and— 
 - Make sure to survive.

533
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,500
It is right for you to live for the future.

534
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:57,200
I have no intention of achieving anything by sacrificing you.

535
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,880
- So please... 
 - Come and save me.

536
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,270
I will be waiting.

537
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,080
- We can do that. 
 - Jeong Yoo Ha!

538
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,310
You must go!

539
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:11,020
If you wait any longer, we will all die!

540
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:40,350
What about Brother Yoo Ha?

541
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,510
Let's go.

542
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:09,920
You came to get me, did you not?

543
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,550
Hurry up and try arresting me!

544
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:39,970

545
00:59:48,490 --> 00:59:50,360

546
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,010
 Run your mouth all you want.

547
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:55,290
 Your voice will not reach anyone.

548
00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:58,740
 I will save him. I must save him no matter what.

549
00:59:58,740 --> 00:59:59,920
 You disgust me.

550
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:03,500
 How much blood did you shed with the hands you used to hold mine?

551
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,530
-  Dan Oh, please...  
  - I will not hold you back.

552
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:07,760
 So please do not tell me to leave.

553
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,490
 What are you going to do to the deposed crown prince's son?

554
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:14,620
 I will decorate the finale by beheading the deposed crown prince's son, Lee Seol.

555
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:17,510
 Even if I die, my brother lives.

556
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:20,790
 He will surely take down the king.
