1
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,950

2
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,000

3
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,420

4
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,610

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,130

6
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:46,370

7
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,830
Proceed with the execution!

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,030

9
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,310
Protect His Majesty!

10
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,840
Protect His Majesty!

11
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,550
Over there! Chase him!

12
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,210
It's a coup!

13
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,100
A coup is happening right now!

14
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,940
It's a coup! A coup is happening!

15
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,090
Hundreds of soldiers apparently passed the fortress wall.

16
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,220
They will come to the palace in no time!

17
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,440
Please hide away for now.

18
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,530
Even the deposed crown prince's son's men are all over the palace.

19
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,620
Even if I go, I will have him killed, at least.

20
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,090
Move!

21
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,900
Your Majesty!

22
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,050
Move!

23
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,340
How dare you get involved?

24
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,550
Hurry up and run.

25
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,470
Slash us first. Otherwise, you will not reach him.

26
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,170
- Protect His Majesty! 
  - Yes!

27
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,460
- Let go! 
 - You must hide, Your Majesty!

28
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,760
Protect His Majesty!

29
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,710
Let go!

30
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,060
- Protect His Majesty! 
 - Let go!

31
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,410
Are you all right?

32
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,060
That way!

33
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,520
The traitor went that way!

34
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,440
It is a losing fight for you now!

35
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,280
An army to remove the deposed king will arrive soon.

36
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,390
Did you join the traitor's side? I favored you so much.

37
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:46,480
The deposed king... should step down from the throne.

38
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,190
Shut up!

39
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:53,230
I will not give the throne to Lee Seol even if I have to die on it.

40
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,280
His Majesty, let us go.

41
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,760
I will take care of the rest.

42
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,620
Your Majesty.

43
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,820

44
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,600
You should hide.

45
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,430
I will take Scholar Yoon with me.

46
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,550
Are you okay?

47
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,640
I am totally fine. Do not worry.

48
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,120
Royal Grandmother...

49
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,820
You should hide, for now, Your Highness.

50
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:47,210
We overcame a crisis, but we cannot do this without the help from the army.

51
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,610
The army will arrive soon.

52
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,390
The owner of Ihwawon agreed to help with opening the palace gate.

53
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,980
Is Dan Oh here?

54
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,400
Yoon Dan Oh.

55
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,210
What is that girl doing here?

56
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,460
Catch her right now!

57
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,800
- Chase her! 
  - Yes!

58
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,380
Look!  What are you doing?

59
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,110
Over there!

60
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,890
Kang San.

61
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:05,580
I did not like the look in your eyes from the beginning.

62
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:10,610
Did you join the Royal Guard to start a coup?

63
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,980
It is not a coup.

64
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,990
I am here to reclaim my place.

65
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,990
I...

66
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,580
I am Lee Seol.

67
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,800
If you are Lee Seol, who is the one who was arrested?

68
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,990
Answer me right now!

69
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,950
What are you conspiring, exactly?

70
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,760
The king has been caught in a trap.

71
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:50,190
He is causing his own death, trying to kill Lee Seol.

72
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:54,190
Whether you are saying the truth or not,

73
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,980
I have no reason to let you live anymore.

74
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,390
Are you okay?

75
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,510
Let us go.

76
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,140
It is okay.

77
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,580
It is okay as long as you are safe.

78
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,500
Queen Dowager and the deposed crown prince's son are safe.

79
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,630
Well done.

80
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,730
Let us find the king first, as planned.

81
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,570
Let us do that.

82
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:59,430
As long as the army enters the palace, we can definitely win.

83
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,820
Dan Oh.

84
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,790
You will have to open the palace gate using the written declaration.

85
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,190
Yes, I will.

86
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,330
They must have missed Yoon Dan Oh.

87
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,550
What is going on, anyway?

88
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:22,000
Did the geumgun not chase after the traitor? Have they not caught him yet? 
  (Geumgun- Imperial Army, bodyguards and guards who protect the court and the king)

89
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,500
Your Majesty,

90
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,690
I think there is a traitor within the geumgun, too. 
  (Geumgun- Imperial Army, bodyguards and guards who protect the court and the king)

91
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:31,430
It is hard to tell who is on our side and who is the enemy.

92
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,160
My Lord!

93
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,590
My Lord!

94
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,710
- Your Majesty! 
 - My Lord!

95
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,830
Your Majesty, you must run now!

96
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,310
You must!

97
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:51,810
Did Kang San... do this?

98
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,810
My Lord!

99
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,310
It is him.

100
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,650
He is, actually...

101
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:09,950
Lee Seol, the deposed crown prince's son.

102
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,670
Say that one more time.

103
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,920
What did you just say?

104
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,860
The...

105
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,100
My Lord!

106
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,370
Secure the gates since there was a report of a coup!

107
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,170
 Yes, sir!

108
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,970
Open the gates.

109
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,580
It is Queen Dowager's declaration to depose the king and put the deposed crown prince's son on the throne.

110
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,940
Where is His Majesty?

111
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:17,930
The deposed king is imprisoned in the King's Royal Chamber by Queen Dowager's order.

112
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:24,090
I carry too much responsibility to open the palace gates based on a mere court lady's words.

113
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:28,000
You two! Go to the King's Royal Chamber and check.

114
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,610
 Yes, sir!

115
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,980
What is this about?

116
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,580
Where is His Majesty?

117
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,450
The deposed king already abandoned the palace and fled.

118
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:56,670
Fled? Is that true?

119
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,540
Do not hasten your deaths by staying in the palace.

120
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,690
You should find a way to survive.

121
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,350
Let us go.

122
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,690

123
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,180
The army is in front of the gates!

124
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,900
What?

125
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,590
The declaration is true.

126
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,570
His Majesty abandoned the palace and fled.

127
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,530
Since we have a new king, please receive his order now.

128
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,630
- Open the gates! 
  - Yes, sir!

129
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,300
The palace gates are open!

130
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,430
March forward!

131
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,480
Your Majesty, the traitors are searching everywhere inside the palace.

132
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,330
You must run!

133
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,740
You have to stay alive for the future!

134
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:55,150
- The back gate is stillâ€” 
 - I must face Lee Seol.

135
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,360
You will definitely lose.

136
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,430
There is no future as long as Lee Seol is alive.

137
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,980
Lee Seol.

138
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,390
If I kill him, the traitors will naturally become powerless.

139
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:20,630
Royal Consort Park, run away with the geumgun and draw the traitors' attention.

140
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,580
Yes, Your Majesty.

141
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,950
The geumgun are moving toward the back gate! 
  (Geumgun- Imperial Army, bodyguards and guards who protect the court and the king)

142
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,820
What?

143
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,800
- Follow me! 
  - Yes, sir!

144
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:13,380
Find Lee Seol and tell him that I am waiting for him at the execution site.

145
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,570
Yes, Your Majesty.

146
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,390
What are you doing?

147
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,540
Do not blame me too much.

148
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,730
I am just trying to protect the king.

149
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,620
Were you Lee Chang's Watchman?

150
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,030
Please leave.

151
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,590
This is my responsibility.

152
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:32,290
Where is the king right now?

153
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:37,250
His Majesty is waiting for you in the Palace Main Hall.

154
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,620
Do not do this! Do I have to kill my own teacher?

155
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,840
You need to defeat me in order to protect the crown prince's son.

156
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,160
Be a proper Watchman!

157
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,770
Leave.

158
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,580
This is the last favor.

159
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,350
Kill me.

160
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,830
If you let me live, my sword will point at the crown prince's son right away.

161
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,400
I am not protecting him as the Watchman!

162
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:39,140
I am protecting him as his friend.

163
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:44,470
So as long as I am there, your sword cannot reach him.

164
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,160
You should finally put down...

165
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,730
the burden of your grave fate.

166
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,260
Open the gate.

167
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:19,160
Kang San, are you really Lee Seol?

168
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,080
That is...

169
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,050
Lee Seol.

170
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,050
You must really be Lee Seol.

171
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,700
Do you recognize me now?

172
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,740
I was circling around you all this time.

173
00:20:55,150 --> 00:21:00,780
Who is Lee Seol you wanted to kill so badly, Uncle?

174
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,110
Does he even exist?

175
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,770
Do you remember?

176
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:15,170
I made you a slingshot when I was a child.

177
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:23,160
You could not kill a single sparrow with it.

178
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:30,450
Someone like that wants to kill his uncle now?

179
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,360
That is why you could not kill me while you were circling around me.

180
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,960
You are the one... who made someone like me...

181
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,820
come all the way here.

182
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,300
Do not get involved!

183
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,220
Are you here to avenge your father?

184
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,520
Do you want me to tell you how he died?

185
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,660
Shut up.

186
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:50,200
He died while begging me.

187
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,990
He desperately begged me to let you live.

188
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:02,170
I will not beg for mercy from you.

189
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,960
That is the difference between the one who became the king and the one who cannot.

190
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,850
This way!

191
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:47,960
Your days are already gone.

192
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,010
I am different than you.

193
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:56,580
If you surrender willingly, I will not kill you.

194
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,990
This country is mine.

195
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:08,210
It is my Joseon I protected by shedding the blood of many!

196
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,080
You are the same as me.

197
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:54,040
You are the traitorous king who rose to the throne

198
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,150
by killing his uncle!

199
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,300
Lee Seol.

200
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:55,370
My name is all yours from now on.

201
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:01,240
They say a lie does not become true.

202
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,840
If I become the kingâ€”

203
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:08,240
You said a person's will changes the world, not his origin.

204
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,990
- Left State Minister. 
 - Ever since we first met,

205
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,570
Seol begged me so desperately.

206
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:22,380
I made up my mind after deliberating for several days.

207
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:33,390
Gyeom, I think it would be good for Joseon...

208
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,590
to succeed to the throne.

209
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,230
I need to talk to him privately.

210
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,500
All right.

211
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,380
San.

212
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,950
- The reason I led Mok In Hoe wasâ€” 
 - I know.

213
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:12,390
It is because you dreamed of a better world.

214
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,780
While I was heading forward to defeat the king,

215
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:25,010
you imagined the future with the people.

216
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:28,370
That is why...

217
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:35,390
I thought I would like to... live the tomorrow you imagined.

218
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:43,410
A world where you can win without killing.

219
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:50,600
I believe... you can achieve it.

220
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:05,450
Oh, dear! Goodness, Miss!

221
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,670
You came quickly. I thought you would arrive in the evening.

222
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:15,410
We ran here as soon as we got the letter!

223
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:18,100
By the way, where are the scholars?

224
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,540
They are all still in the palace.

225
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,330
Scholar Shi Yeol, too?

226
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,600
Brother Shi Yeol left right away.

227
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,440
He asked us to forgive him even if he disappeared without a word.

228
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:39,070
He could just be leaving! Why say "disappear"?

229
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,570
I know.

230
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:43,370
As if he would no longer exist.

231
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,180
You must have waited nervously.

232
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,700
I took too long.

233
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,340
You should go back to the temple and rest today.

234
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,290
Please take us, too.

235
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:15,550
We need to avenge our late master.

236
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,220
As for that...

237
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,590
I already took care of it.

238
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:28,160
What... should we do now?

239
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,430
Survive.

240
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,130
Be sure to survive.

241
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,430
Then... how about you, Scholar?

242
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:30,280
One moment, please!

243
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:46,920
Just... listen to me from there.

244
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,090
I will resent and...

245
00:30:53,990 --> 00:31:00,050
hate you... as long as I am alive.

246
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,280
So, please...

247
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,790
allow me to hate you to my heart's content.

248
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:16,050
You need to stay alive... in order for my hatred to reach you.

249
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,600
Letting go of life effortlessly...

250
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:30,940
is such a cowardly act.

251
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,070
Head Eunuch... what are you going to do from now?

252
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:21,580
After your coronation, I will have to leave.

253
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:25,480
I think my job has been completed now.

254
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,380
You may do so.

255
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:30,110
I heard you were a big help.

256
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,590
I was curious...

257
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:39,800
about what the two of you would decide... in front of the one and only throne.

258
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,500
So is this what you expected?

259
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:51,240
Power is a lot harder to keep than to take.

260
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:57,740
I thought you would fail to overcome that hardship and bring forth atrocity between brothers.

261
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,130
We cannot repeat such a mistake ourselves.

262
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,660
By any chance...

263
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:13,250
do not be mistaken and think you both established the throne on your own.

264
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:21,870
The throne exists because trivial beings such as this lowly one support it from behind.

265
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:05,100

266
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,010

267
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,280
This is the inn that produced a king, right?

268
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,810
They said the king used to reside here.

269
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:18,430
Just imagine the energy this place has!

270
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:25,020
There are so many of you, but I must apologize.

271
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,500
We do not have any rooms available.

272
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,220
Please let me sleep with the servants if possible.

273
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,660
I will pay double the rent.

274
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,710
I am sorry.

275
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:37,210
We have too many people who asked for that.

276
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:45,360

(Placed upside down.)

277
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:54,420
There is a line of guests first thing in the morning.

278
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,640
We'll become a grand merchant at this rate.

279
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,900
You are right. Please bring the side dishes from inside.

280
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,770
Oh, yes.

281
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:15,220
I can never get enough of this view... of such a vast ocean.

282
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,740
Let us come during sunset next time.

283
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,430
They said it is so beautiful.

284
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:23,720
Instead of next time...

285
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,790
there is something I want to do right now.

286
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,620
You should do it if you want to.

287
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,610
Whatever it is.

288
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:37,650
â™«  Melting in again, baby, your love  â™«

289
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:40,880
â™«  Drowning in my imagination  â™«

290
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,180
â™«  Dazzles my eyes, like the sunlight  â™«

291
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:48,370
â™«  Lost in a dream that is you  â™«

292
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:52,400
â™«  When I'm walking for countless nights  â™«

293
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,110
â™«  The star that shines on me  â™«

294
00:35:56,110 --> 00:36:04,000
â™«  Whenever it may be, let me be with you  â™«

295
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:10,100
I heard you are at the top of the class for this year's state exam.

296
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,950
Your loyal advice toward me was well displayed in your essay.

297
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:16,610
I am deeply grateful, Your Majesty.

298
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:21,320
Yoon Yook Ho, I will appoint you the King's Messenger in the Office of Special Advisors.

299
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,900
Please do your best to support me.

300
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:28,210
I will serve you with my body and soul.

301
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,600
Sir! You finally passed the exam!

302
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,270
I did not just pass the exam. I am the top scholar!

303
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:58,150
The proud and great first place!

304
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,160
Najudaek will be overjoyed to find out. Right?

305
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,360
Najudaek!

306
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:07,960
 You are our village's pride!

307
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:14,580

308
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,100
What did I tell you?

309
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,900
If you just pass the exam, I will even hunt a boar andâ€”

310
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,760
Wait! Did you hunt this yourself?

311
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,140
Well, I went and bought it in person.

312
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:39,420
A fresh one from the butcher shop.

313
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,600
I see, huh?

314
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,470
Ihwawon is doing great, and you are successful, too.

315
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:50,200
Goodness. There is no time for my smile to go away lately.

316
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,780
I am the King's Messenger in the Office of Special Advisors.

317
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:56,170
Address me as King's Messenger from now.

318
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:57,320
Yes.

319
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,400
Is anyone there?

320
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,530
I invited her.

321
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,130
Seo Yeon! Hurry up and take a seat.

322
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,790
Congratulations on passing the exam, Sir.

323
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:17,120
Right.

324
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,140
San, are you aware of Shi Yeol's whereabouts?

325
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:26,120
I did get contacted from time to time, but even that has stopped lately.

326
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,760
He seems to be wandering aimlessly, but where could he be now?

327
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,600
It would have been great for everyone to have gathered.

328
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:03,520
Are you still having a hard time... whenever you think about Brother Shi Yeol?

329
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,080
Dan Oh...

330
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:13,570
I already forgave him.

331
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,350
He probably did not want to live such a life, either.

332
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:24,200
It is only because of what fate had given to him was...

333
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,120
too harsh and cruel.

334
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:36,440
That is why I forgave him.

335
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,860
However...

336
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,120
I cannot...

337
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:50,870
forgive myself for...

338
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,820
forgiving him.

339
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,070
I am very glad to see you happy.

340
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:34,140
You seem more at peace now, too.

341
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,750
It is thanks to you who restored my status.

342
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:40,400
It was only the right thing to do.

343
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,840
One by one, regain the things you lost, Maiden.

344
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,750
The things I lost?

345
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:54,000
For example, happiness or memories...

346
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:07,100
The time I spent with you was... also happiness and memories for me.

347
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:28,770
It is great to see you for the first time in a while.

348
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:31,380
Have you been doing well?

349
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,580
Yes, Brotherâ€”

350
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,750
Gosh. Your Majesty.

351
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:39,620
You can address me comfortably when it is just us.

352
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,250
I cannot do that.

353
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:44,210
You are the absolute king.

354
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,470
Right...

355
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:50,240
According to what I heard from Mr. Yook Ho, you two are leaving Hanyang soon?

356
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:54,790
We plan to leave as soon as we are done preparing.

357
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:58,420
If it is because of me, do not do it.

358
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,360
I prefer to stay close to my friends.

359
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:06,030
I do not think that is being considerate of you, Your Majesty.

360
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:14,640
You are the graceful king this humble one has wished for.

361
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:20,430
Therefore, I will not provide any cause for political strife.

362
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:32,340
It has long been my dream... to travel far away.

363
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:36,250
All right. When will you be coming back?

364
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:38,050
I do not know.

365
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:42,430
I plan to travel without a specific goal and stay at places freely, too.

366
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,780
Please talk more with Dan Oh.

367
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,590
I will take my leave now.

368
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:07,520
I heard you got promoted. Are you now Captain Yoon?

369
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,600
Thank you.

370
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:13,970
It would have been great to have you with me, too.

371
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:16,470
How are things going at the Royal Guard lately?

372
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,580
We are all sleep deficient.

373
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:22,440
Since His Majesty even sacrifices sleep for work.

374
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,830
You are really paying back 100 silver ingots.

375
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:35,100
Since the people of Mt. Sobaek are having a hard time,

376
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,810
I will put it to good use in helping them.

377
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:38,280
Yes.

378
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,140
This is all thanks to you, Your Majesty.

379
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,460
Why is that thanks to me?

380
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,210
You are the graceful king Ihwawon produced, right?

381
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:48,980
The rumors are widespread, so we are full of guests.

382
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,850
That is fortunate.

383
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:53,780
It feels like yesterday we were worried about having no guests.

384
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,540
These days, I am conflicted if I should build

385
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:01,540
another guesthouse and where it should be.

386
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,270
There were days we used to talk and laugh like this.

387
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:12,090
I also... miss those days sometimes.

388
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,080
The days when we used to smile altogether.

389
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:22,290
Have you still not heard from Shi Yeol?

390
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:24,040
Yes.

391
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:28,590
 Your Majesty, it is soon time for your council.

392
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:41,890
After today... it will be hard to see you.

393
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:47,600
Please take care... Brother.

394
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,590
Dan Oh...

395
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:57,650
can I... hug you just once?

396
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,940
Of course.

397
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:30,990
I will take my leave now.

398
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:37,100
Please sleep at night and be at peace from time to time, Your Majesty.

399
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:42,610
If the king is at peace, his people will suffer, do they not?

400
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,390
San...

401
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:53,900
wherever you are... be well.

402
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:57,420
Yes. I will.

403
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,570
Let us go.

404
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:42,930
You may go ahead.

405
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,410
Have you met with His Majesty?

406
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,320
I heard you are leaving soon.

407
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,670
Yes.

408
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:01,550
I intend not to enter the palace after today.

409
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:05,710
That is this humble one's loyalty.

410
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,970
San of the Kang family.

411
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:13,200
You are resolved to live as that name only.

412
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:16,780
I will take good care of His Majesty.

413
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:22,330
Since he has you, my footsteps are slightly lighter, Left State Minister.

414
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:04,000
Goodness. I said I would hang the sheets!

415
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,410
Have some sweets before you continue.

416
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:08,340
Later. I will eat them after I am done.

417
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,240
 The moon is bright.

418
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:34,350
 You should... walk around the yard sometimes, at least.

419
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:55,800
â™ª  When the petals fall from the wind that breezes by  â™ª

420
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:12,860
â™ª  At every step my dear takes  â™ª

421
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:18,230
â™ª  Only the angelicas bloom  â™ª

422
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:21,180
â™ª  Gently and lightlyâ€”  â™ª

423
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:23,730
Excuse me, Scholar.

424
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:28,640
Could you tell me where you heard that song?

425
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,890
I heard it from a scholar I met on the way here.

426
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:33,320
What is the matter?

427
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,030
Where did you hear it?

428
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:37,560
Where is that scholar right now?

429
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:42,010
He said he was going to the Mapo docks to set sail to the Qing Empire.

430
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:53,280
 Come on! Hurry up!

431
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,070
 Everyone, be careful!

432
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,940
There is no way he would still be here.

433
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:19,130
â™«  Because I have been hiding these feelings  â™«

434
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:25,740
â™«  The days I couldn't hope for  â™«

435
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:33,920
â™«  They flow dimly by your side  â™«

436
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:39,960
â™«  I only grow more distant from you  â™«

437
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:47,820
â™«  This love that can't be seen  â™«

438
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:55,020
â™«  These feelings I can't show you  â™«

439
00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:09,470
â™«  Because you're my everything that I can only watch from afar  â™«

440
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:15,230
â™«  Do I just need to wait endlessly?  â™«

441
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:21,970
You... told me this before, right?

442
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:26,530
Although the man called Kim Shi Yeol may be an illusion,

443
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:31,880
your feelings for me are sincere without an inch of falsehood.

444
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:35,730
â™«  Although it calls out to you like this  â™«

445
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:40,900
Do your feelings... still remain unchanged?

446
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,650
They did not change.

447
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:52,740
As time went by...

448
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:57,100
they only became clearer.

449
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,920
Then, let us walk through the door together.

450
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:14,840
â™«  My heartbeat races toward you  â™«

451
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:20,380
â™«  Its sound rings so loudly like this  â™«

452
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:30,230
â™«  Although it calls out to you like this  â™«

453
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:33,910
All the lights are off.

454
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:36,070
Is everyone sleeping?

455
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:50,150
Indeed, you were not mistaken, Dan Oh.

456
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:54,410
I saw the two of them at the market on the way.

457
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:57,440
Your appearance lost its shine during those few years.

458
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,010
Did you have a tough time?

459
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,580
Welcome.

460
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:04,290
Your room has been kept empty all this time.

461
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:06,890
Under the authority of the hostess.

462
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:12,070
I am indeed ashamed of myself.

463
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:14,700
I made you all worry a lot. Right?

464
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,590
Bokshil?

465
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:30,050
It is our Bokshil!

466
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,740
I guess she followed her owner, who found her.

467
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:35,460
She came right on the day you came back, Brother.

468
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:39,020
Since Bokshil is also back, all of our family has gathered now.

469
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:40,820
Yes, you are right.

470
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:43,590
It is finally the Ihwawon I know.

471
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,600
- Goodness. 
 - Right, Bokshil?

472
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:01,300
Where have you been all this time?

473
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:05,200
Never mind.

474
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,100
That does not matter. What matters is that you came back.

475
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:13,720
I heard the royal family no longer raises Watchmen.

476
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,350
It was your request, was it not?

477
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:22,440
It was a cruel cycle that would have to be gone one day.

478
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:26,080
Thank you, San.

479
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:31,980
Thanks to you, the children of the hermitage will not live like me.

480
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,230
You should also go forward instead of looking back now.

481
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:43,350
Erase your dark shadow... and live your life now.

482
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:58,420
Each and every night...

483
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:05,000
How long do you plan to live, surrounded by work?

484
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,730
You need to find a queen as soon as possible and plan for your heir.

485
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:12,950
I am still young.

486
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:16,190
You are supposed to marry when you are young.

487
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:20,280
I will begin the queen selection process, so keep that in mind.

488
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,290
The country is finally stable.

489
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:25,200
I should focus on my duties for now.

490
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:32,560
Could it be that you have a lover whom you can not forget?

491
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:41,260
How pretty.

492
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:49,670
What are you doing?

493
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:51,590
You wanted to see the flowers together.

494
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:54,880
You cannot! Do not look yet.

495
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:18,800
It is my present to the bride whom I will marry.

496
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:24,620
Finally, you are more like yourself now.

497
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:32,120

498
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:35,330
It goes up like this...

499
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:38,010
and it droops down...

500
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,460
Letter s...

501
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:43,970
I was not fooling you on purpose.

502
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:49,580
But will it help me to learn to write them down without knowing the meaning?

503
00:56:52,200 --> 00:57:00,480
"At that moment... King's Messenger's lips covered Yeon's lips."

504
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:08,360
You are my everything.

505
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,320
Goodness, seriously!

506
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:16,400
Gosh, the novel is shaking my heartâ€”

507
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:34,290
Take your time to learn the letters.

508
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:38,800
- I will read it to you for the rest of my life. 
 - Oh, dear.

509
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:06,140
I plan to become a graceful king who sincerely... looks after his people's hearts.

510
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:17,730
Please look over me... Mother.

511
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:31,190
You are happy, right?

512
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:34,580
Since your final concern is smiling ear to ear like that.

513
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:42,320
Bride and Groom, bow and greet!

514
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:07,160
Vow to the heavens!

515
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:33,680
Vow to each other!

516
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:40,760

517
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,450
It feels sad to send you off.

518
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:49,430
We had finally gotten together.

519
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:52,530
Shi Yeol, the honeymoon stage only comes once.

520
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:55,890
- Do not be sad and have fun. 
 - "Shi Yeol"?

521
00:59:55,890 --> 01:00:00,690
He should not call me by my name since I am of a higher rank than him.

522
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:02,490
Yes, he should not.

523
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:04,340
It is wrong in so many ways.

524
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:07,020
Family members should address each other properly.

525
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,800
So he says, Brother-in-Law Kang.

526
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,740
Gosh, I should have left earlier.

527
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:13,740
He is right in every way.

528
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:16,380
You need to call him Hyungnim now.

529
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:24,330
H-Hyungnim. Happy now?

530
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,100
Brother-in-Law Kang, what did you say just now?

531
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:31,050
- I could not hear you well. 
 - Hyung-

532
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:33,990
Cut it out.

533
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:47,520
I will make sure to protect Ihwawon... just the way you have been doing, Dan Oh.

534
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:53,560
You did not need to free me from my status.

535
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:56,110
I am sorry it was done too late.

536
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:59,200
Live happily ever after with Sir now, okay?

537
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:08,470
When you arrive, please send me a word.

538
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:14,960
Sir! I will be on my way now.

539
01:01:38,310 --> 01:01:41,030
Do you not regret it, Brother?

540
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:43,450
Regret what?

541
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:47,380
The things you gave up for an ordinary day.

542
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,640
Not at all.

543
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,990
I have never regretted it, not even for a moment.

544
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:04,760
Since you are... by my side as always.
