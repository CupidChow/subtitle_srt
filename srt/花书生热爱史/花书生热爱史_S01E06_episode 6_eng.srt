1
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,140

2
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,880

3
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,420

4
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:37,250

5
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,220

6
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:47,840

7
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,720

8
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,810
I will ask you just two questions.

9
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,320
Fine.

10
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,700
If it's a misunderstanding, we will work it through,

11
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,090
and if it's an ill-fated relationship, we should cut it off.

12
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:09,270
Your life will depend on your answer.

13
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,940
Kim Shi Yeol.

14
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:20,070
You are not the illegitimate son of His Excellency... Kim Hong Ik.

15
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,360
What is your real name?

16
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,540
If Brother Shi Yeol is Lee Seol,

17
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,990
why is he being questioned at a private residence instead of the palace?

18
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,600
 Let me know if the Watchman comes to you.

19
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,180
 Kill two birds with one stone.

20
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,640
 Is he trying to catch the Watchman by using Lee Seol?

21
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:05,130
 Finding him means finding the "jade dust".

22
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,000
 The Watchman is always by the "jade dust's" side.

23
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:19,630
 Do not look... for the person you are looking for right now.

24
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,690
 I was right.

25
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,280
 Kang San was the Watchman.

26
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,190
 He has been protecting the "jade dust" all this time.

27
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:34,560

28
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,960
Deposed crown prince's son, Lee Seol.

29
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,920
Is that the name you wanted?

30
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,960
But I do not know what to tell you.

31
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,380
I am not him.

32
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,440
Kim Shi Yeol.

33
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,660
That is my real name.

34
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,240
You are really His Excellency Kim Hong Ik's biological son?

35
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,050
Your name is not even in the family registry.

36
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,470
Threatening will not change the truth.

37
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:32,380
 If you bring me the Watchman, I will forgive all of your debt.

38
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,390
Are you... going somewhere?

39
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,210
Do I have to report to you about things like that?

40
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,360
It is not that...

41
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,730
The thing is...

42
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,550
What?

43
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,980
Do you have something to say?

44
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,940
 I am sorry, Brother.

45
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,900
 This is my only option.

46
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,340
Let us talk later unless it is urgent. Right now, I—

47
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,340
It is urgent!

48
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,390
So... I need to tell you something urgently...

49
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,610
Well...

50
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:23,570
To be honest, I lost a keepsake from my mother.

51
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,920
A keepsake?

52
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,390
It is a jade ring.

53
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:30,530
It is very small and shines brightly.

54
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,700
- Where did you lose it? 
 - Pardon?

55
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,940
Well...

56
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,820
At a pond.

57
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,490
It is the last thing my mother left behind.

58
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,320
But I dropped it in a pond while cleaning.

59
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,610
How do you drop something like that in a pond while cleaning?

60
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,580
I have been a bit out of it lately.

61
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,450
 I am urgently contacting you because something strange happened.

62
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:37,150
 The soldiers of Hanseongbu have gathered around at Chief Administrator's house right now.

63
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,010
Soldiers?

64
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,300
 And a scholar I do not know the name of is being detained there.

65
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,720
 If I tell Chief Administrator about this,

66
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,280
 Brother Kang San will... be killed. Right?

67
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,670
 Dan Oh.

68
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,320
 Are you okay?

69
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,840
 Did you get hurt?

70
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,660
 Do not cry.

71
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,170
 Do not cry, I said.

72
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:43,000
 How do you drop something like that in a pond while cleaning?

73
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:13,350
Ihwawon is... long gone now.

74
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,370
You will get caught if you go there now!

75
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,150
What are you talking about?

76
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,230
The thing is...

77
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,500
You should figure out the situation first... and then—

78
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,700
Where do you think I am going, exactly?

79
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:26,100
Let us wait and see... how long your spirit will last.

80
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,050
Look all around the area.

81
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,770
I am sure he will come.

82
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,940
- Yes, sir! 
 - Yes, sir!

83
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,720
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

84
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,460
You should step back.

85
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,960
Just tell me which direction.

86
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,680
- I will pull the string— 
 - Have you shot an arrow?

87
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,930
No.

88
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,720
I should start trying now.

89
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,870
If you miss, it is over.

90
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,120
Do not be hasty and give it to me.

91
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,730
Do you have a better option?

92
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:38,640
You cannot even reach the target, let alone hit the bullseye with that arm.

93
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,100
Right now!

94
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,300
He is here.

95
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,730
Over there! Chase him!

96
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,890
Stop.

97
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,460
I noticed that Hanseongbu was empty.

98
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,900
This is where everyone was.

99
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,600
 All the soldiers of Hanseongbu are at Chief Administrator's house.

100
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,830
 And the person you are looking for is also there.

101
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:19,010
Left State Minister, what brings you all the way here?

102
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,710
Who is that person?

103
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,160
He was presumed to be the "jade dust".

104
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,390
- So I was questioning him. 
 - What are you talking about?

105
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:34,170
How dare you question the oldest son of the crown prince at your home?

106
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,540
The oldest son of the crown prince?

107
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,750
The "jade dust" was deposed. Therefore, he is a commoner.

108
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,320
But the fact that he is a royal offspring does not change!

109
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,820
I just...  tried to follow the king's order—

110
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,500
I am also trying to follow his order!

111
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,160
We will question the "jade dust" at the Royal Investigation Bureau.

112
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,120
- Left State Minister. 
 - The Royal Court will be outraged

113
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,330
if you deal with an important matter of the royal family

114
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:01,350
to be determined solely by a mere judge!

115
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,990
He could not have gone too far!

116
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,690
- Search everywhere around here! 
  - Yes, sir!

117
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,430
Over there.

118
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,430
Let's go.

119
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,440
How come you are not asking any questions?

120
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,440
I am just glad you are safe.

121
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,370
That is enough for today.

122
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,940
Are you not afraid?

123
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,140
You do not even know who I am.

124
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:24,730
 I know... that you are the Watchman.

125
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,430
I am afraid.

126
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,950
I was afraid.

127
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,420
Looking at you in the carriage when you were injured,

128
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:44,280
I was afraid that might be the last moment.

129
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,240
So...

130
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,950
please do not get hurt.

131
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,990
Are you here to see Miss?

132
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,680
Is she in her room?

133
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,510
She has not returned yet!

134
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,490
She did not tell you where she was going?

135
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:24,390
She was gone when I came back after delivering eggs.

136
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,680
What is she doing at this hour?

137
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:52,080
Is your arm okay?

138
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,430
It looks quite painful.

139
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,700
It is okay.

140
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,130
I suddenly used it too much earlier.

141
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,580
Let me have a look.

142
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,230
If your wound got worse...

143
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,350
For what?

144
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,110
Forget it.

145
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,780
- Let me look! 
 - Geez!

146
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,940
 What are you doing over there?

147
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:42,910
 Did you throw the water dropper that I cherish in there?

148
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,080
 Yes.

149
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,220
 So it can swim around freely.

150
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,680
 A fish has to hang out in the water.

151
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,640
It is nothing.

152
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,480
You asked me to find a small and shiny thing.

153
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,300
Why?

154
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,650
Do you not like it?

155
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,450
No.

156
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,050
I like it.

157
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,550
I really, really like it.

158
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,460
Good then.

159
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,060
Hold on.

160
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,350
Did you really go into the pond?

161
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,160
Because of the ring?

162
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,470
I just dipped my feet in there.

163
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,920
I could not find the ring, either.

164
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,650
- I will get you the ring next time— 
 - No, no!

165
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:53,140
This is... already enough.

166
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,140
You said it is a keepsake from your mother.

167
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,060
I will make sure to find it when I go back there.

168
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,980
It is okay!

169
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,830
If you did not find it,

170
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:05,040
it might not be there...

171
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,130
It's not there?

172
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,670
It is not that...

173
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,770
I do not want to be a bother.

174
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,840
You know how I feel, right?

175
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,330
It is His Excellency Kim Hong Ik.

176
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,890
What is going on right now?

177
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:43,310
We brought him here because Kim Shi Yeol's identity was in question.

178
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,990
Are you hurt at all?

179
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:02,730
No, Your Excellency.

180
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,570
What happened?

181
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,920
Is the scholar okay?

182
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,970
Do not worry.

183
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,180
Things worked out without any problems.

184
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,560
Lean on me for a moment.

185
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,960
You cannot leave right now, anyway!

186
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,870
I am telling you to rest a bit.

187
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,490
It is not necessary.

188
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,960
You are the one who got hurt.

189
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:14,330
Do you... want to lean for a moment?

190
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,630
Go ahead.

191
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,380
I don't want to.

192
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,110
Geez, I said I do not want to! Come on...

193
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,920
That must hurt. Let me see.

194
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,990
I'm okay.

195
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,140
Are you okay?

196
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:46,110
We need to sync our lips first...

197
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,200
What...

198
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,910
So I mean, we keep our lips in sync—

199
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,510
No, no, no!

200
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,650
We should be on the same page! Same page...

201
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,730
What happened... last night...

202
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,190
You want to keep it a secret, right?

203
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:09,230
Yes. If we go in together and get caught...

204
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,610
I think you are already caught.

205
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,190
Brother!

206
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,980
Where have you been without telling me?

207
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,250
Forget it.

208
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,780
It is okay since you are safe.

209
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,210
It is okay?

210
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,970
What is?

211
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,390
S-Scholar Sir...

212
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:36,250
You are back!

213
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:40,030
Innkeeper Yoon, why are you suddenly acting so properly?

214
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,480
"Scholar Sir"?

215
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,840
My apologies—

216
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,150
Well, um...

217
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,400
I am relieved!

218
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,300
Because you returned home safely.

219
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:02,260
Looks like... you had an interesting night.

220
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,740
Were you with San?

221
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,420
Or with Yoo Ha?

222
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,100
Let us go eat. You have not had breakfast yet, right?

223
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,400
Is it your treat?

224
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,880
How about some hot chicken soup instead of soup and rice?

225
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,840
Enjoy your conversation, then.

226
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:27,680
What is this? Why is she being so oddly polite?

227
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:34,260
I got drunk and fell.

228
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:40,950
Were you... looking for the "jade dust" all night, by chance?

229
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,210
It is not like that.

230
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:48,070
There is still some time left before I give Chief Administrator the house.

231
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,770
Is that so?

232
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:54,900
I am sorry. I will try my best...

233
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,300
so this does not happen again.

234
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:03,560
So do not worry so much!

235
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,790
Okay. See you later.

236
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,730
Right.

237
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,480
Dan Oh.

238
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:17,430
Could you set some time aside? I need to tell you something.

239
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:21,040
What is it? You can tell me now.

240
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,550
No. Not now.

241
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,600
How about at 3:00 at Gwangtong Bridge later?

242
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,180
What do you think?

243
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,850
Okay, sounds good.

244
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,920
I will see you then.

245
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,440
Kim Shi Yeol was acquitted?

246
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,470
Was he truly His Excellency Kim's biological son?

247
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:46,360
He was not added to the family registry because he was born of a concubine.

248
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,400
His Excellency Kim Hong Ik was called in at night to be questioned.

249
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,050
What should we do?

250
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:58,810
What is certain is that someone came to protect him.

251
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,250
Eunuch Yoon.

252
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,750
Yes, Your Majesty.

253
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:18,120
Where did you say you found this book?

254
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,770
It was found where the court ladies do the laundry.

255
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,880
Read it.

256
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,660
As if you are reading it to your friends at the laundry place.

257
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,200
If you do not read it,

258
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,560
I will bring all the maids from the laundry room here and make them read it.

259
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,880
Hurry up!

260
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:59,240
"Since the land is broad and the water runs fast,

261
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,820
an extraordinary man will certainly show up.

262
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:07,970
After receiving Heaven's order, he will come to this world and..."

263
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,700
Go on!

264
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,740
"Become the king."

265
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,730
Please kill me!

266
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,700
Who do you think will become the king?

267
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,840
You must have someone in mind. Who is it?

268
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,600
Who deserves to be on the throne?

269
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:45,070
Your Majesty, many are watching you.

270
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,770
Please kill me...

271
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,750
All right, I will make your wish come true.

272
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,320
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

273
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,940
What are you doing, King?

274
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:16,070
Are you insulting your mother right now?

275
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:19,060
She is a maid of the Queen's chamber. How dare you—

276
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:25,280
That maid from the Queen's chamber dare to... entertain a thought of treason.

277
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,970
Treason!

278
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,060
Treason?

279
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,530
She is...

280
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:02,050
King!

281
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:15,550
How many more need to die for you to be satisfied?

282
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:21,960

(An obscure compilation of speeches and records of major political conversations dating back to Confucian China.)

283
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,970

284
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:27,480

285
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,030

286
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:57,310
I told you clearly that I do not know anything about the "jade dust"—

287
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:00,180
I am not here to look for the "jade dust".

288
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,610
I am... here to give up Ihwawon.

289
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:13,820
If so... you should be seeing Chief Administrator Jang.

290
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:17,030
I have a favor to ask you.

291
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:21,110
I heard Buyounggak will be taking over Ihwawon.

292
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:23,950
The state exam is coming up soon.

293
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:29,460
Please allow the scholars to continue to stay there.

294
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:33,960
You are about to be out on the street.

295
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,970
How come you only worry about the scholars?

296
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:39,450
I beg you.

297
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:59,570
Whom is she trying to protect that she became endlessly bold?

298
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,110
What in the world!

299
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,430
Oh, my. That must hurt.

300
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:18,630
This is why you need to watch where you are going.

301
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:22,040
I mean, since you are preoccupied with seducing men,

302
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,960
you cannot help but fall like that.

303
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,560
Seduce? Who are you to say that?

304
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,900
You seduced three men and made them stay at Ihwawon, did you not?

305
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,640
Only the handsome-looking ones on top of that.

306
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,190
Only the handsome-looking ones.

307
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:39,700
MIss, we are not that different since we all make a living by selling laughter.

308
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,370
Hey...

309
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,770
Let go! What are you doing?

310
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:51,730
Is it you again? Hey, do you take me lightly?

311
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:52,970
Mind your behavior.

312
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:56,080
- You are also low-class, just like us! 
 - I know.

313
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,690
However, do you all not know?

314
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,680
What happens when the low-class rebels against the nobles?

315
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,020
Do you want to get arrested for violation of ethics?

316
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:08,410
I wonder if your bottoms will be safe.

317
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,530
I will get you for this.

318
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,420
Just wait and see.

319
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,340
Please understand.

320
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:28,000
They just get jealous of women of noble families.

321
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,640
Thank you.

322
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,200
It must have been hard to help me like this.

323
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,180
You do not need to thank me.

324
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:38,180
I also used to be a noble once.

325
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,860
So I feel as if your trouble is mine.

326
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,460
You said Ban Ya is your name?

327
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:47,220
Next time we meet, let us become...

328
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,730
friends.

329
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:57,650
I called you to have a drink with me.

330
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:02,110
Between those who survived.

331
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:17,570
You are still beautiful... even after all those harsh years.

332
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,880
Grand Prince cherished you a lot.

333
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,950
Why are you talking about the past?

334
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:32,500
I heard Chief Administrator Jang owns Buyounggak.

335
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:39,310
The Grand Prince's woman... now follows a mere Chief Administrator, huh?

336
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,300
Do not trust Chief Administrator too much.

337
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:48,530
He will never keep silent about your secret.

338
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:53,050
That must be why you have also kept silent so far.

339
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,320
Is that not true?

340
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,030
Huh?

341
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:06,880

342
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:12,900

343
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,340

344
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:26,730
"Lee" for a plum tree, and "Hwa" for a flower?

345
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:32,360
There is even a rumor saying a snow flower will blossom on the plum tree.

346
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,020
By snow flower, they are...

347
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,120
talking about Lee Seol. 
  ("Seol" means snow)

348
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:52,680
If Lee Seol is the leader of Mok In Hoe, this is treason.

349
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,810
Minister of Defense, listen carefully.

350
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:58,780
Locate Mok In Hoe's base and arrest its leader.

351
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:02,190
You must root out the treason even if you must search the entire nation.

352
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,430
Yes, Your Majesty!

353
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,770
It is because of that woman, right?

354
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:20,910
The reason you told me to look into Jang Tae Hwa.

355
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,840
Is there anything you found out?

356
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,110
There were a few surprising things.

357
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,320
What are they?

358
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,780
Ihwawon and Chief Administrator Jang were originally to become in-laws.

359
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,850
- In-laws? 
 - Yes.

360
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:37,980
But since Jang Tae Hwa's son got killed before the wedding,

361
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,770
it never came to fruition.

362
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:43,690
That is what happened to her, huh?

363
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,420
To Dan Oh, that child.

364
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,320
Was Hong Ju her name?

365
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,770
Ihwawon's eldest daughter also passed away soon after her fiance died.

366
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:57,430
By eldest daughter, do you mean... Dan Oh had an older sister?

367
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:00,530
- Did you not know? 
 - I did not.

368
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,010
By the way, how did Chief Administrator Jang's son die?

369
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:08,700
I could not find out that much.

370
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:17,480
What do we do about this?

371
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,670
Ihwawon was our only haven.

372
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,210
Please do not tell the scholars.

373
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:28,790
I do not wish to feel sorry for each other and become uncomfortable.

374
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:32,890
Still... are you going to leave without even a farewell?

375
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,690
Later.

376
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:37,130
Okay.

377
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:40,250
I understand. I will do that.

378
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:44,590
The owner is leaving, and only the guests remain.

379
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,620
I am sorry, Sister.

380
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:55,000
I could not help but hand over Ihwawon... in order for no one to get hurt.

381
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,920
I know.

382
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,610
Dan Oh, if that is your will... that must be the best option.

383
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,400
Why are you preparing winter bedding already?

384
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,440
It is better to have it washed in advance, is it not?

385
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,600
Why?

386
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,110
So you can finish this and leave?

387
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,040
Why do you keep avoiding me?

388
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:36,910
Does it have to do with how I suddenly became Scholar Sir to you?

389
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:38,480
Oh, that is right.

390
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,690
I forgot to wash the rice.

391
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,720
Yoon Dan Oh.

392
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:59,750
Yesterday... I saw everything...

393
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,370
at Chief Administrator Jang's house.

394
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:10,540
I know all about... who you are, Brother.

395
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,940
About what?

396
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,140
Could it be that...

397
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,760
you think I am Lee Seol?

398
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,570
Yes.

399
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,630
I did not think your misunderstanding would be this deep.

400
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,310
I am not Lee Seol.

401
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:38,520
I got interrogated at the Royal Investigation Bureau last night.

402
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,530
If I were really the "jade dust," there is no way I would have been freed like this.

403
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:43,330
Do you not think so?

404
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,580
You do not believe me, huh?

405
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,880
So what are you going to do now?

406
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,660
Are you going to hand over Ihwawon to Chief Administrator Jang?

407
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,230
No.

408
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,860
I am protecting them.

409
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,990
My family at Ihwawon.

410
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:07,040
So that no one will get hurt.

411
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,870
In that case... what about your sister?

412
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,310
Sorry?

413
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:15,140
The lady you hid away in the annex.

414
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,920
You knew about her?

415
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,410
Since when?

416
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:24,450
I already knew she was not a ghost.

417
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:28,150
I was wondering why you would want to hide her away

418
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:31,790
and realized she must be your sister, who is said to be dead.

419
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,700
Anyone there?

420
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,650
Is Young Master Yoo Ha in?

421
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:45,790
Yoo Ha left earlier.

422
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,150
Brother!

423
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,600
Why did you run here?

424
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,870
Did you miss me that much?

425
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,470
The thing is...

426
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,850
Your mother is...

427
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:42,350
Your mother is in critical condition.

428
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:45,660
She will not be able to see past tonight.

429
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,460
Wait.

430
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,950
You left it open all this time?

431
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,780
For resolution,

432
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:20,410
I will cover the hole that I have caused.

433
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,300
Leave it as it is, please.

434
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:26,780
The days did get warm,

435
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:29,060
but for such a large hole to exist in a lady's room...

436
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,850
I was finally able to breathe.

437
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,100
For a window to the outside world was created.

438
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:42,970
So, please... leave it as it is.

439
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:50,020
Is it okay for me... to come to have a chat from time to time?

440
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:56,500
They said silence is a positive response.

441
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,880
I will take that as a yes.

442
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:38,850
They are things... your father left to you.

443
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:44,070
I heard they are valuable things.

444
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,910
The rest is...

445
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:54,290
your share of... inheritance.

446
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:56,620
What do you mean by inheritance?

447
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:01,490
Your taking care of me thus far alone is...

448
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,360
This is...

449
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,400
This is the last time.

450
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,140
I—

451
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:20,070
I was... always afraid.

452
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:27,310
That you, who are not related to our family by blood,

453
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,700
would become the cause of a disaster.

454
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,600
That is why I was grateful.

455
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:40,010
Since you still took me in... despite knowing everything.

456
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:47,760
So now... please cut your ties...

457
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:51,070
with our family...

458
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:56,340
after taking these.

459
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,190
Mother...

460
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,320
Mother...

461
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,250
Mother! Mother! Mother!

462
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,900
Mother! Mother!

463
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,300
Mother...

464
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:21,770
What a... lamentable event...

465
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:24,990
Move!

466
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:27,100
Mother... Mother...

467
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,740
Mother.

468
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,930
Mother...

469
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:34,390
How could you pass in front of a concubine's son?

470
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,200
You rotten bastard.

471
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,040
Get lost if you got what you wanted.

472
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:52,100
Please... allow me to attend her funeral.

473
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,930
I beg of you, Young Master.

474
00:43:56,930 --> 00:44:00,290
A concubine's son to do what?

475
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:02,930
Do you plan to mock Mother on her way to the afterlife?

476
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:04,870
Get lost!

477
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,530
M-Mother...

478
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:11,680
Mother!

479
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:15,010
Mother...

480
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,070
Mother...

481
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:04,520
Do not try too hard.

482
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,390
You do not need to console me.

483
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:14,910
She raised and clothed me, who is not even her biological son.

484
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:20,450
I am just deeply apologetic because I cannot even offer incense on her way.

485
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:27,450
I was reminded... of Father for the first time in a while.

486
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:33,340
Because I had found this thing.

487
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:36,160
What did you find?

488
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,240
A memory.

489
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:42,940
This fish-shaped, shiny little thing.

490
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:44,810
What?

491
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:51,280
That shiny little thing... made me remember Father's face in no time.

492
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,390
After I had forgotten about him for so long.

493
00:45:57,070 --> 00:45:59,630
Am I not such a mean daughter?

494
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:02,790
Not at all.

495
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:07,070
I am proud you grew up well and courageously.

496
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:09,800
I am sure that is what he would say.

497
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:18,700
I am also... very proud of you, Brother.

498
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,860
By the way, I did not have time to ask.

499
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:26,800
What?

500
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,500
You said you had something to tell me.

501
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,700
So you asked to meet at Gwangtong Bridge.

502
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:35,140
Well...

503
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,850
Next time.

504
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:43,380
I will tell you next time.

505
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,020
I heard your mother was in critical condition.

506
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:57,510
Why did you come back so early?

507
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:01,120
Stop being needlessly curious.

508
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:21,650
Jeong Yoo Ha!

509
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,430
I cannot console you and stuff.

510
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:26,640
What?

511
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,130
So let me ask you this.

512
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:32,400
What do you say to a consoling drink... instead of consolation?

513
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,820
Hey, hey.

514
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,740
Eat some food, too.

515
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:00,430
You will ruin your stomach.

516
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:01,890
What is the deal?

517
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:04,400
You are looking after Yoo Ha?

518
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,370
Please pour me one, too.

519
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:14,760
A drink.

520
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:15,980
A drink?

521
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:19,380
Dan Oh, you know how to drink, too?

522
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:22,140
Why does it matter?

523
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:25,110
Innkeeper Yoon is also an adult.

524
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:40,130
The entire house is empty.

525
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:42,740
Everyone, have you seen Dan Oh and Najudaek?

526
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:44,630
I have not seen them, either.

527
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:47,140
And Mr. Yook Ho is also missing.

528
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:04,990
Where is Dan Oh right now?

529
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:10,770
She said she would send a letter when she found a home.

530
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:13,610
Our Dan Oh is quite decisive.

531
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:17,610
Not even giving us time to stop her.

532
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:24,570
 I was afraid.

533
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:28,010
 Looking at you in the carriage when you were injured,

534
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:31,040
 I was afraid that might be the last moment.

535
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:36,270
 So... please do not get hurt.

536
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:42,070
Could it be... because of me?

537
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:54,610
It was quite cold at night, was it not?

538
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:57,440
This room has been empty for years.

539
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,070
Not at all.

540
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:03,530
Please excuse us until we find a room.

541
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:06,310
Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.

542
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,630
It is a house for women to reside in.

543
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:19,570
Please find a place as affordable and safe as possible.

544
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:20,880
Yes.

545
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,160
What are you doing here?

546
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,470
By chance...

547
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:29,880
- did you follow me? 
 - Yes.

548
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:33,770
Please tell me... where Dan Oh is.

549
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:37,120

550
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,630
How come you are even acting like this?

551
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:41,290
My head is already hurting enough as it is.

552
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:43,740
Empty it before it hurts even more.

553
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:46,590
I was taught that problems are to be shared.

554
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,950
A letter came from Ihwawon, sir.

555
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:08,580
 I will vacate the house.

556
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:12,830
 I will... hand over Ihwawon to you.

557
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:16,010
Saying she will hand over Ihwawon means...

558
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:19,750
She will not look for Lee Seol anymore.

559
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:23,800
 Yoon Dan Oh!

560
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,590
 He told me not to...

561
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:31,380
 step a foot near that child.

562
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:36,430
Why would Watchman go to Head Eunuch?

563
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:37,370
Pardon?

564
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:41,430
He never shows himself.

565
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:44,990
Unless his master's life is in danger.

566
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:48,870
 I am aware.

567
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:55,910
 That there is... a shadow warrior who protects the "jade dust".

568
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:59,140
Yoon Dan Oh...

569
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:01,850
That child has found him...

570
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:03,850
the "jade dust."

571
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:07,030
If that is not the case,

572
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:10,630
how would Watchman know Dan Oh's name?

573
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,070
Leave no stone unturned.

574
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:24,980
It is proof that demonstrates he is the oldest son of the crown prince,

575
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,450
so he will definitely have it with him.

576
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:28,370
 Yes, sir!

577
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:39,990
Search every corner.

578
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:42,530
The house is completely empty.

579
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:45,150
The other scholars are also nowhere to be seen.

580
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:20,310
Investigate Dan Oh's whereabouts.

581
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:22,170
I must see that child.

582
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:24,530
Yes, sir.

583
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:29,720
I am not sure if we can just visit without a plan.

584
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,160
Why are you and San both so adamant?

585
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,850
She cannot stay at the hermitage forever.

586
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:36,750
It is about time we discuss what to do from hereon.

587
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:39,460
- I mean, that is true, but— 
 - Right.

588
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:42,350
Do not mention how Chief Administrator Jang had the rooms searched.

589
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:43,850
It will only add to her worries unnecessarily.

590
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:45,500
I understand.

591
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:50,230
If you were also there to see it, I am sure you would have been furious, too.

592
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:17,700
H-How did you find this place?

593
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:22,200
I requested him to tell me where you were.

594
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,910
Gosh, is Najudaek doing all right?

595
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:26,300
Najudaek!

596
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:29,330
She went to the ravine to get water.

597
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:32,410
By the way, have you eaten?

598
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:34,720
No, we have not eaten yet.

599
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:38,840
Yoo Ha has been complaining that he has been hungry since earlier.

600
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,490
I did?

601
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:43,130
Are you hungry?

602
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:44,850
Wait just a moment.

603
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:46,790
I will need to wash the rice first.

604
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:48,400
Sure.

605
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:54,150
Are you not hungry?

606
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:14,930
Sister, stay inside.

607
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:16,330
Brother Yoo Ha is here.

608
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:18,540
Okay. I will do that.

609
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,360
Miss!

610
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:24,080
This is terrible!

611
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,820
- Chief Administrator Jang is... 
 - Chief Administrator Jang?

612
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:27,430
I do not know how,

613
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:31,300
but he is on his way to this place with the soldiers.

614
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,100
I am sure it is nothing serious.

615
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:36,650
You stay here, Sister. I will go out and see.

616
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:37,940
Be careful.

617
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:40,270
- If something happens— 
 - Do not worry.

618
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:43,800
You must not come outside. You know that, right?

619
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:51,190
 I also have my means.

620
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:54,420
 I cannot help but go to Chief Administrator Jang myself.

621
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,600
Najudaek!

622
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,480
Chief Administrator Jang is...

623
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,570
Chief Administrator Jang is?

624
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:29,300
What brings you here?

625
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:31,510
I am looking for someone at the moment.

626
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:33,680
What is your business?

627
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:39,650
I handed Ihwawon over to you, did I not?

628
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:41,610
But why...

629
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:45,870
Why are you doing this?

630
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:48,520
What crime did she commit?

631
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:54,370
What is the meaning of this?

632
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:55,490
Dan Oh!

633
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:57,050
Do you not fear the heavens?

634
00:57:57,050 --> 00:57:59,020
Stop it now!

635
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:01,950
Miss!

636
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:11,150
How impertinent of you.

637
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:14,060
You had hidden something from me.

638
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:17,860
You had found Lee Seol.

639
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:19,850
Who is it?

640
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,250
This is the last time I will ask.

641
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:37,360
Answer me.

642
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,310
You are here, Watchman.

643
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:15,990

644
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:18,870

645
00:59:18,870 --> 00:59:26,240
♫  Melting in again, baby your love, drowning in my imagination  ♫

646
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:30,480
♫  Dazzles my eyes, like the sunlight  ♫

647
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,710
♫  Lost in a dream that is you  ♫

648
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:37,400
♫  When I'm walking for countless nights  ♫

649
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,700
 The killer ceased the killing?

650
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:43,170
 I have seen countless people losing their heads, getting involved in the Royal Family matters!

651
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:45,070
 Did she truly not find the "jade dust"?

652
00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:48,040
 If you find that person, you will be able to find Lee Seol's Watchman, too.

653
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,440
 Do your calculations right.

654
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:53,760
 Standing on which side do you think will be more beneficial for your life?

655
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,060
 You are really different.

656
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,680
 That is why I have come to like you for some reason.

657
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,570
 Did your feelings grow that much?

658
00:59:58,570 --> 01:00:02,070
 So much that you would protect her, putting down your life and conviction?

659
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:03,110
 That is how it turned out.

660
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:06,050
 So you protect Dan Oh in your way.

661
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:07,841
 Because I will do the same.

662
01:00:07,841 --> 01:00:12,170
♫  Melting in again, baby your love  ♫
