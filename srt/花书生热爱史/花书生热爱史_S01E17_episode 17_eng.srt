1
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:14,350

2
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,910

3
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,460

4
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,420

5
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,160

6
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,180

7
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,640
You came to get me, did you not?

8
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,270
Hurry up and try arresting me!

9
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,600
Put your sword down first!

10
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,640
What are you all doing? Let us go!

11
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,400
- Return to the palace! 
  - Yes!

12
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,160
We need to catch the rest, too.

13
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,810
The Watchman is among the people who ran away.

14
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,820
We cannot waste more time. His Majesty is waiting.

15
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,950
Your Excellency!

16
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:53,340
Since we arrested Lee Seol, we can eradicate the rest anytime.

17
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,030
- Let us go! 
  - Yes!

18
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:07,980

19
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,060

20
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,660
Did you get hurt at all?

21
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,100
Goodness, I was so worried that you two might get hurt...

22
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,130
I am sorry.

23
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,120
I always seem to upset you.

24
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,130
Looks like Hong Joo is in shock.

25
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,830
Hurry up and lay the body in the side room.

26
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,430
We need to have a funeral for Hostess Hong first.

27
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,070
I will look for a casket and a burial site.

28
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,780
I will help you, Miss.

29
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,240
Yoo Ha got taken by them?

30
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,570
What happened at the abandoned house, anyway?

31
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,190
It is because Chief Administrator Jang got the Royal Guard involved—

32
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:50,680
If it were not for Yoo Ha, we would not have been able to escape safely.

33
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,820
I see.

34
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,010
What are we supposed to do now?

35
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,360
I will save him.

36
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:04,890
No matter what it takes, I must save him.

37
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,970
How despicable.

38
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:49,580
You must have thought of me as a joke to completely fool me like that.

39
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,300
Maiden.

40
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,660
At least,

41
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,620
you should not have smiled and joked around.

42
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,000
Without realizing it, you took my betrothed's life away.

43
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:19,120
I was smiling... at your jokes.

44
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,560
You make my skin crawl!

45
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:34,770
With the same hand that held my hand, you must have shed so many people's blood.

46
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,810
I am sorry.

47
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:50,380
I know I cannot wash your wound away with some words, but—

48
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,600
How come only innocent ones need to die...

49
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,650
When there is someone who actually needs to die?

50
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,760
This is...

51
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,960
They found it after searching Ihwawon.

52
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,530
My nephew grew so much.

53
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,780
I am not surprised that I did not recognize you.

54
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,340
It is because you are so shortsighted, Uncle.

55
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:05,940
I am already excited thinking about how I should kill you.

56
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,650
Enjoy it while you can.

57
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:15,040
All glorious moments are... just a split second, including your time on the throne.

58
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,810
Talk as much as you like.

59
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:28,460
Your voice will not reach anywhere.

60
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:35,300
I will pick at your flesh little by little until even your soul disappears.

61
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,270
My poor older brother.

62
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:46,560
He will not see his son's face well, even in the afterlife.

63
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,660
Why is the interrogation taking so long?

64
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:11,040
Is the deposed crown prince's son being tortured by chance?

65
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:42,280
There you were, Left State Minister.

66
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,360
Your Highness.

67
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,240
I cannot express enough how terrible and devastated I feel.

68
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,250
 Your Highness!

69
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,010
 Your Highness!

70
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,670
 Your Highness!

71
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,570
What happened anyway?

72
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:15,400
Do not worry. Kang San is in a safe place.

73
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,770
You mean...

74
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:22,690
Since we bought some time, we just need to wait.

75
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,670
Take some.

76
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,890
You did so much in arresting Lee Seol.

77
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,880
I will award you with a special position soon.

78
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,970
I cannot express my gratitude enough, Your Majesty.

79
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:56,660
By the way... how did you know that Jeong Yoo Ha was the deposed crown prince's son?

80
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:01,920
Head Eunuch confessed everything and said who the deposed crown prince's son was.

81
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,460
If so, you just need to decide how to punish him.

82
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,630
Taking poison would be too easy.

83
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,530
Being beheaded is too simple.

84
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:21,810
I cannot let my only nephew have such a boring death.

85
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:27,050
Do you have something in mind, by chance?

86
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,570
I heard you told His Majesty who the deposed crown prince's son is.

87
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,560
Did you already know?

88
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,390
Do not be so disappointed.

89
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:59,030
You will be awarded a special position thanks to me.

90
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:07,350
Does His Majesty know... that your Lee Seol is fake?

91
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,790
Fake?

92
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,750
What kind of absurd thing is that to say?

93
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,570
Is it okay to tell His Majesty this absurd thing, then?

94
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,400
Kang San.

95
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:33,450
That he is Lee Seol, whom His Majesty was looking for.

96
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,680
What is it that you want?

97
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,580
Just tell me.

98
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:46,650
There is only one thing I want to know.

99
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:52,830
The Watchman. His whereabouts.

100
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:56,840
I really do not know where he is.

101
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,430
I reached the limit of my patience.

102
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:05,660
I do not know his whereabouts, but I know of a temple that produces Watchmen.

103
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,830
By the way, how did you know?

104
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:15,330
That Jeong Yoo Ha is a fake.

105
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:22,140
Watchman never abandons his master.

106
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,610
It is impossible.

107
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,980
Where are you going late at night?

108
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,120
I want to visit Left State Minister.

109
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,240
I am sure he is not okay, either.

110
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,990
You should assess the situation in the morning tomorrow—

111
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,670
We do not know when the execution will occur.

112
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,610
It is the moment the king has always been waiting for.

113
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,220
- Your Highness. 
 - I cannot let...

114
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,060
Yoo Ha face that moment for me.

115
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,550
If so, I will not be able to forgive myself.

116
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:09,060
You should take your sword with you no matter how rushed you are.

117
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:16,310
Go ahead. I will be waiting.

118
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,230
Okay.

119
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,400
I will be right back.

120
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,110
Will you keep standing there like that?

121
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:50,190
I thought not catching attention was the best I could do.

122
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:56,390
It would be hypocritical to say that I understand how you feel.

123
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:02,330
Are you going somewhere? I will follow you.

124
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,650
You do not have to do that.

125
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:10,670
- I just feel guilty that I could not let you go sooner. 
 - Your Highness.

126
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:14,560
You can do whatever you want to do now.

127
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,330
You can either stay here or leave.

128
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,790
If I cannot even protect the deposed crown prince's son,

129
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,600
what would be left in my life?

130
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,580
You should save Yoo Ha.

131
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,300
And I will have to protect you.

132
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,310
But you should still stay here tonight.

133
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:55,530
Chief Administrator might keep chasing after you.

134
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,110
I think I would feel comfortable only if I leave you here.

135
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,450
Be careful.

136
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:52,330
I was waiting because I thought you might come.

137
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:55,090
Ihwawon was completely empty.

138
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,340
Where is Left State Minister?

139
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,310
He has been imprisoned.

140
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:07,840
I heard the deposed crown prince's son also got arrested.

141
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,500
The longer we wait, the more difficult it will be for us.

142
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,980
We must start an army and ambush the palace.

143
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,510
I heard Left State Minister prepared for it.

144
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:23,930
The Military Training Commander said he would join us,

145
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,000
but the situation completely changed.

146
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,340
Let me meet with him. I will persuade him myself.

147
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,550
Yes.

148
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,850
 Master!

149
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,240
Who are you?

150
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,540
Where is the Watchman of the deposed crown prince's son?

151
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,480
The Watchman?

152
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,680
I am not sure what you are talking about.

153
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,510
Answer me before I slaughter everyone.

154
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,750
The question is the same.

155
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,670
How could my answer change?

156
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,030
I do not want to.

157
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,040
This hideout is not safe, either.

158
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,750
- If you get caught— 
 - So?

159
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,090
Are you telling me to leave on my own?

160
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:10,880
We do not know when Yoo Ha will get executed and everyone's life is in danger.

161
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,290
You have the rest of the family.

162
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:16,050
Leave Hanyang with them to protect them, at least.

163
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:19,380
You are my family, too.

164
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,290
I can never do that.

165
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:22,580
Dan Oh, please!

166
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,820
I will not get in the way.

167
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:29,780
So please do not tell me to leave.

168
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,910
I will crumble.

169
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,560
If you...

170
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,170
If I end up losing you, too—

171
00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:00,100
- Brother! 
 - I barely managed to make it this far.

172
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,160
But I will not be able to take a single step forward.

173
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,890
I...

174
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,570
I can protect myself.

175
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:12,600
I have done that all this time, and I will continue to do so.

176
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,420
I know.

177
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,580
You are stronger than anyone.

178
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,120
You will overcome any crisis wisely.

179
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,610
Yes.

180
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,920
- So please trust me and— 
 - But, Dan Oh,

181
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:36,030
even someone like you can be shattered and disappear without a trace.

182
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,560
That is...

183
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,330
That is what a revolution is.

184
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,100
The deposed crown prince's son was captured.

185
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,850
We desperately need your strategic help to save him.

186
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:40,200
Even if you combine all the forces that are sick of tyranny,

187
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,240
it would be very difficult to ambush the palace.

188
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,500
I know the security system well since I was a Royal Guard.

189
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,930
I will help out, so—

190
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:51,370
If they lock the palace gate and fight us back,

191
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:55,660
it would only give them time to summon the five military camps.

192
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,960
Would we have a chance if they opened the gate from the inside?

193
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,860
If that is possible,

194
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:07,820
we will be able to subdue the geumgun and get the king to surrender.

195
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,400

196
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,890
How about revealing the fact that you are the deposed crown prince's son now?

197
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:22,340
I do not think I have the right to be called that.

198
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:29,010
It is not me, but Yoo Ha... who is carrying the burden by risking his life.

199
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,070
Your Highness.

200
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:36,340
Commander is... bringing in the army to save the deposed crown prince's son.

201
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,910
Their high spirit will save Yoo Ha.

202
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:47,000
So, right now, Yoo Ha needs to be Lee Seol.

203
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,810
They are making the customers lose their appetite.

204
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,820
Why are they lingering around like that?

205
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,890
They are soldiers from Hanseongbu, right?

206
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,810
Why did Hostess have to be gone on a day like this?

207
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:06,070
Something must be going on.

208
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:10,320
It looked like they were searching Hostess's room without permission, too.

209
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:17,160
Did Chief Administrator tell you anything, by chance?

210
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:24,810
Sister Ban Ya, someone is here.

211
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,310
You should go out for a moment.

212
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,000
Me?

213
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,760
Who could it be?

214
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,120
Ignore me and keep walking.

215
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,930
You were safe.

216
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:01,810
I was so worried that everyone at Ihwawon was gone.

217
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,610
Did you come to Ihwawon?

218
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:04,810
Yes.

219
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:07,300
I stopped by because I was worried.

220
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:11,090
I heard the deposed crown prince's son got arrested.

221
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,140
By chance—

222
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,700
Let us talk on the way there.

223
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,280
On the way there? Where?

224
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,300
Actually...

225
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,210
Actually, Hostess is...

226
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,370
I am glad you came.

227
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:43,210
I thought it would be nice to have someone from Buyounggak join, too.

228
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,950
I cannot believe it.

229
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,330
Offer her a drink first.

230
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:50,420
I will... risk my everything and save Yoo Ha.

231
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:55,950
So... please rest in peace.

232
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,580
Did you say Eunyoungyeon? 
  (A party at the palace for the people who passed the state exam)

233
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,970
Yes. 
  (A party at the palace for the people who passed the state exam)

234
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:14,950
The last round of the exam will be at the palace.

235
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:19,940
I heard there would be a huge party for the ones who passed the exam.

236
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:23,870
I think many courtesans from Buyounggak will go, too.

237
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:26,550
They are having a party?

238
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,520
Something is strange.

239
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,800
I was sure the state exam would be delayed.

240
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,340
By chance...

241
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:42,760
Perhaps on that day, Yoo Ha might be facing the execution.

242
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,250
What is going on all of a sudden?

243
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,800
The signal kite is up.

244
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,100
The signal kite?

245
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,420
Do you mean something bad happened at the temple?

246
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,940
Sir!

247
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,250
The Chief Administrator Jang...

248
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,430
The children are not inside the temple!

249
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:52,150
He took them to Hanseongbu.

250
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:56,640
If you do not go there,

251
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:01,040
the children...

252
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,300
Please carry him inside.

253
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,230
Are you going to Hanseongbu?

254
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:22,590
I cannot let him kill the children.

255
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,440
Do not forget your duty as the Watchman.

256
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,390
Master!

257
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:33,640
If the Watchman gets himself killed, who will protect the master?

258
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:40,070
They are just children.

259
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,530
They did not do anything wrong.

260
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,970
Who are you?

261
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,990
Did you not get to see his face?

262
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:19,030
No, he was already gone.

263
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,310
 I will go to Hanseongbu myself.

264
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:31,610
 Just give me three days.

265
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:38,250
Do not bring too many things.

266
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,810
My brother has household goods, too.

267
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,660
We cannot go empty-handed and bother them.

268
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:55,180
You probably cannot take the state exam this time, right?

269
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,000
The safety of my family is more important right now.

270
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,850
I thought you might be passing for once!

271
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:08,120
Looks like you are really not meant to pass!

272
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,960
You do not know how to be subtle, Najudaek.

273
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,800
- You are very direct. 
 - Oh dear.

274
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:17,650
You are all ready, too. Right?

275
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:46,740
Wait for me. Once everything is over—

276
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:51,570
I know... you will not come late.

277
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,800
Also, regarding Shi Yeol...

278
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,970
Oh, that is...

279
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,110
something he needs to resolve with my sister.

280
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:08,190
- It is not my place to step— 
 - I am not telling you to step in.

281
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:12,730
Since your sister must be having a hard time as well, make sure to console her.

282
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,780
She must be feeling greatly betrayed and resentful.

283
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:22,910
Although Brother Shi Yeol must have suffered a lot as well...

284
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:25,960
Do not resent Shi Yeol too much.

285
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,750
I ask of you, at least.

286
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:33,830
I was the beginning of everything.

287
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,160
The one who turned Shi Yeol like that...

288
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,670
and causing Yoo Ha to be taken was all...

289
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,740
No.

290
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:50,270
All of those things were done by the tyrant who stole the throne.

291
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:58,450
Please do not forget... that above all things, Brother.

292
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:39,710
Stop looking back and hurry on.

293
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,840
I am sorry, Najudaek.

294
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,360
I really cannot just leave like this.

295
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,060
Stop saying such things!

296
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:03,560
I would rather die than watch you jump into the fire!

297
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,560
If I do nothing when all those brothers are on the verge of death...

298
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,740
Miss!

299
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,560
Go on.

300
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:14,380
I will take care of Najudaek and Hong Joo.

301
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,720
You cannot be saying that, Sir!

302
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,440
You need to stop her!

303
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,020
Will she listen to me if I stop her?

304
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,410
It seems her heart already ran off all the way over there.

305
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:33,310
Must you truly go?

306
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,990
Yes.

307
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,700
I am sorry, Sister.

308
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,700
You were alive, huh?

309
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,360
I thought you went off somewhere and died.

310
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,950
Luckily, I did not die.

311
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,960
It was as I expected.

312
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,950
Eunyoungyeon is not a party. It is the execution grounds.

313
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:50,620
He said he will set an example and execute the deposed crown prince's son in front of a big crowd.

314
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:59,950
I am... going to rescue the deposed crown prince's son.

315
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,420
When I first harbored this thought...

316
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:10,170
you were the first one... I was reminded of.

317
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:11,270
What—

318
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:14,070
The king has crossed the line.

319
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:19,690
How many more people will he harm after killing the deposed crown prince's son?

320
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:23,860
If you are hesitant, you may go back.

321
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,170
I will not blame you.

322
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,730
Do you trust me that much?

323
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:32,980
What if I go back and notify the Royal Guard?

324
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:41,640
It is greed to earn something without losing anything.

325
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,110
I might have already been on the same path as you.

326
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,030
In fact...

327
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:56,020
I was feeling glad inside... when you aimed your bow at the tyrant.

328
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,800
 Eunyoungyeon...

329
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,800
 We will head to the palace on that day.

330
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,780
We must stop Eunyoungyeon to save Grand Heir.

331
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:23,490
Will the king dismiss the party just because he hears the traitors are coming?

332
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,270
W-Wait...

333
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:29,040
Will it really be possible with just the five of us?

334
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,990
If things go as planned... the king is sure to panic as well.

335
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:39,720
During the long years the deposed crown prince's son was on the run...

336
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:47,560
the king was also being chased just like him... by the fear that he might lose the throne.

337
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,980
All right.

338
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:54,940
Even if we do safely get into the palace and fool the king... he will find out it is a lie in no time.

339
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,900
If we just stall until sunset...

340
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:03,100
Military Training Commander will bring his soldiers and come.

341
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:08,610
By the way... did you not say the palace gates will be opened from the inside?

342
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:12,840
I will get the declaration of the crown for the deposed crown prince's son from Queen Dowager.

343
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:17,340
With that, we will be able to get the gate guards to surrender.

344
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:21,390
But it is hard to go into Queen Dowager's pavilion.

345
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:26,240
I mean, we can at least send a letter through the palace ladies.

346
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:33,690
And what have you been thinking about since earlier?

347
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:38,410
It seems someone is outside.

348
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,850
Why are you here? Did I not tell you to leave?

349
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:14,200
My feet were too heavy...

350
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,890
I just could not leave.

351
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:17,860
Dan Oh...

352
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,320
What about I go and get the declaration?

353
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,320
That is nonsense.

354
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,340
I will see you out. Get ready at once.

355
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,140
Why is it nonsense?

356
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:34,640
I am the only one here who can disguise myself as a palace lady.

357
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,820
Hostess Yoon will be able to enter Queen Dowager's quarters without suspicion.

358
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,920
We should trust Dan Oh with this one.

359
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,170
- We do not have much time. 
 - You already know, too.

360
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:48,730
Dan Oh has entered the palace before.

361
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,290
If someone was to recognize her...

362
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:54,450
It will be okay as long as I stay out of the king's sight.

363
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,590
On the day of Eunyoungyeon...

364
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:24,730
Once the rebellion is over... I plan to leave right after.

365
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,620
You are going to leave?

366
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:38,940
Please understand... even if I leave without a word.

367
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:58,320
 Gyeom...

368
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,120
 My son...

369
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:07,200
 Please... be happy.

370
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:12,430
 I am sorry...

371
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,400
 Mother.

372
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:29,640
Eunyoungyeon is right around the corner.

373
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:35,960
Since we do not know what the situation is...

374
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,640
Even if things go wrong, I will die as Lee Seol.

375
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,360
I will consider it a consequence of using that name.

376
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,260
Your Highness...

377
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,850
please keep your spirit strong.

378
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:58,210
Even if I die, my brother lives.

379
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:02,820
He will surely take down the king.

380
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:55,250
By the way, what do you plan to do at the palace?

381
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:58,340
I mean, I have all to gain, including this ornament.

382
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,820
They said there is a party.

383
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:04,010
It must be so splendid and beautiful.

384
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:08,940
You must go, right?

385
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,310
Your Majesty!

386
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:25,900
Eunyoungyeon is happening soon, so you should come and

387
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,180
grace us with your presence, Mother.

388
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,680
The feast will be quite a grand one.

389
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,300
You do not say, Seol...

390
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:40,950
You need to see the body of your grandson getting ripped apart ever so hopelessly.

391
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:45,860
What are you going to do to the deposed crown prince's son?

392
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:49,590
You will find out if you come.

393
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,690
I put in a word already, so head to Queen Dowager's pavilion right away.

394
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:42,260
Yes. You told me many times already.

395
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,560
Please do not worry.

396
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,170
It is the same for me.

397
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:54,910
If I lose you, I will not be able to take even a step forward.

398
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:02,320
So, please... focus on yourself from this moment.

399
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,230
Gu Nam should be here by now, but why do I not see him?

400
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:20,670
We should wait for him for now, right?

401
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:22,330
The party starts soon.

402
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:25,410
If we are late, Yoo Ha can be in danger.

403
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,420
You may enter.

404
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,920
We are the traveling performers from Namsangol.

405
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,520
The king had ordered us to come to the party.

406
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,770
Wait. You seem somewhat familiar.

407
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:50,700
Where could you have seen a lowly one like me?

408
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:55,600
That is incorrect. I have seen you from somewhere for sure.

409
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:11,030
Please let them in now!

410
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:16,060
You came in person, Royal Guard?

411
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:21,800
If the party gets delayed because of them, His Majesty will be furious.

412
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,200
- Hurry up and get inside! 
 - Yes.

413
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,350
Do not let your guard down even for a second.

414
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:43,340
 Yes, sir!

415
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:52,720
What brings you here?

416
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,900
Are you saying... the deposed crown prince's son will be executed at Eunyoungyeon?

417
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,590
Yes. That is correct.

418
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:07,400
 Come and save me. I will be waiting.

419
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:10,440
 We can do that.

420
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,230
That was it, huh?

421
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:19,170
The reason he asked for three days.

422
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:56,080
Let us go.

423
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:20,190
Here is your sword you asked me to keep.

424
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:44,860
Could you be Ihwawon's Hostess Yoon?

425
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,140
Yes.

426
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:48,970
Are you from Queen Dowager's pavilion?

427
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:51,120
Please come with me.

428
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:26,790
Hide in here and escape around the time the party comes to an end.

429
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:28,420
Yes, Queen Dowager.

430
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:32,750
Right. There is one more thing Seol asked me for.

431
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:45,100
He told you to keep yourself safe.

432
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:48,200
However, do you know how to use a bow?

433
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,950
Yes, I learned from the deposed crown prince's son.

434
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:53,120
-  Your Highness! You cannot...  
  - Your Highness!

435
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,730
- Your Highness! 
 - You cannot do this!

436
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:01,100
Royal Consort, you cannot barge in here like this.

437
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,550
What is the matter?

438
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:10,210
His Majesty told me to bring you in person.

439
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:12,040
Please come.

440
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:26,970
I-I am getting dizzy...

441
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:30,130
Come and give me a hand.

442
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:24,370
Do you find courtesans' dancing to be that entertaining?

443
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:27,040
Is it not exciting?

444
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:35,140
The finale of the party will be redder and more splendid than this.

445
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,330
Yes.

446
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:51,620
Chief Administrator Jang is asking to see you.

447
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:52,960
Chief Administrator Jang is?

448
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,840
Yes, he said it was urgent.

449
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:00,410
Please tell His Majesty.

450
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:04,170
The remnants of the deposed crown prince's son's men might have snuck into the palace.

451
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:06,560
Are you sure about that?

452
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:13,470
My Lord, a few Royal Guard who were on patrol are missing.

453
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:16,570
It might be those men's doing.

454
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:19,670
Go and hunt them down while I report to the king.

455
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:21,450
I will lend you my men.

456
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:23,410
Yes, My Lord.

457
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:14,950
Your Majesty.

458
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:17,390
The remnants of the deposed crown prince's son's men snuck into the palace.

459
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:20,700
Then, just go and capture his remnants.

460
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:24,930
We can just kneel them out there, too.

461
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:27,830
Please pause the party while the situation is under control—

462
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:30,530
Do not say one more word.

463
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:34,400
It is finally getting interesting.

464
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:44,400
Since the traitor who has been on the run for more than a decade was caught,

465
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,610
this is a great joy for the royal family.

466
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:54,840
Therefore, I will decorate the finale of the party by executing the deposed crown prince's son, Lee Seol.

467
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,180
Proceed!

468
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,970
 Yes!

469
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:19,680
No way.

470
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:22,470
Are they executing dismemberment at the palace?

471
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:24,560
What kind of madness is this?

472
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,170
The deposed crown prince's son, on top of that.

473
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:29,270
Just wait and see.

474
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:36,740
My blood will not be washed away and remain... constricting you, the king.

475
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:45,320
This country's subjects and people... are not weak enough to cower in fear.

476
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:51,950
What are you all doing? Tear apart his limbs right now!

477
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:53,860
 Yes!

478
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:30,050
Watchman...

479
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:33,130
I get to meet you here.

480
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:35,020
Go on ahead.

481
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,510
I will take care of things here.

482
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:39,570
Will you be okay?

483
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,140
We do not have time for this.

484
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:45,990
Hurry up and go.

485
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:49,580
Come at me!

486
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:39,820
Are the children... still safe?

487
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:46,170
Was compassion ever a part of you?

488
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:55,250
I will kill you without fail... and console my son's spirit.

489
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:18,560
Make sure to remember this.

490
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:26,010
What you see right now...

491
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:32,550
is... your true self...

492
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:43,530
Watchman...

493
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,190
You are only a...

494
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:53,060
man-slaughtering fiend...

495
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:56,980
who cannot forget the taste of murder.

496
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:02,000
 You make my skin crawl!

497
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:10,490
 With the same hand that held my hand, you must have shed so many people's blood.

498
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:23,250
Even though I knew...

499
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:27,910
I was going to die by your hands...

500
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:32,410
I had to find you.

501
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:40,630
That is the...

502
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:43,750
heart of a father...

503
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:49,190
who lost a son...

504
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:19,450

505
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:25,360
♫  Do I just need to wait endlessly?  ♫

506
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:31,340
♫  Can you hear my heart?  ♫

507
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:37,080
♫  My heartbeat flows toward you  ♫

508
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,780
 Even if I do die, I will have him killed at least.

509
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:40,820
 Hurry up and go!

510
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,380
 What on Earth are you scheming?

511
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:43,800
 I came to reclaim my seat.

512
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,910
 I am... I am Lee Seol.

513
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:47,790
 Go find Lee Seol and tell him.

514
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:51,570
 That I am waiting for him at the deposed crown prince's son's execution site.

515
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:55,550
 I will resent and hate you as long as I am alive.

516
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,960
 Since we have a new king, please receive his order now.

517
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:00,280
 If you surrender voluntarily, I will not kill you.

518
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:02,220
 This country is mine.

519
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:08,190
 It is my Joseon I protected by shedding the blood of many!
