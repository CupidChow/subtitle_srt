1
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,930

2
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,810

3
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,210

4
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,250

5
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:44,470

6
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:50,380

7
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,220
Why does it have to be a place like this?

8
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,380
Are you him?

9
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,520
"Jade dust."

10
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,830
Stop looking for him.

11
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,840
Unless you want to die.

12
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,040
I cannot do that.

13
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,840
I can cut your throat right now.

14
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:37,800
Even if you do, my answer will not change.

15
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,360
I told you.

16
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,040
This will not do anything.

17
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:58,950

18
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:04,500
What are you... all doing here?

19
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,910
"If you want to find 'Jade dust'...

20
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:16,370
come to the abandoned house next to the guardian tree in Namsangol."

21
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,130

You made a deal with Chief Administrator?

22
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,690
He will forgive your debt if you find Lee Seol?

23
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,380
Yes.

24
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,450
Wow, Dan Oh is... more courageous than men.

25
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:35,530
I heard the Left State Minister Shin Won Ho is the one backing Chief Administrator.

26
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,290
True. How else could a 5th junior-ranking chief administrator go around making a fuss?

27
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,080
It is because he has someone strong backing him.

28
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,940
He cannot be looking for "Jade dust" just for fun.

29
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,480
It must be the king's order.

30
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,050
If so, is Dan Oh carrying out the king's order?

31
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:53,220
She would be the first to succeed before any of us at this rate.

32
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,890
It is a too dangerous thing to do.

33
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,710
- You should try to get money instead— 
 - Money?

34
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,140
- It is easy for a rich young master to say. 
 - What?

35
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,610
For someone who does not even have a penny,

36
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,440
is there anything more difficult to get than money?

37
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,160
Just give up.

38
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,530
Do not risk your life trying to look for Lee Seol.

39
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,530
You are being foolish.

40
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,940
I have a reason... to protect Ihwawon.

41
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:32,810
No matter what you all say, I will make sure to find Lee Seol.

42
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,450
Then... let us join her.

43
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,820
Sounds good!

44
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,790
I think it would be fun, too.

45
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,300
You are all crazy!

46
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,160
I guess it would be fun to watch all of you freaking out.

47
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,460
You never know.

48
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,580
We might end up... finding him somehow.

49
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,590
Deposed Prince Lee Seol or whatever his name is.

50
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,530
No.

51
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,100
You should stay out of it.

52
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,980
- Dan Oh. 
 - Yoon Dan Oh.

53
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,690
What will you do all by yourself?

54
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:08,690
I cannot bring you all into something that is dangerous.

55
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,050
Let us go.

56
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,860
Why are you not sleeping?

57
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,580
Just because.

58
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,860
I cannot sleep.

59
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,330
I am sure.

60
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,380
You put yourself in deep trouble.

61
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:03,820
Thinking about it, you are the first one.

62
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,050
What do you mean?

63
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,540
The one who pointed a sword at me.

64
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,880
A real sword, even.

65
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,860
"I'm not afraid of anything."

66
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,570
Is that your specialty?

67
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:16,070
I am scared, too.

68
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:20,480
I also know that you are worried because of me, too.

69
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,320
If you are,

70
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,810
it is not too late to quit.

71
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:32,070
But... I should protect my family no matter how scared I am.

72
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:36,910
Neither the king nor Buddha will protect them for me.

73
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,690
Family?

74
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,460
Do you have a family other than Najudaek?

75
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,200
N-No, but...

76
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,400
All of us, we are all a family together!

77
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,510
We are like a family.

78
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,060
But I am surprised.

79
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,460
Why?

80
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,370
What are you trying to say now?

81
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:08,720
The most aloof person in the world was worried about me so much.

82
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,720
 Are you okay?

83
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,630
 Are you hurt anywhere?

84
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,270
I get it now.

85
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:40,570
You... actually care about the world a lot.

86
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,990
Although you pretend not to be.

87
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,310
What?

88
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:49,290
When you pulled out the wooden sword trying to save a baby, I just knew it then.

89
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:59,330
Not only are you not perceptive, you do not know how to read the air.

90
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,750

(Queen Mother's Chamber)

91
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,970
I suppose Royal Consort Park is here to visit.

92
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,620
Yes, Your Highness.

93
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,990
Your Majesty.

94
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,980
Are you on your way from the Queen Mother's chamber?

95
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,160
Yes.

96
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,160
She did not grant my visit today, either.

97
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,960
How could she treat Prince so coldly?

98
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,190
Are you that anxious?

99
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,320
Pardon?

100
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:52,335
You are anxious that the Crown Prince status will not be given to...

101
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,330
the fake prince you brought.

102
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,380
Your Majesty! I am not sure what you are talking about.

103
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,770
Did you think I would not know?

104
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:15,770
He does not look anything like me.

105
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,350
Y-Your Majesty!

106
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,380
When Brother was alive,

107
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:33,600
you were only a palace maid at the Eastern Palace and you helped me with something then.

108
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,060
Why are you... bringing that up all of a sudden?

109
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,190
I have been keeping an eye on you since.

110
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,400
Neither water nor fire can stop you from being ambitious.

111
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:50,960
If so... will you not punish me?

112
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:01,530
What I needed was just an heir...

113
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,510
to quiet the ministers.

114
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:11,600
That way, I can keep Joseon to myself longer.

115
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,540
Do you know how much I waited?

116
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,240
You should have told me that you would be running late!

117
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,440
Sorry, sorry.

118
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,070
I came back with the scholars yesterday.

119
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,300
Goodness, Najudaek!

120
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,400
You must have worried a lot.

121
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,500
To be honest, last night, Dan Oh—

122
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,620
Brother!

123
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,650
You keep refusing my help.

124
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,010
I should tell Najudaek about the situation—

125
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:53,340
I am worried that all of you might be in danger as well.

126
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,020
So is it okay... for you to be in danger?

127
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,680
Wait...

128
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,580
Did something bad happen to Miss, by chance—

129
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,540
The thing is... you can either call it bad

130
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,240
or good, if you will... It is both important and insignificant—

131
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,100
Okay!

132
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,310
What do you mean?

133
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,450
I get it.

134
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,600
Let us do it together.

135
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,980
Make sure to keep it a secret from Najudaek and Mr. Yook Ho.

136
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,380
Okay?

137
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:49,140
Of course, there is no reason to get them to worry.

138
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,980
What will you do, Kang San?

139
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,210
Do not bother.

140
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:56,260
I will be glad if he does not try to fight us.

141
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,740
Fine!

142
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:04,230
Let us find... Lee Seol, or whatever his name is.

143
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,310
You will not listen to me even if I try to stop you anyhow.

144
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:14,160
You will realize it once you start looking for him what a crazy thing this is.

145
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:20,320
If so... let us talk again tomorrow.

146
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,420
By the way,

147
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:32,320
if Lee Seol were among us, would that not be so interesting?

148
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,510
Are you not being too harsh?

149
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:42,930
I know being rude is your specialty, but Dan Oh is already suffering.

150
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,800
Do not be so harsh on her.

151
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,920
Is being nosy your specialty?

152
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,730
You are too involved in other people's business.

153
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,780
What?

154
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:56,400
You are not related. You and Dan Oh.

155
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,450
- She is a precious— 
 - Precious sister?

156
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,950
That is too trite, is it not?

157
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:12,090
I was going to say she is... a precious woman... to me.

158
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,130
Have a look around.

159
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,120
Have a look at this.

160
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,270
This is...

161
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,290
This is not too bad.

162
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,480
How excellent.

163
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,040
I did not know there would be a secret room like this in the middle of Jungchon.

164
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,400
It is a perfect place to plan a revolt.

165
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,360
This is all thanks to my keen eye.

166
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,500
Is it not thanks to your father, who gave you money?

167
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,210
Is anyone in there?

168
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,240
What is this?

169
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,820
So...

170
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,410
So you are saying... Dan Oh's older sister died, right?

171
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,180
Yes.

172
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,320
That is what I am telling you.

173
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,460
There are Hong Joo and

174
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,710
Dan Oh's father's memorial tablets in the annex. 
  (Tablets with the name of the dead)

175
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:39,670
It is sort of a family shrine.

176
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,770
Family shrine?

177
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:47,200

178
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,820
Why?

179
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,670
Did you see something?

180
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:56,820
Am I not supposed to see something?

181
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,220
People often say they see a lady ghost in the annex.

182
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,170
So I was wondering if you did, too.

183
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,130
No wonder...

184
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,950
She was wearing a mourning dress...

185
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,650
Do not even set foot in the annex.

186
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:16,130
Especially young and handsome men can easily get lured.

187
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,260
I saw it so clearly.

188
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,690
What are you doing in my room?

189
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,080
How interesting.

190
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,520
Do you call this a book of prophecy?

191
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,910
You had better leave.

192
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,600
I did not know you read stuff like this, too.

193
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,840
I can borrow this from you, right?

194
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,810
No way.

195
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,900
He is so prickly.

196
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,800
Why are you not leaving?

197
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,800
Can I sleep with you tonight?

198
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,500
There is no way.

199
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,730
You had better get lost!

200
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,250
No!

201
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:22,280
I do not think I can... sleep alone tonight.

202
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,160
Okay.

203
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,480
Good night. Sleep.

204
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,330
Really?

205
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,810
Will you sleep with me?

206
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,270
You are the best...

207
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,550
Hey!

208
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,080
Why did you turn the light off?

209
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,700
S-San!

210
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,090

211
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,420
 I can cut your throat right now.

212
00:18:53,920 --> 00:19:00,610
 Even if you do, my answer will not change.

213
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,190
 Yoon Dan Oh.

214
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,540
 You will never give up, will you?

215
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,830
Why, you!

216
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,220
Try running away from me!

217
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,470
- You are an animal! 
 - Yes.

218
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:33,570
I will treat you roughly like an animal tonight.

219
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,580
That is enough.

220
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,310
You should just go on your way.

221
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,660
You are only a courtesan. How dare you resist.

222
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,390
How dare you! Do you know who I am?

223
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,580
I do not care who you are.

224
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,450
I will pay for one night with this woman.

225
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,340
Do you object?

226
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,340
No...

227
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:26,170
Thank you for earlier.

228
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:36,540
Then... I will turn the light off first.

229
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,430
Scholar.

230
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,030
Let us say that you got to spend your first night with me.

231
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,990
I do not like to make a fuss.

232
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,440
The court lady committed suicide?

233
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,840
Yes, Your Excellency.

234
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,730
She apparently hung herself on the crossbeam.

235
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:54,700
 As I suspected, he was not His Majesty's seed.

236
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:58,840
Is something troubling you?

237
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,400
There is something I need to confirm.

238
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,040
Find out if there is a family who recently

239
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,570
adopted a daughter in Royal Consort Park's family discreetly.

240
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,380
By an adopted daughter, you mean—

241
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:12,550
Probably an infant who is less than a year old.

242
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:16,300
Find out yourself instead of ordering someone else.

243
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,120
Yes, Your Excellency.

244
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,620
When did you get here?

245
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,560
Just now.

246
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,650
I saw the state exam result notice on the way back.

247
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,720
Looks like you passed, Brother.

248
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,720
Gosh, you are quite impressive!

249
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,640
Should we throw a party or something?

250
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,350
Do not make a fuss. There still is the final exam to take. 
  (Exam is taken in front of the king)

251
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,790
Oh, right.

252
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:05,120
When is your birthday, Brother?

253
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,670
Why would you ask that... out of the blue?

254
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:11,580
We are a family now. I should at least know your birthday.

255
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,140
You do not need to know.

256
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:19,160
But still, I make sure to celebrate everyone's birthday at Ihwawon.

257
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,770
I do not want such a thing as a family.

258
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:25,670
What? Were you two waiting for me?

259
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,760
Geez, I should have come sooner.

260
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,030
Yoo Ha...

261
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,840
You must be very busy these days.

262
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,830
Pardon?

263
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,220
You were always stuck in your room reading books.

264
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,770
But you go out all the time these days for some reason.

265
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,710
I went out for a walk because the weather was nice.

266
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:56,550
Do you like the weather or is it our Dan Oh?

267
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:59,160
Why would you say that?

268
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,220
Young Master!

269
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,700
What is it?

270
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,930
Her Ladyship is...

271
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:09,420
Her Ladyship is gravely ill.

272
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,300
Is this Gil Joon?

273
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,240
Are you awake now?

274
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,170
It is me, Yoo Ha.

275
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,700
Gil Joon...

276
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:58,260
Where is my Gil Joon?

277
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:03,160
Bring Gil Joon here.

278
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:15,980
What do you think of my skills?

279
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,850
I could have made a great swindler.

280
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,030
You totally killed it.

281
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,690
How come that sounded like you want to kill me?

282
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,970
It looks like we are finally on the same page.

283
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,210
- Is Yoo Ha not back yet? 
 - No.

284
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:35,040
He would have said something if he were not returning.

285
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,760
Should I visit his house?

286
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,340
I am sure nothing terrible will happen.

287
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,660
Let us just talk by ourselves.

288
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,010
I could not sleep last night, either.

289
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,150
I was too excited.

290
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:48,250
So how will you find him?

291
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,430
Do you have a clue or something?

292
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:57,400
It turns out the late Grand Prince Geum Ryeong was very close to the deposed crown prince.

293
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,170
If it was Grand Prince Geum Ryeong,

294
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,640
I am sure his family must be completely ruined, too.

295
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,980
Who will you go and find?

296
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,940
The servants who used to live in his house.

297
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,190
I am sure they became government slaves.

298
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:11,330
Then, they probably were sent to different regions, not just Hanyang.

299
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:19,270
I heard they have a list of slaves in Jangyewon. 
  (A government office that kept documents regarding slaves)

300
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:22,740
Maybe I can find some type of a clue if I go there.

301
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,540
In this country of ours, slaves are considered assets.

302
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:28,290
And Jangyewon is like the country's safe.

303
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,240
Is there anything we can do?

304
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,990
How do you break open the safe?

305
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,150
I got an idea.

306
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:50,110
This is my killer idea that book-smart San would never come up with.

307
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:56,360

308
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:00,350
So you want to go inside Jangyewon.

309
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,030
Would that be possible?

310
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,470
While you are on your night shift?

311
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:07,210
My goodness. The law is so strict these days.

312
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,740
It is a bit risky because there are more guards now.

313
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:17,340
Well? I cannot keep my winning streak anymore.

314
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:22,350
I lost.

315
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,600
Well, let me see what I can do.

316
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:34,550
Considering how long we have known each other in gambling houses.

317
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,320
We are in.

318
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:04,100
Thank you very much.

319
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,070
One hundred nyangs more.

320
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:11,220
You remember, right?

321
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,520
The interest is a third of the loan.

322
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,320
You should sit now that you are here.

323
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,840
I will show you how I win all the money.

324
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:33,120
Geez. My appetite is ruined.

325
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,910
Is he the illegitimate son you mentioned?

326
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,550
Do you share the same blood?

327
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,150
Your blood might be dirty, but your looks are—

328
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,340
Why do you not leave now?

329
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:51,750
I was asked to leave... by our illegitimate young master.

330
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,010
Let us go home.

331
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:56,750
You should not be doing this right now.

332
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:01,670
Will this wash away the dirty blood a bit?

333
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:05,020
I cannot stand the stench of the lowly ones.

334
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,770
I am almost getting a headache.

335
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,820
Do not bother.

336
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:15,000
No matter how much liquor you pour on him, his dirty blood will not get washed away.

337
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,530
Thank you for the liquor.

338
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:23,290
Next time, this little brother of yours will treat you instead.

339
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:26,030
You arrogant bastard.

340
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,700
It is not too late to go home.

341
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,990
How could you gamble while Mother is ill?

342
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,820
Let go.

343
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,960
How dare a lowly bastard...

344
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:46,940
If Lord Jeong Yoon saw you like this, he would have been devastated.

345
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:03,960
Will you just leave like that?

346
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,670
Please come with me.

347
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:29,340
Please dry yourself first.

348
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:34,310
I will do it myself.

349
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:46,560
I did not know.

350
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:52,140
That you were the Young Master of Lord Jeong Yoon.

351
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,270
Thank you.

352
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:11,900
I owe you one, Hostess.

353
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,810

354
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:33,140
You will start growing on me since I see you so often.

355
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,380
Excuse us, then.

356
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,930
What is the matter?

357
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,630
- Did I not pay you handsomely? 
 - Come on.

358
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,310
That was for me.

359
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:45,130
These fellas charge separately.

360
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:50,960
- Then, at least— 
 - Will this be enough?

361
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:58,100
Let them pass.

362
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,600
Shift changes in one hour.

363
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,650
Make sure to come back out by then.

364
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,580
You may enter.

365
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:10,010
Be quick with your business.

366
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:30,760
Take your time as you look. I will be next to you.

367
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,680
Not my face.

368
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,990
I am telling you to look there.

369
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:07,310
♫  Beyond countless stars  ♫

370
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,400
It is not here, either.

371
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:17,800
♫  After staying up this night filled with shy smiles  ♫

372
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:23,300
♫  You're glimmering in my eyes  ♫

373
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:31,330
♫  A sorrowful heart falls asleep somewhere deep  ♫

374
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,670
♫  Melting in again, baby your love  ♫

375
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:39,870
♫  Drowning in my imagination  ♫

376
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:44,070
♫  Dazzles my eyes, like the sunlight  ♫

377
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:47,300
♫  Lost in a dream that is you  ♫

378
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:51,290
♫  When I'm walking for countless nights  ♫

379
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:55,140
♫  The star that shines on me  ♫

380
00:33:55,140 --> 00:34:02,850
♫  Whenever it may be, let me be with you  ♫

381
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:08,320

382
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,300

383
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,370
Wake up. Our time is up.

384
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,320
Is it already time?

385
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:46,010

386
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:48,060
I found her!

387
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,540
What?

388
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:52,750
It says she was sent to Hanseongbu.

389
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:55,760
You eventually found her, huh?

390
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,630
I have been wondering since earlier.

391
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:12,070
Do not ask. Whatever it is.

392
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:16,060
The two of you... have a rather suspicious atmosphere.

393
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,970
Wh-What do you mean?

394
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:20,420
I am sure there is something.

395
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:28,200
Those blushing cheeks and those wandering eyes mean—

396
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,270
How is it in season throughout the year?

397
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,300
Your nonsensical talk that is.

398
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,980
Anyhow, it is thanks to you, Brothers.

399
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:39,120
- I will go to Hanseongbu tomorrow— 
 - No, go with—

400
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,500
Go with?

401
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,000
I guess you two have something to do?

402
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,440
Just by yourselves?

403
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,640
I meant, go with everyone.

404
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,770
You, too, Shi Yeol.

405
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,070
What is it you need to tell me?

406
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,400
You were awake?

407
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,240
I woke up.

408
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,550
Thanks to you for waking me up.

409
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,470
You are curious to death, right?

410
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:49,310
Since you were the only one left out of... Bang-seol-dan's first meeting.

411
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,600
Bang what?

412
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,670
Bang, to chase. Lee Seol.

413
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,240
In short, it is called Bangseoldan. 
  (Lee Seol chasers)

414
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,550
I just came up with it.

415
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,150
Crazy good name, right?

416
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,070
So? Were there any dangerous happenings?

417
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,770
What could possibly be dangerous?

418
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:07,920
There were two men. Actually, no.

419
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,050
Was there one?

420
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:11,830
What is that supposed to mean?

421
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:16,590
According to my exceptionally keen and delicate sixth sense,

422
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,700
there was one. I am sure.

423
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,400
If you are going to say something absurd again...

424
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,240
Love blooms and all hell breaks loose between a man and a woman just from a glance.

425
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:33,970
I think I saw that glance... at Jangyewon.

426
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:42,990

427
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:50,660
Oh, right...

428
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,910
I heard you went to Jangyewon yesterday.

429
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,110
Yes.

430
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:58,070
But Brother Shi Yeol was sound asleep when he said he would help—

431
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,730
What about San?

432
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:00,690
Sorry?

433
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:04,130
Since San is always so mean to you.

434
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:06,460
- So I thought he— 
 - No.

435
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,530
He was kind. Very much so.

436
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:15,420
 Love blooms, and all hell breaks loose between a man and a woman just from a glance.

437
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,820
Very much so?

438
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,970
Very, very little.

439
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:23,620
You know how he is always prickly.

440
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,020
I am glad.

441
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,790
What came over him?

442
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:33,910
By the way... where are you headed, Brothe?

443
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,180
You said Hanseongbu, right?

444
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,550
I can drop you off there and go.

445
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,310
Gosh, it is fine.

446
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,230
You said you were going to study today.

447
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,540
I have enough time for that. Let us go.

448
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,610
Excuse me.

449
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:07,260
I heard there is a female servant named Ok Boon here.

450
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,220
Could you get her for me?

451
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,670
I am sorry.

452
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:13,880
They scold me if I goof around instead of working.

453
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:19,780
Ok Boon was... her servant when she was little.

454
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:23,980
Since this maiden will be married off soon, she came to see her for the last time.

455
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,800
How strange.

456
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:30,600
I heard all of His Excellency's family either died or became slaves.

457
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,210
Oh, I see...

458
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,820
That is why your outfit is...

459
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,560
Please wait a moment.

460
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,310
You are more strategic than you look.

461
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:50,010
Your improvisation is really...

462
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:52,920
I was just trying to help. Were you disappointed?

463
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,200
No. You did great.

464
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,760
I apologize for my rude question.

465
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,350
That day's incident must have been a painful trauma for you as well.

466
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:23,570
How lonely must it be to live separated from your family...

467
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:26,710
I really do not know.

468
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:29,300
Crown Prince did come from time to time.

469
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:34,230
But no one was allowed nearby when he was having a conversation.

470
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:39,040
I heard Crown Prince and Grand Prince had an exceptionally strong brotherly bond.

471
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,840
Even if it is a small thing...

472
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:45,500
The woman who served Grand Prince was indeed... a bit flirty.

473
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,130
She might know something.

474
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:50,590
- Would I be able to meet her? 
 - Yes.

475
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:55,910
I heard she left before the incident and became the hostess of an inn.

476
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,430
What was the name?

477
00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:03,020
It was... called Bu-something, located in Jungchon.

478
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,770
- Buyounggak? 
 - Yes, yes.

479
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:08,720
That is right. It is that place.

480
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,080
If it is Buyounggak...

481
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:15,010
Hwa Ryeong?

482
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:39,790
 If Lord Jeong Yoon saw you like this, he would have been devastated.

483
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:46,890
 I did not know... that you were so close to me.

484
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:53,630

485
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,840
Is this really the right thing to do?

486
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,640
Translating from Chinese to Korean.

487
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,930
If you are saying it just because your arm hurts, just quit.

488
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:08,890
Scholar Jeong and I will finish the rest.

489
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:11,300
The people are busy making a living.

490
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,290
Even if there are Korean copies, would they even be interested?

491
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:17,400
Even beggars on the streets do dream in their sleep.

492
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,850
Just because your circumstances are poor, would your dreams also be poor?

493
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,860
I could not agree with you more.

494
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:26,800
If even the poor people could read easily...

495
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:33,050
It will have a great influence in... changing the world.

496
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,820
You ought to be more careful! Geez.

497
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,540
Oh, my.

498
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,850
Are you all right?

499
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,690

500
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:38,780

501
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:56,580
Which one do I need to move... to have a great business?

502
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:13,680
You are late.

503
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:21,380
Leave Hanyang. This is the last warning.

504
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:25,150
As you can see, my limbs are all tied.

505
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:29,120
If you want to live, you will need to make up your mind now.

506
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,180
About whose side to be on.

507
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:34,390
That miss has already chosen the other side, however.

508
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:38,890
Was her name... Dan Oh?

509
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:48,950
Just how much do you know?

510
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:51,160
About "jade dust."

511
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:56,110
You rushed in here like this because you were curious about that?

512
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:59,120
I am on my way from Hanseongbu.

513
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:03,000
And I met Grand Prince Geum Ryeong's servant there.

514
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,570
I did not hide it intentionally.

515
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:08,780
There was no need to tell you.

516
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:14,200
Why did you... tell me not to look for "jade dust"?

517
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,110
You are also the one who told the scholars, are you not?

518
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:19,480
Did he not come to you?

519
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,100
Whom are you talking about?

520
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,980
Watchman.

521
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,600
The one who protects Lee Seol.

522
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:32,500
With a cold, hard sword, he ruthlessly stabs those who smother Lee Seol.

523
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:38,230
Soon enough, his sword might pierce your heart as well, Miss.

524
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:43,300
That is why I told the scholars.

525
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,820
I wished for them to stop you.

526
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,840
If you are done talking, please take your leave now.

527
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:07,930
I... cannot quit.

528
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:13,820
I will never... quit like this.

529
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:19,380
What is the reason you must protect Ihwawon?

530
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:22,800
Do you have personal circumstances you cannot speak of?

531
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:29,120
I cannot tell you too much in detail, but a person's life depends on it.

532
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,510
So, please...

533
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:35,350
If you know anything, please tell me.

534
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,680
I beg of you.

535
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,590
At least for the old time's sake...

536
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,500
There should be a national treasure.

537
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:56,320
National treasure?

538
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:01,540
It is an artifact that Crown Prince... had left for the prince.

539
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:06,840
I heard it is a national treasure that has been passed down only to those who has

540
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,250
the right to inherit the throne for generations.

541
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:12,080
Do you know what it looks like?

542
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:15,820
It has the shape of a dragon engraved on it.

543
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,250
The Royal Guards followed him?

544
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:26,290
Yes.

545
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:30,300
But what does Head Eunuch know that His Majesty kept him alive like this?

546
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,220
We will know once we are there.

547
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:35,950
About what he knows and how he came out unscathed.

548
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:51,320
Watchman?

549
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:08,410
You came for that young lady despite the danger, did you not?

550
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:17,080
Does Yoon Dan Oh truly not know who you are, Scholar?

551
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,300
Shut your mouth.

552
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:22,500
I guess she must be killed, right?

553
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,600
- That woman. 
 - That mouth of yours!

554
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,160
I told you to shut it.

555
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,560
If you keep her alive, she is sure to be a problem later.

556
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,370
Do not ever speak of Dan Oh's name—

557
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:36,460
Could... it be that you have placed her in your heart?

558
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:39,500
If that is not the case, then why?

559
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:48,200
Whichever one it may be, I am good for only one thing.

560
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,380
Confirmation of lineage.

561
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:56,400
Either execute Lee Seol, the deposed crown prince's son, for treachery or put him on the throne.

562
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:04,680
The only one who knows the face of... the grown-up "jade dust" is me.

563
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:14,060
Do not ever come close to Dan Oh.

564
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:19,040
If you do... you will die.

565
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:30,150
- Chase him! 
 -  Yes, sir!

566
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,520
Who was the man who just left?

567
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,980
Was someone here?

568
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,970
Do you wish to die?

569
00:51:57,970 --> 00:51:59,910
I had a glass of alcohol before going to sleep.

570
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:01,890
So I was sound asleep in no time.

571
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:03,920
Tell me honestly.

572
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,230
Who is the man who was with you just now?

573
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:09,510
How could I lie to you, Sir?

574
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:11,610
Having gone through so much trouble at the palace,

575
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:15,460
I was so exasperated that I would not know even if I was to be carried away.

576
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:17,740
Was it Watchman?

577
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,800
Speak up.

578
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,040
Before I rip you apart today!

579
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,260
Was it Watchman?

580
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:34,980
The one you were looking for. Was it not Lee Seol... but Watchman?

581
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:38,940
In that case, our terms...

582
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:43,490
must be adjusted... Sir Chief Administrator.

583
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:15,560
He is this way.

584
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:01,330
Let us go that way.

585
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:56,800
 Does Yoon Dan Oh really not know... who you are, Scholar?

586
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,910
- Gosh, that hurts! 
 - Why are you...

587
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:27,680
You might kill me if I tried to call you twice.

588
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,050
Counterattack is a top priority against ambushes.

589
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:31,430
I will be careful.

590
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:35,700
Sure, sure. I am sure you will.

591
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:38,160
Why are you roaming outside at this late hour again?

592
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,170
I went to Buyounggak.

593
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:45,750
It turns out... the Hostess used to be Grand Prince Geum Ryeong's servant.

594
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:48,400
- The Hostess was? 
 - Yes.

595
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:51,390
So?

596
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:54,760
Is there anything you found out?

597
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:59,560
She said "jade dust" inherited an article from... the deposed crown prince.

598
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:04,570
 If you keep her alive, she will surely be a problem later.

599
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,490
She said it has a dragon-shaped engraving.

600
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:11,200
Would he still have it?

601
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:15,400
How would I know that?

602
00:56:58,170 --> 00:57:00,060
Why did you bother to come to see me?

603
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:01,410
I would have come if you had waited.

604
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:05,570
I had been waiting for ages, Your Majesty.

605
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:07,600
I told you not to call me that.

606
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:14,050
With what title shall I call Your Majesty besides Your Majesty?

607
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,000
Listen to you...

608
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,100
Why do you ask for the items you had entrusted to me?

609
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:30,790
I have my reasons.

610
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:34,540
Brother, wait for me.

611
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:43,450
Brother!

612
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:45,350
Brother...

613
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:01,010
- He is not there. 
 - He is not there.

614
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:05,940
Search each and every clinic in Jungchon if you must, and you must find him.

615
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,770
- Do you understand? 
 -  Yes, sir!

616
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:23,950
Please give me a hand here.

617
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:26,860
There is an urgent patient who has to be moved.

618
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:39,900
Please lend me your help.

619
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:50,800
Stop right there.

620
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:11,010
Open the door of the palanquin.

621
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:34,950

622
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,640

623
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,530
 He told me not to look for her.

624
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:48,890
 Yoon Dan Oh...

625
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:51,930
 He told me not to step a foot near that child.

626
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:54,640
 Are you aware that swordsman is a killer?

627
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,810
 Go ahead and tell me. Let me see how much you know.

628
00:59:56,810 --> 01:00:00,550
 You mean it, right? You will not suddenly change your mind, right?

629
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:02,630
 I will not change my mind.

630
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:04,750
 I wish for no one to get hurt.

631
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:06,800
 I really wish that for this time.

632
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,990
 Am I allowed to kill if the unforeseen happens?

633
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:12,790
 If the same thing happens again, run away.

634
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:16,560
 Are you Watchman, Brother?
