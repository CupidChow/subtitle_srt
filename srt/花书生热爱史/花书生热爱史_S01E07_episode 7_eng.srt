1
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,950

2
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,710

3
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,200

4
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,280

5
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,190

6
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,690

7
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,140

8
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,150
You found Lee Seol.

9
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,060
Who is it?

10
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,350
I am asking you for the last time.

11
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,480
Answer me.

12
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:15,020

13
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,810
There you are, Watchman.

14
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,610
Attack!

15
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,740
Dan Oh!

16
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,280
What on earth is going on? Why is the Chief Administrator—

17
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,410
Let me explain later. We should run for now.

18
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,560
There is a path toward the back.

19
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,630
Let me show you.

20
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,340
I am sorry, sir.

21
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,670
I am causing you so much trouble.

22
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,000
Not at all. Please hurry up now.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,900
You should go without me. I will check the situation.

24
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,470
Dan Oh! What happened?

25
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,530
Sis, we need to leave right now!

26
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,070
I have been waiting for you for a long time.

27
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:01,260
You were looking for the son of the deposed crown prince? Is it really true?

28
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,990
I did not know this would happen.

29
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,360
I just... thought I should protect Ihwawon.

30
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,050
How could you be so foolish?

31
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,530
I saw countless people who died for getting involved in the royal family's business!

32
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,120
It is all my fault.

33
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,900
I am her older sister, but I could not help her at all.

34
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,600
It already happened. What can you do?

35
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,260
Miss must not have had a choice.

36
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,560
By the way, who is the swordsman?

37
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,430
He suddenly showed up and saved you.

38
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,650
It sounded like he was called the Watchman.

39
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,410
I heard he is a warrior who protects the deposed crown prince's son.

40
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,420
I do not know the details, either.

41
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,300
Dan Oh!

42
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,150
You must be surprised.

43
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,470
She is my older sister.

44
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,400
Nice to meet you.

45
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,560
There was a bit of a situation.

46
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,620
I will tell you everything later.

47
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,490
Right.

48
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,860
What was the situation like at the temple?

49
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,050
Did Chief Administrator—

50
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:34,040
When I got there, everyone was gone already.

51
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,510
I see.

52
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,130
By the way, where are we going now?

53
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:43,370
We cannot return to Ihwawon.

54
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,620
We had better leave Hanyang.

55
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,610
It is Namtaeryeong straight ahead.

56
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,610
Let us look for a house to live in.

57
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,050
And we can come back right away.

58
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,090
It would look suspicious if I were gone for days.

59
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,200
If Chief Administrator asks where I am,

60
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,390
tell him you last saw me at the temple, and you do not know.

61
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,630
I will go to Gwacheon when things quiet down.

62
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,570
Make sure to stay in touch.

63
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,200
Yes.

64
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,330
Najudaek...

65
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,830
Let us meet here again after 15 days.

66
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,960
We need to talk about what we will do in the future.

67
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,350
Okay.

68
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,990
How come she is leaving in such a rush?

69
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,200
I know Chief Administrator is scary, but...

70
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,530
Did you know?

71
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,490
Chief Administrator's only son died a while ago.

72
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,730
His daughter-in-law died soon after, too.

73
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:03,020
That daughter-in-law is... Hong Joo.

74
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:10,790
She is a precious girl whom we saved by having her disappear from this world.

75
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:18,850
I guess she is not supposed to be alive.

76
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:29,920
I have never seen swordsmanship like that.

77
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,110
I could see why he is called "the murderer."

78
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,630
 His skills improved a lot more than I expected.

79
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,830
There were two swordsmen.

80
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,290
Maybe there are two Watchmen.

81
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:43,990
One of them could have been the "jade dust".

82
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,050
If Watchman came to save the "jade dust"...

83
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:53,570
Watchman kills everyone and saves only one person, the "jade dust".

84
00:08:54,610 --> 00:09:00,150
But how come he did not kill anyone?

85
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,420
He has the skills to kill more than ten people.

86
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,850
Do you think he let us live for a reason?

87
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,690
The murderer stopped killing?

88
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:15,900
Or... is he not the Watchman?

89
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,450
Firstly, continue looking for Yoon Dan Oh.

90
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,630
She must be hiding something.

91
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,490
Yes, sir.

92
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,960
Where have you been all this time?

93
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,430
I thought everyone had run away because I did not see anyone.

94
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,400
How about Dan Oh?

95
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,150
Is she safe?

96
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,690
What?

97
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,300
I am curious how she is doing without a place to stay.

98
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,700
Do you not know?

99
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,500
How would I know?

100
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,200
I am sure she is okay.

101
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,600
What in the world?

102
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,400
I thought you just saw her or something.

103
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,300

104
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,700
I wonder if Dan Oh is doing well.

105
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,900
I wish I could see her face, at least.

106
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,000
The undercover soldiers are everywhere like that.

107
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,400
How can we visit her?

108
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,300
What a heartless bastard.

109
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,400
Is he not worried about Dan Oh at all?

110
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,600
How could he be carefree?

111
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,600
What is going on?

112
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,000
Are you here to see me, by chance?

113
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,700
Yes. I need to talk to you.

114
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,100
What is it? How will you threaten me this time?

115
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,500
Dan Oh said she is going to Gwacheon.

116
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,300
I thought you might be worried about her.

117
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,300
I'm not worried. She is a smart kid.

118
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,600
I am sure she is doing well wherever she is.

119
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,100
It was you, was it not?

120
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,400
The swordsman who showed up at the temple.

121
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,600
When you got shot by a poison arrow last time,

122
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,900
I noticed you were carrying a real sword instead of your usual wooden sword.

123
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,200
So I studied it carefully.

124
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,600
And?

125
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,000
That swordsman had the same sword.

126
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:21,100
All swordsmen have the same swords. Let us go if you are done.

127
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,400
Did your feelings grow that much?

128
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,900
So much so that you would protect her by risking your principles and life?

129
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,300
Yes. It just happened like that.

130
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,000
So you should protect her in your own way, too.

131
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,000
Do as you feel like.

132
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,600
And I will, too.

133
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,600
We have been watching them for over 15 days.

134
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,300
But we did not notice anything strange about the scholars.

135
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:06,000
We have to find Yoon Dan Oh to find out where the swordsman is.

136
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,700
Do not let your guard down.

137
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:15,600
I heard one of the scholars at Ihwawon is a military service applicant.

138
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,200
What was his name?

139
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,900
It is a man named Kang San.

140
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,400
He passed the first round because he is good at archery.

141
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,800
Kang San.

142
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,000
Find out where he is from and where he grew up.

143
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,600
Jong Soo, I want you to do it yourself.

144
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,900
Yes, sir.

145
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,100
Give me a bowl of rice wine.

146
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,600
 By chance, he didn't get caught, did he?

147
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,400
 The soldiers ran after him as if they wanted to kill him.

148
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,200
Dan Oh.

149
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,600
What are you thinking about?

150
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,600
It is nothing.

151
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,800
By the way, I do not see Najudaek.

152
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,400
Did she go somewhere?

153
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,000
- She went to Hanyang. 
 - What?

154
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,500
Why would she go to Hanyang?

155
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,600
- Did something happen? 
 - No.

156
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,400
She is looking for your potential husband material.

157
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,000
I told her to.

158
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,600
Sis!

159
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,500
You cannot keep living this way.

160
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,600
But this is not right!

161
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,200
What would you do if I got married?

162
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,800
There is a temple called Gwaneumsa that only has female monks.

163
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,000
I explained my situation, and they said they would take me.

164
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,400
No way.

165
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,600
How could you do this without discussing it with me—

166
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,800
You also looked for the deposed crown prince's son without telling me.

167
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,700
Was that okay to do?

168
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,400
That is...

169
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,500
That is my fault.

170
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,300
So please do not do this.

171
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,000
I work at the tavern now, too.

172
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,400
The three of us can manage.

173
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,500
Until when? Will you hide for the rest of your life?

174
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,100
By barely managing to eat?

175
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,600
I cannot let my sister live like that.

176
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Let us see here...

177
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,000
Please cut us some slack.

178
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,400
Why would I...

179
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,600
I bought it to give to my wife if I get married.

180
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:51,400
Your daughter has reached pretty high within marriageable age.

181
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,600
Hold on.

182
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,700
You did not marry?

183
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,800
She is like my daughter.

184
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,400
She did get a marriage proposal before.

185
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,800
It was from Sir Ong.

186
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:11,800
S-So she was the lady who rejected Sir Ong!

187
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,000
Well, she did not exactly reject him.

188
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,600
How is Sir Ong doing?

189
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,100
He got married over 15 days ago.

190
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,200
If so... can you think of anyone else?

191
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,000
This is the only family that can accept her...

192
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,900
Goodness! At least she does not have to do hard work!

193
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,600
Sir Kim, who is over 60 years old?

194
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,300
And not even as his wife, but a mistress?

195
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,400
So how did it go?

196
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,000
I looked into the distant relatives, too.

197
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,900
But as you said,

198
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:05,300
there really was a family that adopted a girl who was less than a year old.

199
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,300
 They could not bring themselves to kill her.

200
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,600
 She is Lady Park's bloodline, after all.

201
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,200
The family became very wealthy ever since they adopted her.

202
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,100
Not to mention growth in wealth,

203
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:24,100
but they even own farmland in Gochang that was previously owned by Lady Park's family.

204
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,400
 Your Majesty.

205
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,200
A prince less than 100 days old has never been made the future crown prince before.

206
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,600
Also, the Queen is still alive—

207
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,000
You know that it is difficult for her to conceive because of her chronic ailment!

208
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,400
You do not want him because he has dirty blood from Lady Park.

209
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,300
Do you think I do not know how dark your hearts are?

210
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,400
The future crown prince will be the national foundation of Joseon and will eventually become the king.

211
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
Please think this through carefully, Your Majesty!

212
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,700
 Think this through carefully, Your Majesty!

213
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,800
Crown prince! That damn crown prince!

214
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,100
I have been tormented for decades trying to conceive a crown prince.

215
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,600
Affairs of the state* in the day and intercourse* at night! 
  (These two words sound the same in Korean)

216
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,800
I am so sick and tired of it.

217
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:17,700
Could there be... an heir, all of you have in mind?

218
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,800
Was his name mentioned in the forbidden book?

219
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,600
Your Majesty, it is treason to nominate the deposed crown prince's son as the crown prince.

220
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,000
I am afraid just thinking about it.

221
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,200
Please withdraw those words, Your Majesty.

222
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,700
Prince is a child of a concubine, but he is the one with royal blood.

223
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:45,400
I think it is necessary to designate him as the future crown prince as soon as possible in order to stabilize the royal family.

224
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,200
Minister of Defense, you are truly a loyal subject.

225
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:59,300
As we designate him as the future crown prince, Lady Park will be made the 1st-grade royal concubine as well.

226
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,400
Anyone who is opposed to it will be considered a traitor.

227
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,600
So, keep that in mind.

228
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,400
Congratulations, Royal Consort.

229
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,600
Royal Consort?

230
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,600
I feel like it was just yesterday

231
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,200
when I entered the palace as a palace maid and lived a tough life.

232
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,900
You are the biological mother of the future crown prince. You certainly deserve it.

233
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,000
Thank you.

234
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,900
What did you want to talk about?

235
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,400
I need to visit Queen Mother's Palace with the future crown prince soon.

236
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,400
It is regarding the Queen Mother's Palace.

237
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,600
Did you know...

238
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,400
that the Queen Mother's Palace is the place that funds the Watchman?

239
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,200
What?

240
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:50,240
So you are telling me to plant someone at the Queen Mother's Palace.

241
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,270
Yes.

242
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:57,740
There must be someone they regularly contact to provide funds.

243
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,930
If you find him, you could find Lee Seol's Watchman, too.

244
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:06,980
Furthermore, I could even find Lee Seol, too.

245
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,900
I already assigned a palace maid.

246
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,870
I will tell her to watch the Queen Mother's Palace carefully in secret.

247
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,700
I do not need the medicine.

248
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,550
I will accelerate the schedule and go to the temporary palace in Onyang today.

249
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,180
Get ready for it.

250
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,800
Yes, Your Highness.

251
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,900
I will escort you as soon as I am ready.

252
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,360
Here are the funds for the Watchman.

253
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,830
Deliver it to him.

254
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,520
Yes, Your Highness.

255
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:04,410
The more often you leave the palace, the more suspicious you will appear to the king.

256
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:08,880
You need to hurry up and find someone to do this for you.

257
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,930
If they find out where Watchman lives,

258
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:20,560
my Seol... will not be able to live.

259
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,020

260
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:31,040
I am currently searching for Yoon Dan Oh.

261
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,950
- I understand. You may leave now. 
 - Yes, Your Excellency.

262
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:58,760
I let everyone leave. You may sit and relax.

263
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:13,370
I heard you are helping Chief Administrator look for the "jade dust".

264
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,350
Yes, that is correct.

265
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:21,610
In order to bring order to the royal palace, we need to kill the "jade dust" as soon as possible

266
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:26,990
- and prevent future troubles. 
 - Killing the "jade dust" will not fix the problem.

267
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:34,500
The royal line might end because there is no son in the royal family.

268
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,370
How could Joseon find its order?

269
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,270
What do you mean, the royal line might end?

270
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,500
There is a prince.

271
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,910
His Majesty apparently works through his anxiety with superstition.

272
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:50,810
He once mentioned the legend of the abandoned child.

273
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:56,340
The great king in the legend also could not have a son.

274
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,400
But did you know this?

275
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:05,150
When the great king ended up having a seventh daughter, he threw the princess into the river.

276
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,790
Do you mean Lady Park gave birth to a princess?

277
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,150
She is the Royal Consort now.

278
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:14,670
His Majesty elevated her status himself.

279
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,630
When she was giving birth,

280
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:20,100
the court lady who was caring for Royal Consort Park committed suicide.

281
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,460
The male and female physicians from Hosanchung who were in charge of the birth 
  (A temporary government agency to aid in royal births)

282
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,550
all left the palace, and they were nowhere to be found.

283
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:29,040
Do you think... that was just a coincidence?

284
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,480
Let me ask you this.

285
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,830
Were you really not able to find the "jade dust"?

286
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:39,450
I do not know anything.

287
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:44,390
If I had found the "jade dust," I would have notified Chief Administrator immediately.

288
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,060
Do not tell him.

289
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,610
Chief Administrator Jang cannot find the "jade dust".

290
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:52,870
- You mean— 
 - We cannot give the "jade dust" to some lowly chief administrator.

291
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:56,130
He deserves to be treated so much better.

292
00:23:56,130 --> 00:24:00,350
 Is he planning to put the "jade dust" on the throne?

293
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,940
Take it.

294
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,930
Did you say you are no longer a eunuch but a merchant?

295
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:28,370
Do you trust me, Your Excellency?

296
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,780
I do not.

297
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:39,020
But a crafty man like you is good at finding a way to survive.

298
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,800
Do the math carefully.

299
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:48,380
Whose side do you have to be on to survive?

300
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,950
Dan Oh, how have you been...

301
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,590
Good to see you again, sir.

302
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:31,670
We need to change all the door handles.

303
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,410
What are you doing here, Madam?

304
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,470
There are a lot of things to fix here.

305
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,970
I am planning to live in the main house for now.

306
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,530
Is this Chief Administrator's doing again?

307
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:44,550
I am just doing my best as the head hostess.

308
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:06,320
You were waiting for the lady who lived in the main house, right?

309
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,680
I apologize for earlier.

310
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,420
It is okay.

311
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:16,750
I wanted to live normally in a house like this with a husband.

312
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:20,330
Goodness, time is so futile.

313
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,900
I was not born as a courtesan, either.

314
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:35,410
As soon as the crown prince was dethroned,

315
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:40,240
my father abandoned his position and lived as a hermit.

316
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,150
The king who took the throne was not satisfied with killing the crown prince

317
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:48,890
and he tried to find and kill the deposed crown prince's son.

318
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:55,370
My father appealed with a petition against the decision trying to stop him

319
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,870
and was cornered as a traitor...

320
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:05,210
What is your... late father's name?

321
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:09,960
He worked as an officer at the Office of Special Advisors.

322
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,170
His name was Im Ji Gook.

323
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:19,230
If so, what happened to your family?

324
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,350
My brother...

325
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:28,870
was beheaded with my father and my mother passed away recently due to an illness.

326
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:35,030
That is why... I ended up at Buyounggak alone.

327
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:43,940
I did not know... that you had a story like that.

328
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,900
We are leaving now. Are you really not joining us?

329
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,190
Get going.

330
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:05,580
It is not good to go as a big group anyway.

331
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:40,900
Let us break up here. We need to divert them.

332
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:44,160
That is a good idea. I will meet you down below.

333
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,360
Who is this?

334
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,830
We are from Hanseongbu.

335
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:37,380
We need to check something. Step aside.

336
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,050
Hanseongbu?

337
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,600
Oh, no. What do we do?

338
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,160
This is not in the jurisdiction of Hanseongbu.

339
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,150
Surround him!

340
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:55,030
Hyungnim, he got away.

341
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,570
- Let us go! 
 - Let us go!

342
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,300
Let us go!

343
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,430
You came all the way here!

344
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,040
So, this is where you live, Dan Oh.

345
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,450
Have you been well?

346
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,830
Yes, of course.

347
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,970
You look quite disappointed.

348
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,660
I guess you wish another certain person were here.

349
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,830
Gosh, not at all.

350
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,070
I am surprised because I am glad to see you.

351
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:35,330
Forget it if that certain person is San. He probably will not be able to come.

352
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,870
Why?

353
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:39,590
Did something bad happen to him?

354
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,300
Something bad?

355
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,760
I did not know, but San was also a man.

356
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,190
Having a great time with the courtesans in Buyounggak—

357
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:52,300
He has been busy day and night since the third stage examination was very near.

358
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,880
Gosh, what's this?

359
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,030
Is everyone doing well at Ihwawon?

360
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:19,840
Of course. Everyone is doing well.

361
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,260
Although it is crowded with people, unlike how quiet it used to be.

362
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,930
Ahjussi is worried sick about you.

363
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:30,330
Please tell Ahjussi that I am sorry.

364
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,770
He must be deeply disappointed in me.

365
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,260
I will do that.

366
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:38,800
However, I am sure he is worried, not disappointed.

367
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,800
Since he cherishes you like his own daughter.

368
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,120
Yes.

369
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,680
That is why I am more apologetic.

370
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:48,830
Have you been doing well all this time?

371
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,070
You asked that already.

372
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:54,250
I have been doing very well.

373
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,220
I have not been doing well.

374
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,270
I have missed you, Dan Oh.

375
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,460
I am just telling you how I was.

376
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,760
It is great to see you like this.

377
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:12,340
I also feel at ease seeing you, Brother.

378
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,890
Are you only going to stay in your room?

379
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:21,160
It is such a nice day.

380
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,710
You finally came out.

381
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:42,190
- Let us go on a walk— 
 - That song...

382
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:44,800
Where did you hear it from?

383
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,180
The song you were humming just now.

384
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,630
I heard it just once a long time ago.

385
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:55,030
From a wanderer that I met at a tavern.

386
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:59,670
Do you... still remember that?

387
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,710
It remained in my memories.

388
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:04,610
Since that day was the worst day of my life.

389
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:09,010
While I was swallowing the bitter alcohol at the tavern,

390
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:12,650
the wanderer at the next table was drinking it like it was honey.

391
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,460
So I asked him.

392
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,580
"What makes you look so happy?"

393
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:21,470
What did... the wanderer say?

394
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,650
He said he was soon to marry the one he was in love with.

395
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:35,150
Well, anyhow. I guess you liked that song, huh?

396
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,060
Seeing how you are asking about it like this.

397
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,510
- I did not. 
 - If you like that song...

398
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:41,310
I will sing it often for you.

399
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,350
I am a scholar who knows elegance and has a taste for the arts.

400
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,990
I can sing and dance very well.

401
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:48,240
- Maybe a dance next time— 
 - I am fine.

402
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,000
Please do not ever sing that song again.

403
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,750
Chief Administrator Jang wants to meet you.

404
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,160
He wants to meet me?

405
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:18,130
- For what reason? 
 - Come to Buyounggak at the Hour of the Dog.

406
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,360

407
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,400
All right.

408
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,380
How did you get into martial arts?

409
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:42,120
What reason would a soldier have for picking up a sword

410
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,840
except to pass the martial exam and serve His Majesty?

411
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,680
That is the biggest honor.

412
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,920
I see.

413
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,000
I will also be looking forward to the third stage exam.

414
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,900
Since you welcome me so much, I do not know what to say.

415
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,030
Why did you want to see this humble servant?

416
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:10,420
Have you... heard of Six Swords?

417
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,690
This is my first time hearing it.

418
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,130
It is a private organization made up only of young warriors.

419
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:25,810
They are talented individuals who are indispensable to this nation.

420
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:28,280
Although the men of books gained power,

421
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:34,120
warriors are the only ones who will be there to protect the country in times of crisis.

422
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:38,900
There is one vacancy, so I am looking for new talent.

423
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:45,810
I am considering you to be that new talent.

424
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,080
I would like to decline.

425
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,500
I am still too lacking to be called a talent.

426
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,600
Your humbleness is exaggerated.

427
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,120
I heard you are good with bows.

428
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:06,340
Next time, let us go hunt together.

429
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,050
San!

430
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,210
Wow, fancy seeing you here.

431
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:29,860
What brings you to Hanyang?

432
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:33,220
I came to meet someone who would be helping me pass the exam.

433
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:38,950
Since I lack skills, unlike you... I need to do my best by all means.

434
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:42,680
Anyway, I am glad to hear that.

435
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,830
Gosh, it is cold.

436
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:06,760
Will it be okay to leave Dan Oh like that?

437
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:11,210
Just let her be or... are you going to get her a house or something?

438
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:14,000
I just might get her one.

439
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,070
You better not.

440
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:20,140
You couldn't even give her a bag of rice, worried she might feel burdened,

441
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,820
and ended up making me give it to her.

442
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,470
That is...

443
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:27,070
You are too quick for no good reason.

444
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:29,130
You still did well.

445
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:31,240
I went to the kitchen earlier and

446
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,000
- they had no rice at all. 
 - Really?

447
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,500
Is she too tight financially?

448
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,780
Working at the tavern could not be easy, right?

449
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:50,940
I am more concerned about Lady Hong Joo.

450
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,870
She does not step a foot outside.

451
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:00,020
Yes. That man is San of the Kang family.

452
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,350
How can I not recognize my childhood friend?

453
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:05,070
Since when have you two been that close?

454
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,750
It has been more than a decade.

455
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:11,200
Before San came to Hanyang, we lived in the same neighborhood.

456
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,770
Do you have an open spot over there?

457
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,650
Aigoo, let me join you.

458
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:53,810
Let me raise the stakes a little.

459
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,790
Eat these on your way.

460
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,560
Thank you.

461
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,950
Dan Oh,

462
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:09,560
if there is a way for you to come back to Ihwawon, what will you do?

463
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,270
Are you still sleeping?

464
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,530
I want to give you something before I go.

465
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:39,210
They had blossomed beautifully on the road.

466
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:44,100
Let us go for a walk and see them next time.

467
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,350
It is quite the sight.

468
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,510
I do not want to.

469
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:54,900
Please never bring such things again.

470
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,880
- Maiden... 
 - We will not be seeing each other again.

471
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,120
Going on a walk together is even more out of the question.

472
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,190
What do you mean by that?

473
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:05,400
I am entering a temple soon.

474
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,690
A temple?

475
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:11,880
Could it be... you will become a female monk?

476
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,600
Is this how it feels to be a loyal subject who was given poison as a death sentence?

477
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,000
There is an equal amount of despair and anger.

478
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,600
Looks like you might even cry now.

479
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,800
I already cried in my heart.

480
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,600
I had tears fill up to my chin.

481
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,200
How fascinating.

482
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,600
How could you get so emotional when you have not known Maiden Hong Joo for that long?

483
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,200
You have no idea.

484
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,200
Affection is not something that grows over time.

485
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,900
What?

486
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:00,500
If that were true, something would have surely happened between you and Dan Oh.

487
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,100
Did something happen with Brother Shi Yeol?

488
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,000
You threw out the flowers he gave you.

489
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,390
 Dan Oh!

490
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,700
 Why are you taking so many flowers?

491
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,600
 You need a flower carriage to ride on your way to the wedding.

492
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,500
 This one will be pretty.

493
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:38,400
 - How pretty. 
 - Miss!

494
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,600
 Miss!

495
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:51,200
I was just... reminded of what happened back then.

496
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,800
Sister,

497
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,300
- that happening... 
 - That it was an accident?

498
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,600
I know.

499
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:03,800
I was playing with flowers... when my husband-to-be was dying.

500
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,900
So leisurely at that.

501
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:12,370
Where would you see such an accident?

502
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:32,800
 Please save me!

503
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,400
 Please save me.

504
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,700
 Please save me!

505
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,700
 - Scholar, this way, please. 
 - Start moving!

506
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,800
Why are you taking the child away?

507
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,300
He does not even look ten years old.

508
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:01,000
There was a royal decree to execute all sinners who read "Three Secret Prophecies of Joseon."

509
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,400
So are you going to kill that small child or something?

510
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,700
We are only following orders.

511
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,300
Do not let it show so much.

512
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,300
They will also take you away if you do so.

513
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,500
What?

514
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,000
San also reads that book.

515
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,200
You introduced it to him, right?

516
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:26,590
You go on ahead. I have to stop by a place.

517
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,400
Sir, I am sorry for coming late.

518
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,600
Let us go.

519
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:02,100

520
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,700
It was you.

521
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,900
The woman I saw at the temple.

522
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,800
Yes, you are right.

523
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,700
Are you disappointed, perhaps?

524
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:36,800
- That a mere courtesan... 
 - I was just surprised.

525
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:41,000
I always wished for a world where even people like you harbor dreams.

526
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,900
Is that why... you volunteer to do such dangerous work?

527
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,000
Are you worried about me right now?

528
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,600
When you are also a part of it.

529
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Refrain from having meetings for a while.

530
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,400
A few scholars were taken from the store, too.

531
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,090
Right.

532
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,800
About your inheritance...

533
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,400
You have something else other than the land you sold, right?

534
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,600
- How did you know? 
 - Make sure to keep it safe.

535
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,600
It will come in handy in the future.

536
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,800
You seem to know everything about me, Hostess.

537
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,000
For some reason.

538
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,500
I had a relationship...

539
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,700
not with you, but with your father.

540
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:34,000
Are you talking about His Excellency Jeong Yoon?

541
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,850
No.

542
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,400
I meant your biological father.

543
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,600
It is a relationship from ages ago.

544
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:03,290
D-Did you just say... my biological father?

545
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,490
Yes.

546
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:22,000
This is the will your...

547
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,110
biological father gave me.

548
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:36,400

549
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
My Lady.

550
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,800
I found this outside in the front.

551
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,800
Does it belong to you by chance?

552
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,600
What is it?

553
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,000
What is this?

554
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,600
It looks like a very valuable item.

555
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,800
You think so, too. Right?

556
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:02,400
It looks like a cover, maybe?

557
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,100
It was yours, huh, Dan Oh?

558
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,800
But did you not say you lost it?

559
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,900
It looks like a dragon engraving, too...

560
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:29,300
Where did you get such a valuable-looking thing?

561
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,800
 It has the shape of a dragon engraved on it.

562
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,100
 Could this engraving be...

563
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:45,900
 It is an artifact that the Crown Prince had left for his father.

564
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:53,090
What is this letter written here?

565
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,300
 I must go. I promised to meet up with Nanny.

566
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,800
 If you go right now, it will be dangerous.

567
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,600
 The soldiers might still be there.

568
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:17,600
 Miss!

569
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,200
 Miss Dan Oh!

570
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,400
 Miss!

571
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:45,400
 I thought you left without saying a word.

572
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,710
 What is your name?

573
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:58,320
 You are really funny.

574
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,720
 You ask for my name now that it is time for you to go?

575
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:04,700
 You saved my life.

576
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:08,010
 So I must know your name, at least.

577
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:12,670
 My name is Yoon Dan Oh.

578
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:26,180
 Take it.

579
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:29,660
 Someday, I will come back to pay back the favor.

580
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,590
 What is this?

581
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:33,400
 It is called yundo. 
  (A traditional Korean compass.)

582
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,860
 It tells you the direction when you are on a journey.

583
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:39,880
 Why are you giving this to me?

584
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,710
 You are the one going on a journey.

585
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:46,520
 It is the most valuable and precious item I have.

586
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,120
 That is all I have to give you.

587
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:56,670
 Do not tell anyone about my stay.

588
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:59,940
 If things go wrong, your family will also be in danger.

589
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:24,990
Looks like I should not have brought it to you.

590
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:26,810
Not at all.

591
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:31,010
By the way... did you see who left it there?

592
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:35,860
No, it was placed on the floor when I came back.

593
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:47,590
Do you remember... Father's funeral, by any chance?

594
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:49,910
Of course, I do.

595
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:54,420
No one had come to show their condolences.

596
00:51:54,420 --> 00:52:00,390
That just made me sad when I was young. But thinking back after growing up,

597
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:04,490
I started thinking it was rather weird.

598
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:10,320
To be honest, that was during a rebellion.

599
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:14,600
By rebellion... the one that sat His Majesty on the current throne?

600
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,900
Yes.

601
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:19,400
That day was when the deposed crown prince's son escaped.

602
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,880
That was why most streets in the city were blocked off

603
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:25,760
and we could not even deliver the news to the elders of the family.

604
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:30,120
 Then that child was...

605
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:35,800
 - One soup and rice over here, quickly! 
 - Yes!

606
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,820
Did I work too much lately?

607
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:57,450
I keep seeing things.

608
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:09,340
Did you get hurt?

609
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:31,050
♫  I couldn't tell you, even when I knew everything, 
 although I wanted to  ♫

610
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:34,490
You seem angry for some reason.

611
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:38,260
I am not.

612
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:41,690
Did I do something wrong?

613
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:45,580
- Or is it because I came without a word— 
 - No.

614
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:49,170
It is all my fault.

615
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:52,240
I should have listened when you told me not to look for the "jade dust".

616
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:59,820
As a result, even the Ihwawon family has been put in danger.

617
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:01,180
All because of me.

618
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:04,240
Dan Oh, that is not your—

619
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,800
Whose fault is it, if not mine?

620
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:11,050
Is it the "jade dust's" fault for being chased for life from getting swept in politics?

621
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:14,680
Or is it Watchman's fault for willingly...

622
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:20,280
forsaking his own life to protect the "jade dust"?

623
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:24,930
- Dan Oh... 
 - It was definitely you at the temple.

624
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:30,320
If you are not Watchman... why would you go to your own grave?

625
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:34,590
Why do you not ever cherish yourself? Why do you always...

626
00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:41,380
- Why do you always risk losing your life— 
- It is not because I'm Watchman.

627
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,140
I went because...

628
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,580
it was you...

629
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:55,480
I went there because of you.

630
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:59,980
♫  For some reason, it sounds awkward to me  ♫

631
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:05,690
♫  Afraid that we might become distanced  ♫

632
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:09,500
♫  I'm waiting for you  ♫

633
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:12,930
♫  Perhaps...  ♫

634
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:22,530
Mok In Hoe's scholars are all safe... thanks to your considerate gesture.

635
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:25,000
I am glad.

636
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,450
It puts me at ease that you always act promptly, Hwa Ryeong.

637
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,280
Your Excellency,

638
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:36,020
the great work you intend to plan with the scholars in the future,

639
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:40,460
is it... a rebellion?

640
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:46,050
To set this nation on the right path, we need a power that will oppose His Majesty.

641
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:52,560
In that case, there is a person... you must meet, Your Excellency.

642
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,850
Someone I must meet?

643
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,130
Could that person be...

644
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:28,330
Are you there?

645
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:38,750
Where did Dan Oh go?

646
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:42,160
She went to the tavern for work.

647
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:46,550
Anyhow, Dan Oh is not here right now.  So come back next time.

648
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:49,140
I came to see you.

649
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:55,460
It was my first time seeing... a lady who dislikes flowers.

650
00:56:57,430 --> 00:57:02,360
You are very different... from other women.

651
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,820
That is why...

652
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:09,540
I have come to... like you for some reason.

653
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:16,340
What is the deal with this man?

654
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:22,900
- Do you dislike me? 
 - Yes, I dislike you.

655
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:29,480
Could you still not become a female monk?

656
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:44,210
For what business is the elder asking for me?

657
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,270
He has already arrived.

658
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:49,350
So please ask him yourself inside.

659
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:26,610
I heard you are His Majesty's closest aide... and a loyal subject, Left State Minister.

660
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:28,790
Why are you helping Mok In Hoe?

661
00:58:28,790 --> 00:58:35,250
The only one this humble one serves... is this country, Joseon.

662
00:58:57,890 --> 00:59:00,620
Please allow me to ask you in return.

663
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:04,200
Why did you join Mok In Hoe?

664
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:10,490
Do you wish to sit on the throne and rule the land?

665
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:23,990

666
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:28,400

667
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:49,490
 I am terribly afraid to see how much farther the king's madness will go.

668
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:52,970
 A world where the poor and the lowly can also work to make there dreams come true,

669
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:54,660
 I will help you achieve that will of yours.

670
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:59,030
 Establishing a proper kingship... Would that not be a Queen Mother's duty?

671
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:03,530
 That child must be set free in order to catch Lee Seol and Watchman.

672
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:06,760
 I can no longer live on as a setback to that child's life.

673
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:07,760
 What about you, Maiden?

674
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,910
 - Please take good care of Dan Oh. 
 - I will protect her day and night.

675
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:12,600
 It looks like Dan Oh was taken.

676
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,520
 You have indeed found the "jade dust," have you not?
