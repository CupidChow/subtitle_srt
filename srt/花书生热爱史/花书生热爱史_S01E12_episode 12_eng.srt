1
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,040

2
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,860

3
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,400

4
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,770

5
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:41,120

6
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,370

7
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:16,320
♫  The dark night sky is filling up with you while everyone is asleep  ♫

8
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:27,380
♫  You were smiling in my arms  ♫

9
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,130
I think they...

10
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,110
melted away.

11
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:40,680
♫  On the night the moon rose, the day you quietly reached me  ♫

12
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,410
The thoughts that have been occupying my head melted away.

13
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,400
What thoughts have been occupying your head?

14
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,510
I worried that you might get taken away.

15
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,740
The only thing I can do is feel nervous.

16
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,090
So it makes me upset.

17
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,100
But?

18
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,400
It feels like everything will work out.

19
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,300
Yes.

20
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,700
Everything will work out.

21
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:18,300
♫  At the place I have always been watching you  ♫

22
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,500
So...

23
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,360
trust me, and wait a bit.

24
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,400

25
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:46,990

26
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,700
You two!

27
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,040
You follow me.

28
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,020
What should I do now?

29
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,280
Tell the king that Watchman tried to kill you.

30
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,560
And then what?

31
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,180
You need to be on the king's side, Dan Oh.

32
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,650
Pardon?

33
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,430
What are you talking about?

34
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,350
Queen Dowager is coming herself?

35
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,770
Yes, when I told her we found the deposed crown prince's son,

36
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:48,110
she came outside the palace, pretending to take an outing to a temporary palace.

37
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,060
She shared a lot of memories with the oldest son of the crown prince.

38
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,060
You will not be able to have a long conversation today, but try to talk less.

39
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,960
I will keep that in mind.

40
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,730
Please go inside.

41
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,680
I will be waiting out here.

42
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,600
Your Highness.

43
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,000
Is it you, Seol?

44
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,300
Allow me to greet you.

45
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,360
You had small and delicate hands.

46
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:22,240
My Seol... already became a dependable man.

47
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,370
May I... try holding you?

48
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,980
Yes.

49
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,080
Grandmother.

50
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,430
 Gyeom.

51
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,230
 My son.

52
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,150
 You should go your way now.

53
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,400
 I will be supporting you.

54
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,780
 Madam, it is Ban Ya.

55
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,120
 I will come in for a moment.

56
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,780
That is a baby shirt, is it not?

57
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,820
What is this about?

58
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,650
I need to ask you something.

59
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,870
May I join the next Naeyeon? 
  (A party at the palace with guests)

60
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,670
You may.

61
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:57,690
You have become a proper courtesan now.

62
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,360
Well, Madam.

63
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,800
You know, Lee Seol, the deposed crown prince's son.

64
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,080
If he gets caught, what would happen then?

65
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,440
- Will he be in exile or— 
 - Why are you...

66
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,620
curious about that?

67
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,870
Let just say it is a minor curiosity.

68
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,420
He will face the death penalty.

69
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,330
He will not be able to survive.

70
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,900
Did you get injured anywhere?

71
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,870
You must have been suffering so much all this time.

72
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,820
Since when did you stay in Hanyang?

73
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,220
Do you have a place to stay?

74
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,940
Please catch a breath.

75
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,640
I have been doing well without any problems.

76
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,850
It is because I cannot believe it.

77
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,350
That, Seol, you are right in front of me.

78
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,750
I am sorry.

79
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,190
Why would you say such a thing?

80
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,890
You did not do anything wrong.

81
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:15,090
I... committed a great sin.

82
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:22,290
I could not visit you sooner, so I only made you worry.

83
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:30,360
We reunited like this.

84
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,860
That is good enough for me.

85
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,800

86
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,430
Did your meeting with Queen Dowager go well?

87
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,240
It went well.

88
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,190
Were you lurking around because you were worried about that?

89
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,380
What a relief.

90
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:12,020
By the way, why do you look so sad?

91
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,630
Her Highness cried a lot.

92
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,580
I do not feel comfortable lying to her.

93
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,580
You are also her grandchild.

94
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,800
She would have cried out of joy even if you met her as yourself.

95
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,720
I wonder.

96
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,250
Right...

97
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,020
I was going to tell you this.

98
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,090
Apparently, Lee Seol finally showed himself.

99
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:49,150
Chief Administrator's servants who were chasing after Lee Seol in Seogangbyeon

100
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,000
were annihilated by Watchman.

101
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,100
You mean she might meet the real Lee Seol soon.

102
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,800
I thought you should know.

103
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,200
Thank you.

104
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,500
You seem to be always looking out for me.

105
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,300
Thankfully, the Royal Guard protected you.

106
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,600
You almost got killed by Watchman.

107
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,900
I was able to survive thanks to you, Your Majesty.

108
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,500
What do you know about Lee Seol that

109
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,200
even Watchman stepped in?

110
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,000
Your Majesty!

111
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,300
To be honest, I am terribly afraid.

112
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,200
If I tell you about Lee Seol, Watchman will kill me.

113
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,300
And even if I do not,

114
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,970
you will not forgive me. So...

115
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,400
I really have no idea what to do!

116
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,970
You must know.

117
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:04,130
That you and your family's safety depend on me.

118
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I met with... the deposed crown prince's bodyguard.

119
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The deposed crown prince's bodyguard?

120
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You know that I found Lee Seol because of Chief Administrator's order, do you not?

121
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,100
I do.

122
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,600
While I was looking for him,

123
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,300
he showed up one day and threatened me.

124
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:56,200
He said he would let me live once since I saved Lee Seol as a child,

125
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,200
but if I chase after Lee Seol again,

126
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,100
not to mention me,

127
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,000
but also, my family will not be safe.

128
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,900
- Chief Royal Guard. 
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

129
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:13,600
I thought all the men who guarded Lee Pyeong had died.

130
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,200
That is also my understanding.

131
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,500
But I will find out if anyone survived.

132
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,600
Is that everything you know?

133
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,400
It looked like he had changed his identity

134
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,600
and became a merchant in Gaeseong.

135
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,600
He told me to come to

136
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,800
his fabric shop if I want to leave Hanyang.

137
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,600
Move!

138
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,200
Move!

139
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,000

140
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,900
What is this about?

141
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,200
We are urgently looking for someone.

142
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,600
Catch him!

143
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,510
Stop right there!

144
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,400
- Search the area. 
 - Yes.

145
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,800
- Let us go! 
  - Yes!

146
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,800
Who is the man who just ran away?

147
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,600
He is the clerk at the shop.

148
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,800
- What is his name? 
 - It is K-Kim Chi Woon.

149
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,200
What is this about, anyway...

150
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,600
He is late today.

151
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,900
Is he very busy?

152
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,500
It must have been me.

153
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,300
The one you have been anxiously waiting for?

154
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,400
You did not come when you normally do.

155
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,000
So I just came out to make sure nothing bad happened.

156
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,600
You never left the annex. Did I make you come to the door?

157
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,300
Did I?

158
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,500
Yes.

159
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,400
You should be so proud of yourself.

160
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,520
Were you really waiting for me?

161
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,900
What were you doing alone?

162
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:59,300
I was just making ornaments and doing some cleaning.

163
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,500
You put rouge on, too?

164
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,300
You cannot be this pretty.

165
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,900
Y-Your hand...

166
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,000
What happened to your hand?

167
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,800
Did you do something dangerous?

168
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,100
I saw a cat passing by around here.

169
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,100
So I tried to pet it and...

170
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,200
The cat... must have been really vicious.

171
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:57,000
I will tell him not to be so vicious from now on.

172
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,600
I told him what you told me to.

173
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,200
Will the crown prince's former bodyguard be okay?

174
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,400
I already took care of it.

175
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,500
Do not worry.

176
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,800
It is thanks to you who tricked the king so well.

177
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,200
I recognized your ability immediately when you lied to me about the rent—

178
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
What did you say?

179
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,400
You went through so much Dan Oh.

180
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,800
Someone might see us.

181
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,700
You cannot do this at Ihwawon.

182
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,200
What am I supposed to do when I want to hold you, then?

183
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,500
We should come up with a signal.

184
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,000
A signal?

185
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,000
Got it.

186
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,600
I will do that.

187
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,800
Dan Oh,

188
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,000
there is something you need to know.

189
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,400
What is it?

190
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,200
The thing is... Mr. Yook Ho...

191
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,600
found out.

192
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,800
Are you preparing for a rebellion?

193
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,700
The eldest son of the crown prince would not

194
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,200
join the Royal Guard if not for that reason.

195
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,800
Yes. You are right.

196
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,080
Dan Oh, you!

197
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,500
Did you ask for more time even after knowing all this?

198
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,800
Sir... the thing is...

199
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,200
Please leave us alone for a moment.

200
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,800
I need to talk to Dan Oh a bit.

201
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,200
I am the one who caused all this.

202
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,400
I will listen, too.

203
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,620
I...

204
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,730
was always proud of you.

205
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:50,200
Even though you lost your parents early, you grew up so properly.

206
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,600
Because of that, I had no guilt toward your father.

207
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,700
But I do not feel that way right now.

208
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,200
They say, "If you succeed, you become the king. If you fail, you become a traitor."

209
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,800
His Highness will end up one way or the other.

210
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,000
Would you be able to handle something like this?

211
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,200
I...

212
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,300
thought about it countless times, too.

213
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,700
If something goes wrong, something tragic will happen.

214
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,000
Since I was afraid of that,

215
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,500
I tried to be away from him, too.

216
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,820
But my heart keeps...

217
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,020
giving up and turning around.

218
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,820
Of course, I understand what Sir is worried about.

219
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,050
I will explain it well to him.

220
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,700
Yes.

221
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,480
Let us go.

222
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:41,450
Jeong Yoo Ha, why are you coming back so late?

223
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,640
How frustrating.

224
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,750
Dan Oh's heart is so far gone now.

225
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,590
How could you possibly catch her at that pace?

226
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,970
Do you think so, too?

227
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,800
Why are you taking it so seriously, anyway?

228
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:00,700
For some reason, I think they are sharing a secret I do not know about.

229
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,730
Shi Yeol, let me come in for a moment.

230
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,930
 Okay, come in.

231
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,510
What is wrong? Did you eat something funny?

232
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,820
How about your injury from yesterday?

233
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,510
There was a lot of blood here and there.

234
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,700
The royal guards, not me.

235
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,700
I know it was for tricking the king,

236
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:45,190
but you running away holding Dan Oh's hand was too dangerous.

237
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:48,410
I could not let the Royal Guard take away Dan Oh.

238
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,970
If Dan Oh is in danger,

239
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:54,330
will you continue to be reckless like that?

240
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:58,200
I will try to be careful from now on.

241
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,300
You are not saying you will not do anything.

242
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,020
Let us sleep.

243
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,690

244
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,200
- Oh, no... 
 - Let me go out.

245
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,530
Three Secret Prophecies of Joseon.

246
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:10,410
It is because of the drawing, is it not?

247
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:15,340
What could it be that Sir is so upset about it?

248
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,330
You mean what San drew?

249
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:20,660
He drew with a rough hand like this?

250
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,570
You said you burned it!

251
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:27,540
I noticed that you were so good at lying.

252
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:34,240
You are good at dodging... and not answering my question.

253
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,380
The same goes for you.

254
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,710
Should I ask you about Mok In Hoe, too?

255
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,390
You keep asking questions. Who would answer them?

256
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:44,300
- Should I? 
 - Are you not going to eat?

257
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,980
I will put the table away if you are done eating.

258
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,810
Good job with the soup. It is refreshing.

259
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:57,310
Dan Oh is actually so tough, is she not?

260
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,800
- She is so tough. 
 - Yeah...

261
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,140
Dan Oh...

262
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,390
made it possible for me to live all this time.

263
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,620
Every time I felt like giving up on life,

264
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,640
I thought of Dan Oh.

265
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:33,130
I always regretted leaving Ihwawon as if I were running away without saying...

266
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,890
a word of thank you.

267
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:44,560
I am not interested in abandoning Dan Oh to accomplish the rebellion.

268
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,130
I understand how you feel.

269
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:54,110
But how could you guarantee Dan Oh's safety?

270
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,220
If she faces difficulty at the palace again—

271
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,170
If it's becomes dangerous for her,

272
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,240
you should tell them...

273
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,770
about who I am.

274
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,190
Dan Oh will not be able to do it. So I want you to do it.

275
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,080
That way,

276
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,600
we can protect everyone at Ihwawon.

277
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,150
I cannot get any sleep these days.

278
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:37,030
Because I want to know what happens next.

279
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,400
Miss? Are you listening to me right now?

280
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,180
What did you say?

281
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:52,790
"On his sweet lips, I..." Kissed, right?

282
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,300
No!

283
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,330
There was no kissing.

284
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,860
What is the point of having lips?

285
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,570
Well...

286
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,840
To be honest...

287
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:08,140
- The thing is— 
 - Yeon and the officer are so desperately in love.

288
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:11,930
What kind of depressing story is this?

289
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,590
They did kiss.

290
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,190
It was very nice and warm.

291
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,940
Right?

292
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:24,520
They did, right? Gosh! I almost got disappointed!

293
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:31,350
Why is that cat meowing?

294
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,340
He must have eaten all the side dishes!

295
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,580
- That rascal! 
 - No, no, no!

296
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:40,260
I... I will go out!

297
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,940
They kissed. They did!

298
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,950
I really thought it was a cat.

299
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,500
I practiced every time I thought of you, and it was already morning.

300
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:33,310
What should we do now?

301
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:36,350
I will think of you every time a cat meows.

302
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,940
What is there to worry about?

303
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,760
I will be there whenever that happens.

304
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,860
 Miss! Did the stray cat leave?

305
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,410
Do not come out, Najudaek!

306
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,800
Do not come! Do not come!

307
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,080
The cat likes people too much!

308
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,750
He kept rubbing his face on me.

309
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,160
It was hard to shoo him away.

310
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,960
Is that so?

311
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,360
What a strange cat!

312
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,320
Kitty!

313
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,510
Go now, go now! Come on!

314
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,930
It is cold out!

315
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,280
Come on in right now!

316
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,860
Huh?

317
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,660
Okay!

318
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,770
Leave now. You might be late for work.

319
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,380
Come here for a second.

320
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,040
Come close.

321
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,400
Let us save the longer kiss for later.

322
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:49,400
In the future when we will have no worries.

323
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,480
What are you doing here?

324
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:15,300
I am here to meet Lady Dan Oh.

325
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,560
You should go in then.

326
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,780
Excuse me, Sir.

327
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:26,440
By chance...

328
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:34,180
 Are you Lee Seol, the deposed crown prince's son?

329
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,330
Do you have something to say to me?

330
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,460
It is nothing.

331
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,320
Safe travels.

332
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,430
Dan Oh...

333
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,110
Yes?

334
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:07,980
I heard you looked for a scholar with a red mole on his ankle before.

335
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,130
How did you know?

336
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:12,580
The hostess told me.

337
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:17,870
That man is... the deposed crown prince's son. Right?

338
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,760
Why are you asking me that?

339
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,790
Although it's hard for you as a noble to lift scholars' ankles,

340
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,390
it's very easy for me, a courtesan.

341
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:32,230
I'm wondering if I can be of help.

342
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,230
Chief Administrator Jang had ordered me to look for him.

343
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:39,360
I paid off all the debt, so it has nothing to do with me now.

344
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,380
I see.

345
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,070
By the way, Dan Oh...

346
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:50,450
if that man is someone who's very close to you...

347
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:53,090
what are you going to do then?

348
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:58,640
By chance... did you find out something?

349
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,550
It's nothing.

350
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:12,130
Ban Ya...

351
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:14,980
If you find out something about the deposed crown prince's son...

352
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,280
could you discuss it with me first?

353
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,010
It's too big of a matter to manage alone.

354
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,180
Sure.

355
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,390
It's a promise. Okay?

356
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,970
I'll be going now.

357
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:41,590
What are you working so hard on?

358
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:45,160
The days are cold, so I should have lots of firewood hacked.

359
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,570
Give it to me. I'll help.

360
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:55,940
There's something you're not good at, huh?

361
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,160
I only slipped. My hands were slippery.

362
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,720
- Let me try again. 
 - Sure, sure.

363
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,650
Take your time, and make sure to hold tight.

364
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,400
Hey, why is this so...

365
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,930
Wait! I told you to hack the wood...

366
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:12,770
but you only hacked the ax?

367
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,860
You can let me take it.

368
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,890
You have something to tell me. Right?

369
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:26,090
It has been forever since I last asked how you were doing.

370
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:32,400
It seems a lot is happening to you while I am unaware, Dan Oh.

371
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:37,420
Could they be... matters related to San?

372
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:39,900
Well...

373
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:44,300
Are you unable to tell me anything about it?

374
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:49,240
Miss! Are you not going out for delivery?

375
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,280
Take me with you today.

376
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,380
I have to shop for groceries anyway.

377
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,990
Well, I need to get going now.

378
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:01,650
All right. Go on.

379
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,730
How did it go?

380
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:26,050
I had everyone at the business evacuated to safety.

381
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,890
Thank you for the trouble.

382
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:30,570
You should also be extra cautious for a while.

383
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,600
I will do that.

384
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,190
If something urgent comes up, leave a letter in the pond like last time.

385
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,670
During the Hour of the Horse, the scholars are usually not at the quarters,

386
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:40,900
so you can come by then.

387
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,810
Yes, Your Highness.

388
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,090
There is no record left in the palace about

389
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,320
Lee Pyeong's bodyguard...

390
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,400
since you ordered all things related to the crown prince to be burned.

391
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:56,620
Head Eunuch, do you also know nothing about that man?

392
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,920
There was a man who came from Gaeseong.

393
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:04,050
His father used to trade ginseng.

394
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,930
His name was...

395
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,170
- Do you remember? 
 - It is a bit faint...

396
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:11,730
but I think he was of the Kim family.

397
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,400
Was his name Chi Woon of the Kim family, by chance?

398
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,190
Yes, I think that was his name.

399
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:22,070
Send people to Gaeseong and search.

400
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:25,960
Someone must know him, even if he changed his identity.

401
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

402
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:45,140
I saved you this time, Your Highness.

403
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,870
Thank you.

404
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:50,270
Do not forget your promise.

405
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:54,690
If this lowly one's life is in danger, then...

406
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:58,630
you must save me, Your Highness.

407
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:01,860
I understand. You have my word.

408
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,750
By the way,

409
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:09,070
what is Yoon Dan Oh to you that you would go this far?

410
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,090
Did you just say not to tell His Majesty about Head Eunuch?

411
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:19,450
Once you tell His Majesty, he will interrogate Head Eunuch right away.

412
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:23,300
If that happens, we cannot delve into his background.

413
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:29,200
We need to grasp Watchman by his tail and find Lee Seol, do we not?

414
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,310
You will get all the credit for catching Lee Seol, Your Highness.

415
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:37,440
Therefore, you must keep it to yourself for now.

416
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:40,120
I understand.

417
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,260
I will do as you say.

418
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,500
Monk, he is being followed. Please take cover.

419
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,540

420
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,530
Anyone there?

421
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:13,190
I came to find a place to stay.

422
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,200
Do you have an empty room?

423
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:25,840
Goodness!  You have the luck for food, Scholar.

424
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,880
- Please eat. 
 - Yes.

425
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,590
I look forward to having you here.

426
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:33,480
Yes. My name is Gu Nam of the Yoon family, Sir.

427
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,250
Wait.

428
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,140
You seem quite familiar.

429
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,570
You were looking for a place at the tavern!

430
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:42,800
Have you been wandering all this time?

431
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,850
Well, one way or the other, we became one family like this.

432
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,140
What brings you here?

433
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,080
It is Chief Royal Guard's order.

434
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,960
He told me to guard Miss while residing here.

435
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:03,810
Goodness, let us all eat.

436
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,870
Do not come with me today.

437
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,850
Why? Where are you going?

438
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:13,050
Read between the lines.

439
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,330
You said you'd stay out on your own accord.

440
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,410
It is one of your few days off.

441
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,600
Are you going somewhere?

442
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,600
By chance, with that lady?

443
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,470
It is okay.

444
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:54,360
I already got the gist of it all.

445
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,640
What do you mean?

446
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,950
The moment you ran away with Miss's hand in yours...

447
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:06,540
You would not have held hands so affectionately if you were just a guest and a hostess.

448
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,570
You can believe what you want.

449
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:26,230
Let's go.

450
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,000
You said it'd be just the two of us...

451
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,800
I shouldn't have bothered to look in the mirror.

452
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,600
You need to pull a little stronger.

453
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,500
Stronger. More.

454
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,500
Don't shake your arm. There.

455
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,600
I am sure there are many things a man and a woman can do...

456
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,200
but it had to be a bow.

457
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,100
What did you say?

458
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,400
I'm just saying.

459
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:21,800
I want you to be safe... even when I'm not around.

460
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,600
Are you worried?

461
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,600
Because of how I was chased by the Royal Guard last time?

462
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,300
If you learn it... it'll come in handy in many ways.

463
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:44,600
Nothing ever... can be established at once.

464
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,200
Please teach me slowly, Brother.

465
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,000
Tomorrow... and the day after...

466
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,200
besides me.

467
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:03,140
Going on a picnic is what you wanted to do?

468
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,500
The day is cold. Are you really not going to tell me where we are going?

469
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,100
You'll know... when we get there.

470
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,800
Before we get any closer...

471
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,700
there is something I must tell you.

472
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,380
There was a man...

473
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:39,870
I was betrothed to a long time ago.

474
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,350
Although I loved him deeply,

475
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,500
on the day the flowers bloomed ever so beautifully,

476
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,200
he passed away.

477
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,800
That's why I don't like flowers.

478
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,400
You must have been deeply lonely and...

479
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,300
hurting painfully for a long time.

480
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,600
You can go ahead.

481
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:22,200
I will give you up for the day to that man, Maiden Yoon.

482
00:42:54,600 --> 00:43:01,100
♫  Because I have been hiding these feelings  ♫

483
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,400
It has been eight years, right?

484
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:11,200
You are still... here at this place, Dear.

485
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:17,170
All those years...

486
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:21,950
my body was alive...

487
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,400
but my heart was dead the entire time.

488
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,500
I missed you who passed, Dear,

489
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:39,670
so I had closed all the doors to the world.

490
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:51,680
♫  Because you're my everything that I can only watch from afar  ♫

491
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:56,900
There is someone who enlightened me...

492
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,060
and extended his hand so that I could be brought outside.

493
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:04,020
♫  Can you hear my heart?  ♫

494
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:10,000
Although I'm ashamed of myself, I have to say these words with my own mouth.

495
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,700
I want to live on... with the name of Yoon Hong Joo...

496
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,600
exclusively as myself.

497
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:26,400
♫  Can you hear it? My love that's about to burst?  ♫

498
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:33,920
♫  I can't go near you because it takes my breath away  ♫

499
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:41,960
♫  Do I just need to wait endlessly?  ♫

500
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,940
♫  Can you hear my heart?  ♫

501
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:57,000
♫  My heartbeat races toward you  ♫

502
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,380
♫  Its sound rings so loudly like this  ♫

503
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:12,300
♫  Although it calls out to you like this  ♫

504
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,200
It is a place called Ihwawon.

505
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,000
The owner there makes such great food.

506
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,300
Gosh, I am fine.

507
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:29,400
But her cooking skill is really good...

508
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,000
Sis!

509
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,600
Dan Oh...

510
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,000
Sis, why are you here?

511
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,400
With Brother Shi Yeol, on top of that?

512
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,300
Dan Oh, let's first go inside and talk.

513
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:47,600
By the way, why are you two together?

514
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,700
Why bother asking? It's obvious at one glance.

515
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,000
You were the one, Scholar, huh?

516
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,200
The military officer on the battlefield who got Dan Oh drunk.

517
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:06,000
She was never like that before. How badly did you hurt her feelings?

518
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,200
- I have no excuse for that. 
 - Gosh...

519
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,800
But that's your liquor, Sis. The one you hid in your room.

520
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,600
- You drank with me. 
 - Dan Oh,

521
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:20,600
how lonely must she have been to drink in secret?

522
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,600
Did you come out with her to console her loneliness?

523
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,000
Luring my innocent sister?

524
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,500
I wasn't lured out!

525
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:30,500
I'm the one who asked him to come out with me.

526
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,800
You have no idea.

527
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:39,700
Wait, I gave you that ornament to wear on your wedding day.

528
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:43,700
Why would you say that here? I wore it since you gave it to me.

529
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:48,130
Dan Oh is a lot more beautiful than usual today, right?

530
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,800
I think she just needs a husband now.

531
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,200
She was always prettier than others in the first place.

532
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,800
Gosh, seriously!

533
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,800
When was I ever that pretty?

534
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,100
Whoa, am I getting hungover already?

535
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:07,000
I'm getting really nauseous.

536
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,200
Let's settle it this way.

537
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,600
We'll keep what happened today among us.

538
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,000
Sure. Once Najudaek and Sir find out,

539
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,200
it'll be troublesome for both of us. Will you be okay?

540
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,400
Go ahead and introduce yourself. He is the crown prince's son.

541
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,800
Your Highness...

542
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,100
it is my honor to meet you like this.

543
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:47,900
Are you the merchant who trades around the Gyeongsang region?

544
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:52,200
Yes, please call me Mr. Kim.

545
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:56,700
Will you be able to meet the commander of Gyeongsangdo and deliver my letter to him?

546
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:59,200
Yes, I can deliver it.

547
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,300
However, His Lordship is...

548
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:05,700
such a strict and cautious person...

549
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:10,700
so he will most likely not read a letter of questionable origin.

550
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,000
It is a letter from His Highness.

551
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,800
How can you say it is questionable in origin?

552
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,800
What do I need to do for you?

553
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,800
Well...

554
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,700
if you show me anything that proves you are the crown prince's son,

555
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:27,300
I will see it with my own eyes and tell His Lordship exactly what I saw.

556
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,890

557
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:20,950
 Mok In Hoe's leader is attempting to take the throne by daring to steal your name.

558
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:23,200
 His name is Lee Gyeom.

559
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,600
-  He is your brother, Your Highness.  
 - Lee Gyeom?

560
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:58,140
 Dan Oh, did you know all along...

561
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:01,600
 who San is?

562
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:13,290
What do you need my clothes for?

563
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:15,490
Since Yoo Ha joined Mok In Hoe,

564
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:18,020
I want to look into the group.

565
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,800
You learn everything so quickly, whatever it is.

566
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,510
When did you finish all of these?

567
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:33,740
Dan Oh, were you aware of everything?

568
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:35,860
What do you mean?

569
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:38,480
The thing you have been hiding,

570
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,350
is that the secret you two kept between yourselves?

571
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:45,690
I have no idea what you are talking about.

572
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:47,740
Kang San...

573
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:50,940
About what his true identity is...

574
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:54,370
I happened to find out everything.

575
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,340
- Brother... 
 - Is San really the deposed crown prince's son, Lee Seol?

576
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:03,060
I do not mean to interrogate you.

577
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:06,800
This also is why you were called to the palace, right?

578
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,580
I cannot...

579
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:12,920
tell you anything at all.

580
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:21,730
Do you cherish San that much... to hide this serious matter?

581
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:41,220
Please pretend not to know.

582
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:44,720
- Dan Oh... 
 - You're also in Mok In Hoe, are you not?

583
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:49,910
You wish more than anyone... for Brother San to be unharmed.

584
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:54,180
Wrong. The one I really wish for is you.

585
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,580
It is your safety, Dan Oh.

586
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,410
Brother...

587
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:15,380
You're not going out today?

588
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:18,500
Why are you asking me that?

589
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,310
No reason.

590
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:24,070
I'm just off duty today and also curious about what you do.

591
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,750
Did you two argue?

592
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:32,090
We did not argue.

593
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:34,040
It's nothing like that.

594
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,580
Really?

595
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,170
It's even more strange, then.

596
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:29,110
 Did Mok In Hoe have this many followers?

597
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:35,040
How did you come here?

598
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:47,150
A scholar in Ihwawon is a part of Mok In Hoe.

599
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:49,740
I followed him here.

600
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:54,960
Is everything you said in the letter true?

601
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:58,480
Lee Gyeom, that man...

602
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,260
is my brother?

603
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:02,600
Yes.

604
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:06,160
I confirmed it in person.

605
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,580
All this time, I did not know...

606
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:11,280
that I had a sibling.

607
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:15,350
Why did you not tell me anything all along?

608
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:18,910
Crown Prince hid him away at a young age and

609
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:22,310
had him grow up at a private home in secret.

610
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:24,280
After the slaughter happened,

611
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,390
I also did not receive any news regarding him.

612
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,120
How did you find out, then?

613
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,920
I was also surprised.

614
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:33,000
Mok In Hoe's leader had...

615
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:38,590
the crown prince's hairpin in his possession.

616
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:39,550
The hairpin?

617
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:43,990
I believe the crown prince gave the hairpin to the prince to signify

618
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:46,640
being summoned back to the palace.

619
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:51,010
Let us keep a watch for now.

620
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,390
I am sure he will show himself at the meeting.

621
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:08,420
The Grand Heir enters.

622
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,260
Can you recognize him?

623
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:30,810
We will collect everyone's signatures, uniting our wills.

624
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:33,250
Those who intend to join in,

625
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:36,870
come forward and show your faces.

626
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,700
Your subject, Yoon Hui Sung, will serve you as my lord, Grand Heir.

627
00:56:56,100 --> 00:57:00,430
Your subject, Jang Tae Eul, will put his life on the line to follow you, Your Highness.

628
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:09,100
Your subject, Go Heung Gi, will serve you with my life, Your Highness!

629
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:20,180
Please dethrone the abject tyrant and take the throne!

630
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:25,020
 Your Highness, please take the throne!

631
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:41,300
We will write down the history of our great deed together!

632
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,490
Have you called for me?

633
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:12,300
Do you happen to know who Lee Seol is, by chance, Your Excellency?

634
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:16,400
I also do not know his identity yet.

635
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,500
Nonetheless, why do you ask?

636
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:24,480
If you find the real Lee Seol, what do you plan to do?

637
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:31,170
There cannot be two suns... in the same sky, can there?

638
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:05,300
Jeong Yoo Ha...

639
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:10,260
were you the one who claimed to be Lee Seol?

640
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:20,500
Are you the leader of Mok In Hoe, Lee Gyeom?

641
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:31,950

642
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:38,970
♫  Do I just need to wait endlessly?  ♫

643
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:45,050
♫  Can you hear my heart?  ♫

644
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:53,880
♫  My heartbeat flows toward you  ♫

645
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:57,180

646
00:59:57,180 --> 01:00:01,750
 There will be another war for the throne between brothers.

647
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:04,550
 Answer me. Why did you commit such an act?

648
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:07,890
 Do you think you can take down the king alone?

649
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:10,550
 I also want to try living as who I am.

650
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:13,290
 Such a day will come for sure, Maiden Hong Joo.

651
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:15,210
 I want you to never fall.

652
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:16,500
 Please be careful.

653
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:19,300
 You can end up getting devoured by the fake one.

654
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:21,810
 No matter what anyone says, you are Lee Seol, Your Highness.

655
01:00:21,810 --> 01:00:24,800
 I also know there cannot be two Lee Seols.

656
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:28,190
 I will never let it happen.

657
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,380
♫  My heart races toward you  ♫
