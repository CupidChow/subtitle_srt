1
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,000
Your dad is Jee, so what's your name?

2
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,040
Butcher?

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,040
Don't get on my nerves.

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,600
Did you wait long?

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,040
Move closer. You'll fall off.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,440
Didn't you say
you were leaving for Chiang Mai today?

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,760
Why haven't you left?

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,480
<c.bg_transparent><i>I'll get going. I'll leave
the finger replanting case to you.</i></c.bg_transparent>

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,080
Butcher.

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,880
My name isn't Butcher.

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,160
I'm Jirawat.

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,440
By the way, Ji, you were close
to Achivich before, right?

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,800
At first, I was wondering
if you two were dating.

14
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,600
Hello, Butcher.

15
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,280
We saw each other this morning.

16
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,840
Hello, Butcher.

17
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,760
Achi.

18
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,160
Achivich, why are you here?

19
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,920
You didn't go to our school.

20
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,040
Right.

21
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,000
I didn't go to this school.

22
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,720
But my best friend did.

23
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,280
So I'm here too.

24
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,000
-Best friends.
-They're best friends.

25
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,400
They're best friends.

26
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,120
I need to use the restroom.

27
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,360
-Can he be here?
-They're best friends.

28
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,280
Yes.

29
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,399
He just followed him.

30
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,000
Why are you following me?

31
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,800
I'm not.

32
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,800
I'm just out for a walk.

33
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,560
Are you messing with me?

34
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,800
And what are you doing out here, Mr. Ji?

35
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,880
That's my business.

36
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,320
And stop calling me Mr. Ji.

37
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,840
Okay then.

38
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,600
Butcher.

39
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,880
I stopped being a butcher
a long time ago when my mom died.

40
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,520
I'm sorry. I didn't know that.

41
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,440
I'm sorry for your loss.

42
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,480
-Hello.
-

43
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,160
-
-Leave then.

44
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,280
I don't want to walk. It's far.

45
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,240
Can you leave with me?

46
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,320
No way. I just got here.

47
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,960
I haven't seen everyone.

48
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,680
Come on. You live here.

49
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,600
You see your friends all the time.

50
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,920
You'll get to see--

51
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,240
Come on, guys. Let's eat.

52
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,800
Ki, you asshole.

53
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,280
Ji.

54
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,880
Sorry.

55
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,360
Did I scare you again?

56
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,880
Just say what's on your mind.

57
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,040
Get it over with here.

58
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,160
So you can stop scaring me.

59
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,200
There's nothing in particular.

60
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,240
I just want to talk to you.

61
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,720
I want to know how you're doing.

62
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,400
We haven't seen each other in years.

63
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,240
Don't you ever think

64
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,440
that the reason is because

65
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,720
I don't want to see you.

66
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,280
Why not?

67
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,800
Why don't you want to see me?

68
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,440
It's fine if you don't want to answer.

69
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,480
I don't want to talk
about what's in the past.

70
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,440
Then we can talk about the present.

71
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,840
How are you doing?
I heard you're a doctor now.

72
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,360
Didn't you already know back then

73
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,440
that I was going to become a doctor?

74
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,600
I did.

75
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,600
But we haven't talked since then.

76
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,680
It has been ten years.

77
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,560
Everything might not be the same anymore.

78
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,680
I'm not the same person

79
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,640
that you used to know anymore.

80
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,120
Do you think that garden is still there?

81
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,960
I wonder if it's still the same.

82
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,360
Why the hell are you smiling? Hurry up.

83
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,240
You're wearing my pants again.

84
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,520
How else could I sneak in?

85
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,160
Why didn't you change your shirt?

86
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,160
I ran out of money.

87
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,000
Don't your parents own the market?

88
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,320
-Hurry up.
-Jirawat!

89
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,280
Hey! Is that Achivich?

90
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,240
He doesn't go here!

91
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,040
And now you two are cutting class?

92
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,040
Stop! Stop right there!

93
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,880
I said stop!

94
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,480
-I'll tell your parents!
-Run.

95
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,000
I'll tell your parents that
you two snuck out of school!

96
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,240
You little punks.

97
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,720
Why would you climb over the gate
when you could just open it?

98
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,760
My gosh! You idiots!

99
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,120
What's with you?

100
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,360
Why are you laughing?

101
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,040
Do you want some?

102
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,440
Jeez. Knock it off.

103
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,360
You're tickling me again, you jerk.

104
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,000
Tell me to stop then.

105
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,760
Stop it or I'll kick you off the bridge.

106
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,560
Here.

107
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,560
Are your knees in bad shape, Mr. Ortho?

108
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,080
How did you know that?

109
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,520
What?

110
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,560
Is it a secret?

111
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,960
You already know a lot about me.
What else do you want to know?

112
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,520
Nothing's changed.

113
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,320
It's unbelievable.

114
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,360
What do you mean?

115
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,840
There are lights everywhere now.

116
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,160
I meant you, Ji.

117
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,400
You're exactly the same.

118
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,200
Hey.

119
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,280
If you want to pick a fight with me,

120
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,480
you don't have to follow me from Bangkok.

121
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,320
Who said I followed you here from Bangkok?

122
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,160
The view is still the same.

123
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,320
That's not true.
The sky changes every day.

124
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,800
Although it's nighttime,
it's never the same.

125
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,720
Ki, you jerk.

126
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,200
I'll kick your butt later for this.

127
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,240
Are you heading back?

128
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,080
Yes.

129
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,440
But the party just started.

130
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,160
I'm not enjoying it.

131
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,520
I have no reason to stay.

132
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,680
Didn't you come to Chiang Mai for this?

133
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,600
No.

134
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,800
I have other reasons.

135
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,480
How will you get back?

136
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,520
I'll get Ki to take me home.

137
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,560
Do you need a ride?

138
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,200
No.

139
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,720
Come on. I'll take you back.

140
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,960
I said no.

141
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,800
You're going back to the party?

142
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,240
I don't think so.

143
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,960
Don't tell me you'll walk home.

144
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,880
This is a nice vibe.

145
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,880
Are you hungry?

146
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,960
No.

147
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,040
Well, am I driving too fast?

148
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,120
Fast is good.

149
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,280
I'll drive slower.

150
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,320
Did you drive here from Bangkok?

151
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,440
No.

152
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,520
I had my car towed here yesterday.

153
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,880
I flew here this morning.
We ran into each other at the airport.

154
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,440
Seriously?

155
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,920
Sorry about that.

156
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,760
Is it your girlfriend's?

157
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:13,720
Yes.

158
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,040
Do you even remember
which girl it belongs to?

159
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,839
I do. It's Mona's.

160
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,600
I see.

161
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,120
It's that model in the news.

162
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,760
So are you two really together?

163
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,200
She could trip and fall
wearing heels this high.

164
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,920
Are you keeping up with
the entertainment gossip, doctor?

165
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,640
I'm not.

166
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,200
It just popped up on my news feed.

167
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,560
It's nonsense.

168
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,240
I don't want to know who's dating who,

169
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,240
who broke up with who,
or who's cheating on who.

170
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,880
But I want to know.

171
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,080
I want to know about you.

172
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,320
I heard nothing.

173
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,240
Of course you didn't.

174
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,600
I'm not a celebrity.

175
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,600
So are you seeing someone?

176
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,520
No answer. Does that mean no?

177
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,120
Why not?

178
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,640
Is it because you're too busy
as a doctor or--

179
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,640
You don't have to try
to make conversation.

180
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,800
We're practically strangers anyway.

181
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,160
Honestly, if we could
turn back time like in movies,

182
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,040
I would've said this to you.

183
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,520
That you don't have to try.

184
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,240
I'm just a stranger to you.

185
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,720
Cheers!

186
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,080
THE REUNION THAT WE MISS

187
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,440
So what is this?

188
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,600
THE REUNION THAT WE MISS

189
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,720
Hello.

190
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,960
Let's have fun together tonight.

191
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,800
Who's that?

192
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,640
It's the singer.

193
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,840
Who is he friends with?
I've never seen him.

194
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,400
I heard that he works
at Ms. Ratree's farm.

195
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,080
Nice.

196
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,760
Did he follow her here?

197
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,200
I think Ms. Ratree's probably enjoying
a private concert up in the mountain.

198
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,520
Don't tease her.

199
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,560
That's nice.

200
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,560
Why did you turn this way?

201
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,520
It's another way back.

202
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,120
Turn around. This is a detour.

203
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,880
But the view is better.

204
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,840
What are you talking about?

205
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,680
If you want to take a drive
and enjoy the view,

206
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,600
do it later. I want to go home.

207
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,080
PEH

208
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,640
Hello.

209
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,880
<c.bg_transparent><i>Hey, how's the homecoming party?
Are you having fun?</i></c.bg_transparent>

210
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,800
It's so much fun.

211
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,280
Why is it so quiet?

212
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,720
Aren't you at the party?

213
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,840
No. I'm in the car.

214
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,480
What? Are you heading back?

215
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,400
Or are you going somewhere with someone?

216
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,760
No, I'm going home.

217
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,920
<c.bg_transparent><i>What? Why? Is the party over?
Why is it over so early?</i></c.bg_transparent>

218
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,240
Did that store close already?

219
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,480
Hey! That voice! Is it Achivich?

220
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,960
Achivich!

221
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,840
Who said you could talk?

222
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,520
Have some manners.

223
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,600
Just keep driving.

224
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,520
We're finally here.

225
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,680
I told you that route was a detour.

226
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,360
Wait.

227
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,880
What are you doing?

228
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,200
Are you crazy?

229
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,840
What's wrong with you, Ji?

230
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,720
Why must you act this way with me?

231
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,360
What do you mean?

232
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,080
You act like we're strangers.

233
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,920
Like you're disgusted by me.

234
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,840
That's not true.

235
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,000
Stop denying it.

236
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,720
You know that the thing between us…

237
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,000
What about it?

238
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,720
The thing between us…

239
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,600
It's already over.

240
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,480
What the hell are you doing?

241
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,880
I freaking hate you, Achi.

242
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,720
I hate your face and your hands.
Stay away from me.

243
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,720
I'm sorry, Ji. Let me explain.

244
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,840
I hate you, Achi.

245
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,880
You forgot your phone.

246
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,240
SATURDAY, JUNE 24TH, 22:19

247
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,720
Did you keep this picture?

248
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,320
Ji.

249
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,320
Why didn't you let me know first?
You're wasting the film.

250
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,880
If I told you, I wouldn't have
funny pictures of you.

251
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,840
Come on. Let's take
a nice picture together.

252
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,040
Come on.

253
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,440
One, two, three.

254
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,160
What?

255
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,280
You have to wait.

256
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,960
But I want to see it.

257
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,400
It isn't done yet.

258
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,280
Here. You keep it.

259
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,720
It's our best photo together.

260
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,560
I don't want to see your face again.

261
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,080
Coin.

262
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,920
You agree with me
that Achi is an asshole, right?

263
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,800
How could he kiss me like that?

264
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,960
Doesn't he know what consent is?

265
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,040
What he did was sexual harassment.

266
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,000
His fans would be pissed
if they found out.

267
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,960
All of them would be devastated.

268
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,160
I'll let them all know, Achi.

269
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,960
Screw him.

270
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,320
I shouldn't have come here.

271
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,320
I shouldn't have run into him.

272
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,800
What does he want?

273
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,840
Why does he show up now?

274
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,160
Why is my heart all flustered?

275
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,880
No, he can't do this to me.

276
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,200
He has been gone for ten years.

277
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,880
He can't make me feel this way.

278
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,240
You can have this.

279
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,040
I don't want it anymore.

280
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,480
Let me pull it apart for you.

281
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,320
This is top secret, Coin.

282
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,040
You can't tell anyone about this.

283
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,440
Not even Ki, your stepdad.

284
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,120
Actually…

285
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,280
I do like Achi.

286
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,720
I can't seem to get over him.

287
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,680
That's why this hurts so much.

288
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,080
Why did he kiss me?

289
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,800
He's so self-centered.

290
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,040
He doesn't care about how I feel at all.

291
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,120
That's why I broke things off with him.

292
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,720
Coin.

293
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,160
Promise me

294
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,440
that you won't tell anyone about this.

295
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,560
I love you, Coin.

296
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,840
Nini, what's wrong?
Did you have a bad dream?

297
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,600
Where's Mom?

298
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,080
She's out at a meeting.
She'll be back soon.

299
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,680
Will I have my finger back?

300
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,080
Of course.

301
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,000
The doctor in your case is very good.

302
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,680
I'm scared.

303
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:30,520
The doctor will reattach your finger
and then you'll be just fine.

304
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,040
Then you'll be able to play piano again.

305
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,800
What if the doctor can't do it?

306
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,280
Then you can play piano
using your right hand.

307
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,440
And I'll be your left hand.

308
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,520
It's going to be all right.

309
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,600
Get some rest. Mom will be back soon.
Don't be scared.

310
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:17,040
You can make merit for others
while you pour the holy water.

311
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,960
Just as the rivers
full of water fill the ocean,

312
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,199
so does what is here given
to benefit the dead.

313
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,040
Whatever you wish or want,
may it quickly be.

314
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,600
May all your wishes be fulfilled.

315
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,840
May all your distress disappear.

316
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,239
May all diseases be destroyed.

317
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,680
Mom must be happy

318
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,120
that you're back
for the anniversary of her death.

319
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,360
But we didn't have time
to go make merit at the temple.

320
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,680
This is good enough.

321
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,280
Who knows? Maybe Dad is happy too.

322
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,080
I guess.

323
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,240
Ki.

324
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,240
Come help me clean up.

325
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,040
Let's do it together.

326
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,680
Ji!

327
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,720
I'm holding Mom's picture.

328
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,120
I got the tray. You come get the table.

329
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,600
Dad.

330
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,600
I'm leaving.

331
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,080
What?

332
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,200
You just got here.

333
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,520
Yes. I'll try to stay longer
next time I come home.

334
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,720
It's fine.

335
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,160
You should get back to work.

336
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,880
What are you watching?

337
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,400
I'm just watching some drama.

338
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,680
Aren't you bored
staying here all the time?

339
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,520
You should go out sometimes.

340
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,040
I don't feel like it.

341
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,200
There is a lot of dust and smoke out here.

342
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,080
You might get sick.

343
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,960
Stop lecturing me.

344
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,760
I know.

345
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,720
Do you want to eat something?

346
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,280
I'll ask Ki to cook for you.

347
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,160
Shall we go?

348
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,520
I'll have to stop by the market
to get groceries after I drop you off.

349
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,120
Fine. All right.

350
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,120
Bye, Dad.

351
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,480
Bye.

352
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,640
Hey, come on.

353
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,560
All right. I'm coming.

354
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,120
Let's go.

355
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,720
I miss you, Mom.

356
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,040
Don't forget your promise to me.

357
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,760
Got it?

358
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,480
And don't tell Ki I gave you chicken.

359
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,040
He'll nag me about it.

360
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,400
I'll be off now.

361
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,520
Bye, Coin.

362
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,680
Bye.

363
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,480
Thank you for the ride.

364
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,880
And thank you for yesterday as well.

365
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,880
I didn't want to leave yet.

366
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,920
I'll remember.

367
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,920
So how did you get home last night?

368
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,920
My friend gave me a ride.

369
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,600
-Was it Achi?
-How did you know?

370
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,280
Well, people at the party said
Achi was there.

371
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,160
But he didn't stay long.

372
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,760
Yes.

373
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,760
He just gave me a ride.
It was no big deal.

374
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,960
I didn't say it was.

375
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,280
Don't tell anyone about it.

376
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,960
Do you think I'm that much of a tattler?

377
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,440
Who would I tell? Coin?

378
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,720
Whatever. Just shut up about it.

379
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,600
Keep my package for me.

380
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,800
Why didn't you have it sent to Bangkok?

381
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,040
It will be ages
before you come back for it.

382
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,560
That's my business. That will be all.

383
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,920
I'll get going now.

384
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,160
Get lost.

385
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,560
Hey!

386
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,320
Thank you.

387
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,240
Are you that singer
from the homecoming party?

388
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,360
That's right.

389
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,080
Are you also an alumni?

390
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,040
Which class were you in?

391
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,400
No, I was just helping out.

392
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,240
I see.

393
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,200
Hey, are these from Dragonfly Farm?

394
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,760
Yes.

395
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,680
I'm a regular customer.

396
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,600
So what did you bring today?
Can I have a look?

397
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,640
Sure.

398
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,920
This is fresh produce.

399
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:47,320
Well, you got a flat tire.
How did you even get here?

400
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,120
Flat tire?

401
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,560
What?

402
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,160
How did this happen?

403
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,480
Come on, let me help.
I'll take you to a garage nearby.

404
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,440
Can you help me
unload the vegetables first?

405
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,880
Sure.

406
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,800
I can push the motorbike myself.

407
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,440
It's fine. I want to help.

408
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,960
Thank you.

409
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,400
You're so kind.

410
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,640
Do you live near here, sir?

411
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,760
Yes.

412
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,960
You don't have to call me sir.

413
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,040
Well, what should I call you then?

414
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,480
How old are you?

415
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,720
I'm 26.

416
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,160
So we're the same age.

417
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,160
So I should call you…

418
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,160
Ki.

419
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,320
All right, Ki.

420
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,920
All right. So what's your name?

421
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,240
I'm Gumbie.

422
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,720
Gumbie?

423
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,760
How do you think I got a flat tire?

424
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,040
Maybe your tires are old,
so the air leaked out.

425
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,280
But I don't think that's the case.

426
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,560
Maybe I ran over something sharp.

427
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,040
Like a nail or something.

428
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,720
Do you see it?

429
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,960
It's what my instinct tells me.

430
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,280
Your instinct?

431
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,120
Didn't your instinct tell you
you got a flat tire

432
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,760
when you were riding the bike?

433
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,560
Are you making fun of me?

434
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,160
Why don't we make a bet

435
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,880
about how I got a flat tire?

436
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,120
What will I get?

437
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,440
All right. You win.

438
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:01,840
What do you want?

439
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,960
Well…

440
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,560
You're a chef, right?

441
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,160
How about you cook a meal for me?

442
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,360
Well, I'm not a chef.

443
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,880
I do food vlogs.

444
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,440
-Food vlogs?
-Yes.

445
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,840
What are they?

446
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,320
It's online content.

447
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,080
I see.

448
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,440
Right.

449
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,360
Here.

450
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,480
Goodness, Ki.

451
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,360
Your channel has over 100,000 subscribers.

452
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,320
Well, I started doing it
not that long ago.

453
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,200
I'm still figuring out what to do.

454
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,720
Anyway,

455
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,280
what's your channel called?

456
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,000
It's called

457
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,600
L'oeuf

458
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,480
It means eggs in French.

459
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,520
Gosh, you must think I'm dumb.

460
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,520
No, I meant for it to sound like "love."

461
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,880
You know,

462
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,640
my farm has a lot of cats.

463
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,320
I always let one out of the bag.

464
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,040
Do you always do that?

465
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,880
That's right.

466
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,320
I let the cats out of the bag

467
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,320
so they can roam free and be happy.

468
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,360
I can show you my cats sometimes.

469
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,240
You really don't know what that means?

470
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,080
Let's go.

471
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,560
Here's your phone.

472
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,880
DEMON SLAYER

473
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,080
JUJUTSU KAISEN

474
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:04,280
NOTIFICATION MEMORIES

475
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,600
You still won't quit haunting me.

476
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:12,720
ACHI

477
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,840
My gosh. Who can it be?

478
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,360
Don't tell me…

479
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,320
I'm coming.

480
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,240
So it's you.

481
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,600
You troublemaker.

482
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,960
My mom asked me to bring you banana bread.

483
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,000
Thank you.

484
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,880
Please thank her for me.

485
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,320
What is it?

486
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,160
See for yourself.

487
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,120
Don't turn around.

488
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,200
Why are you embarrassed?
I've seen your place look messier.

489
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,680
Did you really clean up?

490
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,240
Ji, where can I wash my clothes?

491
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,800
-Here.
-Let's use this to do a food vlog.

492
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,320
This is bamboo shoot.

493
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:59,280
So what's the status of your relationship
with Achivich right now, Mona?

494
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,880
You'll have to ask him that.

495
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,200
Right now, I need a friend.

496
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,760
Can you be my friend?

497
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:12,440
