1
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,320
I just want my patient to know

2
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,200
before it's too late like with my mom.

3
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,760
You're a full-fledged doctor now.

4
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,280
You can do whatever you want to do.

5
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,680
I feel so bad for her.

6
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,440
I want to play Achi's song.

7
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,400
Then can I add something to the lyrics?

8
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,240
I want to add the word "sorry" in there.

9
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,880
I want to start over with this person.

10
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,040
ACHI

11
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,880
ACHI

12
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,720
What's up, doctor?

13
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,960
Hello.

14
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,360
Are you free to talk?

15
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,920
Yes. Is anything wrong?

16
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,200
Can't I call you if there's nothing?

17
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,720
I also miss you.

18
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,960
Who said I missed you?

19
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,440
You must have worked too much,
Mr. Superstar.

20
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,120
I didn't reply to your texts,
so I'm calling you.

21
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,560
But I miss you so much.

22
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,720
What's with you?

23
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,160
We just saw each other.

24
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,040
What's wrong?

25
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,760
Are you tired?

26
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,440
Yes.

27
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,760
Have you eaten anything?

28
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,040
Not yet.

29
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,120
So where are you now?

30
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,200
Excuse me.

31
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,720
Are you Dr. Ji?

32
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,720
Yes.

33
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,519
I'm Dan, Achivich's manager.

34
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,920
I think we need to talk.

35
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,120
I'll get straight to the point.

36
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,480
If you really care about Achi,

37
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,280
you wouldn't want to distract him
or cause him to lose his fanbase.

38
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,240
Please understand that
his career has an emotional impact

39
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,280
on his fans and sponsors.

40
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,040
But if you can help him concentrate
and perform better,

41
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,720
then I'm okay with it.

42
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,040
But if not,

43
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,280
I'll have to deal with this in my way.

44
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,440
I hope you understand.

45
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,320
Go like this. Okay, let's do it.

46
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,800
One more time.

47
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,800
Five, six, seven, go.

48
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
I DON'T THINK I CAN GO ANYMORE.

49
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,960
Seven, eight.

50
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,160
Good.

51
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,400
Five, six.

52
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,400
Greetings, sir.

53
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,320
Okay. Can I use the computer
to check my lab reports

54
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,720
while they're preparing?

55
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,120
Take it easy, doctor.
You're going to break it.

56
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,160
You're a woman. Carry yourself better.

57
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,400
Okay.

58
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,080
But I'm in a hurry.

59
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,720
It's very nice
to fall in love with someone.

60
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,360
Look at the patient sent
by the Physical Therapy Center.

61
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,000
When Dr. Ji used the rabbit doll Ichi
to talk to her,

62
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,640
she finally talked to him and agreed
to do physical therapy.

63
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,600
Keep your voice down.

64
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,360
This is a secret, Joo.

65
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,080
I never thought there'd be a doctor
who'd use a doll to talk to his patient.

66
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,600
But Dr. Ji is so nice, isn't he?

67
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,200
He talked the patient
into doing physical therapy.

68
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,240
We can do anything with support.

69
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,280
She's totally right.

70
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,960
It gives me so much willpower to work.

71
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,320
Which fan club do you belong to?

72
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,440
Achi's fan club.

73
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,640
Do you like him?

74
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,880
Achivich is cute, isn't he?

75
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,920
Hey, introduce me to the club.

76
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,360
Sure, I'll give you the information,

77
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,520
but now, I have an operation to perform.

78
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,080
Come over. I'll tell you about it.

79
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,920
All right, now we have to make
some shrimp paste dip.

80
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,920
But before that, let's talk about this.
Why are the vegetables so fresh, Gumbie?

81
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,640
These vegetables are from Dragonfly Farm.

82
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,680
You can only get them

83
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,600
-Where?
-in Chiang Mai.

84
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,680
I see, in Chiang Mai.

85
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,920
-If you come, please buy some vegetables
-Yes.

86
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,400
-at the Dragonfly Farm.
-Yes.

87
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,560
And besides vegetables, we also have eggs.

88
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,240
-Eggs?
-Yes, organic chicken eggs.

89
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,320
-Chickens. All right.
-Chickens, yes.

90
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,280
-Show us the correct way to cut them.
-Sure.

91
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,000
Let's go with cucumber first.

92
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,280
Go ahead and cut the head and the tail.

93
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,120
It's too sharp.

94
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,400
All right, the last step.

95
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,920
Arrange the vegetables.

96
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,760
This is a gimmick you can't miss.

97
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,240
Choo, choo. Clickety-clack.

98
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,400
Excuse me, ma'am.

99
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,280
Has Gumbie come here at all?

100
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,520
Ma'am?

101
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,600
I mean, miss.

102
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,600
He hasn't come here for days already.

103
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,640
When I called him to order more,
he said he had no produce.

104
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,640
I see. Is that so?

105
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,280
Well, if you want anything,
you can write it down.

106
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,880
I will call and tell him for you.

107
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,960
Do you want anything?

108
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,680
Well,

109
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,200
I'll do that next time.

110
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,440
Honey, he's asking where Gumbie is.

111
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,080
Can you tell him?

112
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,960
I think he's at his farm.

113
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,760
I heard him complaining
about having to fix a coop.

114
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,800
I see. Thank you.

115
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,240
Do you want anything?

116
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,320
Hey!

117
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,400
What are you doing here, Ki?

118
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,560
-Ki.
-Gumbie.

119
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,920
What is it?

120
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,920
I'm sorry, Gumbie.

121
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,880
It's okay.

122
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,440
You were fixing things for me,

123
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,080
but I was being impolite
and chasing you away.

124
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,320
I'm sorry, Gumbie.

125
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,240
I'm not forgiving you.

126
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,760
Is that so?

127
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,080
It's okay.

128
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,040
I'm about to forgive you.

129
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,640
Won't you try harder?

130
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,840
Of course I will.

131
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,640
Well then, get on your knees.

132
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,440
Okay.

133
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,240
I'm kidding.

134
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,040
Are you teasing me?

135
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,160
But…

136
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,600
if you don't help me build a chicken coop,

137
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,960
I won't stop being mad at you.

138
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,480
Of course, I promised you, didn't I?

139
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,800
Shall we start now?

140
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,320
Yes.

141
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,280
But before we do that,

142
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,120
can I recharge my energy first?

143
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,200
Let's eat.

144
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,280
Sure.

145
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,800
It's your treat, okay?

146
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,280
Let's go.

147
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,800
Hey, Peh, they put a T-shirt up
for auction to help sick children.

148
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,280
Put in another 1,000 now.

149
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,720
A thousand?

150
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,600
That's too much. It's just a shirt.

151
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,560
It'd be expensive if it were just a shirt,

152
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,080
but this isn't the case.

153
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,440
Achivich is inviting us
to make merit here.

154
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,560
Our love and money can help others.

155
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,720
Gosh, okay. I'm doing it now.

156
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,720
Damn, he's using his fans' love
to help society.

157
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,960
He's such a nice person.

158
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,960
What about you?

159
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,640
Do you want to make merit for society

160
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,240
by putting in some love and money?

161
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,040
Let me see.

162
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,200
Great job, doctor.

163
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Hey, someone has put in more money.

164
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,280
Peh, put in some more.

165
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,200
-Are you sure
-Yes, put in some more.

166
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,000
that you don't have this design?

167
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,360
This is the new collection.
Last year's was white.

168
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,520
How did you know that, Ji?

169
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,920
Hey,

170
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,840
Achivich is making merit,
so let's put in another thousand.

171
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,800
Look, I've put in some more.

172
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,800
We got it!

173
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,480
-Hey, we got it, right?
-Yes, we got it.

174
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,520
Yes!

175
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,560
We got it.

176
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,640
-Damn.
-My gosh.

177
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,400
Jeez, this is harder than when I had
to deliver a baby at an intersection.

178
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,840
Gosh.

179
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,920
Okay, Peh. Turn off the computer.
Let's go for the evening round.

180
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,720
-Let's go, Ichi.
-Mission complete.

181
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,680
I mean,

182
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,520
Ji.

183
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,280
Ji is about to scold us.

184
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,520
-Come on, Peh.
-Okay, let's go.

185
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,600
-Come on.
-Let's go.

186
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,200
Gosh, we finally got the T-shirt.

187
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,640
Well done, Peh.

188
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,960
That's a lot of money.

189
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,280
What are you writing?

190
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,520
Here.

191
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:25,320
GOOD LUCK, MY FRIEND

192
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,160
What's with your collar?

193
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,360
Tidy it for me.

194
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,720
We're done!

195
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,960
We're done!

196
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,560
I'll get going, Dr. Ji,

197
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,840
Superstar Achi.

198
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,680
Things will go as I say

199
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,120
for sure!

200
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,800
Why is it quiet here?

201
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,160
Are you copying me?

202
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,800
What a troll.

203
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,560
Isn't the weather nice?

204
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,080
Yes.

205
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,520
It's so nice.

206
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,960
GOOD LUCK, FRIEND

207
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,200
Let's come back here together again.

208
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,400
DON'T FORGET ME

209
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,760
Okay.

210
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,480
Do you want to come over for a movie?

211
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,960
Sure.

212
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,480
What kind of movie
are you making me watch?

213
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,280
Is it porn?

214
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,680
It's art.

215
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,640
I don't want to watch it anymore.

216
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,520
Why?

217
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,800
You don't like it?

218
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,400
Let's turn it off and go to bed.

219
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,240
Do you want to try it?

220
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,200
No.

221
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,080
Six, seven, go.

222
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:57,040
Can we turn from friends into lovers now?

223
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,280
One more time. Concentrate.

224
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,560
I need you to concentrate.

225
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,920
Come on. Get to the hook.

226
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,880
Five, six, seven, go.

227
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:11,560
Can we turn from friends into lovers now?

228
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,280
Okay, let's go to the second verse.

229
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,000
Okay? Concentrate, all right?

230
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,480
Okay, five, six, seven, go.

231
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,400
I'll let you say it first

232
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,800
Say it

233
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,800
Please understand I want to be your man

234
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,720
What's going on?

235
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,160
Are you all right?

236
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,720
Are you okay?

237
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,000
Well, can we have a 15-minute break?

238
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,440
Sure.

239
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,160
Okay, let's break for 15 minutes.
You can go to the restroom.

240
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,520
Okay.

241
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,160
-Let's take a break.
-I'm sorry.

242
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,160
Please understand that
his career has an emotional impact

243
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,160
on his fans and sponsors.

244
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,600
But if you can help him concentrate
and perform better,

245
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,280
then I'm okay with it.

246
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,560
But if not,

247
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,440
I'll have to deal with this in my way.

248
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,160
I hope you understand.

249
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,840
I'm so lucky.
I thought you weren't back yet.

250
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,840
Was there not much work today?

251
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,200
It was tough as usual.

252
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,080
So why are you here today?

253
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,720
Right.

254
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,720
For you.

255
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,080
Please come see me.

256
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,320
I don't think I can.

257
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,040
Come on, try to come first.

258
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,840
I'm giving them to you in advance.

259
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,320
If you really can't come,
you can sell them.

260
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,840
The tickets were sold out.

261
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,200
Why are you giving me so many?

262
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,360
Well, you can invite
your friends or anyone along.

263
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,520
Seriously, I have a lot of fans
at the hospital.

264
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,040
Right, someone must want it.

265
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,480
But I want you to go.

266
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,560
Okay.

267
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,920
I'll see.

268
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,360
Thank you for giving me these.

269
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,760
Can we talk, Ji?

270
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,720
About what?

271
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,600
What else do we have to talk about?

272
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,520
Everything

273
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,680
in the past ten years.

274
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,240
Won't you sleep some more?

275
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,280
I couldn't sleep.

276
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,240
Does it hurt a lot?

277
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,000
Yes.

278
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,600
I'm sorry.

279
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,680
What for?

280
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,440
For doing it to you.

281
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,040
Why are you saying sorry?

282
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,160
You're not wrong.

283
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,080
I started it.

284
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,320
I'm in the wrong.

285
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,120
I'm sorry.

286
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,800
No,

287
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,720
you're not wrong.

288
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,640
You don't have to feel sorry.

289
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,600
I'm okay.

290
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,800
-The things between us--
-Don't tell anyone about it.

291
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,600
I know.

292
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,040
What I wanted to say

293
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,320
-was--
-I have a question.

294
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,920
Can I ask you something?

295
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Sure.

296
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,080
Do you think

297
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,840
we can still be friends?

298
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,400
You're being quiet.

299
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,320
Does this mean you don't want
to be friends with me anymore?

300
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,880
-I want to take responsibility.
-No need.

301
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,640
You only have
to be friends with me like before.

302
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,760
I want to be responsible for you.

303
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,520
Then forget about tonight.

304
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,280
Okay.

305
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,400
I know now.

306
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,600
Why bring it up again?

307
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,920
Why?

308
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,040
Why didn't you tell me you were leaving?

309
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,520
You're so self-centered.

310
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,120
I'm sorry.

311
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,320
I was a coward back then.

312
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,800
And are you brave enough now?

313
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,320
Aren't you going to ask at all
if I'm still hurt?

314
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,080
Screw you. Fine, let's not talk.

315
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,960
Be strong, Tiger.

316
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,560
Why are you here?

317
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,880
How were the exams?

318
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,840
Do you need help with anything else?

319
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,239
By the way,

320
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,600
can we talk?

321
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,400
Why did you bring the dolls here?

322
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,080
They are yours.

323
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,520
I'm here to give them back to you.

324
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,840
And I need to talk to you.

325
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,920
Achi.

326
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,000
I bought you iced red lemon soda.

327
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,640
Is this your friend?

328
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,760
Yes.

329
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,200
Hello, I'm Nu-nim.

330
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,680
-I'm--
-She's my girlfriend.

331
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,960
Achi.

332
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,480
Okay, that's great.

333
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,360
What do you want to talk to me about?

334
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,800
It's nothing.

335
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,680
I just wanted to return the dolls to you.

336
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,480
Keep them.

337
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,760
No, they're too girly.

338
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,040
Ki is going to tease me.

339
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,600
I said keep them.

340
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,160
They are yours.

341
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,160
Give them to your girlfriend.

342
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,280
If you don't want to keep them,
then don't.

343
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,840
Why are you throwing them away?

344
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,720
I'm sorry, Nu-nim.

345
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,240
It's okay,

346
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,960
but it wouldn't be okay
if we were really dating.

347
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,840
We won't.

348
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,640
You're my cousin. How can I do that?

349
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:26,120
By the way, what were you
and your friend fighting about?

350
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,280
Can you tell me?

351
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,880
I can't.

352
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,120
It's not something kids should know.

353
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,920
You two are adults,
but you fought over dolls.

354
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,560
You might not have noticed it,

355
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,760
but when you threw the dolls away,

356
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,080
your friend looked very sad.

357
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,520
Poor him.

358
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,000
Well then, I'll get going.

359
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,120
I don't know what I should do

360
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:04,120
I don't know what you'll say

361
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,280
If I confess my love to you

362
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,880
I'm afraid you don't feel the same way

363
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,560
I'm afraid you don't have feelings for me

364
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,440
I'm afraid things aren't like what I think

365
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,880
The closer we are

366
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,480
The more I'm afraid to say it

367
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:32,080
I can only wait for you to say it first

368
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:38,240
I really don't know
How much longer I'll have to wait

369
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,720
I'm waiting for you to say you love me

370
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:50,800
Because I don't want to be sad
How much longer

371
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,400
Will I have to hide it inside?

372
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,760
The closer we are

373
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:01,720
The more suffocated I get

374
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:08,640
I have to keep pretending
To be friends with you

375
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:14,240
I have to keep pretending…

376
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:20,120
To be friends with you…

377
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:31,040
That day I did it out of temper

378
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:38,400
I didn't listen to you
It's made things turned out this way

379
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,280
That day I did it because I knew

380
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:52,080
I'd be the only one getting heartbroken

381
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,080
Right now

382
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:59,040
-I'm the one in the wrong
-I'm sorry.

383
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:05,200
I'll do anything to restart things over

384
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,320
I want to say I love you again and again

385
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,440
I want you to hear it already

386
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:19,960
I'm sorry for being this way
When it's already too late

387
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,360
Even now

388
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:27,560
I don't want if there'll be a way

389
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:33,480
For us to restart things…

390
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,800
All over again…

391
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,800
What is it, dear?

392
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,200
Mom.

393
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,680
I'm coming to live with you in the US.

394
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,640
Really?

395
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,400
Is anything wrong?

396
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,320
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

397
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,520
I just want to continue
my studies there as you suggested.

398
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,560
I think it's better.

399
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,440
Okay.

400
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,000
You must really come.

401
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,280
I won't let you change your mind anymore.

402
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,920
These are the tickets to the beach.
I can't go with you anymore.

403
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,880
Go there with your girlfriend.

404
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,840
Are you here to see Achi?

405
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,200
He's not here.

406
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,760
I see. Okay.

407
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,600
When is he coming back?

408
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,840
I meant he'll be gone for a long time.

409
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,480
He just left for Bangkok last night.

410
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,440
When will he come back?

411
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,200
He'll be back in four to five years.

412
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,840
He's gone to stay
with Madam Chan in Chicago.

413
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,720
I heard he'll continue his studies there.

414
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,600
Ji.

415
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,200
Ji.

416
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,040
What's wrong?

417
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,800
Nothing.

418
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,520
Look, Money was also shocked.

419
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,680
See? She has been sad

420
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,080
and wouldn't eat.

421
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,400
I don't know what to do now.

422
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,440
Achi told me to take care of her.

423
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,760
Mom.

424
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,360
Hey, whose dog is this?

425
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,720
It's Achi's dog.

426
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,640
Can I keep her?

427
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,160
You can't.

428
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,600
How can we keep a dog
when we sell pork? It's dirty.

429
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,360
Then don't take her to the market.

430
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,080
Let her stay at home.
I'll be responsible for her.

431
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,520
Look at you. Don't cry.

432
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,560
You're not a small kid to be crying
for wanting to keep a dog.

433
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,080
Please, Mom.

434
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,720
I pity her.

435
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,480
Not only was she hit by a car,
but she's also been dumped.

436
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,920
And if you go to study in Bangkok,

437
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,800
who is going to take care of her?

438
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,400
It will definitely be us.

439
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,160
Give her back to them.

440
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,960
They're no longer here.

441
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,320
Everyone has gone to the US.
Only Kwan is here.

442
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,440
Honey.

443
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,120
It's just a little dog.
Don't get so upset.

444
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,680
Keep her if you want,
but I won't help you.

445
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,920
Hey, honey.

446
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:32,600
Well, once Ji has left for Bangkok,
you'll miss him.

447
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,360
Consider this little dog
as Ji's representative.

448
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,240
Just let people do what they want.

449
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,040
This is what life is.

450
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,240
We don't know how long we'll live.

451
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,920
Hey, honey.

452
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,720
Don't say inauspicious things.

453
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:54,000
Ji, your mom loves dogs so much.

454
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:58,120
When she was younger,
she couldn't resist keeping little dogs.

455
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,880
It took me years to talk her
into selling pork.

456
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,480
What's she called?

457
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,400
Money.

458
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,880
-Money?
-It's a good name.

459
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,280
Bring us a fortune, all right?

460
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,640
Dad, her name is Money.

461
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,920
Well, it means money.
A lot of money means wealth, right?

462
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,480
And this.

463
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,440
-That's all.
-Okay, sure, some ground pork.

464
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,560
This one, honey.

465
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,880
I don't think he got in.
He only read comic books.

466
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,960
Hey, Ki.

467
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,360
-It's here.
-It's here.

468
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,920
-Hey, that's Ji. It's his name! Ji!
-Hey, that's his name.

469
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,000
-He made it!
-He did it!

470
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:15,800
-Good job, son.
-Let's dance to fulfill our vow, Ki.

471
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,640
When you asked us to be friends back then,

472
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,040
what did you mean?

473
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,960
Well, it was your face.

474
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:33,000
You didn't look okay after we had sex.

475
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,840
I wasn't okay that I hurt you.

476
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,760
I thought you felt bad.

477
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,600
That's right,

478
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,040
but not in that way.

479
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,640
Well, I was scared.

480
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,280
I was confused.

481
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,720
I was afraid you'd change.

482
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,000
So you told us to be friends?

483
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,240
Well, you had a girlfriend.

484
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,520
No.

485
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,360
I lied to you.

486
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,560
That girl was my cousin.

487
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,040
I was upset that you wanted
to return the dolls.

488
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,680
It was like you were saying

489
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,760
you wouldn't get involved with me again.

490
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,800
I don't get it.

491
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,560
Weren't you the one being cold to me?

492
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,480
You didn't text me, call me, or anything.

493
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:53,920
So this means

494
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:58,800
we didn't get to continue it
because of something trivial?

495
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,400
Yes, probably.

496
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,000
If back then,

497
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,840
we had talked to each other…

498
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,320
We were young back then.

499
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,760
What about now?

500
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,240
I've waited ten years for today, Ji.

501
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,720
Actually, I always thought

502
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,640
that it'd be great
if I could meet you again.

503
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,120
But you always had a girlfriend.

504
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,960
But none was called Jirawat.

505
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,240
You're overreacting.

506
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:35,560
I meant it.

507
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,640
Oftentimes, I thought

508
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,360
what the hell was I doing

509
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,240
and that I had
to clear things up with you.

510
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,400
What if I didn't give you a chance

511
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,040
and that I had a lover? What would you do?

512
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,280
Well, I'd check first.

513
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:58,320
If you had a lover, I'd leave you alone.

514
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,720
Does this mean before you came to see me,

515
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,000
have you already looked into it?

516
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,360
Yes, of course.

517
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,480
Gosh, I'm hungry.

518
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,120
I haven't had anything
since I was done with the practice.

519
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,760
-Got anything for me to eat?
-No.

520
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,120
You don't take care
of yourself at all, Dr. Ji.

521
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,640
Take care of what?

522
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,720
Yes, it's Ji.

523
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,040
This is Ji and Achivich, right?

524
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,560
Right, Peh?

525
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,080
-Right, the leaked photos.
-Do you have anything to say, Achi?

526
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,560
That's really me.

527
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,040
I had always thought

528
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:04,200
that you and Achivich would come
to this point.

529
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,600
If you want to come back

530
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,480
and move forward with Ji,

531
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:10,000
don't make him sad like that again.

532
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,800
Regardless of what happened in the past,

533
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,360
from now, now,

534
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,640
let's move forward together.

535
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:23,280
