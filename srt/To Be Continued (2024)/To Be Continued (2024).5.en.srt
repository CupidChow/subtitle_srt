1
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,560
Why do you seem so distracted lately?

2
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,920
Well, it's nothing.

3
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,720
Why didn't you sleep at your condo?

4
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,600
Where have you been?

5
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,240
You really like watching movies.

6
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,680
I don't really like movies.

7
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,840
Especially romantic movies.

8
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,240
Maybe you need to be in love

9
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,560
in order to enjoy them.

10
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,360
You talk like you're in love.

11
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,960
There you go again, Ji.

12
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,320
Dr. Ji, someone asked me
to give this to you.

13
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,560
Who was it?

14
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,560
FOR BUTCHER

15
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,480
I told you not to accept things
from strangers, didn't I?

16
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,520
He's not a stranger.

17
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,480
That handsome guy came to see you once.

18
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,680
FOR BUTCHER

19
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,160
So where did he go?

20
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,800
He already left,

21
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,040
but he asked me to tell you
that he'd come and get the box himself.

22
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,480
WHO…

23
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,240
Hey, why are you throwing it away?

24
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,920
Did you write it wrong?

25
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,960
I don't really like the color green.

26
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,840
WHO ASKED YOU THIS?

27
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,480
Please give this back to him for me.

28
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,720
Bye.

29
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,680
Slow down.

30
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,320
How much is it?

31
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,120
It's 200.

32
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,680
You said 100 earlier.

33
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,640
Fine, 120.

34
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
Is it here?

35
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,560
My gosh.

36
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,360
When we played football,

37
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,360
I thought he was just good-looking.

38
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,280
But when he walks in
all dressed up in nice clothes,

39
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,200
he looks like a celebrity.

40
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,800
He'll definitely become a male lead.

41
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,240
That's nonsense.

42
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,640
I'm serious. He's handsome.

43
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,440
Where is Pear?

44
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,440
Over there.

45
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,400
Okay.

46
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,160
Ji.

47
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,320
Play football with me first.

48
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,640
I'm not here to play football.

49
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,320
You play with Peh.

50
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,840
Yes, I can play.

51
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,400
Just now, Peh said

52
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,040
you'd definitely become a star.

53
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,640
Why?

54
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,480
I don't know. Ask him.

55
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,280
It'd be nice if you do.

56
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,800
I want to be friends with a star.

57
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,800
I'll get going.

58
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,320
Hey.

59
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,240
Please be lenient with me, Mr. Star.

60
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,120
No, I want to use some force.

61
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,600
Hey, are we starting now?
Okay. Come on, let's do it.

62
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,640
Damn, if it weren't raining,
you wouldn't have stopped.

63
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,640
Were you going to play
like there was no tomorrow?

64
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,040
Kind of.

65
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,720
What kind of? I'm very exhausted.

66
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,040
Jeez, it's raining cats and dogs.

67
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,760
-Hey, Peh.
-Yes?

68
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,800
How long have you known Ji?

69
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,880
Well, since we were in seventh grade.

70
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,040
Why?

71
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,480
I was just asking.

72
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,760
Is that so?

73
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,440
Gosh.

74
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,080
Hey, how is it going?

75
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,320
Look at you two.

76
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,880
We don't look that bad.

77
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,120
Where's Pear?

78
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,960
Her dad came to pick her up.

79
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,720
-But I got this. I got her number.
-Hey.

80
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,440
Pear's number?

81
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,120
Yours, maybe.

82
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,680
You're something, Ji.

83
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,000
No, she had difficulty with chemistry,

84
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,800
so I asked if I could help her.

85
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,280
You said you would help me.

86
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,160
Peh is also good at studying.
Let him help you.

87
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,640
I'm really good. I'm not denying it,

88
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,560
but I'm not free.

89
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,559
Fine, I'll help you on the weekdays.

90
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,480
Weekends are for Pear.

91
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,520
Nice.

92
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,840
I'm thinking of inviting her to a movie

93
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,799
after we finish studying on Saturday.

94
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,720
-Which movie?
-The one I watched with Achi.

95
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,840
What? You already watched it.
Why watch it again?

96
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,880
Well, it's a romantic movie.

97
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,760
Damn, you're pretty smart.

98
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,520
I, Fortuneteller Peh,
can already see your future.

99
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,960
Achi, you're going to become a star.

100
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,880
And Ji,

101
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,320
you're going to be Dr. Jirawat Chotehirun.

102
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,600
What about you?

103
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,960
I'm going to be Dr. Peh.

104
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,320
A bright future is waiting.

105
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,400
VITAL SIGN MEASUREMENT ROOM

106
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,200
RECEPTION

107
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,000
SONG: SOS. I SAW ACHIVICH
IN AN EXAMINATION ROOM.

108
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,120
PEH: ACHIVICH? THE REAL ONE?

109
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,040
SONG: YES. MY HEART IS ABOUT
TO STOP BEATING.

110
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,920
PEH: THEN GET CPR
AND GET BACK TO WORK.

111
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,080
Song, I found you just in time.
You have already eaten, right?

112
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,600
Yes.

113
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,760
It's the case of the patient
in the wheelchair, Ms. Mona.

114
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,600
VITAL SIGN MEASUREMENT ROOM

115
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,920
Why are you smiling?

116
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,720
What? I'm not smiling.

117
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,440
Hey, Ji. Do you have any more OPD cases?

118
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,680
No, I don't.

119
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,000
There is an accident.

120
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,760
What accident?
Why do I have to go to the OPD?

121
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,080
Gosh,

122
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,920
it's a love accident.

123
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,480
What's with you?

124
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,920
You see, you won't understand
even if I explain it.

125
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,120
You must see it for yourself.
You can't miss it.

126
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,960
And why me?
Why don't you go see it yourself?

127
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,440
Well, I can't. I'm busy.

128
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,800
I'm not available. Speak of the devil.

129
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,720
See? The professor texted me.

130
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,480
Let's say I have to set up the OR.
I'll get going.

131
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,240
I'm sorry.

132
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,600
What's with him?

133
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,800
BANGKOK CENTER OF MEDICINE

134
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,560
No bones are broken or fractured.

135
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,120
Can I check your injury

136
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,160
and how you feel
when you put weight on it?

137
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,320
Sure.

138
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,280
-Does it hurt here?
-Yes.

139
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,440
Please try to put weight on it
as much as you can.

140
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,720
Please don't worry.
I'll make sure you won't fall.

141
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,160
I'm sorry.

142
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,960
Slowly.

143
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,400
All right, one.

144
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,440
Two.

145
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,920
-I'm sorry, miss.
-I'm sorry.

146
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,360
I'm sorry.

147
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,640
Slowly.

148
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,240
Slowly.

149
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,280
Based on the X-ray film,
the bone isn't fractured or broken.

150
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,720
And given the pain,

151
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,560
I believe your tendon has been injured
due to a twist.

152
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,240
I think it's an ankle sprain.

153
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,600
Please refrain from using your ankle
and apply a cold pack to it.

154
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,160
I'll wrap it with an elastic bandage
to prevent swelling and movement.

155
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,800
Also, please raise your foot high
while you sleep.

156
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,360
I'll prescribe you
anti-inflammatory drugs and painkillers.

157
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,480
Are you allergic to any drug?

158
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,760
No.

159
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,280
Yes, there is.

160
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,520
She's allergic to penicillin.

161
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,000
Do you have any drug allergy documents
or photos of it?

162
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,120
You're so good for always carrying
the drug allergy card with you.

163
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,800
It helps my work easier. Thank you.

164
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,160
Do you have any other questions?

165
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,840
No.

166
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,320
Okay, here you go.

167
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,760
It's all done.
You can get your medicine now.

168
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,960
I'm a fan of your dramas, Mona.

169
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,120
You did so well in that one.
You were so evil.

170
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,080
Are you filming anything right now?

171
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,680
Yes, I'm filming one.

172
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,320
Well, you may have to rest
for a few weeks.

173
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,040
This is your appointment slip.
The doctor has scheduled a follow-up.

174
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,080
Also, please go to the cashier

175
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,200
and get your medicine at the pharmacy.

176
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,560
-Sure, thank you so much.
-Get well soon.

177
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,560
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

178
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,080
Why is he here?

179
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,200
Hey, August. What are you doing here?

180
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,800
I'm here with the handsome guy.

181
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,880
Come here.

182
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,040
Do you want some?

183
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,680
Why are you crying?

184
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,079
Well, it's sad.

185
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,920
Ji.

186
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,200
-Yes?
-The movie was fun, wasn't it?

187
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,480
Yes.

188
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,200
I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.

189
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,040
Let's go. What do you want?

190
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,400
Well, I want some curry noodles.

191
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,640
Curry noodles?

192
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,240
Yes, Mom.

193
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,800
Achi.

194
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,200
I bought a house in Chicago.

195
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,120
Is that so? I'm happy for you.

196
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,760
But you don't sound happy at all.

197
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,200
Look, I waited to call and tell you
before anyone else.

198
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,000
I'm really happy, Mom.

199
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,920
Now, you can come to stay with me here.

200
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,440
We have a house of our own now.

201
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,160
When are you coming to see me?
How about this semester break?

202
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,840
Later, Mom.

203
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,000
I want to finish school first.

204
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,880
Up to you then,

205
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,760
but behave over there, okay?

206
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,560
Give me a call
whenever you want to come see me.

207
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,520
I'm always ready.

208
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,400
I love you, Achi.

209
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,480
I love you, Mom.

210
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,880
Hello?

211
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,480
You sound so polite. Are you with a girl?

212
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,000
No.

213
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,040
What's it? Why are you calling me?

214
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,880
It's nothing. I just wanted to call you.

215
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,240
I bet you're calling to brag
about your date.

216
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,280
No. I can't sleep.

217
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,040
I see.

218
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,520
Do you want me to go see you?

219
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,800
Or should I not go?

220
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,520
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

221
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,240
Thank you so much, Achi.
I've wasted your time.

222
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,640
It's okay. This is nothing.

223
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,440
You're always kind to me.

224
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,120
It must be because I'm clumsy

225
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,560
and forgetful
so you've had to take care of me

226
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,960
since my return from the States.

227
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,600
You must be bored of it.

228
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,520
That's not it. I'm not bored.

229
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,560
You're not bored, but you're not into it.

230
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,880
I know that,

231
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,640
but I'm being stubborn.

232
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,120
I came to see you today

233
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,360
because I wanted to give it another go

234
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,440
in case I find out what I did wrong.

235
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,080
If I fix it,

236
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,120
we may be able to get back together.

237
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,520
I don't want to let you go
without doing anything.

238
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,200
It's nothing.
You didn't do anything wrong.

239
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,840
I just don't want
to waste your time any longer.

240
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,160
I'm happy

241
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,280
that you finally made things clear.

242
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,880
Does that condo belong to your lover?

243
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,080
No, it's my friend's.

244
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,400
So how did you get there?

245
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,000
Well, you wouldn't go back to your condo.

246
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,840
I asked Dan
after having waited for a long while.

247
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,640
Does Dan know?

248
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,480
It's not just Dan.

249
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,320
I saw reporters waiting for you
at your friend's condo.

250
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,680
That's why I rushed inside

251
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,200
and almost bumped into the kid
at the elevator.

252
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,320
The kid?

253
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,960
Hey, August! I've lost him.

254
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,280
Go find him now.

255
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,040
I'll get someone to pick me. Don't worry.

256
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,320
-Go now. Give me the shoes.
-Okay.

257
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,960
Here you go.
Yours is an orange juice, little man.

258
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,680
Eat it slowly. Are you that hungry?

259
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,080
August.

260
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,520
How did you get here?

261
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,560
I went down to get some food,

262
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,720
and a big-eyed lady bumped into me,

263
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,440
so I came here with Achivich.

264
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,000
So what do you have to do with this?

265
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,280
Why did you follow him here?

266
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,440
If you see a boy of around seven years old

267
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,880
wearing a white T-shirt and shorts,

268
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,160
please contact Information
in front of the hospital.

269
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,960
I think it's him.

270
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,240
I'll go and tell them now.

271
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,960
Okay.

272
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,080
Well, I don't think
I need to go there anymore.

273
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,440
This way, young man. Over here.

274
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,560
Thank you, sir.

275
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,080
There you are.
I was looking for you everywhere.

276
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,320
Achivich.

277
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,160
Why did you bring him here?
And why didn't you keep an eye on him?

278
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,280
What would you do if he disappeared
or anything happened to him?

279
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,800
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

280
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,000
Don't apologize to me.

281
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,520
Apologize to August.

282
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,760
August,

283
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,320
I'm sorry.

284
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,320
Take him back to the condo.

285
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,600
August, when you get home,
tell your mom to call me, okay?

286
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,720
Okay.

287
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,400
He's a kid. How could you forget him?

288
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,960
Remember this, Achi.

289
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,040
Whether it's a human or a dog,

290
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,240
you shouldn't leave them alone again.

291
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,320
Those chickens, you let them walk free?

292
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,680
Yes,

293
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,040
but I got a house for them at the back.

294
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,600
They sleep there at night.

295
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,680
But it's worn out now.

296
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,360
Right,

297
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,560
you have a degree in architecture, right?

298
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,200
Can you design their house?

299
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,760
How did you know?

300
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,920
I saw a broken frame with your degree
at your house.

301
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,480
I do have the degree,
but I've forgotten everything.

302
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,040
But I think
designing a house for the chickens

303
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,880
shouldn't be too hard for you.

304
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,360
Please?

305
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,000
Please?

306
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,720
Okay, fine,

307
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,960
but it'll be simple.

308
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,240
It won't look nice.

309
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,960
That's fine.

310
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,960
If it protects them from wind and rain,

311
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,600
they're happy.

312
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,640
What are you planting here?

313
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,960
Similar plants.

314
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,200
Peh!

315
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,080
Peh!

316
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,840
-Peh!
-Gosh, what's it?

317
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,560
Listen, it happened a while ago,

318
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,440
but my heart is still racing, Peh.

319
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,560
Just by thinking of his smile,

320
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,120
it's racing.

321
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,640
He smiled at me

322
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,320
and helped me.

323
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,320
Gosh, my heart is melting for him, Peh.

324
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,080
-He's so cute I'm dying.
-Hey.

325
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,720
So you really met Achivich?

326
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,720
Yes.

327
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,200
Just heart palpitations, right?
You won't die, right?

328
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,400
I can't die.
Who is going to do the work if I die?

329
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,080
You're right.

330
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,520
Check my pulse.

331
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,360
-It's over 120.
-Really?

332
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,320
You're exaggerating. You met him at noon.

333
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,480
Palpitations don't last that long.

334
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,160
The pulse of the patient with joint pain
was 120. It was palpitation.

335
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,120
I did a function test on them
and found an abnormal thyroid.

336
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,640
What the hell is this?

337
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,800
Do you have a thyroid problem?

338
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,240
You also have palpitations.

339
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,840
What did you do?

340
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,640
Well…

341
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,720
Nothing. I didn't do anything at all.

342
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,120
It's nothing.

343
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,520
Hey, Ji. Don't ask too much. I'm leaving.

344
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,880
What's with her?

345
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,960
And what about you?

346
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,960
Have you met a love patient
who makes your heart race, Dr. Jirawat?

347
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,200
What did you find out again?

348
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,320
What's wrong?

349
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,800
Why can't you sleep?

350
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,200
I feel strange.

351
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,640
With Pear?

352
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,240
You like her, don't you?

353
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,840
I don't know. I think so.

354
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,360
But it's weird.
I don't know how to explain.

355
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,160
I can't explain with words.
Do you understand?

356
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,480
I don't.

357
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,720
The more you talk,
the more confused I get.

358
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,360
You might be too happy with her
that it's made you this way.

359
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,480
Why don't you tell her
you're happy when you're with her

360
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,400
and start dating her?

361
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,400
I don't know.
I haven't talked to her since I got back.

362
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,080
I only called you.

363
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,640
Move. Let me sit with you.

364
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,720
Why?

365
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,480
What?

366
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,040
It's nothing.

367
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,480
You have a beautiful nose.

368
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,520
Maybe less beautiful than Pear's.

369
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,880
Why are you comparing yourself to her?
She's a woman.

370
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,280
So?

371
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,400
Nothing. I was just complimenting you.

372
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,560
Why did you speak so harshly?

373
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,920
It wasn't harsh.

374
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,600
I asked so what if my nose was beautiful.

375
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,800
I don't like how you said
the word "so" just now.

376
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,760
It was too blunt.

377
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,960
So, you bastard…

378
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,240
What do you want me to say?

379
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,160
Nothing that isn't…

380
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,200
Then let me show you something.

381
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,640
Hey.

382
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,640
I thought it was gone.

383
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,520
I kept it with me.

384
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,520
-You can't sleep, right?
-Yes.

385
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,280
I'll tell you a story.

386
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,920
I'm not a kindergartener.

387
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,240
Let's try it first.
I guarantee this works.

388
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Once upon a time,

389
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,960
there was a cute little rabbit.

390
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,800
It was the nicest animal in the jungle.

391
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,280
And one day,

392
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,080
it met a tiger.

393
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,920
Here, you're the tiger.

394
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,360
This is so silly.

395
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,960
Come on.

396
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,160
The tiger was a bully.

397
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,200
No one wanted to be friends with it.

398
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,040
Achi, are you insulting me?

399
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,480
It's the tiger. This is a story.

400
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,160
Fine then.

401
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,160
No one wanted to be friends
with the tiger,

402
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,360
but the rabbit was nice,

403
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,560
so it befriended a sulking tiger.

404
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,680
The tiger and the rabbit
became very close friends.

405
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,400
They played football
and hung out together.

406
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,920
And then, one day…

407
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,840
the tiger…

408
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,880
slept.

409
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,280
The rabbit was just afraid that

410
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,880
when the tiger fell in love…

411
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,360
it wouldn't matter
as it had been just a friend.

412
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,880
Sweet dream, my friend.

413
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,639
Here you go, a special surprise
only for this fan meeting.

414
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,320
I've prepared this Ichi-kun doll as a gift

415
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,800
to show my gratitude
for the support you have given me.

416
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,120
Book it together with a ticket
at the link below.

417
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,239
Hey.

418
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,440
Peh.

419
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,360
-Peh! Look at this!
-Gosh.

420
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,840
My bones, doctor. Jeez.

421
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,639
Hey.

422
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,840
There's also a link to make an order.

423
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,199
-Really?
-Yes.

424
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,480
-Here.
-Hey, you're right.

425
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,200
-Hey, l need to use your computer.
-Yes?

426
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,960
-Come on. Get up.
-Okay.

427
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,320
Gosh.

428
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,800
My gosh.

429
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,840
The rabbit is cute.

430
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,080
Gosh, I want to hug it.

431
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,640
Will I get it, Peh?

432
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,760
The word…

433
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,680
FOR BUTCHER

434
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,280
I DIDN'T ASK YOU FOR THIS

435
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,680
-Mom!
-Dear me! Gosh.

436
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,600
You surprised me.

437
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,320
Hey, luckily,
I didn't drop the fried rice.

438
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,320
Look, I'm cooking fried rice
with pork for you.

439
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,400
Aren't you bored eating it every day?

440
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,920
Hey, I think

441
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,880
you should learn how to cook it,
so I won't have to do it.

442
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,160
No, I don't want to.

443
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,880
I want you to cook it

444
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,080
for me forever.

445
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,600
You're good at pleasing.

446
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,160
This is what we call being lazy.

447
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,880
You know me too well.

448
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,200
It's getting burnt.

449
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,040
It smells so good.

450
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,040
-Come on.
-Is it done yet?

451
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,640
Go and grab a plate.

452
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,840
I guess I should move.

453
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,120
Have you eaten it,

454
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,280
the fried rice with pork?

455
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,160
I left it since this morning.
It must have gone bad.

456
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,600
It's all right.

457
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,360
I've cooked you more.

458
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,680
Are you tired today?

459
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,800
Yes, I am.

460
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,880
What about you? Are you tired?

461
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,720
How many times have you come
to my condo today?

462
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,040
Yes, I'm tired,

463
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,320
but I want to see you.

464
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,560
Nonsense.

465
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,800
Don't come if you're tired.

466
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,720
Then I won't bother you anymore.

467
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,720
Get some rest.

468
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,720
You just got here.

469
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,480
Why don't you get some rest first?

470
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,760
THANK YOU

471
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,840
THANK YOU

472
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,720
Yes.

473
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,240
Am I a joke to you?

474
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,000
Hello, Joo.

475
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,840
Just this?

476
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,640
Yes, take one first.

477
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,560
-I see. Sure.
-Come back later for more.

478
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,600
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

479
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,760
Sir, this is a case
of a single 50-year-old Thai man.

480
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,160
He came with knee pain. We found pus
in his knee and sent it for a culture.

481
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,520
He also has sepsis.

482
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,360
MISS YOU

483
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:25,320
YOU'RE OVERREACTING

484
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,400
I'M TIRED!

485
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,880
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU

486
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,640
DON'T FORGET YOUR FOOD

487
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,360
IT'S BAD, LEARN TO COOK IT AGAIN

488
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,680
DO YOU REMEMBER THE STORY
OF THE TIGER AND THE RABBIT?

489
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,920
After taking a bath
and putting on new clothes,

490
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:10,080
Ichi the Rabbit is still the cutest
in the jungle.

491
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,680
IT'S SO SMELLY, HAVE YOU EVER WASHED IT?

492
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,520
I have eaten, Mom.

493
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,080
I'll take a bath, wait for my patients,
and go to work soon.

494
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,560
Where did it go?

495
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,920
I was using it just now.

496
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,160
What are you looking for?

497
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,600
I'm looking for my phone.

498
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,800
What's the thing at your ear?

499
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,840
Yes, Mom. I found it.

500
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,080
What's with me?

501
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,280
Hey, Ji. Let me borrow your charger.
My phone is about to die.

502
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,320
I don't know where I put my power bank.

503
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,240
Were you on the night shift
and didn't sleep?

504
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,560
Why don't you wear clothes
with auspicious colors for your shifts?

505
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,920
It might help.

506
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,600
Gosh, Ji, you troll.

507
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:27,200
Do you believe in this kind of thing too?

508
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,440
No, I'm finding a solution

509
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,240
-for you.
-Let me borrow yours.

510
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:47,360
Isn't this the Achivich fan doll
that was just offered for pre-order?

511
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,440
Why did you get it already?

512
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,560
Did they already send out the orders?

513
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,560
Why haven't I gotten it yet?

514
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,280
Don't tell me it's lost, Ji.

515
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,520
Calm down.

516
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,520
Someone gave this to me.
Is it that important?

517
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,880
Of course.

518
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,520
Listen, this has a deep effect on me.

519
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:10,200
Let me have it. I need it to cure myself
from tough shifts. Okay?

520
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,800
What is it?

521
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,960
Hey, Ji. Be gentle. You're hurting him.

522
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,040
Then let go of it.

523
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,880
I've pre-ordered it. I'll get it soon.

524
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,160
Okay.

525
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,640
Hello, miss.

526
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,720
Which room?

527
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,800
Let me check. Just a second.

528
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,000
Hello.

529
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,080
The Examination Room 3.

530
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,720
The Examination Room 3? Okay.

531
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,440
Mr. Chanon, this way, please.

532
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,360
This is the last case for this morning.

533
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,200
He's a football player who fell down

534
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,480
and hurt his left knee.

535
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,040
You requested for his X-ray this morning.

536
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,760
Okay.

537
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,360
What does the film say, doctor?

538
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,560
Mom.

539
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,960
I said I'm okay.

540
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,640
"I'm okay." It has been two days,
but you just told me about it.

541
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,080
You know how important
legs are to football players.

542
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,280
Don't forget you got into the university
with a quota for football players.

543
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,720
What if you can't play?

544
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,040
Football players get injured all the time.

545
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,120
It's normal.

546
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,000
Am I right, doctor?

547
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,760
Yes.

548
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,960
Can I do another X-ray

549
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,960
or MRI for him?

550
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,600
What is an MRI?

551
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,760
It's an examination
with electromagnetic waves,

552
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,600
which can make things clearer for us.

553
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,440
Do we have to go that far, doctor?

554
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,320
My leg doesn't hurt that much.

555
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,720
Why do I have to do so much?

556
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,520
He's right.

557
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,440
Why does he need the MRI
or whatever it is? Is anything wrong?

558
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:16,280
I suspect he has a deadly disease,
such as cancer.

559
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,720
What?

560
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,680
Cancer?

561
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:25,280
Hey, what kind of nonsense is this?

562
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,440
He fell, but you're saying it's cancer?

563
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,400
Are you cursing him?

564
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,840
Where are your ethics?

565
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,480
How can he have cancer
at such a young age?

566
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,880
Well? Are you making it up?

567
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,520
This is such nonsense. You're crazy.

568
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,600
Please calm down, ma'am.

569
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,960
Calm down? Check it carefully
and tell me what's wrong with him exactly.

570
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,640
You can't just say whatever you want.

571
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,080
Doctor, please leave first.

572
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,160
Do you know how to read it?

573
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,480
Say it again.

574
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,640
You don't know what you're doing.
Where did you graduate from?

575
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,640
How can you do this to people?

576
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,400
-What is this?
-Ma'am, please let the doctor do

577
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,480
a bit more examination.

578
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,280
Ji.

579
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,840
What do we do?

580
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,560
No idea.

581
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,640
But if you want me to raise her,

582
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,240
you must also be responsible for her.

583
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,920
What do you mean?

584
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,360
PEAR

585
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,920
-Right?
-What is it, Pear?

586
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,320
Not like…

587
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,760
Wait here.

588
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:02,960
-Ji.
-Why?

589
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,880
-Achi.
-Ji.

590
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,720
What's going on between you two?

591
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,120
If you don't say it now…

592
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,720
…then don't say it ever again.

593
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:15,720
