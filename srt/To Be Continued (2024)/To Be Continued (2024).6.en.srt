1
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,480
Hey, August. What are you doing here?

2
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,640
I'm here with the handsome guy.

3
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,880
Why did you bring him here?
And why didn't you keep an eye on him?

4
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,400
He's a kid. How could you forget him?

5
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,800
Isn't this the Achivich fan doll
that was just offered for pre-order?

6
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,680
Which room?

7
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,880
This is such nonsense. You're crazy.

8
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,960
Please calm down, ma'am.

9
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,200
Calm down? Check it carefully
and tell me what's wrong with him exactly.

10
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,040
Ji.

11
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,840
That's your last case, right?

12
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,320
Let's go eat.

13
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,000
What are you doing here?

14
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,480
Well, I'm not sick or anything.

15
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,280
But I want to see a doctor.

16
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,080
That's a weird thing to say.

17
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,000
Are you hungry?

18
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,240
No.

19
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,440
You heard what happened in there, right?

20
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,800
Come on. You should eat something.

21
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,880
You can't work on an empty stomach.

22
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,760
Ji, watch out.

23
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,280
What do we do?

24
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,760
No idea.

25
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,720
You're all right now.

26
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,560
Will your owner come looking for you?

27
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,720
We'll go ask around tomorrow.

28
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,120
Make sure that no one is looking for her.

29
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,120
Okay.

30
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,960
Even if we can't find her owner,
my mom won't let me keep her anyway.

31
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,200
I think you might have to take her.

32
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,320
Think of a name for her.

33
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,000
Money.

34
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,000
-What?
-Money.

35
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,000
Why?

36
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,320
She cost me money at the vet.

37
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,840
But I'm glad she's all right.

38
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,080
But if you want me to raise her,

39
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,640
you must also be responsible for her.

40
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,960
What do you mean?

41
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,200
She can stay at my house

42
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,760
and you help take care of her.

43
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,520
Deal.

44
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,560
You'll be staying with Achi. He's rich.

45
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,400
Just tell him what you want to eat.

46
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,040
Are you really talking to a dog?

47
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,920
Don't let me see that you talk to her too.

48
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,880
Right? He'd better not be
talking to you too.

49
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,960
I'm sorry.

50
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,320
Are you talking to her?

51
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,560
I'm talking to you.

52
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,640
You had to take her
to get her vaccine shots with me,

53
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,960
so you didn't get to see Pear.

54
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,360
It's fine.

55
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,720
I can see her some other day.

56
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,760
Right.

57
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,360
Won't Pear be mad at you?

58
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,200
Well, I guess she might be a bit upset.

59
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,640
I see.

60
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,840
Do you want me to talk to her for you?

61
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,960
I can handle it myself.

62
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,520
Achi, come on. I'm holding Money.
You'll make me drop him.

63
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,880
So?

64
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,320
No one told you to hold him.

65
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,480
Achi.

66
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,240
That's enough. Stop it.

67
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,160
He's sleeping.

68
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,800
Do you want to spend the night
at my house with me and him?

69
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,000
Sorry.

70
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,160
My hands are full. I couldn't help.

71
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,280
I'm sorry.

72
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,320
Did you choose a dog over me?

73
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,720
Not so loud. He's sleeping.

74
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,880
Do you space out a lot?

75
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,240
No.

76
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,200
I'm thinking.

77
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,840
About that footballer?

78
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
Yes.

79
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,360
It's dangerous to space out.

80
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,800
Let's eat.
Stop thinking about this for a while.

81
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,600
You can worry about it later.

82
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,080
Here. I'm sorry
you had to come out to get this.

83
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,200
It's fine.

84
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,120
Wait.

85
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,440
No Post-it note today?

86
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,040
Just admit that you missed me.

87
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,760
Don't pretend to ask
for Post-it notes from me, Dr. Ji.

88
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,160
Who said I missed you?

89
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,400
I was just wondering.

90
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,720
You always leave me Post-it notes.

91
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,880
I rarely get to see you.

92
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,000
Why? Are you free today?

93
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,280
Yes.

94
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,520
Wait. Where's your food?

95
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,480
I made this for you.

96
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,080
So you're just here to bring me food?

97
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,480
Aren't you free today?

98
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,560
What's in this?

99
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,360
Sala syrup and lime soda.

100
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,680
You like it. Take it.

101
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,360
Take it.

102
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,120
Well, I'll get going now.

103
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
Come on.

104
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,760
Stay and eat with me.

105
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,440
You said you're free today.

106
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,560
Why are you smiling?

107
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,280
My gosh, Gumbie.
What are all these vegetables?

108
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,680
They're what you usually order.

109
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,040
Let me help.

110
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,480
Look at this, Ki.
Doesn't it look as good as new?

111
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,040
Your dad let me take it to get it fixed.

112
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,800
That's my stuff.
I can take care of it myself.

113
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,080
Just mind your business.

114
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,320
I'm sorry.

115
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,600
You don't like it?

116
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,840
It's all right.

117
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,880
I bet it's not as good
as your mom's cooking.

118
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,920
Right.

119
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,480
I'm really sorry, Ji.

120
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,160
About Ms. Duen.

121
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,600
I had no idea.

122
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,400
It's fine.

123
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,480
You couldn't help anyway.

124
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,440
Even I couldn't help her.

125
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,640
I was the last person in my family
to find out she had cancer.

126
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,040
She wouldn't tell me at first.

127
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,080
My mom got diagnosed
with terminal breast cancer.

128
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,160
I was a medical student.

129
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,080
But I couldn't do anything to save her.

130
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,000
If I had known sooner, my mom wouldn't--

131
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,120
Come on.

132
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,120
No one knows what would've happened
if you'd known sooner

133
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,080
or if your mom had told you
from the start.

134
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,840
I just want my patient to know

135
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,080
before it's too late like with my mom.

136
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,280
People deserve to know
what's going to happen to them

137
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,960
and what options they have.

138
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,960
Your mom would want you to be happy

139
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,080
and give everything your all.

140
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,960
You can't fix what's already in the past.

141
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,960
But you can still save your patient.

142
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,240
I believe that

143
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,080
you'll do everything as best as you can.

144
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,440
What makes you believe in me that much?

145
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,240
The Jirawat I know

146
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,520
always gives everything his all.

147
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,720
Things have changed since your mom died.

148
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,240
You're not the same person
you were back then.

149
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,680
You're a full-fledged doctor now.

150
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,640
You can do whatever you want to do.

151
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,640
If you're wrong, isn't it good?

152
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,120
That means your patient is fine.

153
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,680
But if what you think is right,

154
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,560
you can save your patient.

155
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,960
A footballer came in
with a pain in his left knee.

156
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,760
What do you guys think?

157
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,280
I think he has cancer.

158
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,480
I see something above the knee.

159
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,240
You've got good eyes.

160
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,400
No wonder you got a 3.97 GPA.

161
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,440
Your patient is lucky
to have you as his doctor.

162
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,400
What did your resident say?

163
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,760
Dr. Ji.

164
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,040
The senior resident looked at the films

165
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,040
and he agrees with you.

166
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,720
Where's Joo?

167
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,520
The senior resident requested her
on another case.

168
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,760
He will come to meet you shortly.

169
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,320
He said for you to go ahead
and handle this case.

170
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,440
The patient is still here?

171
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,520
Yes. Joo told him to go collect himself

172
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,440
and asked me to come get you.

173
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,160
Do you want to try
talking to the patient again?

174
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,640
He said he doesn't want
to receive treatment.

175
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,920
Ji.

176
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,360
-Can you two--
-Of course.

177
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,320
Why don't you hear him out first, Peh?

178
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,200
I can do anything for Dr. Ji.

179
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,640
And for you too.

180
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,960
How are you doing? Does it hurt?

181
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,520
It hurts even more now.

182
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,960
You have the right
to see a different doctor,

183
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,960
to go to another hospital,

184
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,600
or to refuse treatment.

185
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,400
I can't stop you from doing that.

186
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,240
That's right.
So all of you understand that.

187
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,440
But before you sign this form,

188
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,320
can I say something?

189
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,280
My mom had terminal cancer.

190
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,280
She passed away
before she could receive treatment.

191
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,880
I don't want that to happen
to any of my patients.

192
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,320
My mom had no options

193
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,720
and she found out when it was too late.

194
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,280
I know what that feels like.

195
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,640
What if my son doesn't have cancer?

196
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,120
I'll go to the media about this.

197
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,040
I'm going to sue all of you here.

198
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,840
Like I said this morning,

199
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,840
I want to do another X-ray

200
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,200
to get a clearer picture
of his upper knee.

201
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,800
Once we know the results,

202
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,080
we can determine
the appropriate treatment for him.

203
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,960
Maybe it's nothing serious.

204
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,800
The two of us,
as well as the senior resident,

205
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,120
we all agree that
your son needs further examination.

206
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,480
We've all looked at the films.

207
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,960
We might be able to find out
what's wrong with your son.

208
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,160
We may not be able to fix
what has already happened.

209
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,320
But right in this moment,

210
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,320
I'd like to have a chance
to take care of my patient.

211
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,560
That's nonsense.

212
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,800
But Mom…

213
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,920
What?

214
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,200
Can I talk to my mom privately?

215
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,080
I will

216
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,080
meet you guys later.

217
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,640
I need to know, Mom.

218
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,960
I need to know what's wrong with me.

219
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,120
If I really do have cancer,

220
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,800
we'll just have to learn more about it
and fight it together.

221
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,360
You've been with me
through so many matches.

222
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,200
I'm confident that…

223
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,600
we'll win this one too.

224
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,520
Let's go then.

225
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,880
Mom, wait.

226
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,960
This time,

227
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,440
let me go in and compete on my own
like I always do.

228
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,520
And I want you

229
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,840
to cheer for me on the sidelines

230
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,280
like you always do.

231
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,480
We got this.

232
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,960
The film is from this morning.

233
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,440
You can see these lines
on the upper corner here.

234
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,120
We took another X-ray of your thigh
to get a clearer picture.

235
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,000
Then we compared the films.

236
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,200
This is the frontal shot
and this is the side shot.

237
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,280
The blurred area up here
is where we spotted a mass.

238
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,480
Both the orthopedist
and the radiologist speculate

239
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,600
that it might be cancer.

240
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,880
Are you all right?

241
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,960
Cancer.

242
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,320
So that's it?

243
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,400
What about my dream?

244
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,840
And…

245
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,040
what about my mom?

246
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,680
What about…

247
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,080
What about sports?

248
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,640
Why…

249
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,440
Why did this have to happen

250
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,160
to me and my mom?

251
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,240
I don't understand.

252
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,480
Why are we so unlucky?

253
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,840
This is also a blessing in disguise.

254
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,800
The sooner you know,
the faster you can get it treated.

255
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,080
And it also answers the question you have.

256
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,120
You're not in this fight alone.

257
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,680
I understand

258
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,640
that no one wants this to happen.

259
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,920
I'm worried about you.

260
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,240
I want you to get an MRI

261
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,920
to determine the tumor's size
and the treatment plan.

262
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,200
I'm really sorry about this morning.

263
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,240
I sprang the news on you without thinking.

264
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,480
I want to apologize to you as well.

265
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,880
I apologize for how my mom reacted.

266
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,480
She tends

267
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,600
to get panicky easily.

268
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,360
And there's one more thing.

269
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,960
I'm sorry about your mom.

270
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,520
It's all right.

271
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,920
What's important is that
we save your life.

272
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,080
After that, you can go back
to chasing your dream.

273
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,160
I'll order an MRI for you.

274
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,560
Let's fight this thing together.

275
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,440
Okay.

276
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,640
Doctor.

277
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,920
Are you okay?

278
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,560
People don't know
what doctors have to go through.

279
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,760
It takes experience

280
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,240
before we can understand life.

281
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,880
How am I supposed to feel now?

282
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,480
Should I be happy

283
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,200
that I caught his cancer early?

284
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,600
Or should I be scared

285
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,960
that he would end up like my mom?

286
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,000
Or…

287
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,560
should I be hopeful
that he'll make a full recovery?

288
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,480
Although…

289
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,440
there's still a lot more
that he has to go through.

290
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,920
Come on, Ji.

291
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,560
Nothing is for certain
when it comes to medicine.

292
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,800
Although there's no hope,
we have to believe in miracles

293
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,960
and we must keep on fighting.

294
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,480
Ji, doctors are people too.

295
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,560
You just have to accept that

296
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,840
and support your patients
and their choices.

297
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,640
Just do your best as their doctor.

298
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,320
Thank you guys so much for sticking by me.

299
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,800
You got this.

300
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,120
Come on. Let's go eat.

301
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,400
-Come on.
-Let's go.

302
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,840
-Come with us.
-Come on, Ji.

303
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,880
-Let's go.
-I got it.

304
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,480
You carry him like he's a child.

305
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,800
I just want him to go eat and cheer up.

306
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,880
-Let's go.
-Come on.

307
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,440
Here you go.

308
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,360
-You're done for today.
-Thank you.

309
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,440
PEAR

310
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,160
I'm a very sweet
and understanding teacher.

311
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,760
What is it, Pear?

312
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:39,440
You don't have to sneak around
behind my back, okay?

313
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,440
-Peh.
-You're right, ma'am.

314
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,120
Just be honest with me.

315
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,960
-What?
-We got a problem.

316
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,320
Just come with me.

317
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,200
What happened?

318
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,000
I'll tell you later.

319
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,800
I always have your best interest at heart.

320
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,960
I just want you all to know that.

321
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,960
I am not your enemy.

322
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,240
I'm talking to you, Praween.

323
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,600
Come on. Hurry.

324
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,920
Hurry up.

325
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,360
Damn. This bike is loud.

326
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,200
Jeez.

327
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,960
Why did you hurt my friend?

328
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,880
-What did I do?
-You know what you did!

329
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,040
What did I do?

330
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,240
Wait, Ji.

331
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,760
Don't you see that they're fighting?

332
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,000
You don't know?

333
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,280
What did I do?

334
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,880
Don't you see Achi?

335
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,000
Wait here.

336
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,720
-Ji.
-Why?

337
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,800
You asshole. Why did you--

338
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,400
-Achi.
-Ji.

339
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,600
Achi.

340
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,200
-Get out of here.
-No.

341
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,480
Can we talk later?

342
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,160
Will this take long?

343
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,160
Butt out.

344
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,480
Tell me.

345
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,240
What's going on between you two?

346
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,280
Aren't we friends?

347
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,600
If you don't say it now,

348
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,560
then don't say it ever again.

349
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,120
I'm sorry.

350
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,800
Ji.

351
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,320
Ji, are you okay?

352
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,280
Hey! Knock it off!

353
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,440
Stop it.

354
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,000
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

355
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,560
We're here.

356
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,240
Here.

357
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,400
Hey.

358
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,880
Is your face still swollen?

359
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,960
Yes.

360
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,560
Thanks for getting ice for my face.

361
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,600
Why would you thank me?

362
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,320
It's what friends do.

363
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,440
I know. Thanks anyway.

364
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,960
You need to talk to your girlfriend.

365
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,960
Who are you talking about?

366
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,240
Pear of course.

367
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,480
When Achi was fighting
with that kid from another school,

368
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,960
Pear was also there.

369
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,960
Pear isn't my girlfriend.

370
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,640
What?

371
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,200
I thought you two were together.

372
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,160
The two of you always hang out
and go out together.

373
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,080
No, we're just friends.

374
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,360
So what was Achi so mad about?

375
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,280
Why did he punch you?

376
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,520
I don't know. Screw him.

377
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,800
Please. As if you could.

378
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,920
You'll forgive him once
he comes to apologize to you.

379
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,720
You're such a softie. I know you.

380
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,400
Come on.

381
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,120
He won't come.

382
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,120
Come on.

383
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,960
Cheer up.

384
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,280
-Wait.
-What is it?

385
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,800
You can't start your bike here.

386
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,200
You'll wake my dad.

387
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,440
Right. Okay then.

388
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,480
All right.

389
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,960
-Peh!
-Bye, Ji!

390
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,240
I just told you
not to start your bike here.

391
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,720
Why did you skip school?

392
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,240
Ms. Ratree called and told us

393
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,120
that you snuck out of school.

394
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,640
Who did you fight with?

395
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,200
A kid from another school.

396
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,480
Why did you fight him?

397
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,800
-Why?
-Dad!

398
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,200
-I didn't raise you to be a thug!
-Honey!

399
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,080
Honey! That's enough!

400
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,520
Ji knows now that what he did was wrong.

401
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,400
Will you beat him to death?

402
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,920
Learn your lesson.

403
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,440
Don't fight with anyone again.

404
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,920
Give me that.

405
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,520
Go upstairs, Ji.

406
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,360
Gosh.

407
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,920
How did you get in?

408
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,800
Ki let me in.

409
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,800
Ji.

410
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,920
I'm sorry.

411
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,120
I'm sorry I punched you.

412
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,280
You can punch me back or yell at me.

413
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,120
Are you really mad at me?

414
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,840
Mr. Bunny misbehaved today.

415
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,560
He lost his temper.

416
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,640
He punched the tiger, his friend.

417
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,680
Mr. Bunny really wants to explain himself,

418
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,400
but he doesn't know
if the tiger will listen.

419
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,440
Go ahead. The tiger is listening.

420
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,080
The tiger's girlfriend
was with another guy.

421
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,840
Mr. Bunny got furious
and punched that asshole.

422
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,280
The tiger came and saw everything.

423
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,760
He tried to stop Mr. Bunny.

424
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,080
After I punched you,

425
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,120
I was mad that you tried to stop me.

426
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,640
You didn't know what happened.

427
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,520
I'm sorry, Ji.

428
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,600
Why didn't you tell me when I asked you?

429
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,200
I didn't want

430
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,400
to hurt your feelings.

431
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,160
About Pear?

432
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,560
Yes.

433
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,480
She didn't cheat on me.

434
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,040
She and I aren't together.

435
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,120
Achi.

436
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,080
You're my friend.

437
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,480
I know.

438
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,240
We're friends.

439
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,240
I always put my friends first.

440
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,640
Can you promise me

441
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,840
you'll tell me everything?

442
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,600
I'll try.

443
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,560
You have to say yes.

444
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,800
Fine. Okay.

445
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,600
Happy now?

446
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,160
Yes.

447
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,440
Did I hurt you?

448
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,560
Yes, you did.

449
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,600
But my dad's beating hurt more.

450
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,600
Your dad beat you?

451
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,680
Yes.

452
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,080
For skipping school and fighting with you.

453
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,560
Where did he hit you?

454
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,760
Right here. Over here.

455
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,200
Can I take a look?

456
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,040
Fine.

457
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,480
Do you see it?

458
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,200
Yes.

459
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,720
I'm sorry.

460
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,840
You don't have to say sorry.

461
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,560
I'll be fine.
This isn't the first time my dad beat me.

462
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,280
What about you? How's your face?

463
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,280
Put some medicine on it.

464
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,600
My hands are full.

465
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,080
Fine. I'll do it for you.

466
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,600
Whatever.

467
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,720
Hey.

468
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,920
Okay. I'm up.

469
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,200
Have you been here long?

470
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,840
I just got here.

471
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,680
Get up.

472
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,480
I'll help you study.

473
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,960
Anyway, sign my friendship book for me.

474
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,600
Can't I sign your shirt?

475
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,840
That's for the last day of school.

476
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,320
-That's all?
-Yes.

477
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,760
We'll still see each other.

478
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,280
I won't write much.

479
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,360
-What if we go to different colleges?
-That's fine.

480
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,880
If I can't get into
the same college as you,

481
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,120
I'll go to a private college near you.

482
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,600
Or you can stay at my house in Bangkok.

483
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,720
Awesome.

484
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,320
Ji.

485
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,360
Gosh.

486
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,480
Come here.

487
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,040
Come on.

488
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,040
One, two…

489
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,160
Take it. It's our best picture together.

490
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,640
Okay. Great.

491
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,920
I'll put it in my friendship book
next to your messy handwriting.

492
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,160
Achi.

493
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,600
What?

494
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,720
Will you sleep soon?

495
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,600
In a bit.

496
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,160
Okay.

497
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,280
LOVE YOU, JI

498
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,160
-Hello, doctor.
-Hello.

499
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,920
How is she doing?

500
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,200
Nini won't do physiotherapy.

501
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,040
What should I do?

502
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,760
I feel so bad for her.

503
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:06,000
But I'm not sure whether
what she likes will help her or hurt her.

504
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,560
Hello, Dr. Ji.

505
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,600
Hello.

506
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,800
Are you Nini?

507
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,400
What are you listening to?

508
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,040
Can Mr. Bunny listen too?

509
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,480
Hello, everyone.

510
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,320
I'm Achivich.

511
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:03,280
My new single will come out in a few days.

512
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:07,480
I hope my new song will give you
the strength to keep fighting

513
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,120
just like how you all help keep me going.

514
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,560
Please give it a listen.

515
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,520
Let's keep going together.

516
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,320
Achi, do you need a break?

517
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,120
Let me try one more time.

518
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,320
When you were singing,
I couldn't tell at all how you felt.

519
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,600
What do you mean?

520
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,880
Do you remember what you said to me

521
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,640
when you came to see me?

522
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,920
I have something that has been on my mind.

523
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,400
It's a feeling that
I never get to say out loud.

524
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,600
But I don't want to hide it anymore.

525
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,080
I want to feel like there's still hope

526
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,000
for me to be with the person I love.

527
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,960
I thought you said no love song.

528
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,720
I changed my mind.

529
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,960
Okay. It's a good concept.
Let's go in that direction.

530
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,240
Try using that
as your inspiration when you sing.

531
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,320
Picture that person.

532
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,720
Think of their face
and their eyes to help you

533
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,240
get your emotions across.

534
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,440
Then can I add something to the lyrics?

535
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,680
I want to add the word &quot;sorry&quot; in there.

536
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,040
I want to start over with this person.

537
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,200
How is your finger doing, Nini?

538
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,440
Have you been doing physiotherapy?

539
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,400
Isn't this Ichi,
the doll for Achivich's fans?

540
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,600
Do you know Achivich?

541
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,600
Nini told us about him.

542
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,880
She has been playing
the promo for his new song all day.

543
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,480
I like him.

544
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,520
I like his voice.

545
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,120
Also, he's kind.

546
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,360
Nini's more willing
to do physiotherapy now.

547
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,600
She said she wants to start
playing piano again.

548
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,760
I want to play Achi's song.

549
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,440
All along, I have made you cry

550
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:28,960
It's all my fault
For not being good enough for you

551
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:34,880
I was hotheaded
And I said things I didn't mean

552
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,840
It was my words that drove you away

553
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:43,440
If you still love and care about me

554
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,120
If your love for me is still there

555
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:51,720
Can you come back to me
And give me another chance?

556
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:56,080
Can we be together again?

557
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:03,360
Will you keep going
With me on this journey?

558
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:08,680
Will you forgive me
For everything that I've done?

559
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,160
Please give our love another chance

560
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,480
Please tell me it's not too late

561
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:19,440
Believe me when I say it will be all right

562
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,240
Please let me prove my love to you

563
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,920
Please understand I want to be your man

564
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,760
How about we take a 15-minute break?

565
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,200
Are you Dr. Ji?

566
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,960
I think we need to talk.

567
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,800
If you really care about Achi,

568
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,240
you wouldn't want to distract him
or cause him to lose his fanbase.

569
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,960
Please come see me.

570
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,120
I don't think I can.

571
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,440
Do you think

572
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,160
we can still be friends?

573
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,000
