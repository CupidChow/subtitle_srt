1
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,400
Don't turn around.

2
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,480
Why are you embarrassed?
I've seen your place look messier.

3
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,960
Did you really clean up?

4
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,960
Here.

5
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,520
Let's use this to do a food vlog.

6
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,040
This is bamboo shoot.

7
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,920
So what's the status of your relationship
with Achivich right now, Mona?

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,400
We both took a step back
and are now like siblings.

9
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,080
Someone needs me more than you.

10
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,640
It's a mass burn case,
but why are all orthopedists here?

11
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,360
The burns are severe,

12
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,200
but everyone stepped on each other
so it became a mass casualty.

13
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,160
Ji.

14
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,720
-Yes?
-We're here.

15
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,440
You should leave already.

16
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,280
I'll leave after walking you home.

17
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,560
Gosh!

18
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,440
How did you get here?

19
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,040
You're really out of it, doctor.

20
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,120
Thank you for taking me home.

21
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,600
Sure.

22
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,960
You can go now.

23
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,560
Are you kicking me out?

24
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,120
I waited for you for over ten hours.

25
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,560
I didn't ask you to wait.

26
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,120
Just go if there's nothing else.

27
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,440
You left your car and ran off.
What was I supposed to do?

28
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,680
You could've…

29
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,760
let the nurse at the information desk
or the security guard know.

30
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,480
Come on.

31
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,400
Don't just sit there.

32
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,080
You have to leave.

33
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,800
-Come on.
-What?

34
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,360
I'm really tired.
Let me nap for 15 minutes.

35
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,480
No.

36
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,760
Nap with me.

37
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,240
Do you think this will turn out
like in a movie?

38
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,320
Please let me stay over.

39
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,880
If you want to stay,

40
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,280
go shower and brush your teeth first.

41
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,600
All right, Dr. Ji.

42
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,160
Thank you for letting me use
your bathroom, Dr. Jirawat.

43
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,200
Do you want to take
another shower with me?

44
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,480
Just go shower.

45
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,280
Do you have a headband?

46
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,720
I want to mask my face.

47
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,360
Well…

48
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,120
A hair tie?

49
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,720
I only have rubber bands. Will that do?

50
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,440
They hurt when I pull them off.

51
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,840
Then I can't help you,

52
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,480
Achivich.

53
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,600
Do you carry around face masks?

54
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,720
Yes.

55
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,480
I sometimes need these
before getting my makeup done.

56
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,680
Thank you.

57
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,600
You should put something on your eye.

58
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,520
I'll mask my face first.

59
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,200
Gosh, Ji!

60
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,640
Stop it, Ji.

61
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,960
Ji, stop!

62
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,360
What? I'm helping you.

63
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,800
-Ji, no.
-So it dries faster.

64
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,920
Ji, stop it.

65
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,640
What do you think you're doing?

66
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,280
What do you want from me?

67
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,840
It's nothing.

68
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,800
You should go to bed. It's late.

69
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,440
Fine. Suit yourself then.

70
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,240
I'll leave you alone.

71
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,880
Good night, Jirawat.

72
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,880
#ACHIVICHWEMISSYOU

73
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,000
#ACHIVICHWEMISSYOU

74
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,240
DAN, MANAGER: ACHIVICH,
WHERE ARE YOU? WHEN WILL YOU BE BACK?

75
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:16,280
I'LL BE BACK TOMORROW,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME

76
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,720
ACHIVICH: I'LL BE BACK TOMORROW
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME

77
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,360
Ji, you idiot.

78
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,440
Why did you let Achi come here?

79
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,160
You never learn your lesson.

80
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,600
Ji.

81
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,080
Are you asleep?

82
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,080
Are you asleep, Butcher?

83
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,320
I actually never wanted
to be friends with you.

84
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,440
I missed you so much.

85
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,600
I've missed you for ten years.

86
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,680
Your eyes.

87
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,880
Your nose.

88
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,720
Your lips.

89
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,640
They look nice.

90
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,720
What did you just say?

91
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,800
I said you have nice eyes.

92
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,400
You have a nice nose.

93
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,480
You have nice lips.

94
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,480
Lip Care. Peach lip balm.

95
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,040
Jo, can we do another take?

96
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,880
All right. Reset and go again.

97
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,040
Jo, I think Achi's face

98
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,320
looks a bit weird here.

99
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,600
Can you check for me?

100
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,240
We can apply some more concealers.

101
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,320
-Okay.
-All right.

102
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,320
All right.

103
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,320
Let me see.

104
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,440
Achi, what happened to your face?

105
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,760
It looks like someone punched you.

106
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,520
Do you think Achi was in a fistfight?

107
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,880
He just dropped something
on his face yesterday.

108
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,040
Just use makeup.

109
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,840
Make sure you cover up that bruise.

110
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,080
Use a lot of makeup.

111
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,080
All right. We're all set.

112
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,720
Come on. Let's go.

113
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,080
Okay. We'll do another take.

114
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,400
All right. Are you ready?
Three, two, and action.

115
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,960
Lip Care. Peach lip balm.

116
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,160
Why is there milk in an Americano?

117
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,040
That's a latte.

118
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,040
A sweet drink for a sweet guy like me.

119
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:29,320
This is an Americano with no sugar.

120
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,200
A bitter drink for a bitter guy like you.

121
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,600
You took my drink, you punk.

122
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,360
Hey, Ji.

123
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,960
You know,

124
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,400
about the fire incident yesterday,

125
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,440
if there had been
proper fire drills before this,

126
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,400
people wouldn't have panicked
and gotten crushed.

127
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,640
You should go sleep on the couch.

128
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,800
Or you can leave if you want.

129
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,160
I have to go to work early tomorrow.

130
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,360
I'm going to bed now.

131
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,440
If there had been
proper fire drills before this,

132
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,440
people wouldn't have panicked
and gotten crushed, right?

133
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,640
Right.

134
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,000
You don't have a fever.

135
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,280
What's with you?

136
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,040
-Come on. Tell me what's wrong.
-Knock it off.

137
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,760
Doctors.

138
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,360
What are you doing?

139
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,320
We're working.

140
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,120
NEW CONCEPT

141
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,480
The senior resident wants you to talk
about the finger case in a conference.

142
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,120
The hip surgery yesterday?

143
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,640
-It's next week, right?
-That's my case.

144
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,200
Take your coffee.

145
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,480
And go check on the outpatients.

146
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,320
You can have mine too.
I'll get another one.

147
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,520
Maybe I shouldn't get it.

148
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,000
No, I need coffee.

149
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,440
What would you like, doctor?

150
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,920
I'll have an iced Americano, please.

151
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,240
Iced Americano?

152
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,000
Yes.

153
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,920
Just one?

154
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,120
You normally order a latte.

155
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,120
Right. I'll have an iced latte then.

156
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,760
You're getting another?

157
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,680
Yes.

158
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,960
But you just bought two earlier.

159
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,400
Well, we doctors work very hard.

160
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,400
-I see.
-I'll have an iced latte.

161
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,800
You're acting weird.

162
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,080
Just get me coffee.

163
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,880
Yes, doctor.

164
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,440
PEH

165
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,920
Hey, what's up?

166
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,920
Ki, did our plan fail?

167
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,400
Ji looks like a mess after he came back.

168
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,240
What happened in Chiang Mai?

169
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,720
PEH

170
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,240
He seemed fine when he left. But…

171
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,240
I haven't talked to him since then.

172
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,320
What?

173
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,640
I'm on the phone.
I'll go put my stuff away.

174
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,360
I'm sure he's fine.

175
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,880
You can ask him yourself.
It's probably nothing.

176
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,360
Well? Tell me all about it.

177
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,360
Those two were close
before they became doctors.

178
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,480
But this morning,
I saw Dr. Peh touch Dr. Ji's dimple.

179
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,880
They're just friends.
They've been friends since high school.

180
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,960
If Dr. Peh and Dr. Ji
don't have feelings for each other,

181
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,800
what about you and Dr. Peh?

182
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,080
Gosh. He's my friend.

183
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,200
There's nothing more going on.

184
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,560
What a relief.

185
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,960
I think

186
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,600
your type is probably
someone like Achivich, right?

187
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,080
Dr. Peh has nothing on Achivich
when it comes to looks.

188
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,960
He's not my type.

189
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,440
Are you sure?

190
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,160
I see the things that you bring
to give to people at the hospital.

191
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,760
They are the products
that Achivich does commercials for.

192
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,800
It's the junior doctors.

193
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,200
They often ask me
to get those things for them.

194
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,200
Is that so?

195
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,720
-But I think--
-Guys.

196
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,560
You need to go check on the outpatients.

197
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,000
-I see.
-That's right.

198
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,280
Let's go.

199
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,600
-Come on, Joo.
-Okay.

200
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,800
I haven't finished my food yet.
You two go on ahead.

201
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,680
-Take her plate with you too.
-Okay.

202
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,440
Sure, ma'am.

203
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,520
Hey! Don't forget to clean up, Dr. Song.

204
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,960
What are you doing out here?

205
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,920
Nini's doctor.

206
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,320
Can Nini have Jell-O?

207
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,080
Is there only one cup of Jell-O?
Can I have a taste?

208
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,680
Do you have to?

209
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,720
Why is there only one cup? Are you hungry?

210
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,560
Nini may not want to eat anything.

211
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,040
But you must eat.

212
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,080
Here.

213
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,600
It's a reward for the hero
who saved Nini's finger.

214
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,120
Even the senior resident said
that you took very good care of it.

215
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,880
Good job, Cho.

216
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,760
The doctor said you could have Jell-O.

217
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,760
Hello.

218
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,240
You see? Cho went and bought you Jell-O.

219
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,480
Do you like it?

220
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,920
It's strawberry-flavored.

221
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,560
I like it.

222
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,880
I had a wound on my finger
when I was a kid.

223
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,720
Do you see it?
Can you help me look for it?

224
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,400
I don't see anything. You're lying.

225
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,400
I'm not lying.

226
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,880
But I have a trick.

227
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,560
What's the trick?

228
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,200
You need to eat a lot of food,

229
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,960
drink a lot of milk,

230
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,000
and do physiotherapy.

231
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,800
The wound will still be there at first.

232
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,520
Then it will just disappear.

233
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,280
Will my wound really disappear?

234
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,520
Yes.

235
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,720
Then your finger will look as good as new.

236
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,400
Just like this.

237
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,600
There's no wound, right?

238
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,240
How about I cast a spell
to make your wound heal faster?

239
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,880
That won't help.

240
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,280
Open up.

241
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,760
Here you go.

242
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,640
Is it good?

243
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,400
Yes.

244
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,520
Thank you, doctor.

245
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,120
You're welcome.

246
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,600
Eat up, honey.

247
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,160
Achi.

248
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,840
Yes?

249
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,880
Why do you seem so distracted lately?

250
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,000
Well, it's nothing.

251
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,320
Why didn't you sleep at your condo?

252
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,960
Where have you been?

253
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,400
Are you seeing someone new?

254
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,440
No.

255
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,640
I have no problem with that.

256
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,760
But you just broke up with Mona.

257
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,360
I don't want the reporters to say that

258
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,480
you cheated on her with someone.

259
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,160
It will make things messier.

260
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,440
I understand.

261
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,920
You also have
a fan meeting project coming up.

262
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,080
It will be bad if the sponsors
back out of the project.

263
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,000
Dan.

264
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,080
For now, you don't have
to take me around anymore.

265
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,720
I'll drive myself.

266
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,120
Are you sure?

267
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,800
Just let me know where you're going.

268
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,920
Your mom's worried.

269
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,480
She calls me all the time
regardless of the time difference.

270
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,600
She even calls me
in the middle of the night.

271
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,240
She sleeps when I'm up.

272
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,920
And when she's up, I sleep.

273
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,920
Have you talked to her lately?

274
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,920
I have bags under my eyes because
I have to answer her calls late at night.

275
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,800
Yes, Dan.

276
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,280
Is the air conditioner broken?

277
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,080
Should we make a stop and get it fixed?

278
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,600
I haven't learned this yet at my school.

279
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,760
Just focus on the lesson,
so you can teach me later.

280
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,480
You're the one who should focus.

281
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,000
Achi.

282
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,360
Can I have a Post-it note?

283
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,440
Do you know her?

284
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,160
She's a friend from school.
Her name is Pear.

285
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,360
I see. Her name is Pear?

286
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,960
WANNASORN TUTORING SCHOOL

287
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,640
YES, I THINK I LIKE PEAR

288
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,320
CAN YOU INTRODUCE ME TO HER?

289
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,680
Please? I'll do anything you say.

290
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,160
CAN YOU INTRODUCE ME TO HER?

291
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,680
-Are you friends with Achi?
-Yes.

292
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,880
How are you going home?

293
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,480
My dad's picking me up. What about you?

294
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,120
I'm going with Achi.

295
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,480
Achi, you've never told me
you have a friend from another school.

296
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,280
He doesn't talk much.

297
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,600
That's true. When he's at school,

298
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,840
he barely talks to anyone.

299
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,960
Anyway, have you known Achi long?

300
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,400
-We--
-Ji.

301
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,280
-Come on.
-You come on.

302
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,760
Just talk to your friend.

303
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,880
Hey, it's fine.

304
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,400
I'll get going now.

305
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,680
-Okay.
-Bye, Ji.

306
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:41,200
CHEM-OU, WANNASORN TUTORING SCHOOL

307
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,640
CHEM-OU, WANNASORN TUTORING SCHOOL

308
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,240
Jeez. You're so bent on teasing me, huh?

309
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,680
Did you draw me a heart?

310
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,440
Is that what you think?

311
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,480
Yes.

312
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,080
Suit yourself then.

313
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,800
You said earlier that

314
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,159
you'll do anything I say, right?

315
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,440
Yes. Why?

316
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,040
Why didn't you just say
you wanted to see a movie?

317
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,760
And why does it have to be

318
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,480
I just want to see it.

319
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,440
Why is it all sweet?

320
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,520
Did you get salty popcorn for me?

321
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,600
I did.

322
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,120
I just ate one.

323
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,800
This is also sweet.

324
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,320
You don't like sweet popcorn?

325
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,200
I can eat it, but I prefer salty popcorn.

326
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,480
Fine. I'll get you another box.

327
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,000
Just forget it.
The movie's about to start.

328
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,720
Here's salty popcorn for you.
I don't like it.

329
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,720
Just shove it down my throat,
why don't you?

330
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,920
I already put it in my mouth.

331
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,160
It was salty, so I spit it out for you.

332
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,080
Gosh, Achi.

333
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,640
Hey.

334
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,760
Do you want to get back at me?

335
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,520
It's sweet. I like it.

336
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,080
Gosh. You eat like a dog.

337
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,240
You're the dog. You always bark at me.

338
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,200
Knock it off already.
Do you want to see the movie or not?

339
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,440
I've already seen it.

340
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,760
This is my fourth time.

341
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,360
What?

342
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,760
Cut. That's a wrap.

343
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,480
Thank you so much.

344
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,800
-Thank you.
-Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

345
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,360
Thank you.

346
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,400
Thank you to all the staff as well.

347
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,080
-Thank you.
-Thank you, everyone.

348
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,120
What will you do about Mona?

349
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,920
Everyone's waiting
to hear your side of things.

350
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,560
Publish a statement
on my official account.

351
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,880
Just confirm Mona's story.

352
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,480
All right.

353
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,760
Dan.

354
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,240
Can you give me a ride to the condo?

355
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,080
Whose condo?

356
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,080
Mine, of course.

357
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,320
Excuse me, please take us to Achi's condo.

358
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,200
Well, Golden Boy.

359
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,800
Do you have to hurry home?

360
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,080
No.

361
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,280
No one's at home right now.

362
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,840
I see.

363
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,040
What about you?

364
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,240
Do you have to help out at the store?

365
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,240
I don't. My parents are there.

366
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,880
Do you have to go study for the exam?

367
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,200
No.

368
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,640
The exam's still far off.

369
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,880
There's no point studying now.

370
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,520
What about you?

371
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,120
Don't you have to study?

372
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,040
It won't help me anyway.

373
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,680
Ji.

374
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,920
What?

375
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,160
Can you help me study?

376
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,240
Ask me nicely.

377
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,760
Beg me.

378
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,400
Please. I'm begging you.

379
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,800
You're so annoying.

380
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,560
Why do you have to look at me like that?

381
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,080
So what do you say?

382
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,760
Will you help me?

383
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,600
Okay.

384
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,080
I usually help Peh study anyway.

385
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,560
But…

386
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,000
we'll have to do it at your school.

387
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,680
Why?

388
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,520
I want to see Pear again.

389
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,960
Is Pear single?

390
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,560
Achi.

391
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,360
Do you have feelings for Pear?

392
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,840
No.

393
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,120
I don't have feelings for Pear.

394
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,960
Okay.

395
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,360
Who do you usually hang out with?

396
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,960
I'm usually by myself.

397
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,800
I hang out with Peh sometimes.

398
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,720
And there are also some other friends.

399
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,640
What about you?

400
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,840
What do you do when you're not with me?

401
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,760
I watch movies at home.

402
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,920
You really like watching movies.

403
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,560
I don't really like movies.

404
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,240
Especially romantic movies.

405
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,520
Maybe you need to be in love

406
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,920
in order to enjoy them.

407
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,800
You talk like you're in love.

408
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,920
It's so pretty.

409
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,800
You can see the stars and the moon
when the sky is dark

410
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,240
and you can hear the sound of nature
when there's no one around.

411
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,640
Achi.

412
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,320
Will you be mad at me

413
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,320
if I tell you that…

414
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,760
you have a pretty face?

415
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,440
What's pretty about it?

416
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,200
Every part of it.

417
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,520
Your eyes. Your nose.

418
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,200
Your lips.

419
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,160
They're all pretty.

420
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,680
Ji.

421
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,720
I…

422
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,720
I'll wait on the motorbike.

423
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,560
He came to buy some pork.

424
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,600
Maybe he wanted to use it
to make spicy pork salad.

425
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,400
Hey, what are you doing here?

426
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,560
I'm here to help out.

427
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,680
Gosh, there's no need.
You'll only get in the way.

428
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,720
The medical entrance exam is coming up.
You should go study. Go on.

429
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,960
Mom, help back me up.

430
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,480
-Your dad's right.
-Hey.

431
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,480
Just go hang out
with your friends and have fun.

432
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,880
You're a teenager, so live like one.

433
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,240
You shouldn't be here.

434
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,640
-Right?
-Right.

435
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,920
-Just get out of here.
-Go on.

436
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,040
Or you can stay and listen
to your dad ramble on

437
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:30,040
about the time when life was hard.

438
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,320
Come on, honey.

439
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,440
-All right. I'll go.
-Go on.

440
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,040
-Right, Mom.
-What?

441
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,600
Is Madam Chan's house far away?

442
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,320
No, it's just two alleys away
from the market. Why do you ask?

443
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,400
It's nothing. I'll leave now.

444
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,320
-What?
-Hey.

445
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,280
-Why did he ask if it's nothing?
-Right.

446
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,360
#ACHIVICHWEMISSYOU

447
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,360
#ACHIVICHWEMISSYOU

448
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,720
Where are you now?

449
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,200
You got back from Chiang Mai ages ago.

450
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,360
#ACHIVICHWEMISSYOU

451
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:40,720
#ACHIVICHWEMISSYOU

452
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:46,560
#ACHIVICHWEMISSYOU

453
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:51,680
#ACHIVICHWEMISSYOU

454
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,840
Did they break up?

455
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,040
My gosh.

456
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,560
When we played football,

457
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,120
I thought he was just good-looking.

458
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:16,120
But when he walks in
all dressed up in nice clothes,

459
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,400
he looks like a celebrity.

460
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,480
Hey, August. What are you doing here?

461
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,640
I'm here with the handsome guy.

462
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,880
Why did you bring him here?
And why didn't you keep an eye on him?

463
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,360
He's a kid. How could you forget him?

464
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,440
