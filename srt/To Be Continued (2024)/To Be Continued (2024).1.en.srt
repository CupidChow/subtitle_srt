Nini!

00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,920
-Please help my child. She's in the car.
-Someone is stuck in the car.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,720
She's in the car.
Rescue, please check her out.

6
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,800
-Hang in there, dear.
-Mom!

7
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,120
-Nini!
-Mom!

8
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,520
Mom! Where are you?

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,640
I'm here, dear.

10
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,120
-Mom!
-I'm here.

00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,040
Nini!

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,520
Mom!

13
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,920
Mom!

14
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,320
-Where are you, Mom?
-I'm here, dear.

15
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,000
-Mom!
-Nini!

16
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,360
-Mom!
-I'm here.

17
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,800
-Mom.
-Her finger.

18
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,320
Her finger is cut off. Please look for it.

19
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,040
Help!

20
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,880
-Mom.
-Nini, I'm here.

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,720
Did you find it? Look carefully.

22
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,720
It hurts.

23
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,840
We're almost there.

24
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,640
Mom, it hurts.

25
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,600
Does it hurt, dear?

26
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,080
Are we almost there yet?

27
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,000
Hey. Yes, it's you.

28
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,320
I have something to tell you.

29
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,880
Come closer if you want to know.

30
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,400
Who wants to know?

31
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,840
DR. JIRAWAT CHOTEHIRUN, BCMD

32
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,600
Hello, Joo.

33
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,760
Dr. Ji, we have an emergency.

34
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,880
Okay, got it.

35
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,040
-A handoff, please.
-Here it is.

36
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,720
Our patient is a ten-year-old girl
named Nini.

37
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,840
She's a left-handed pianist
who had a car accident an hour ago.

38
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,200
She didn't pass out.
She's fully conscious.

39
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,440
FAST is negative. Consult neurosurgeon.
Observe neuro signs for 24 hours.

40
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,640
The rest is fine.
I've sent you blood test results.

41
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,920
Consult case. Hand injury

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,480
with a good candidate
for digital replantation.

43
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,920
The last meal was at noon.
No chronic disease, no drug allergy.

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,920
This is the severed finger.

45
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,040
Can you replant it?

46
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,160
I think so.

47
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,720
Let's check her out.

48
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,840
Let's go.

"Jee the Butcher."

55
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,560
Bee the…

56
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,880
JEE THE BUTCHER

57
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,240
Don't block the way if you're not buying.

58
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,000
Are you Jee?

59
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,360
Jee is my dad. Got a problem?

60
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,520
Calm down.

61
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,320
You were chopping some pork,
so I thought you were him.

62
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,240
Your dad is Jee, so what's your name?

63
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,280
Butcher?

64
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,520
Don't get on my nerves. I got a knife.

65
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,360
Why are you so fierce?
I'm here to buy some pork.

66
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,320
-I'm not selling. Get it somewhere else.
-Hey, don't you want money?

67
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,520
If you don't sell it to me, Bee…

68
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,000
No.

69
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,040
I mean, Jee will get mad.

70
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,600
You want to die, don't you?

71
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
All right.

72
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,840
M.D.W. 50346, ACHIVICH

73
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,640
JEE THE BUTCHER

74
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,760
I'm getting the usual.

75
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,560
The usual, my ass.
We have never met before.

76
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,560
The usual Kwan always got.

77
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,160
What Kwan? I don't know her.

78
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,840
Take this.

79
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,360
It's Kwan's.

80
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,000
Mom.

81
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,160
I've prepared it for her.

82
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,440
Give it to him yourself.

83
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,880
Gosh, you little pup.

84
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,840
It's just right there.
Can't you just give it to him?

85
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,200
The name Kwan is written there.
Can't you see it?

86
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,280
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

87
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,840
I left the stall to him for just a bit,
but he has already created trouble.

88
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,480
Give it to him.

89
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,920
-Thank you.
-Right. I forgot about this.

90
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,440
Your mom hasn't returned
from the US, right?

91
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,720
Please send her my regards anyhow.

92
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,680
-Sure.
-Also,

93
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,159
if you want to eat anything,
please tell Kwan. I'll find it for you.

94
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,159
All right? And here you go,
some fresh vegetables.

95
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,000
Let Kwan stir-fry them for you, all right?

96
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,360
Thank you.

97
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,440
What was that all about?

98
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,000
What do you mean?

99
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,600
Him.

100
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,680
Do you mean him?

101
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,080
He's the only son of Madam Chan,

102
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,880
the owner of this market.

103
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,080
-Meaning he's rich?
-Exactly.

104
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,360
Come on, Mom.

105
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,480
What is it?

106
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,720
You're like those extras in soap operas.

107
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,720
"Madam.

108
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,440
You have returned from the US.

109
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,400
Would you like some vegetables today?"

110
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,360
Who are you to tease me? What about you?

111
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,600
You were standing with hands on your hips,
pointing your finger, insulting him.

112
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,160
You acted like a villain in soap operas.

113
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,680
Am I right?

114
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,000
I didn't do that.

115
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,480
"I didn't do that." Come on.

116
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,480
-You do it, Mom.
-Come, I'll do it myself.

117
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,920
Ji, are you going to school yet?

118
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,720
Do you see me?
If you do, then it means I haven't left.

119
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,280
What? Gosh,

120
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,240
Mr. Ji got cranky right in the morning.

121
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,600
-Hello, ma'am
-Hello.

122
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,960
-Have you had breakfast?
-Yes, ma'am.

123
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,720
-Ride there safely.
-Yes, ma'am.

124
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,280
Go to school already.

125
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,000
And most importantly,
after you're done with school,

126
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,360
come straight home.
Don't go anywhere else.

127
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,360
Come here.

128
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,640
Go now. Take off your apron.
Hang it there.

129
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,360
-I'm leaving.
-Okay.

130
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,040
Hurry up, Ji. We're running late.

131
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,600
I know. I'm already in a hurry.

132
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,160
Jeez.

133
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,120
Peh, ride slowly, all right?

134
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,120
Yes, ma'am.
Did Ji help you boost the sales today?

135
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,800
-He's the best. He's our chopper.
-He's the chopper?

136
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,400
Damn, you boosted the sales
even with that foul mouth of yours.

137
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,960
Come here. Let me kiss you first.

138
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,440
Hey. Come on,
you let your mom kiss you, so why not?

139
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,960
Well, that's my mom.

140
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,040
-Okay, get on the bike.
-Hey, you can't ride inside the market.

141
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,400
Take it outside.

142
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,520
Hey, what do we do?

143
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,800
Push it outside.

144
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,240
-Me?
-Yes, you push it.

145
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,880
Let's go. Push it.

146
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,360
Let's go!

147
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,440
-Gosh, these boys.
-We're getting too fast.

148
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,240
WYE NAMPHUENG CHANGMOI

149
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,960
-We're here.
-Pull over.

150
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,400
Be careful.

151
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,640
-Hurry up, Peh.
-Hurry up? Damn.

152
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,800
Gosh.

153
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,520
-Hurry up. We're late.
-Please participate in class, students.

154
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,440
Pay attention, all right?

155
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,720
You see, humans

156
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,200
need to live together, right?

157
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,840
We gather to create a society

158
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,040
to pass down culture

159
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,640
and make ourselves strong.

160
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,160
Have you ever heard
that humans are social…

161
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,880
-Animals.
-Animals.

162
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,000
We are social animals,

163
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,280
but some of us are completely clueless
about what's going on in society.

164
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,880
The others are answering questions,
but they are not.

165
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,520
You can't be animals without socializing.
It's a no-no.

166
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,560
Well?

167
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,880
You're not answering anything

168
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,240
at all!

169
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,240
Look at you.

170
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,840
What's going on?

171
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,000
Your friends were answering my questions,

172
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,120
but you were snoozing off.

173
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,200
But when I give you tests, you always get

174
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,360
top scores for my class.

175
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,120
I'm getting upset.

176
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,560
We weren't sleeping, ma'am.

177
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,640
We were just closing our eyes.
We were listening.

178
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,160
Is that so?

179
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,600
It requires high concentration.

180
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,240
You must be punished by society.

181
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,200
Class, attention.

182
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,000
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

183
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,920
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

184
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,400
Hey.

185
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,400
And don't forget to submit
your worksheets in the next class.

186
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,760
Yes, ma'am.

187
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,960
Submit your worksheets
in the next class, all right?

188
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,760
-Yes, ma'am.
-Hey, don't get up yet.

189
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,760
Tomorrow is the last day
for the prayer test.

190
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,840
I don't doubt your ability,
but your memory.

191
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,320
-Yes, ma'am.
-All right?

192
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,000
And you took the test
but didn't dedicate your merit to me.

193
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,000
My dad said we do it
for past enemies, ma'am.

194
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,880
You have a lot of merit.
I don't think you need mine.

195
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,080
-Is that so?
-Yes.

196
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,640
-Okay.
-Goodbye, ma'am.

197
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,120
-Stay with her.
-Go now.

198
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,160
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

199
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,840
Gosh, you're so slow.

200
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,000
Don't forget to turn off the lights, okay?

201
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,200
-Make sure you turn them off.
-Yes, ma'am.

202
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,640
-Yes, ma'am.
-Gosh, you're such a forgetful child.

203
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,320
Here you go.

204
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,480
We're lucky you gave us
a hand in this, Jirawat.

205
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,040
It ended faster than we thought.
Great job.

206
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,880
This year is your last year
as a fix ward intern.

207
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,680
Have you decided what you want
to pursue for your studies?

208
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,760
I have thought about it.

209
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,080
You drew it well.

210
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,960
The rescue collected the finger well.

211
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,480
I heard the patient's older brother,
who is around 11 to 12 years old,

212
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,320
collected it

213
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,400
and put it in a tumbler.

214
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,160
He's quick-witted.

215
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,400
He knew he had to put the finger
in a bag first.

216
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,320
He didn't put it in the ice directly
because he also added some water,

217
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,520
so the finger didn't freeze.

218
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,400
Right, didn't you say
you were leaving for Chiang Mai today?

219
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,920
Why haven't you left?

220
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,720
I can go there later.

221
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,120
Get some rest.

222
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,960
The duty doctors and I
will take on this case.

223
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,920
We're a team.

224
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,760
Thank you, sir.

225
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,160
Hey.

226
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,320
Hey.

227
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,960
Yes, it's you.

228
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,960
I have something to tell you.

229
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,920
Did you wait long?

230
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,200
Here you go.

231
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,480
Move closer.

232
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,880
You'll fall off.

233
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,640
I know now.

234
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,960
Hello, what is it?

235
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,200
I'm in front of the classroom.

236
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,319
What?

237
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,560
How did you get inside?
Okay, I'll be there.

238
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,120
Miss, I need to go to the restroom.

239
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,840
Hey.

240
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,720
Hey. Yes, it's you.

241
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,240
I have something to tell you.

242
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,040
Come closer if you want to know.

243
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,080
Why do you pop up so often?

244
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,160
What's your name?

245
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,960
Butcher?

246
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,760
What's up, Butcher?

247
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,160
Yes, it's you.

248
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,240
What's up, Butcher?

249
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,480
Come closer if you want to know.

250
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,200
Butcher.

251
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,640
Hey.

252
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,360
Why are you still here?

253
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,640
I was just finished
the finger replanting case.

254
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,280
Why didn't you tell them you were leaving
for Chiang Mai before taking the case,

255
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,440
so they could look for someone else?

256
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,040
You missed the flight, didn't you?

257
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,560
Yes, but it's okay.

258
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,880
I got a new ticket.

259
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,640
I'm leaving tomorrow morning.

260
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,560
Damn, are you leaving
for Chiang Mai or Singapore?

261
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,400
That's it.

262
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,640
I'll get going. I'll leave
the finger replanting case to you.

263
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,600
Well then, I'll also ask you a favor.

264
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,520
Buy me some northern Thai green chili dip
and pork rinds.

265
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,480
-Okay.
-Can you also get me crab paste?

266
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,480
It's going to spoil.

267
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,080
Okay, buy whatever you want.

268
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,040
Okay.

269
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,480
Have a safe flight.

270
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,240
Go now. See you later.

271
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,400
Where are you?

272
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,160
Are you on the way there?

273
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,120
CHECK-IN

274
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,360
Achivich's first sign.

275
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,960
Achivich's second sign.

276
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,320
Third.

277
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,440
And I think I shouldn't count anymore.

278
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,680
Stop counting, Ji.

279
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,760
You're going to forget
your name is Jirawat, not Achivich.

280
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,600
Nice.

281
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,120
Snap.

282
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,480
Some more.

283
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,320
Let's take a close shot first, okay? One.

284
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,920
Kam. That's it. A heart.

285
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,040
-My gosh. I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

286
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,720
Are you okay? Hey, what's wrong?

287
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,040
I think he likes him.

288
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,040
Want some photos? Hand me your phone.
I'll take some for you.

289
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,080
Don't be shy. Hand us your phone.

290
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,360
I'm not taking it.

291
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,440
Don't be shy.

292
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,160
There are so many fanboys in our fandom.

293
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,600
Which fan base are you under?

294
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,800
-We're a fan base.
-Are you under the same one?

295
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,320
This is fucking nonsense.

296
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,440
What did you say?

297
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,400
Seriously,

298
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,360
besides looking handsome,

299
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,760
what else is good about him?

300
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,040
Hey, you don't like him,
but there's no need to be a snob.

301
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,960
Just leave if you don't like him.
You're blocking the way.

302
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,360
It's you two who are blocking the way.
This is a public area.

303
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,800
If you're going to fan him,
then be considerate.

304
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,320
Given how you are,
you don't have friends, do you?

305
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,320
You're very stinky. Do you know that?

306
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,920
What stinky?

307
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,400
That's what Google is for.

308
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,680
I need to upload this on JokJok.

309
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,480
My gosh.

310
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,480
-Hey, is it him?
-Take his photos now.

311
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,720
-Yes, it's him.
-Butcher.

312
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,880
Can you move?

313
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,360
-My gosh.
-Achivich.

314
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,720
Hold on, Butcher.

315
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,240
It's you, right?

316
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,360
Achivich, what are you doing here?

317
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,800
Where are you going?

318
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,640
He's handsome.

319
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,040
My name isn't Butcher.

320
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,840
I'm Jirawat.

321
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,280
How have you been?

322
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,280
Have you been well?

323
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,440
We haven't met

324
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,000
for ten years, have we?

325
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,800
Are you friends with him, Achivich?

326
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,360
Yes.

327
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,160
Are you returning to Chiang Mai?

328
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,160
Yes, that's right.

329
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,800
We haven't met for ten years,

330
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,920
but your memory is as good as before.

331
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,520
I'll get going.

332
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,560
-Excuse me.
-Okay.

333
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,880
-Okay.
-Hold on, Ji.

334
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,840
Hey, I think he's taking
the same flight as us.

335
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,240
Right. Maybe we're taking the same flight.

336
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,160
My mom said there's a reunion.

337
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,440
Are you attending it?

338
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,520
If I have time. Why?

339
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,560
If there's a chance,

340
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,200
I hope we can meet again.

341
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,720
Okay.

342
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,840
If there is.

343
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,640
I'll get going, or I'll miss my flight.

344
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,560
What's your name?

345
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,640
What's up, Butcher?

346
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,520
Come closer if you want to know.

347
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,120
Butcher.

348
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,160
Why did we have to meet now?

349
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,000
Hey. Hey. I have something to tell you.

350
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,560
Come closer if you want to know.

351
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,480
Butcher.

352
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,480
Gosh, what the hell is wrong with you?

353
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,400
Hello. Yes, let's talk later.

354
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,000
I'm about to board the plane.

355
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,840
We were so lucky to meet Achivich today.

356
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,880
I didn't dare dream of it,
but I did anyway.

357
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,680
-I blushed so hard.
-It's so awesome.

358
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,960
Gosh, we were so lucky

359
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,280
to suddenly meet our favorite star here.

360
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,840
Listen, we didn't take selfies
with Achivich.

361
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,960
But do you know where he's going?

362
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,680
He entered the same gate as us.

363
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,680
No idea.

364
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,760
This isn't on his schedule.

365
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,800
Okay, let me check Twitter for a second.

366
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,720
-Or could it be that…
-Hey.

367
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,120
he's leaving for Chiang Mai
on the same flight as us?

368
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,960
If I'm not out of luck,
I'm going to bet on it.

369
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:22,080
Three-eyed god, please bless me.

370
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,960
Calm down.

371
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,800
All right, come.

372
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,800
-Hey, he has got some good stuff.
-I'm an expert at this.

373
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,560
CHIANG MAI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

374
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,440
CHIANG MAI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

375
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,320
Hello, where are you?

376
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,800
I have arrived.

377
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,480
Turn around.

378
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,880
Welcome back, my big brother.

379
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,680
Yes, right.

380
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,960
I waited for an hour. Let's go.

381
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,440
Why didn't you park your car here?

382
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,120
Hey, what are these?

383
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,120
We only have one dog.
Why did you buy three sacks?

384
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,200
For the landfill or what?

385
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,840
I bought them for temple dogs.

386
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,280
Gosh, Ki, you little pup.

387
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,840
My gosh, you're such a good person.

388
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,240
Gosh.

389
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,480
-Hey!
-Hey, be gentle.

390
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,320
I'm a surgeon.

391
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,920
I need to take care of my hands.

392
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,440
Close the trunk.

393
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,360
Ki.

394
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,640
Ki.

395
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,680
Ki, this is not funny.

396
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,080
Ki.

397
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,240
Ki, you evil brother.

398
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,480
Hey, pull over.

399
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,920
Why are you telling me to pull over?

400
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,440
What's with him?

401
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,840
It has changed quite a lot, hasn't it?

402
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,200
You talk like old people.

403
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,560
I'm not old.

404
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,160
If so, then what are you? A Y2K teen?

405
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,640
Come on. Hey, Ki.

406
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,080
We're just two years apart,
so you can't say that.

407
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,400
Also, were you born in the Y2K era?

408
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,760
Hey, if you miss it,
why don't you come visit often?

409
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,600
Hey. Ji.

410
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,080
-Ji!
-What?

411
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,840
Why are you being loud?

412
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,640
Let's go.

413
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,560
What's wrong with him?
He snapped at me all of a sudden.

414
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,880
It's so hot here.

415
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,280
Chiang Mai has changed,
but you haven't at all.

416
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,920
Wait for me, Ji.

417
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,960
Gosh, my brother.

418
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,640
Mom, Ji is back.

419
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,480
Coin, come here.

420
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,920
Come here. Gosh, do you miss me?

421
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,360
Coin.

422
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,160
This scene looks familiar.

423
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,520
Do you miss me, son? Do you?

424
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,040
I can already tell you miss me
just by looking at your eyes.

425
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,520
Come, let's get inside. Come on.

426
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,440
I'm back, Mom.

427
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,480
The floor at our shop was slippery
so I fell.

428
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:56,240
I had no idea how I fell,
but my shoulder hit the ice tank

429
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,720
and broke.

430
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,840
Just that?

431
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,680
Yes.

432
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,920
Maybe it's osteoporosis.

433
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,440
You need to take some calcium.
I'll send some to you.

434
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,560
No need.

435
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:11,360
I'll buy it myself.

436
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,920
You must buy some.

437
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,040
Also, don't be so naughty.

438
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,040
Stay home with Dad sometimes.

439
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,400
Roger that.

440
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,960
And you, don't forget your food.

441
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,239
I want some fried rice with pork floss.

442
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,280
Can you cook some and send it to me?

443
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,719
You can dream.
They also sell it over there.

444
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,280
Look for it yourself.

445
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,639
Okay, fine.

446
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,120
I'm going to continue my studies.
I have an exam tomorrow.

447
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,159
I love you, Mom.

448
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,080
I also love you, my little pup.

449
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,120
You didn't tell Ji about the tests
the doctor told you to take?

450
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,640
Well,

451
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,960
I want to wait
for the doctor's analysis first.

452
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,560
But…

453
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,120
what if it happens
to be a malignant tumor?

454
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,960
What's the cause of cancer?

455
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,560
Well,

456
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,440
I'll tell him when that happens.

457
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,400
I'm not in pain or anything right now.

458
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,520
Listen, I'll use my left arm
to chop the pork tomorrow.

459
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,680
Mom,

460
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,320
if you don't tell Ji the truth,
I'm going to do it.

461
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,120
Don't do it.

462
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,320
I'm fine, really.

463
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,880
Tomorrow…

464
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,200
Ji has an exam to take.

465
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,640
I don't want to make him worried.

466
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,600
If he can't concentrate,

467
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,280
it won't turn out well.

468
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,880
All right?

469
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,320
Honey.

470
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,400
Why are you crying?

471
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,200
Don't cry.

472
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,200
Honey.

473
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,160
I'm not in pain.

474
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,120
I'm not in pain at all.

475
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,360
I'm not in pain at all, honey.

476
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,800
Hey, are you still going to help me?

477
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,240
Where is Dad?

478
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,200
He's on the balcony like usual.

479
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,760
I need to take this call.

480
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,920
What is it?

481
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,680
You've arrived at home,
right, Dr. Jirawat?

482
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,120
I'm calling to report you
on Nini's finger replanting case.

483
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,120
She's conscious, has an appetite,
and doesn't feel any pain.

484
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,800
Her finger is warm and red.

485
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,480
No pus. No venous congestion.

486
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,080
The capillary refill
is less than two seconds.

487
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,160
There's minimal serum oozing.

488
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,320
In conclusion, well done, sir.

489
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,360
Okay, thank you so much. I'm relieved.

490
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,040
So how's everything in Chiang Mai?

491
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:59,200
Did anything happen?
Do you have something to tell me?

492
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,640
I met two dogs.

493
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,000
You met two dogs?

494
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,160
-Come and help me out.
-Are they cute?

495
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,520
-Take off your shoes. Come.
-Are you okay, my friend?

496
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,320
-Hey, just a second.
-Come on.

497
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,800
Hey. Come on,
you also still have yours on.

498
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,080
Mom, look at him.

499
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,040
You're complaining like always.

500
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,120
Mom, he likes to argue like always.

501
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,880
Come on. Let's go.

502
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,680
Ki, I'm older than you.

503
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,840
Come on.

504
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,760
Fine, you evil brother.

505
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,760
THE REUNION THAT WE MISS

506
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,560
THE REUNION THAT WE MISS

507
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,200
-Hey, who are you looking for?
-What?

508
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,840
Peh isn't here, is he?

509
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,080
Do you know anyone else besides him?

510
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,840
Hey, I have many friends.

511
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,360
I'm looking for Ms. Ratree.

512
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,760
I want to greet her.

513
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,480
-Hey, she retired a long time ago.
-What?

514
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,680
I heard she's helping her nephew
with a vegetable farm on a mountain.

515
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,200
I don't think she's here.

516
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,680
Okay. You can go to your friends.

517
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,080
Ji.

518
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,840
I'll get going.

519
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,440
Hey, Ki.

520
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,120
-Hey.
-Have you been here long?

521
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,040
Come to our table. Others are waiting.

522
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,240
Hey, Jirawat.
Didn't you say you were busy?

523
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,000
I thought you wouldn't come.

524
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,240
Well, I managed to take leave.

525
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,560
I'm Mimew.

526
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,400
-You don't remember me, right?
-Come on.

527
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,840
Who would remember you?

528
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,520
Your face wasn't like this before.

529
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,320
Are you bullying me even now?

530
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,240
It's my right to do anything with my face.

531
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,080
I'm so sorry.

532
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,880
I was going to say you're prettier.

533
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,240
That sounds more pleasant to my ears.

534
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,920
By the way, Ji, you were close
to Achivich before, right?

535
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,960
No, we weren't.

536
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,960
Is that so?

537
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,960
But I remember

538
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,560
you were close to Achivich.

539
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,480
I often saw you hang out with each other.

540
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,640
I remember this

541
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,760
because Achivich was very handsome
back then.

542
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,960
At first, I was wondering
if you two were dating.

543
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,840
We weren't. No.

544
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,960
And do you still get to see each other?

545
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,600
But Achivich is dating Mona now, isn't he?

546
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,160
Do you know her too?

547
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:37,600
Well, I do know
what's going on in the news.

548
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,200
Hey, Ji.

549
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,360
Let me know if you see him.

550
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,600
I want to do a video call
with him just once. Please, Ji.

551
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,000
I haven't seen him at all, really.

552
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,760
We just met this morning.

553
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,320
Hello, Butcher.

554
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,960
Hello. Let's have fun together tonight.

555
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,400
Who is he friends with?
I've never seen him.

556
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,960
Achivich, why are you here?
You didn't go to our school.

557
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,480
I didn't go to this school.
But my best friend did.

558
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,920
So I'm here too.

559
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,400
So what's your name?

560
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,720
I'm Gumbie.

561
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,160
The thing between us…

562
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,560
It's already over.

563
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,320
Honestly, if we could
turn back time like in movies,

564
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,920
I would've said this to you.
That you don't have to try.

565
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,040
I'm just a stranger to you.

566
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:27,320
