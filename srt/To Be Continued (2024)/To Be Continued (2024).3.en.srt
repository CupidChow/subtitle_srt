1
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,080
Hello.

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,240
Let's have fun tonight.

3
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,680
Who is he friends with?
I've never seen him.

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,240
Achivich, you didn't go to our school.

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,760
But my best friend did.

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,280
So I'm here too.

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,880
<c.bg_transparent><i>-The thing between us…
-It's already over.</i></c.bg_transparent>

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,280
What the hell are you doing?

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,840
I freaking hate you, Achi.

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,560
<c.bg_transparent><i>Honestly, if we could
turn back time like in movies,</i></c.bg_transparent>

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,200
<c.bg_transparent><i>I would've said this to you.
That you don't have to try.</i></c.bg_transparent>

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,320
I'm just a stranger to you.

13
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,040
Achi, you piece of shit--

14
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,120
Don't be rude, doctor.

15
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,160
This little guy is watching you.

16
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,000
Did you follow me here?

17
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,320
Are you a stalker?

18
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,720
Can you let me inside first?

19
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,520
Why should I?

20
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,160
This is my place.

21
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,760
Can you at least be responsible
for what you did, doctor?

22
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,080
What do you mean?

23
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,280
Back then, you kissed…

24
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,240
You just need some medicine.

25
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,640
Well then, if reporters ask me
about what happened,

26
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,920
I'll say you punched me, okay?

27
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,440
Are you threatening me?

28
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,920
Well, does your hospital have enough space
for a crowd of angry fans?

29
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,920
What fans? They can come. I'm not scared.

30
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,640
Are you sure?

31
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,680
Stop fighting already.

32
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,720
Don't tell your mom, okay?

33
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,480
Turn around.

34
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,000
Turn to where?

35
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,240
-Why do I have to? Turn to where?
-Just do it.

36
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,680
Hold this.

37
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,400
Don't turn around.

38
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,640
-Can I turn around now?
-Not yet.

39
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,360
Why are you embarrassed?
I've seen your place look messier.

40
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,480
-I'll turn around now, okay?
-No, don't do it.

41
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,960
-Can I do it now?
-No, not yet.

42
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,280
-I'm going to turn around now.
-Don't you dare.

43
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,240
You can leave now.

44
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,080
Hey, what's the rush?

45
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,760
Let's talk first.

46
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,280
Just leave already.

47
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,320
I'm going to take a shower.

48
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,920
You still found a way to escape me?

49
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,720
This is the 24th floor.

50
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,160
Take your time. I'll be waiting here.

51
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,400
Did you really clean up?

52
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,960
What is he doing?

53
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,840
Why hasn't he left?

54
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,880
And why am I the one hiding?

55
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,960
This is my place.

56
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,360
This is too much.

57
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,560
Ji.

58
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,240
Where can I wash my clothes?

59
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,120
Why are you still here?
Just leave already.

60
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,480
How could you lay hands
on my things like this?

61
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,280
I'll say this to you one more time, Achi.

62
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,200
Mind your manners.

63
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,640
But it's cleaner, isn't it?

64
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,080
Who asked you to do this?

65
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,320
If you don't have time,
you can hire someone.

66
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,720
There are services for this.

67
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,880
What is it?

68
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,240
What do you want from me?

69
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,560
Got anything for me to eat?

70
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,280
Gosh.

71
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,040
Are you really someone
who was just off duty,

72
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,120
my Prince Charming?

73
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,240
Goodness, you're so handsome.
What did you do?

74
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,720
Gosh, you're too kind.

75
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,600
Well, I drink two liters of water daily,

76
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,400
meet basic nutritional needs,

77
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,080
and make my mind pure.

78
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,200
Really?

79
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,320
Mr. Prince Charming.

80
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,600
You missed exercise.

81
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,720
Gosh, Dr. Peh. How confident you are.

82
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,039
Tell her you just had Botox injections.

83
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,960
Gosh, come right here.
Come and help me move these,

84
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,520
Joo's Prince Charming.

85
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,280
Why is there so much?

86
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,840
It looks heavy.

87
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,400
But I think this is nothing
for a female doctor

88
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,880
who deals with patients' bones
with her bare hands.

89
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,240
What an exaggeration. Your bare hands?
There is equipment for me to use.

90
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,560
-Help me move this now.
-Okay.

91
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,280
Why did you buy so much?

92
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,680
Are you a top spender again?

93
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,200
-Take this and shut up.
-Gosh, it hurts.

94
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,200
What a big mouth you have.

95
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,800
Gosh, Joo,

96
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,320
my shoulder is dislocated.
It hurts so much.

97
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,760
Help me. Gosh.

98
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,360
Please push it down a little.

99
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,160
Okay, that's just about right.

100
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,800
-Peh.
-What is it?

101
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,360
Do you want her Line ID?

102
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,800
The Line ID of a new anesthetist?

103
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,160
Hey. Damn. Gosh, it suddenly got better.

104
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,400
Hey, my shoulder suddenly feels great.

105
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,840
Excuse me, Joo.

106
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,920
How about we do this, Dr. Song? Well,

107
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,400
you can tell me to do anything you want.

108
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,400
I'll do everything.

109
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,560
I'll be at your service.

110
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,040
Okay, you do this then.

111
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,720
-Here.
-What?

112
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,600
-Push it.
-Push it?

113
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,640
Dr. Song.

114
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
I need to go.

115
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,560
Do you want to leave a few here?

116
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,920
-It's okay.
-There are a few of us here.

117
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,920
-She'll give it to people there.
-Okay.

118
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,120
Gosh, it's actually heavy.

119
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,120
You're not helping me, Dr. Song.

120
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,000
You almost slipped, Peh.

121
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:22,080
Don't forget you must keep the fact
that I'm Achivich's mom fan a top secret.

122
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,760
Come on, I didn't slip.

123
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,960
Really?

124
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,360
No, I did.

125
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,400
-Peh.
-Gosh.

126
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,960
Hey, aren't the things you bought
and gave away to people

127
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,200
Achivich's endorsements?

128
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,200
You've got everything except his standee.

129
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,800
Don't let me see one in the medical room.

130
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,120
Come on, who would do that? Are you crazy?

131
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,840
"Do your best, Dr. Song.

132
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,560
You're the best

133
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,160
and strongest orthopedist.

134
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,800
You must survive the tough shifts.

135
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,480
Do your best."

136
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,640
Thank you, my baby, Achivich.

137
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,680
I'm so worried I'm dying.

138
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,000
About what?

139
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,400
Well, Achivich suddenly postponed
his schedule and popped up in Chiang Mai.

140
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,600
That isn't like Achivich at all.

141
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,960
Do you think he's all right?

142
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,360
Is he hurt?

143
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,720
I'm worried about his feelings.

144
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,680
What do I do?

145
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,080
Worry about yourself.

146
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,280
Don't worry about him.

147
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,080
Hey, Ji.

148
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,080
-What?
-He's in Chiang Mai, right?

149
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,600
-Yes.
-Do you think he'll meet Achivich?

150
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,800
Hey, Peh. Call Ji now. Do it now.

151
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,480
Come on, Peh. Call Ji now.

152
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,960
-Hey, pull yourself together.
-Hey.

153
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,800
Chiang Mai is big.

154
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,360
I don't think
they'll bump into each other.

155
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,080
-Is that so?
-Yes.

156
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,000
I can't concentrate on my work anymore.

157
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,920
My heart is with my baby Achivich
in Chiang Mai.

158
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I wonder if he's okay.

159
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,880
I pray I won't be worn out tonight.

160
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,400
I'm worried about my baby and also myself.

161
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,480
Amen.

162
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,080
Who is she praying to?

163
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,560
Yes.

164
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,120
Sure.

165
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,000
Gosh, Peh.

166
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,880
-Yes?
-It was from the ER.

167
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,440
I need to go.

168
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,560
Okay.

169
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,880
Damn, she said it's a secret,

170
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,720
but she was so loud,
I bet everyone heard it.

171
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,520
Why does she call Achivich baby?
He's the same age as her.

172
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,320
This is confusing.

173
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
This is all I have.

174
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,360
Is this from the dinosaur era?

175
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,480
You're exaggerating.

176
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,200
It's just from last month.

177
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,360
It's good to eat when you heat it up.
Will you eat it?

178
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,520
Are you really a doctor?

179
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,240
Eat it if you want. If not, then don't.

180
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,920
I'm not the one who is hungry.

181
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,600
Why do I have to find food for you?

182
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,920
What about that?

183
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,360
You can't eat that.

184
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,280
It's for Peh and the nurses.

185
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,120
Well…

186
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,880
Okay, it isn't moldy yet.

187
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,240
Hey.

188
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,800
You'd better not eat it.

189
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,200
Why?

190
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,440
Let's get food outside.

191
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,800
Not now.

192
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,280
I have something to talk to you about.

193
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,040
We can do it outside.

194
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,160
-But--
-Or do you want to go alone?

195
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,160
It's up to you. I'm not the one starving.

196
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,720
So what's the status of your relationship
with Achivich right now, Mona?

197
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,920
We both took a step back
and are now like siblings.

198
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,880
So did you two break up?

199
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,800
Let's say it's a downgrade.

200
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,040
We talked and decided

201
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,680
to give each other time to reflect.

202
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,320
Does this have anything
to do with an affair?

203
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,120
No, I can confirm this.

204
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,000
It's more about our schedules
and attitudes that don't match.

205
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,040
Is this the reason why Achivich went
to Chiang Mai?

206
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,400
I don't know. You'll have to ask him that.

207
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,480
Okay, lastly…

208
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,640
Please tell your fans about your projects.

209
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,120
Sure.

210
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,640
<c.bg_transparent><i>Please support my drama on Channel 3.
Press 33.</i></c.bg_transparent>

211
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,280
Ki.

212
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,600
ORGANIC VEGETABLE AND FRUIT ZONE

213
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,640
Here you go.

214
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,120
It's to thank you for taking me
to patch the tire.

215
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,520
Thank you.

216
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,720
It's a bamboo shoot.

217
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,720
Let's use this to do a food vlog.

218
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,680
Hey, are you free?
If you are, can you come with me?

219
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,600
Me?

220
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,960
What can I possibly help you with?

221
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,600
At least, help me taste some food.

222
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,360
You can also tell

223
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,560
where this thing came from,
how it was planted,

224
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,360
and what we can do with it.

225
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,920
It's already fun thinking about it.

226
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,200
Sure,

227
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,160
but I won't appear on camera. I'm shy.

228
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,840
Sure.

229
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,920
Is this really a restaurant?

230
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,000
Yes.

231
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,200
You haven't been here, have you?

232
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,200
No, I haven't.

233
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,079
So where is the restaurant?

234
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,360
You'll find out soon.

235
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,080
So do you still want some food?

236
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,840
Yes.

237
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,720
Hold on, Ji.

238
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,120
Can you unlock the car?
I forgot my shades.

239
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,400
You don't need them,
there are not many people here.

240
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,240
Especially at this hour.

241
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,440
<c.bg_transparent><i>You're still smiling when we lost
the football match. Look at your face.</i></c.bg_transparent>

242
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,640
What about it? It's a normal face.
It's what we call handsome.

243
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,280
You even compliment yourself.

244
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,000
You shouldn't have let that ball pass

245
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,040
or we would have won. This sucks.

246
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,280
Peh will boast for ages.

247
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,680
I don't really get to play.

248
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,600
I won't make a mistake next time.

249
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,080
Why? Do you not play football
at your high-class school?

250
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,320
No, we do.

251
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,880
I see. You have no friends.

252
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,760
Yes, I don't really have friends.

253
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,320
I've often transferred schools.

254
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,880
So will you transfer again?

255
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,560
I'm thinking of asking my mom
if I can transfer to your school.

256
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,720
Impossible.

257
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,120
Your school is already good.
Why would you transfer here?

258
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,320
Can I have your number?

259
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,680
What do you need it for?
I'm not going to chitchat with you.

260
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,000
Okay, fine.

261
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,320
Give me your number. I'll call you.

262
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,280
I said give me your number,
not you take mine.

263
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,960
It's the same.

264
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,960
Gosh, you already called.

265
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,720
Okay, you should get inside.

266
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,920
Okay.

267
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,400
Hello, you're still smiling.

268
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,400
The more I say it, the more you smile.

269
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,720
Come on, let's go.

270
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,600
What's wrong?

271
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,800
You were fine the other day
when you met your fans at the airport.

272
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,480
Well…

273
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,560
Things just happened last night.

274
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,640
Last night?

275
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,600
Is the restaurant really open?

276
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,240
Yes, but the owner is a little indie.

277
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,840
So who does he sell his food to?

278
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,960
Mostly the regulars.

279
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,720
-So who recommended this place to you?
-Ki.

280
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,920
-Can I have the menu?
-No need.

281
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,600
Order what you want.
If they can't cook it, they'll tell you.

282
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,640
This is difficult.
It's difficult to pick one.

283
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,120
I'll get fried chicken tendons.

284
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,880
Now?

285
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,880
Yes, why?

286
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,480
Is there a rule prohibiting

287
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,880
the consumption
of fried chicken tendons in the daytime?

288
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,480
It's batter-fried, greasy, and salty.

289
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,960
And so?

290
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,280
Speed is of devils.

291
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,320
Do you have anything that--

292
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,720
Is there anything that's not spicy,
full of carbs, deep-fried,

293
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,400
sweet, and fatty but is high in protein?

294
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,840
Boiled chicken breast.

295
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,040
You're a doctor,
so you should care for your diet.

296
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,080
I do,

297
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,840
but I don't overreact like you.

298
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,320
I eat as humans do.

299
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,920
I'm not a celebrity.

300
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,960
I'll get skinless chicken breast steak

301
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,920
and a salad.

302
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,200
No dressing, please.

303
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,760
Wait, I'll get Thai holy basil stir-fry
with beef and a sunny-side-up egg.

304
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,200
Make it the spiciest. Also, I want
the egg crispy and the yolk uncooked.

305
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,320
He really wants to sell food, doesn't he?

306
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,280
I told you he's indie.

307
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,200
Hi, audience.
Our main ingredient for today is

308
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,240
bamboo shoots.

309
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,400
They normally grow in forests.

310
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,040
Bamboo forests.

311
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,760
I see, bamboo forests.

312
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,920
Hey, come here.

313
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,280
Help me explain.

314
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,840
-Come on.
-Me?

315
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,120
Yes. Take this.

316
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,360
Bamboo shoots grow in bamboo forests.

317
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,720
They're abundant in the rainy season
but become rare after the season is over

318
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,560
because they turn into bamboo trees.

319
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,840
I see, so did the villagers collect
this themselves?

320
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,240
Yes.

321
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,040
Before, I'd go with them,

322
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,160
but I haven't been going lately
because things get busy at the farm.

323
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,360
Right, audience,
I forgot to introduce my friend here.

324
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,600
This is Gumbie. He's a farmer.

325
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,320
He works at an organic farm
called Dragonfly Farm.

326
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,800
Hello.

327
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,560
I'm Gumbie. Well, I'm the owner
of the Dragonfly Farm.

328
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,720
What?

329
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,520
You're the owner?

330
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,240
Yes.

331
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,240
Well, the name is dragonfly

332
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,400
and dragonfly is Gumbie.

333
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,680
I see. You're right.

334
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,880
Right.

335
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,560
Audience, we'll let Gumbie

336
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,800
teach us how to slice bamboo shoots.

337
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,840
All right, show us how to slice
bamboo shoots.

338
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,520
We're done cooking the bamboo soup
with mushroom.

339
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,320
Don't forget to hit the like,

340
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,320
share, subscribe, and alert button.

341
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,240
We and the
to bid you goodbye for today.

342
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,160
Goodbye.

343
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,920
Dad.

344
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,800
When did you come downstairs?

345
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,880
Do you want anything?

346
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,640
What are you two doing?

347
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,760
We cooked spicy bamboo shoot soup.

348
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,200
Hello, sir. Would you like to have some?

349
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,360
We put puffball mushrooms.
It's super yummy.

350
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,760
Puffball mushroom.

351
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,760
It was his mom's favorite.

352
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,240
Yes.

353
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
-Let me get some for you.
-No need.

354
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,160
Give some to your mom.

355
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,200
You can have it.

356
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,200
Your dad must have loved
your mom very much.

357
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,840
He even remembers what she liked.

358
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,240
Sometimes, it's bad
to love someone too much.

359
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,320
Come on, let's eat.

360
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,120
You're really a devil.

361
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,720
Doctors eat fast

362
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,360
because every minute means life,

363
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,000
so just say whatever you have to.

364
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,200
Not now. I haven't finished eating.

365
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,680
Well then, enjoy.

366
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,840
I'm leaving.

367
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,760
Hold on, Ji.

368
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,160
I said I have something
to talk to you about.

369
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,000
But I don't want to.

370
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,040
I just wanted you to leave my room.

371
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,320
We're done here.

372
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,880
This meal is on me.

373
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,960
I won't say it anymore.

374
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,560
Right now, I need a friend.

375
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,800
Can you be my friend?

376
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,680
MS. PING'S CRAM SCHOOL (DA'VANCE)
CHIANG MAI

377
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,040
Then I'll get going.

378
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,200
Stay with me first.

379
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,120
I'm stressed these days.
I'm afraid I won't pass the entrance exam.

380
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,280
Then I think you need to relax.

381
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,560
Tell me where you want to go.
I'll take you.

382
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,440
It's a ten-ten.

383
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,120
Come on.

384
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,440
Hey, you almost got it.
Go for the head. Do it now.

385
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,960
You look just like it.

386
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,520
Really?

387
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,000
Let's get another one.
Let's go for the tiger.

388
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,320
-This one?
-Wait.

389
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,160
No.

390
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,920
-Hey.
-Hey.

391
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,080
We got another one!

392
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,280
Why are you looking at me? Eat.

393
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,120
<c.bg_transparent><i>Announcement. Calling code zero.
No doctor at the ER.</i></c.bg_transparent>

394
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,440
No doctor at the ER.

395
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,680
No doctor at the ER.

396
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:29,240
<c.bg_transparent><i>Announcement. Calling code zero.
No doctor at the ER.</i></c.bg_transparent>

397
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,280
No doctor at the ER.

398
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,440
No doctor at the ER.

399
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,680
I haven't got to do my business yet.

400
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,640
Gosh, my finger.

401
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,160
Code zero.

402
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,280
I haven't taken a dump yet.

403
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,320
Hold on, Ji.

404
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,720
What's the rush?

405
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,680
You finished your meal.

406
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,720
I also stayed with you like you wanted.

407
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,600
I don't want to stay with you anymore.

408
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,400
DAN

409
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,920
Why don't you take it?

410
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,960
You might have been caught.

411
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,240
Hello.

412
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,520
Yes, I'll be there in ten minutes.

413
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,240
Wait.

414
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,120
I don't have time for you anymore.

415
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,960
Someone needs me more than you.

416
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,160
Are you coming?

417
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,680
Come on.

418
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,280
Hurry up.

419
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,400
ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY CENTER

420
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,560
Ji.

421
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,080
Park the car and leave already.

422
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,840
-Shall I come and get you?
-No need.

423
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,400
What do I do?

424
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:50,560
ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY CENTER

425
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,920
It's a mass burn case,
but why are all orthopedists here?

426
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,200
Also, operating rooms will be used.

427
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,240
The burns are severe,

428
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,240
but everyone stepped on each other
so it became a mass casualty.

429
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,800
They didn't practice safe fire evacuation,
so they all panicked

430
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,360
when there was a fire.

431
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,040
Hello.

432
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,800
Well, thank you for coming to help today.

433
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,720
I called code zero
because there was a mass fire

434
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,240
and people trampled on each other.

435
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,960
The first 50 cases being sent
to our hospital, all need an operation.

436
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,960
Now we're checking the operating rooms,

437
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,800
giving patients anesthesia,
calling doctors,

438
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,160
preparing recovery rooms,
and doing blood tests.

439
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,760
Also, I'd like to thank you all
for coming to help today.

440
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,880
Hey, Song.

441
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,920
Why is your shift so tough?

442
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,760
Do you see you're giving us trouble?

443
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:24,480
It's not because it's my shift.
It's because of the fire.

444
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,360
It's your shift.

445
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,920
No.

446
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,840
-It's your shift. Can't you see?
-No.

447
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,440
-Just shut up--
-Gosh.

448
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,880
Hey.

449
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,320
I'm tired. I'll get going.

450
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,280
-Okay.
-Okay, get home safe.

451
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,560
See you whenever.

452
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,880
Gosh, I didn't eat chicken,
and my top isn't bloody,

453
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,080
but why am I so worn out?

454
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,040
-Gosh.
-Hey.

455
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,160
Why are you getting upset?

456
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,360
NEW IDEAS

457
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,200
Park the car and leave already.

458
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,040
-Shall I come and get you?
-No need.

459
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,080
Gosh, how am I going to go back?

460
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,440
I gave everything to him,

461
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,120
both my car and keycard.

462
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,920
Ji, you stupid.

463
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,360
Ji.

464
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,080
Why didn't you bring a car?

465
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,840
Well, there's no parking at the school.

466
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,480
Get on first.

467
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,480
Will it be all right?

468
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,440
Why are you in a hurry?

469
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,480
We're running late.

470
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,000
Okay.

471
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,960
Be careful.

472
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,280
Ji.

473
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,520
-Yes?
-We're here.

474
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,960
We're at your condo.

475
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:52,080
-We have arrived?
-Yes.

476
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,320
Thank you for the lift.

477
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,920
Hold on, Ji. Your key.

478
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,920
Ji.

479
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,320
You forgot your things.

480
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,640
You should leave already.

481
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,920
I'll leave after walking you home.

482
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,880
Hey!

483
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,080
Why are you here?

484
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,680
<c.bg_transparent><i>If you're going to sleep, then get up
to take a shower and brush your teeth.</i></c.bg_transparent>

485
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,560
What happened to your face, Achi?

486
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,560
It looks like you fought with someone.

487
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,160

to save the world succeed?</i></c.bg_transparent>

488
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,200
Ji came back in a really bad condition.

489
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,280
What happened in Chiang Mai? Tell me.

490
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,800
Actually, I never wanted
to be friends with you.

491
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,640
I fucking miss you.

492
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,640
I've been missing you for ten years.

493
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,680
Achi, would you be mad at me

494
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,280
if I told you that…

495
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:27,320
