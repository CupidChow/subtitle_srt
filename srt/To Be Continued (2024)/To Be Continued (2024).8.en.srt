1
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,560
I was upset that you wanted
to return the dolls.

2
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,720
It was like you were saying

3
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,920
you wouldn't get involved with me again.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,480
Weren't you the one being cold to me?

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,800
So this means

6
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,560
we didn't get to continue it
because of something trivial?

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,920
We were young back then.

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,280
What about now?

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,400
I've waited ten years for today, Ji.

10
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,440
This is a hidden restaurant,
so we'll have some privacy.

11
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,400
There aren't many customers,

12
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,000
but the fried rice here is the best.

13
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,760
Thank you.

14
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,320
Sure.

15
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,160
What?

16
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,000
You haven't changed at all.

17
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,040
It has been ten years

18
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,920
and you're still the same.

19
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,320
How am I the same?

20
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,720
You're blunt.

21
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,000
So? That's just how I speak.

22
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,040
It's good.

23
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,600
I like it.

24
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,800
Like hell you do.

25
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,800
Ji.

26
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,840
Can you do something for me?

27
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,680
What is it? Tell me first.

28
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,520
From now on,
can we not swear at each other?

29
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,240
What do you mean?

30
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,960
Do you want to start speaking politely
all of a sudden?

31
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,000
No.

32
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,440
I don't want to act like we're friends.

33
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,400
Instead,

34
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,840
can we call each other "baby"?

35
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,360
Don't be ridiculous.

36
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,200
This isn't a movie.

37
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,640
Baby.

38
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,520
Baby.

39
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,800
Baby.

40
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,519
Let's just eat.

41
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,560
-Come on.
-Why are you blushing?

42
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,120
-Let's eat.
-Baby.

43
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,960
-Just eat.
-Say it without blushing.

44
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,520
Baby.

45
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,400
Let's eat.

46
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,480
Okay.

47
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,800
Knock it off.

48
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,200
Stop it.

49
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,400
People will see us.

50
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,360
There's no one here.

51
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,840
You never know.

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,840
Come on.

53
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,400
Let's go.

54
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,720
If you want to go anywhere from now on,

55
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,440
let's go together.

56
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,840
Achi, I fucking--

57
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,680
We said no swearing.

58
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,160
I love you so much.

59
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,960
Achivich.

60
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,680
I won't make you cry again.

61
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,120
I love you.

62
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,600
I love you.

63
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,400
I love you.

64
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,840
KI

65
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,840
IS THIS YOU?

66
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,320
Where did you get that photo?

67
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,400
The Internet.

68
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,120
That's you in the photo, right?

69
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,520
I can't tell. It's dark.

70
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,640
Just admit it already.

71
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,360
I'm not asking whether that's you.

72
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,920
I'm asking if you kissed Achi.

73
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,120
That's my business.

74
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,560
Are you talking to Ji?

75
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
What's wrong?

76
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,400
It's nothing, Dad.
I just prank-called him.

77
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,960
I heard you mention he kissed someone.

78
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,120
No, I didn't.

79
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,200
It's just celebrity gossip.

80
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,760
Celebrity?

81
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,000
Is it Achivich?

82
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,320
He's the son of Madam Chan,
the market owner,

83
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,000
he's friends with Ji, right?

84
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,160
Do you remember him?

85
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,400
Of course.

86
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,080
Your friend's not coming today?

87
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,720
-You mean Gumbie?
-Yes.

88
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,360
He's not coming.

89
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,520
Did you two fight?

90
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,400
No, we didn't.

91
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,680
Ki.

92
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,480
Do you realize that you keep
denying things since we started talking?

93
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,000
That's not true.

94
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,520
Yes, Dad.

95
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,160
Ji is just as bad.

96
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,240
Seriously.

97
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,840
Do you want to be alone like me?

98
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,760
But you had Mom.

99
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,440
That's true.

100
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,960
But I'm alone now
because I have no choice.

101
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,480
When your mom was alive,

102
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,640
it was the best time of my life.

103
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,400
If you two don't change your ways,

104
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,520
you're going to end up alone.

105
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,960
I didn't choose to be alone.

106
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,760
Gumbie isn't coming

107
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,320
because I'm going to see him.

108
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,520
Don't worry about me.

109
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,800
You should worry about Ji.

110
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,000
Don't talk back to me.

111
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,880
You two are just as bad.

112
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,440
Why are you so chatty today?

113
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,960
I'm not a mute.

114
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,120
Gosh.

115
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,000
Dr. Ji.

116
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,400
Yes?

117
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,000
Do you know any doctor named Butcher?

118
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,440
This is addressed to Butcher. Is it you?

119
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,880
That's me.

120
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,560
Here. Take it.

121
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,480
Is this for real?

122
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,280
Yes.

123
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,120
Damn.

124
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,440
-He got red roses.
-He's Butcher.

125
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,720
Butcher.

126
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,480
Look at those red roses.

127
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,520
Who are they from, doctor?

128
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,080
That's enough.

129
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,720
Let's get back to work.

130
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,120
Ji's Butcher Shop is now
open for business.

131
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,520
Ji's Butcher Shop! My gosh!

132
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,920
Let's go, guys.

133
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,680
-I want minced pork.
-I want pork belly.

134
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,920
Let's work.

135
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,600
You're doing great, ma'am.
You don't need a cane anymore.

136
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,080
She followed all of your instructions.

137
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,880
She now sleeps downstairs.

138
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,840
She does physiotherapy as you advised.

139
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,440
She's careful with her diet.

140
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,160
Good job, ma'am.

141
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,480
You don't need me now.

142
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,320
So I won't get to see
your handsome face anymore?

143
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,280
But my grandchild's not doing well.

144
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,840
What's wrong?

145
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,040
Are you seeing a doctor?

146
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,320
She's single.

147
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,880
Are you seeing anyone, doctor?

148
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,920
Do you want to date my grandchild?

149
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,680
I'm seeing someone.

150
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,440
What is going on?
You're smiling at a bouquet of flowers.

151
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,320
Are you in love?

152
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,040
Are you in love with a superstar?

153
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,280
How did you know?

154
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,560
There's only one person
who calls you Butcher.

155
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,680
It's you, right?
Are you in on this with Achi?

156
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,960
Tell me.

157
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,200
If you don't tell me,

158
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,920
I won't help you study
for the orthopedic exam.

159
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,080
Gosh.

160
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,320
Please, Ji.

161
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,920
You have to help me study. Listen.

162
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,280
You always had a soft spot for Achi.

163
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,200
I know. I can tell.

164
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,800
Here's the thing.

165
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,320
Achi was also hurt.

166
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,320
When he left you,
he was a mess because he thought

167
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,760
that you didn't love him.

168
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,600
He really missed you.

169
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,680
So he begged me to help him.

170
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,040
He wanted a fresh start with you.

171
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
So I…

172
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,760
So Ki…

173
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,560
I can't help you.
You broke my friend's heart.

174
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,800
How can you ask for my help now?

175
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,120
It was a misunderstanding.

176
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,200
I've left things unresolved
for long enough.

177
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,520
So you do realize that.

178
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,760
I just want a chance
to have Ji back in my life.

179
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,240
I can't make that decision for my friend.

180
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,280
But I know someone who can help.

181
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,640
He's very close with Ji.

182
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,200
He knows Ji way better than I do.

183
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,880
If he decides to help you,

184
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,120
you might have a chance.

185
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,880
Who is he?

186
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,320
Why are you video-calling me?

187
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,480
I need your help.

188
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,840
Help with what?

189
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,760
Achi.

190
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,600
Hey, Ki.

191
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,760
Jeez, Achi. What do you need my help with?

192
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,800
I won't help you. I don't want to.

193
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,960
Wait, Ki.

194
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,040
He's your brother's friend.

195
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,920
What kind of friend leaves
my brother heartbroken?

196
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,360
He left Money too.

197
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,240
Then he disappeared without a word.

198
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,640
Are we done here?

199
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,600
I'll hang up now.

200
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,880
Hey, wait.

201
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,920
It's like you said, Ki.

202
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,720
It was my fault for leaving.

203
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,320
I left everyone behind.

204
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,680
I'm sorry.

205
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,520
Don't apologize to me.

206
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,160
You should apologize to Ji.

207
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,640
I'll hang up now.

208
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,760
It was Ki?

209
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,480
That's right.

210
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,360
But don't be mad at him.

211
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,520
Listen.

212
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,280
I'm not saying
you should forget what happened.

213
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,080
But if you still have feelings for Achi,

214
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,720
don't wait another ten years.

215
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,760
No one knows
what's going to happen in the future.

216
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,560
Right now, Achi wants
to move forward with you.

217
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,600
It's up to you whether you want
to move forward with him.

218
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,280
What do you think I should do?

219
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,360
Just be with each other already.

220
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,120
Quit playing games.

221
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,160
The two of you were in on this together.

222
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,640
Achi. Ki. I'll make them pay for this.

223
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,960
Don't be mad at them.

224
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,240
You're just as bad.

225
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,840
I thought he was mad. Looks like he isn't.

226
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,480
I think he's blushing.

227
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,800
THIS ISN'T FOR ANY SPECIAL OCCASION

228
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,200
BECAUSE EVERY DAY WITH YOU
IS ALREADY SPECIAL

229
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,440
HAPPY ORDINARY DAY

230
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,200
TRENDING IN THAILAND, #ACHIVICH

231
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,800
THIS CLIP IS FROM WHEN
ACHI WAS STILL WITH MONA

232
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,720
All right. Here's the last question
that we have for Achivich and Mona.

233
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,960
Should I watch this?

234
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,760
Do both of you still remember
your first love?

235
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,040
Write down your answer.
I'm so excited. I can't wait to find out.

236
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,960
Do you remember your first love?

237
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,760
Time is ticking. Tick-tock.
Do you remember your first love?

238
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,000
Reveal your answers
on the count of three. One, two, three.

239
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,760
Show us your answers. Can you remember?

240
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,880
YES

241
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,480
So you still remember your first love.

242
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,160
All right. I'll see you guys next time.

243
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,200
We have to go now. Bye, everyone.

244
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,360
ACHIVICH: I'LL PICK YOU UP
AT THE HOSPITAL THIS EVENING

245
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,800
JI: I GOT THE FLOWERS,
I LOVE THEM, THANK YOU

246
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,560
I forgot I'm on call tonight.

247
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,280
Hello, Peh.

248
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,600
Can you cover for me tonight?

249
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,840
Sure. No problem.

250
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,160
Where are you going?

251
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,520
That's my business.

252
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,200
Okay. You're still as blunt as ever.
That's the Ji I know.

253
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,480
I'll hang up now.

254
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,320
So people know about us.

255
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,680
Do you mind?

256
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,720
It's fine. I'm used to it now.

257
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,920
Do you mind?

258
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,280
It feels a bit weird.

259
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,160
But I don't mind.

260
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,960
What about your fans?

261
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,680
They all seem pretty upset.

262
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,080
Yes.

263
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,560
It will take a while.

264
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,680
But they should understand once I explain.

265
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
Right.

266
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,920
Let me know if you need my help.

267
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,800
Just be you and be with me like this.
That's all I need.

268
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,960
Okay.

269
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,800
This is nice.

270
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,800
Did you just do CPR?

271
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,480
You look like hell.

272
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,720
I'm freaking exhausted.

273
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,640
Hey, listen.
I think Achivich is seeing someone.

274
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,200
He posted a picture of red roses

275
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,040
with a caption,

276
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,160
"This isn't for any special occasion

277
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,480
because every day with you

278
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,560
is already special."

279
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,960
He's obviously in love.

280
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,160
Isn't it good that he's seeing someone?

281
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,760
Your fan club will have a new member.

282
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,720
What new member?

283
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,520
If Achivich is seeing someone,

284
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,640
his fans will be left with nothing
but the Ichi doll.

285
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,040
Wait.

286
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,360
Speaking of the Ichi doll,

287
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,480
Ji got that doll before anyone else.

288
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,640
Do you know how he got it?

289
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,400
It's probably a coincidence.

290
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,040
It's too much of a coincidence.

291
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,200
When Ji went to Chiang Mai,

292
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,600
Achivich was also there.

293
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,320
Not to mention the shirt auction.

294
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,480
Wait.

295
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,560
The photo from last night.

296
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,640
Hold on.

297
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,760
Yes, it's Ji.

298
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,240
Peh.

299
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,880
What?

300
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,520
Peh.

301
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,080
Is this Ji?

302
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,160
It has to be him.
This is Ji and Achivich, right?

303
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,760
Right, Peh?

304
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,880
Gosh.

305
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,760
Anyone with eyes can tell that it's him.

306
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,880
Am I the only one who didn't know?

307
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,800
I kind of always knew.

308
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,320
Back in Chiang Mai,
the two of them were very close.

309
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,120
Are you sad?

310
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,080
I'm happy that Achivich
found someone he loves.

311
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,080
Aren't you happy for Ji?

312
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,480
Please.

313
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:40,000
Ji? Someone should give him an Oscar.

314
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,800
"That's absurd."

315
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,160
"I don't like Achivich." Blah, blah, blah.

316
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,760
Ji's in love with him, right?

317
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,720
I really want to give him a good smack.

318
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,280
-Hello, everyone.
-Hello.

319
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,520
Let's start, Achi.

320
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,080
Tell us about this event.

321
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,960
This event is meant to celebrate
the five years I've been in the industry

322
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,480
and to thank my fans
for always giving me support.

323
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,760
-Achi.
-Yes?

324
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,240
Do you have anything to say

325
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,120
about the photo that leaked?

326
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,560
-Right, the leaked photos.
-Do you have anything to say, Achi?

327
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,880
I have nothing to say. That's really me.

328
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,720
-What?
-Who is the other guy?

329
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,920
What's your relationship with him?

330
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,200
The guy in the photo…

331
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,880
Who is he?

332
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,080
He's my boyfriend.

333
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,640
What?

334
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:49,320
But you just broke up with Mona.
Did you cheat on her with him?

335
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,600
No.

336
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,720
Mona and I broke up before it happened.

337
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,080
It might seem like we just met,

338
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,120
but we've known each other
since before I became an actor.

339
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,600
So it might seem like
we rushed into things.

340
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,760
Are you going to introduce your boyfriend
to the public?

341
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,840
Right.

342
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,920
That's right.

343
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,680
That's up to him.

344
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,800
And how did you two reunite?

345
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,760
I think we should talk about the concert.

346
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,960
I think you look so happy
and in love right now.

347
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,880
That's right.

348
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,040
-Really? Does it show?
-Yes.

349
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,880
That's right. You look so happy.

350
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,320
Thank you.

351
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,240
Did I cause you trouble again?

352
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,080
It's not that big a deal.

353
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,960
Thank you so much
for always helping me out.

354
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,760
Did your boyfriend tell you
I went to talk to him?

355
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,200
You've met Ji?

356
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,040
I went to see him once.

357
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,200
I wanted to talk to him about your work.

358
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,920
What about it?

359
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,560
At the time, I didn't know
what kind of relationship you two had.

360
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,200
I was just worried.

361
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,920
You seemed distracted.

362
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,120
You always went off on your own.

363
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,000
So I went to talk to him about it.

364
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,360
Did you tell Ji to stop seeing me?

365
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,480
Why would I tell him that?

366
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,240
I was just worried.

367
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,080
I'm happy that you found love
and that you're happy.

368
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,920
But you have to accept

369
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,360
that by telling the press
about your relationship,

370
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:58,840
it will cause you to lose fans,
work, and sponsors.

371
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,240
I know.

372
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,840
I'm sorry for making you worried.

373
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,360
I'm sorry as well.

374
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,080
Just be straight with me from now on.

375
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,600
We'll always be a team
no matter what happens.

376
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,480
-Come on. Let's go home.
-All right.

377
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,280
-Is the car over there?
-That's right.

378
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,880
Whose car is it?

379
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,000
What?

380
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,760
How did we get here this morning?
Didn't we take a cab?

381
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,000
Are you confused?

382
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,120
Maybe I am.

383
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,440
Hey, whose dog is this?

384
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,080
It's Achi's dog.

385
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,400
Can I keep him?

386
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,640
You can't.

387
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,720
Please, Mom.

388
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,400
Keep him if you want.

389
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,960
This is what life is.

390
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,560
We don't know how long we'll live.

391
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,240
Hey, honey.

392
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,880
Don't say inauspicious things.

393
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,600
Why didn't you tell Ji the truth?

394
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,440
No, honey.

395
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,760
Ji's about to take his exam.

396
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,840
I don't want him to worry.

397
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,600
He'll worry anyway.

398
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,880
Honey.

399
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,400
When I'm gone,

400
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,560
you must take care of our kids.

401
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,200
Both Ji and Ki.

402
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,840
And Money too.

403
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,840
Honey.

404
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,760
I want you to be happy.

405
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,560
Please don't be sad for too long.
Just for a little while.

406
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,000
You must be strong.

407
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,880
For our kids.

408
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,840
Without you,

409
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,480
how can I be strong?

410
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,800
You won't be alone.

411
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,440
You have Ji and Ki with you.

412
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,120
And you also have Money.

413
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,240
You all have to love each other.

414
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,680
DAD: IS THIS YOU, JI?

415
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,720
Hello, Peh.

416
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,120
Ji, where are you? Get over here.
The residents are almost here.

417
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,840
All right. I'll be there soon.

418
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,920
Pat, let's go.

419
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,199
If everyone's ready, we'll begin now.

420
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,000
Put your tablets away.

421
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,000
You're all reading from the screen.

422
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,440
You won't learn.

423
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,600
You rely too much on the external brain.

424
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:36,120
You won't have your tablets with you
when you take your board exam.

425
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,800
What's your surgery?

426
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,600
Tell us about your case, Dr. Ji.

427
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,920
Yes, sir.

428
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,080
Hey, Ji.

429
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,880
Why are you up at 4:00 a.m.?

430
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,480
I have an operation tomorrow.

431
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,760
But I'm still not prepared.

432
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,640
Can I help?

433
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,480
How can you help?

434
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,600
You're not a doctor.

435
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,480
But I'm an actor.

436
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,200
I'll be Dr. Achivich.

437
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,280
I'm good at memorizing lines.

438
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,840
You're a quack.

439
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,560
You're not a registered physician.

440
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,240
I'm not a real doctor,

441
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,600
but I really love you.

442
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,640
That makes me even more stressed.

443
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,680
So what do you have to say?

444
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,160
I can help you memorize it.

445
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,520
The patient is a 12-year-old Thai boy.

446
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,080
He is 150 cm tall.

447
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,360
His weight is 85 kg.

448
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,480
-His BMI is 37--
-Stop talking.

449
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,120
Stop.

450
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,800
First of all,

451
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,960
you need to relax.

452
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,720
Take a deep breath.

453
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,000
Then breathe out.

454
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,680
Now talk about your case
without stressing over it.

455
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,400
Start over.

456
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,760
The patient is a 12-year-old Thai boy.

457
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,760
He is 150 cm tall.

458
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,760
His weight is 85 kg.

459
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,720
His BMI is 37.7.

460
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,960
He has hip pain
and he has been limping for three days.

461
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,680
Are they evaluating him?

462
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,400
Ji wants to be an orthopedist.

463
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,840
I'll use a lag screw…

464
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,560
I think they are.
This is so nerve-wracking.

465
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,960
…to hold the bones together.

466
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,560
After positioning the bones,

467
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,480
I'll make an incision

468
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,560
and insert the screw
to hold the bones in place.

469
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,920
Can you speak in a way
that humans can understand?

470
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,920
You're operating on a kid.
What will you say to his mom?

471
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,840
But I'm not talking to his mom right now.

472
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,800
How will you explain this
to the kid or his parents?

473
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,280
I'll talk differently.

474
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,320
How will you talk to them? Show me.

475
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,320
This is the femur.

476
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,680
This is the femoral head.

477
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,440
They usually sit on top of each other.

478
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,000
This is the acetabular socket.

479
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,120
It goes here.

480
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,920
Like this.

481
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,280
The femoral head is dislocated.

482
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,920
So the femur is displaced from the socket.

483
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,280
So we need to put them all back into place

484
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,040
and stabilize the head with a screw.

485
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,040
Gosh.

486
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,320
Is this a big surgery?

487
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,520
Not really.

488
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:13,320
I just have to position the bones,
insert the screw, and…

489
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,600
make a small incision.

490
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,960
I see.

491
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,960
Yes. That's right.

492
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,760
It's an operation where
you don't have to cut open a patient.

493
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,280
Why? Did you not get it?

494
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,000
You made things easy to understand

495
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,040
when you talk like that.

496
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:38,960
You seemed relaxed and approachable
as you were talking.

497
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,640
You nailed it.

498
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,760
And you were so damn attractive.

499
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,640
My boyfriend is really the best.

500
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,960
How about we let Jirawat
take point in the surgery?

501
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,920
I'll supervise him.

502
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
All right.

503
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,520
Keep an eye on him whether
he can put his money where his mouth is.

504
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,680
You can go prep, doctor.

505
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,240
Yes, sir.

506
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,280
I'M DONE AND IT WENT GREAT

507
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,560
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP

508
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,160
I LOVE YOU

509
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,560
I'M DONE AND IT WENT GREAT

510
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,160
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP

511
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,560
I LOVE YOU

512
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,360
Hello.

513
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,000
How did it go? Did you get pulled apart?

514
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,520
As if. Of course not.

515
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,480
I practiced so hard for this.

516
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,440
The senior resident is letting me operate.

517
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,240
Really?

518
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,040
That's amazing.

519
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,800
You got this.

520
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,040
Don't forget

521
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,600
to give me my reward for helping you.

522
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,760
Tell me what you want first.

523
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,680
All I want is your love, Dr. Ji.

524
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,640
You're so silly.

525
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,960
Knock it off, Achi.

526
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,960
Good luck.

527
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,160
I'm ready.

528
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:25,040
3 MONTHS LATER

529
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,840
LOVE YOU ALWAYS

530
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,800
It's Dr. Nueng.

531
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,720
-Hello, Dr. Nueng.
-Hello.

532
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,920
Hello. Are you also Achivich's fans?

533
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,160
That's right.

534
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,920
It's like the whole hospital is here.

535
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,760
My gosh. I'm so excited.

536
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,920
Come on. Calm down.
Your blood pressure will shoot up.

537
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,400
Will Ji make it here in time?

538
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,520
I guess.
He said he just got out of surgery.

539
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,400
Yes?

540
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,440
He can't miss this.

541
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,720
What time is it now?

542
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,160
The concert's starting.

543
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,800
Song. Peh.

544
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,600
-Hey.
-My gosh, Ji.

545
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:09,720
Look at you all dressed up
like a Korean idol for your boyfriend.

546
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:13,480
Jeez. How much did this outfit cost you?

547
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,600
Knock it off. Stop teasing me
or I'll take away your tickets.

548
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,920
Peh, zip it right now.

549
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,520
-Got it.
-Good.

550
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,480
Let's go inside.

551
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,880
Let's go.

552
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,080
Wait.

553
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,560
Let's take a picture together first.

554
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,200
-Come on.
-But we'll be late.

555
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,720
It will take just a second.

556
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,240
Over here. Can you take a picture for us?

557
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,360
Jeez.

558
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,880
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

559
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,400
Let's go inside. Come on.

560
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,640
-Wait.
-What?

561
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,080
I'll be right back.
I need to use the restroom.

562
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,720
-What?
-Is she serious?

563
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,040
-Hey.
-Unbelievable.

564
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,360
We'll be late.

565
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,760
The concert's about to start.

566
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,120
-The gate's closing.
-Go on.

567
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,360
This reminds me of old times.

568
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,520
Yes.

569
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,560
I had always thought

570
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,480
that you and Achivich would come
to this point.

571
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,320
What point?

572
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,960
You're an excellent doctor.

573
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,280
Achi is a superstar.

574
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,080
Most importantly,

575
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,400
you two are still together.

576
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,160
I don't believe you.
You're making that up.

577
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,960
I've thought that for a long time

578
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,240
and I've always believed in both of you.

579
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,200
Anyway, I'm happy for you.

580
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,360
This isn't the time to get emotional.
Come on.

581
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,440
I mean it. I always knew
you two would make it.

582
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,240
I'm being serious.

583
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,400
Can I be your best man?

584
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,840
Don't be ridiculous.

585
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,560
I'll get back at you
and set you up with someone.

586
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,840
Set me up? No, thank you.

587
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,800
There she is.
Your girl is coming right this way.

588
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,360
Hey, come on. Let's go inside.

589
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,800
-Hurry. The gate's closing.
-Okay. Let's go inside, Ji.

590
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,120
Why are you smiling?

591
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,840
Let's go.

592
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,960
-Here. Thank you.
-Here you go.

593
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,440
Thank you.

594
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,680
Are you sure that we're just friends?

595
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,760
I think there's something more going on

596
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,720
We go everywhere together
And everyone can see it

597
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,760
I don't know whether you feel something

598
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,840
But I think you do

599
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:07,520
There's a feeling inside of me
And that feeling makes me feel good

600
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,480
It got me all flustered
And I can't keep it in anymore

601
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,600
Can we go from being friends
To being lovers?

602
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:21,040
Are you hoping
For the same thing I'm hoping for?

603
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:24,880
I'm waiting for you to say it first

604
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,960
Please understand
That I want to be your man

605
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,240
All you have to do is say yes

606
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,800
I like you

607
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,040
And I like you more than just a friend

608
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:41,240
Can we go from being friends
To being lovers?

609
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:46,360
Are you hoping
For the same thing I'm hoping for?

610
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,120
I'm waiting for you to say it first

611
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:54,280
Please understand
That I want to be your man

612
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,960
All you have to do is say yes

613
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,960
I like you

614
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,680
And I like you more than just a friend

615
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,240
I like you

616
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:09,440
And I like you more than just a friend

617
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,720
He wants to be your man.

618
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,200
Knock it off. Stop teasing me.

619
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:28,840
All right.

620
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,240
For this next song,

621
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,920
I have a special guest
who will join me on stage.

622
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,680
I saw her performance
and I was so impressed by it.

623
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,720
Before this,

624
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,600
she was in a car accident

625
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,840
and she almost lost her finger
because of it.

626
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,120
But her dream and her bravery

627
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,880
helped give her the strength
to keep fighting.

628
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,840
The song she's about to perform

629
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,360
talks about my past

630
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,400
with a certain doctor.

631
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,960
That doctor was the one

632
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,240
who made it possible for this girl
to keep chasing her dream.

633
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,840
Please put your hands together for Nini.

634
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,000
-What?
-Nini?

635
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,840
I don't know what I should do

636
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:11,280
I don't know what you'll say

637
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,000
If I tell you that I love you

638
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,720
I'm afraid you might not feel the same way

639
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:21,320
I'm scared you may not see me that way

640
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,600
I'm scared I might have it all wrong

641
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,720
The closer we are

642
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,280
The more scared I am
To tell you how I feel

643
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:38,440
All I can do is wait for you
To be the one to say it first

644
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:45,120
And I have no idea how long I have to wait

645
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,640
I'm waiting for you
To say that you love me

646
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,240
Because I don't want to get hurt

647
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:57,440
Please tell me how long

648
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,240
I have to keep this feeling inside

649
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:07,960
The closer we are
The harder it is for me to keep it in

650
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:15,800
To keep acting like we're just friends

651
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:20,160
I wouldn't be up here
in front of you all today

652
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:25,480
without the help of the doctors,
the senior residents, and the nurses.

653
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:31,240
But I'd like to use this chance
to thank two people in particular.

654
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:37,320
I'd like to thank Dr. Ji for treating me

655
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,920
and telling me to keep fighting.

656
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:44,920
And I'd like to thank Achi
for inspiring me to play piano again.

657
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,640
We're now down to the last song.

658
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,720
I've helped write this song myself.

659
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,120
Regardless of what happened in the past,

660
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,320
from now, now,

661
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,400
let's move forward together.

662
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,800
All along I have made you cry

663
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:44,600
It's all my fault
For not being good enough for you

664
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,840
Come inside.

665
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,800
Why did you have to yell?

666
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,240
-Hello, Achi.
-Hey, Ki.

667
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:57,680
Coin.

668
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,640
His name's Coin?

669
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,960
Money is his mother. Do you remember her?

670
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:09,800
Of course.

671
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,640
You're so cute.

672
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,480
Achi and I decided
to move forward together.

673
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,720
You can choose to live your life
the way you want

674
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,760
or let yourself go
where the world takes you.

675
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:00,960
Sometimes changes
might make you feel nervous.

676
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,360
Write something.

677
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,520
Life might turn out

678
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,440
the way you want.

679
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,600
You're Money's owner, right?

680
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,720
Or it might make you scared.

681
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,800
Are you serious about each other?

682
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:17,760
Yes.

683
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:21,920
If you want to come back
and move forward with Ji,

684
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,560
don't make him sad like that again.

685
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,720
Achivich.

686
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,680
Yes, sir.

687
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,480
No matter what,
we have to keep moving forward.

688
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,240
DUEN'S BUTCHER SHOP

689
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:53,960
PORK NECK SLICES, BELLY PORK SLICES

690
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,640
Aren't they cute?

691
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:23,880
Are they together?

692
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,040
Yes, they are.

693
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,600
SPORTS MEDICINE FELLOWSHIP

694
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,800
Although our story began
and ended in the past,

695
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,960
it doesn't mean we can't start over.

696
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,800
We just have to give it a chance.

697
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:51,040
Today, I'm with someone
who used to exist only in the past.

698
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,360
He's my past and my present

699
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,240
and I hope we can build a future

700
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,640
together

701
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,560
from now on and forever.
