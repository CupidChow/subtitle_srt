Her internship at Genus

69
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,120
is covered by a strict confidentiality agreement.

70
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,370
Five years ago,

71
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,750
Affinity B carriers were involved

72
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,160
in berserk attack incidents, for the first time.

73
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,830
That led to the establishment of the Special Administration Bureau,

74
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,330
to place them under control.

75
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,620
At the same time, research began on the virus within them.

76
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,620
The conclusion was that

77
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,500
Affinity B

78
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,660
greatly enhances the physical potential of carriers,

79
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,250
granting them extraordinary destructive power.

80
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:46,660
And then,

81
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,870
the government later named this group "Ren".

82
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,220
[Ren (Blade)]

83
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,580
Affinity also caused a small number of Ren

84
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,250
to develop emotional deficiency.

85
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,540
In other words,

86
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
they cannot feel

87
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,750
or truly understand

88
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,660
emotions like love, or pain, unlike normal people.

89
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:01,870
That is one way to put it.

90
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,660
So,

91
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,120
they're much more likely to turn antisocial

92
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,790

93
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,620
Just like they said on the news.

94
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,660
They will turn crazy

95
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,120
and become antisocial.

96
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:12,870

98
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,250

99
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,260
Using them

100
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,040
to carry out dangerous missions

101
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,000
to protect ordinary people.

102
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,670
But Ren,

103
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,160
once a mission is over,

104
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,130
are prone to losing control and hurting others.

105
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,790
When they

106
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,040
become overly excited,

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,040
their virus load

108
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,370
will...

109
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,450
Will surge.

110
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,540
Then they lose control,

111
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,700
lashing out uncontrollably.

112
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,540
In the end,

113
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,370
they would burn out.

114
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,250
Some didn't survive.

115
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,370
That kind of loss of control

116
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,660
can be addressed.

117
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,620
Under certain conditions,

118
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,500
Affinity A

119
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,540
can suppress Affinity B.

120
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,750
Simply put,

121
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,370
that means

122
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,450
an Affinity A carrier

123
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,950
can guide a berserk Ren back to normal.

124
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,160
However,

125
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,370
the two must be of opposite sexes.

126
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,330
So, later on,

127
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,540
this group was named "Yin".

128
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,330
[Yin (Guide)]
They naturally attract Ren.

129
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,620
So how does a Ren

130
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,870
identify an Yin among crowd?

131
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,620
Yin,

132
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,040
under the virus's influence,

133
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,560
have blood,

134
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,290
tears, and other body fluids

135
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,340
with a distinctive scent.

136
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,720
Ren have extremely keen senses.

137
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,650
They can detect it.

138
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,540
So how can an Yin guide a Ren back to normal?

139
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,230
Through deep interaction of body fluids.

140
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,650
We call it

141
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,600
"forming a pact".

142
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,500
A common and relatively safe way to form a pact

143
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,820
is for two people to get married.

144
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,250
And through the

145
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,290
marital intimacy...

146
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,290
Now, many Ren have already

147
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,950
return to normal life

148
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,750
by marrying Yin.

149
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,370
So a pact

150
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,500
is essentially marriage.

151
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,120
No.

152
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,160
It is even stronger

153
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,160
than an ordinary marriage.

154
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,160
This is a one-to-one bond, permanent and exclusive.

155
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,840
After a pact is formed,

156
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,300
the virus develops exclusivity.

157
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,580
From that point on,

158
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,110
this Ren

159
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,400
can only be soothed by this Yin.

160
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,250
And this Yin's bodily fluids

161
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,910
no longer work on any other Ren.

162
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,370
They

163
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,250
recognize only each other.

164
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,740
However,

165
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,910
there are far fewer Yin than Ren.

166
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,040
That is why Genus has spent years

167
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,540
researching inhibitors,

168
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,410
to deal with the problem of Ren losing control.

169
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,750
So they developed it?

170
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,370
So Mr. Gu

171
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,870
saved me just now using the inhibitor, right?

172
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,910
Inhibitors work by lowering viral activity,

173
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,790
forcing Ren out of an overexcited state.

174
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,000
But it won't last.

175
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,660
Resistance increases with repeated use.

176
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,870
Eventually, the inhibitor stops working.

177
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,120
That is why

178
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,660
we need to keep improving the inhibitors.

179
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,330
In fact, these Ren came here today

180
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,040
as volunteers to test the new drug.

181
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,080
No one expected them to die after testing the new drug.

182
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,620
Could the side effects of the new drug

183
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,200
be something like

184
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,790
temporary respiratory arrest,

185
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,250
and then

186
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,290
they were mistakenly declared dead?

187
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,620
Go to Security.

188
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,250
It is safer there.

189
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,370
Let me tell you something amusing.

190
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,370
Those Ren

191
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,370
may look intimidating,

192
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,000
but every time they go through drug trials,

193
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,620
they scream uncontrollably, like a panicked animal.

194
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,160
Just thinking about it makes me laugh.

195
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,290
They were like fools.

196
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,000
You sound so entertained.

197
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,120
I want to hear it too.

198
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,450
- Come on. - Come.

199
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,750
Just thinking about it cracks me up.

200
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,540
Give me a throat lozenge.

201
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,160
I have something even funnier to tell you.

202
00:13:59,210 --> 00:13:59,600
Here.

203
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,790
Sheng, your story makes me feel like

204
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,550
[Nan Xing. Affinity-B]
having a bowl of offal porridge tonight.

205
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,500
Here.

206
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:38,910
No.

207
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,040
No.

208
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,040
No.

209
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,910
Try not to scream like an animal.

210
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,000
Hi.

211
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,160
You are still alive!

212
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:16,870
Oh.

213
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,000
Just consider this as an innocuous joke.

214
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,540
But next,

215
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,290
I am getting serious.

216
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,700
The hunting game

217
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,860
officially begins.

218
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,980
I heard gunshots over here.

219
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,510
I saw someone running that way.

220
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,040
Nan Xing.

221
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:42,830
The inhibitors

222
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,870
are all secured.

223
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:46,750
Nice.

224
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,160
Hand them out later.

225
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,000
So we do not lose control and hurt our own.

226
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,080
Let me think.

227
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,960
Next,

228
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,890
how should we play with these little rats?

229
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,250
Should we

230
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,160
leave survivors?

231
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,750
If we find an Yin, keep them.

232
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,290
In the future,

233
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,330
this place will only be full of

234
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,160
free,

235
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,580
happy, and united

236
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,540
Ren and Yin.

237
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,410
It must have been those Ren.

238
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,870
Check the cameras.

239
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,080
They...

240
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,360
They are not heading for the dorms, are they?

241
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,120
Hurry, find the elevator keys.

242
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,790
Stop them.

243
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,500
Move, now.

244
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,750
What did you do to those Ren?

245
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,370
Why are they trying to wipe everyone out?

246
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,290
It really was just a standard drug trial.

247
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:11,690
We...

248
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,040
They even signed Informed Consent Forms

249
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,650
and Body Donation Agreements.

250
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,700
The keys!

251
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,850
What are you messing with behind those screens?

252
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,410
It is useless.

253
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,000
Looks like some little rats

254
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,040
are secretly watching us.
