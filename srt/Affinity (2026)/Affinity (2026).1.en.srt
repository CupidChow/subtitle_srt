00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,210
Boss!

193
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,830
I'm losing control!

194
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,620
Then take an inhibitor shot.

195
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,960
Hang in there. We'll be free soon.

No inhibitor shots left.

208
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,710
Get off if you are done here.

209
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,370
It's getting out of control.
