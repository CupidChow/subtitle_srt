1
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:26,830
Xu.

2
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,300
I knew it.

3
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,500
You were never ordinary.

4
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,290
Who gave you the right to touch her?

5
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:53,910
Because of this woman,

6
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,290
you lost yourself.

7
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,040
You turned into a love-struck idiot

8
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,310
and destroyed every promise we made.

9
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,450
What promise?

10
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,580
You forgot?

11
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,510
The day we met.

12
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,740
I could not take the excessive training,

13
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,840
being monitored like a prisoner every day,

14
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,400
so I broke down and wanted to end it all.

15
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,950
But then I ran into you while you were escaping.

16
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,800
You are not allowed to die here.

17
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:38,950
Why?

18
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,600
Unknown massive life form detected. Area is dangerous.

19
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,010
Emergency return.

20
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,260
I can't believe it!

21
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,210
We really escaped that place!

22
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,000
No one has found this place.

23
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,580
If you want to do it, go ahead.

24
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,580
I do not want to die anymore.

25
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,460
Where are you heading?

26
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,330
Take me with you.

27
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,620
I'm the strongest in this team.

28
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,500
Everyone calls me Max.

29
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,830
I can definitely help you.

30
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,290
No.

31
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,210
You are as annoying as those Yin from the Administration Bureau.

32
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,460
If you hate Yin that much,

33
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,210
why don't we create a world

34
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,960
controlled entirely by Ren?

35
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,580
You are that strong.

36
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,580
You can do it.

37
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,330
I will get stronger too and keep up with you.

38
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,620
Let us start now.

39
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,830
Stop following my path.

40
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,670
I'll go north. You go south.

41
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,860
That was when I made up my mind.

42
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,170
Xu,

43
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,040
I will meet you at the summit.

44
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,420
But

45
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,170
after I cleared every path for you,

46
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,040
you killed the ideal version of yourself.

47
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,710
You crushed all of my expectations!

48
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,480
Since you are no longer who you were,

49
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,310
then just die!

50
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,290
I do not need your expectations.

51
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,870
We were never on the same path.

52
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,210
What I want to destroy

53
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,440
is the inequality imposed upon Ren,

54
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,780
not creating new inequality

55
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,590

you never needed me.

61
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,210
How dare you touch him?

62
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,070
We can make Xuyan a thriving company,

63
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,350
fulfilling our dream

64
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,260
of building a world ruled by Ren.

65
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,650
So all of this

66
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,000
was just my own delusion.

67
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,600

00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,520

Siyuan.

92
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,000
Why are you here?

93
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:51,830
Your hand.

94
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,920
This watch monitors your health in real time.

95
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,390
I have one too.

96
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,040
If your condition shows anything abnormal,

97
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,170
it will send me your location immediately.

98
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,170
So, you will be tracking me around the clock?

99
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,540
You got lucky this time.

100
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,040
Li Xiang and Lin Juan made it in time

101
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
and got you to the hospital.

102
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,920
You were fortunate,

103
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,790
as there are only a few scratches.

104
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,210
By the way, Siyuan,

105
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,710
where is Xie Xinxu?

106
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,790
He just came out of surgery. They got the bullet out.

107
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,790
He is resting in another ward.

108
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:05,690
From now on,

109
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,500
you aren't allowed to go on missions with him.

110
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,870
But I handled this one really well.

111
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,650
For those missing people, Xuyan Trading...

112
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,070
Lin Juan already reported it.

113
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,170
There is one thing Lin Juan does not know.

114
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:21,920
Dragons

115
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,460
did not go completely extinct.

116
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,580
There is still one.

117
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,500
I saw it myself.

118
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,290
I told you before.

119
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,290
I would give you the best of everything.

120
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,790
I went to a lot of trouble

121
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,820
to recreate this dragon from fossils.

122
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,880
This biological weapon...

123
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,500
Do you like it?

124
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,120
Are you not worried

125
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,950
that I could tame it, control it, and have it kill you?

126
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,330
Get to work.

127
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,580
Yes.

128
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,670
The world is full of strange things.

129
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,170
Back when you were at Genus,

130
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,040
did you not see Nan Xing's mutated octopus?

131
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,670
But an octopus is not a dragon.

132
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,350
The wound looks like it is healing fast.

133
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,040
If I mess with it like this,

134
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,280
it will not heal so quickly.

135
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,870
Is this my reward for grinding through that mission?

136
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,620
Why does it look worse again?

137
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,000
It is fine.

138
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,170
I probably pulled the wound by accident.

139
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,830
From now on, do not take solo missions.

140
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,210
Stay with me.

141
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,040
This knife is for eating,

142
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,960
not for violent use like that.

143
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,420
It is dirty.

144
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,020
I'll take it to the dry cleaners later.

145
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,370
I promise you can hold it while you sleep tonight.

146
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,710
My sister has been asking for this every day.

147
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,960
I do not get what is so special about it.

148
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,540
Try it.

149
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,120
If you are eating cake, just eat it.

150
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,330
Why are you grinning like that?

151
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,450
It tastes pretty good.

152
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,050
Go ahead.

153
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:37,960
This is your reward

154
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,170
for always remembering to buy cake to cheer me up all these years.

155
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,170
I hope you do not misunderstand

156
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,710
our relationship.

157
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,350
And one more thing.

158
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,340
Do not pull any tricks

159
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,620
behind my back.

160
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,760
If something happens to you,

161
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,920
it'll be a lot of trouble for me too.

162
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,120
Got it.

163
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,540

dimly,

181
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,960
saw...

182
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,000
a dragon.

183
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,790

184
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,790

has a temper just as hard to deal with as yours.

191
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,210
So, where does it usually live?

192
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,460
Deep in the mountains and forests.

193
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,670
It is an anomaly, after all.

194
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,790
Staying away from people is safer,

195
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,720
and it's more comfortable.

196
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,750
But their boy,

197
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,870
has been quite a loner.

198
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,370
He never smiled or greeted us

199
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,580
whenever he saw us.

200
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,210
Just like they said on the news.

201
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,870
They will turn crazy.

202
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,430
Actually,

203
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,290
I am really glad we became

204
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:23,650
partners.

205
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,120
Partners.

206
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,250
Just partners?

207
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,500
These past few months have been intense.

208
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,370
Constant close calls

209
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,440
and even

210
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,980
entering your dreams.

211
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,780
I asked my teacher to look into those dreams.

212
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,710
In Sunset Forest,

213
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,940
there is a type of fern

214
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,420
that releases special molecules

215
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,950
when fog humidity exceeds 90 percent.

216
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,080
Anyone who inhales them

217
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,040
will have their brain invaded,

218
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,300
specifically the areas tied to memory and imagination.

219
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,580
That is why our dreams were linked.

220
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,010
More precisely,

221
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,260
we shared each other's subconscious.

222
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,870
If it were the subconscious,

223
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,750
then what we experienced in those dreams

224
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,500
could be real memories that actually happened.

225
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,290
The day your parents were killed,

226
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,920
you saw the killer's back.

227
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,080
You also know

228
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,540
he was with the Special Administration Bureau.

229
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,500
Yes.

230
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,170
All these years,

231
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,670
I have been tracking his identity,

232
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,060
but I still

233
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,710
have found no trace of him.

234
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,170
Once we gather all the fragments,

235
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,210
I will go with you to find your parents' killer.

236
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,710
But the memory of that day

237
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,040
has been reshaped

238
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,330
by your appearance.

240
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:36,930
