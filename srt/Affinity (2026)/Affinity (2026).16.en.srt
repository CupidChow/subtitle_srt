1
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:17,320
Don't worry.

2
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,100
Rest assured.

3
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,580
He won't be going anywhere anytime soon.

4
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,420
You go first.

5
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:22,800
Li Xiang and I will cover your retreat.

6
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,040
Xie Xinxu.

7
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,420
That shot counts as your apology.

8
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,460
You screw me over again,

9
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,290
I’ll blow your head off.

10
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,040
I wasn't apologizing.

11
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,330
You got captured

12
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,920
because you were weak.

13
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,770
♪You smell like something strange♪

14
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:53,810

19
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,400
You drive well.

20
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,380
What kind of amateur shot was that?

21
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,870
How did you even pass your driving test?

22
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,080
I'll handle the shooting.

23
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:14,470
♪I keep telling myself, to find a way out♪

00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:21,560

Ready?

28
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,080
What?

29
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,710
The wind's too loud. I couldn't hear you.

30
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,370
Can you explain it first before you act next time?

31
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:17,960
What did you say?

32
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,620
The wind's too loud. I couldn't hear you.

33
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,260
We're heading to Sunset Forest.

34
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,370
According to Max's intel,

35
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,670
the fragment should be there.

36
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,120
Shouldn't we go to the hospital first?

37
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,200
It's fine.

38
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,170
The bullet just grazed me.

39
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,290
I can still hold on.

40
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,000
If we don't go now,

41
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,580
Max will tighten security even more.

42
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,420
Starting navigation to Sunset Forest.

43
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,040
Stop the car.

44
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,870
There's something wrong with the fog in this forest.

45
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,960
Hold at the intersection.

46
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,080
We'll go in after the fog clears.

47
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,080
Why am I so sleepy?

48
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,580
Wasn't I supposed to be in Sunset Forest?

49
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,460
Where am I?

50
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,250
Xie Xinxu.

51
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,220
Good morning, everyone.

52
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,570
Today is November 31st, 2020.

53
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,200
On this day in history,

54
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,010
the well known writer Lin Yu

55
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,490
published his first full length novel, Silence.

56
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,330
The year 2020?

57
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,150
Did I travel back five years?

58
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,780
Xie Xinxu.

59
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,420
If you see my girlfriend again,

60
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,760
stay away from her. Got it?

61
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,720
What are you doing?

62
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,670
Let's talk this out.

63
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,290
Who are you, stepping in like this for him?

64
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,620
He's my husband.

65
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,270
So you're being kept by a pretty lady.

66
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,480
Watch your mouth. You spread rumors way too easily.

67
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,010
Leave. Now.

68
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,370
Or I'll call the police.

69
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,960
Search her. Take her phone.

70
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,640
♪I am lost in the dizzy pull of your fierce attraction♪

71
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,930
♪So devoted that I would let this obsession last until the end of my life♪

72
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:33,270
♪Will your love ever burn as fiercely as mine?♪

73
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,170
You're going to kill them.

74
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,620
Xie Xinxu.

75
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,750
Who are you?

76
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,920
Why would you say

77
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,120
we're in that kind of relationship?

78
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,750
Am I the only one who went back in time?

79
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,450
The person in front of me

80
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,920
is Xie Xinxu from five years ago, before he ever met me.

81
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,980
I had a dream that foretold the future.

82
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,250
In that dream,

83
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,290
I was your wife.

84
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,450
In the future.

85
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,080
Get off.

86
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,220
What are you still trying to do?

87
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,790
Why are you burning up?

88
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:38,570
You've got a fever.

89
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,370
We're going to the hospital.
(Watch on www,kisskh,la or www,kisskh,id to support Admin)

90
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,670
If I went back in time,

91
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,350
how would I get back to my own time?

92
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,880
That's an intense presence.

93
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:15,750
If you don't mind,

94
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,440
could you come in and explain?

95
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,290
What exactly happened to my son?

96
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,250
Did Xu get into a fight outside?

97
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,650
No.

98
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,790
He just tripped outside by accident.

99
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,710
I was a bit worried,

100
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,750
so I walked him back.

101
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,500
Judging by how you're dressed,

102
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,870
you don't look like his classmate.

103
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,620
How old are you?

104
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,420
I'm twenty three.

105
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,330
We're very grateful you brought Xu home today.

106
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,120
But

107
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,670
he's only just started college.

108
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,830
You're already working in society.

109
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,420
So considering all aspects,

110
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,710
we don't think it's appropriate for you to be friends.

111
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,870
I think it's perfectly fine.

112
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,620
And

113
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,040
I'm pursuing her right now.

114
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,920
Let's go.

115
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,540
Why did you say you were pursuing me?

116
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,960
My parents are rigid and old fashioned.

117
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,200
They'd worry you might toy with my feelings.

118
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,160
They'd warn you, keep an eye on you,

119
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,680
and make sure you stay away from me.

120
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,420
You can only see each other three times a week.

121
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,920
You must be home by nine at the latest.

122
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,120
And

123
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,420
cannot affect his studies.

124
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,580
This is the bottom line.

125
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,540
If you can't follow these rules,

126
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,040
we will oppose any further contact.

127
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,330
That's fine with me.

128
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,420
Fetch the camera.

129
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,420
The school

130
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,760
gave every Provincial Outstanding Teacher

131
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,740
a camera as a reward.

132
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,420
Since we have the chance,

133
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,460
I'll test it to see if it's working properly.

134
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,670
Can I have a look?

135
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,620
What a nice vintage camera.

136
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,670
I've wanted one for a long time.

137
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,870
This is this year's new model.

138
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,580
I'm saying this design has a real vintage feel.

139
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,920
And its burst mode is pretty powerful too.

140
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,960
How do you use burst mode?

141
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,960
Madam, you're very photogenic.

142
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,460
You look exactly the same in person.

143
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,420
Sir,

144
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,080
if your bangs were a bit longer,

145
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,540
you'd look just like a Korean oppa.

146
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:16,960
Really?

147
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,580
And this one!

148
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,420
Madam's smile looks great here.

149
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,870
How about

150
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,210
we take a couple more?

151
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,080
The frame's full of people.

152
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,460
You can't really tell if the color is vivid enough.

153
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,290
Noisy.

154
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,850
You're driving me crazy.

155
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,170
I'll go check on him.

156
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,960
Don't lock the door.

157
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,330
Your fever's gotten worse.

158
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,580
Get up.

159
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:08,920
Come on.

160
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,250
You look like you're about to go berserk.

161
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,620
I can help you.

162
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,040
I don't know what you're talking about.

163
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,750
Leave.

164
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,830
But if you go berserk, you will hurt someone.

165
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,370
Don't you remember those troublemakers?

166
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,870
What if you hurt your parents?

167
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,330
Trust me just once.

168
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,120
I can't do anything bad to you anyway.

169
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,210
Then what are you going to do...

170
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,670
to help me?

171
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,500
Do you feel any better now?

172
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,500
Try to relax.

173
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,420
You're holding too tight.

174
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,540
That hurts.

175
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,250
It hurts.

176
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:52,960
You…

177
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,610
You crossed a line.

178
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,550
I'm sorry.

179
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,500
Looks like I'll have to pull out the big move.

180
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,960
Why are your lips swollen?

181
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,370
Did you two

182
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,670
just now

183
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,610
eat spicy snacks?

184
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,040
Have this instead.

185
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,290
Don't eat those junk snacks.

186
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,300
Um...

187
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,530
