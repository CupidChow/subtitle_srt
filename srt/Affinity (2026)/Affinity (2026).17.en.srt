00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,320
This is probably the first time in your life

00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,370
that the virus has gone out of control.

3
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,170
So this is how unbearable it feels.

4
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,620
You even run a fever.

5
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,210
So that night in the original timeline,

6
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,700
you forced yourself to endure it alone.

7
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,410
It must have been far worse than this.

8

Let's not waste the food.

10
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,290
You're such a noisy eater.

11
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,180
This is all because of you.

12

This bread's no good now.

Stay.

14

Hey.

18

We'll give him a proper talking-to tomorrow.

19
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,160
That noise just now really wasn't me.

20
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,200
Your mother probably knocked something over

21
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,700
while she was cleaning.

22
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:05,950

I saw that person

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,500
near your place yesterday.

Don't move.

30
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,200
That couple refused to hand over Xie Xinxu,

31
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,050
so we took action.

32
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,630
Now the situation has changed.

33
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,280
We need your instructions for the next step.

34
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,250
We haven't searched the house yet,

35
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,550
but our people have already surrounded it.

36
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,570

We'll wait for the rest of the Bureau team to arrive and take over.

40
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,410
What did he just say?

41
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,290
Something about taking action?

Stay in the room.

43

I'll go check outside.

44
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,750
This is the day Xie Xinxu's parents died.

45
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,870
It's also the day we first met.

46
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,750
Then doesn't that mean my brother and the others

47
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,910
will be here soon to take Xie Xinxu in as a suspect?

48
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,580
It's best not to touch anything.

49
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,450
Preserve every trace at the scene.

50
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,360
And this knife.

51
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,200
Your fingerprints are on it.

52
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,330
That would be hard to explain.

53
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,690
Your expression too.

54
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,080
You don't look like someone who's grieving at all.

55
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,330
That's how they'll mark you as a suspect.

56
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,200
That kind of grieving look you mentioned,

57
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,230
I don't think I can do it.

58

61
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,540
Cutting onions makes people tear up.

62
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,370
That won't work.

63
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,910
See?

64
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,330
It works.

65
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,660
You do the cutting yourself.

Isn't that cruelly ironic?
