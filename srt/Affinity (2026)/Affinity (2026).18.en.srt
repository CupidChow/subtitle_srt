Nongyu.

2
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,290
I found Mom.

3
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,200
Mom, I want to tell you something.

4
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,160
Last week, a new classmate

5
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,830
saw the scarf you knitted for me and said it was beautiful.

6
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,370
Does that make you happy?

7
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,820
The last time I saw you,

8
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,750
your forehead was like burning.

9
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,330
This time, it is not like that at all.

10
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,210
That means my blood

11
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,910
really helps with your illness.

12
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:22,660
Right?

13
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,070
Is your dad using your blood to treat your mom?

14
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,680
Mom got very, very sick.

15
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,500
She slept for a very long time.

16
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,700
Dad tried every way he could.

17
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,750
In the end, he realized...

18
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,500
I was the one who could save her.

19
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,870
But what if

20
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,950
your mom does not get better,

21
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,250
and it ends up hurting you?

22
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,500
Big guy,

23
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,330
you and my brother

24
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,790
are saying the same dumb thing.

25
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,580
Look.

26
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,200
Mom has always smelt nice.

27
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,830
When I go to classmates' homes to do homework,

28
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,580
their sick family members smell bad.

29
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,000
That means Mom is getting better every day.

Dad never wants to bring me here.

You helped me fulfill

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,120
my wish of seeing Mom.

36
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,830
I'm really, really happy.

You still have to go back?

41
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,540
Of course I have to go home after seeing Mom.

42
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,870
Otherwise, Dad will cry.

43
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,800
You don't know, every time after they draw my blood,

44
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,660
and after Dad coaxes me to sleep,

45
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,410
he secretly cries in his room for a long time.

00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,860

It was sleep-talking.

68
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,750
I did not dream about you.

Really?

70
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,660
But I did dream about you,

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,410
and you were in fifth grade.

72
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,000
And your parents.

73
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,790
So you too...

74
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,830
I also dreamed about you.

00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,080
I even dreamed

76
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:53,450
that I went to your university

77
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:54,250
and your home.

00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,120

We are out of gas.

84
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,160
We will have to go on foot.

85
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,200
Can you keep going?

00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,400
You okay?

87
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,880

00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,510

For example...

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,870
For example...

96
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,290
Do you believe

97
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,410
that there are dragons still alive?

98
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,920
You are not saying

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,580
you brought a dragon back to life from fossils, are you?

100
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,390
Do you really need to laugh that hard?

101
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,360
This is more than just a scratch.

102
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,670
You are seriously stubborn.

103
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,210
Get up.

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,010

Then, we will cross the mountain ahead.

108
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,700

00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,040
