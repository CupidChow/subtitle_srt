1
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,780
Wow, that is way too generous.

2
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,080
Looks like

3
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,790
your reaction was what was way too generous.

4
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:21,950
Look at you.

5
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,120
Cash would be tacky, right?

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,620
But a pen...

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,790
You can write with it.

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,410
Thanks.

9
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,030
By the way, director.

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,540
How long are you staying?

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:31,950
Call me Mr. Ding.

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,290
I quit.

13
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,500
I'm setting up my own lab,

14
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,290
start my own business.

15
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,750
I'm here, in part,

16
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,120
to invite you to join my project.

17
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:42,910
I heard it from Gu...

18
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:43,700
No,

19
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,000
from Xie.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So you knew already.

21
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,450
Xie

22
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,550
told me about hiding his identity.

23
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,430
He also said

24
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,050
you're working on a drug to eliminate Affinity.

25
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,120
Perfect timing.

26
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,120
My lab plans to take this on as well.

27
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,250
Back at Genus,

28
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,450
I found out something classified.

29
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,290
Thirteen years ago,

30
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,000
a couple, both professors,

31
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,370
developed a cure to Affinity.

32
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,330
But

33
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,620
something went wrong in the final stage.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,750
What happened?

35
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,870
No one knows.

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,120
All that's known is

37
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,620
their notes

38
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,330
were sealed in a glass drive,

39
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,130
split into three pieces.

40
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:28,840
The first

41
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,750
is in Sunset Creek Town.

42
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:33,790
Sunset Creek Town?

43
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,220
Isn't that where you're headed?

44
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,440
That place is dangerous.

45
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,250
I won't take you.

46
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,370
Your brother wouldn't allow it either.

47
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,810
You're strong in a fight.

48
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,850
Of course you'd protect me.

49
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,340
I'll talk to my brother when I get back.

50
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,360
and have him add me to the mission.

51
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:47,680
Alright.

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,870
Thanks, Mr. Ding.

53
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,470
I'll head out.

54
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,750
Why pull her into

55
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,500
the fragment search?

56
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,750
The Special Administration Bureau is also after those fragments.

57
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,250
Bringing her in

58
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,000
helps us get more leads from their side.

59
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,870
And if you go berserk,

60
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,870
having an Yin nearby is safer.

61
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,620
Before making any decisions,

62
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,250
you need to consult me.

63
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,160
It's too dangerous. You're not going.

64
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,000
That's exactly why I have to go.

65
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,620
What if Xie Xinxu goes berserk?

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,120
I can calm him.

67
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,120
An inhibitor shot will also do.

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,120
Siyuan.

69
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,410
After forming a pact,

70
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,370
a Ren becomes psychologically dependent on an Yin.

71
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,120
What if Xie Xinxu

72
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,790
develops separation anxiety?

73
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,660
That would affect the mission.

74
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,620
Then have Li Xiang and Lin Juan go with you.

75
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,370
They can protect you.

76
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,080
Li Xiang?

77
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,500
Is it that pretty young lady

78
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,620
you often work with?

79
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,620
Did you form a pact in private?

80
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,330
Who told you anything?

81
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,370
Three years ago, when you were twenty-five,

82
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,750
you were sick for a long time.

83
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,870
You said it was exhaustion,

84
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,000
but it was your virus going berserk

85
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,370
and nearly killed you, didn't it?

86
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,040
You must have formed a pact with a Ren

87
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,120
to survive.

88
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:21,990
Right?

89
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,170
That's not your concern.

90
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:28,860
Enough.

91
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,740
It's late.

92
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,230
You should head back.

93
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,910
I'll walk you out.

94
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,810
No need. Someone's picking me up.

95
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,910
It's swollen.

96
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,120
So careless.

97
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,000
Cold-blooded.

98
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,540
I'm off, Siyuan.

99
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,540
Good night.

100
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,330
Careful.

101
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,530
Mr. Wu, you didn't need to rush discharge.

102
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,540
I'm fine.

103
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,760
Have you found a suitable Ren?

104
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,800
We selected all female Ren

105
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,040
carrying a high-activity Affinity B virus.

106
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,080
After forming a pact with you,

107
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,500
they should help you recover quickly.

108
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,620
Who are you acting superior for all day?

109
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,000
A Ren who can't work with a team
(Watch on www.kisskh,la or www.kisskh,id to support admin)

110
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,500
is only fit to be a punching bag.

111
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,010
Hey.

112
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,540
I'm talking to you.

113
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,120
Didn't you hear me?

114
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,450
Are you dead or what?

115
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,370
Say something.

Let go!

120
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,580
Let go of me!

Run a check on her name.

Her name is Li Xiang.

133
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,120
She's among the selected Ren.

134
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,540
Bring her in.

135
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:42,790
I can form a pact with you,

136
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,660
as your blood supply.

137
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,370
But you must transfer me to your side.

138
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,160
I never want to go back.

139
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,370
You want to negotiate?

140
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,750

00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,250
So I can leave the Administration Bureau today?

147
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,620
These are my rules.

148
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,660
In front of me,

149
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,730
your mind

150
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,260
can hold nothing but me.

151
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:01,780
If you can't,

152
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,260
you can leave now.

153
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,290
Sheath your claws.

154
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,250
I'll let it slide once.

155
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,260
There won't be a second time.

156
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,400
This place is yours now.

157
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,210
I'll come by regularly.

158
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,310
[Xiang]

159
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,190
Lin Juan and I are ready.

160
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,160
We are leaving for Sunset Creek Town the day after tomorrow.

161
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,350
Nongyu is going with you.

162
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,750
Be careful out there.

163
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You must keep her safe.

164
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,950
Why bring her all of a sudden?

165
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,250
She cares about Xie Xinxu more than I thought.

166
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,120
If she doesn't see his disappearance for herself,

167
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,750
she won't let it go.

168
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,910
I understand.

169
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:30,870
Coming by tonight?

170
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,280
If you don't suppress the virus these days,

171
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,570
you'll get hurt easily.

172
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,500
It's swollen.

173
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,480
An Yin bonded to a Ren

174
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,150
should be physically stronger.

175
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,410
There's no way she'd be weaker than before.

176
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,660
I'll come tomorrow. That's it.

177
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,030
Siyuan.

178
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,220
Why are you here?

179
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,280
What happened to your arm?

180
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,120
Nothing. I bumped it yesterday.

181
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,660
You've always been

182
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,660
a bad liar, since we were kids.

183
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,330
Don't tell me

184
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,910
you never formed a pact with Xie Xinxu,

185
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,110
and that's why you're this fragile.

186
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,220
I...

187
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,570
Then I can tell you right now

188
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,290
the real reason Xie Xinxu got close to you.

189
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,290
What you did to Nongyu,

190
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,370
