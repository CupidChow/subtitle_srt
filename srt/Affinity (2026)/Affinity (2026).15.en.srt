1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,910
We just received a batch of good stuff.

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,280
I heard it can cause

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,000
a Ren's viral load to surge.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,500
Wouldn't that help Lin Juan and Li Xiang

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,430
get their strength back too?

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,250
Alright.

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,200
Then let's keep moving.

8
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,270
Xu.

9
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,190
I just spent a huge amount of money

10
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,200
stocking up on new detonators and guns.

11
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,120
Detonators?

12
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,210
They can be useful.

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,120
I still need to pick a good gun.

14
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,000
So I can shoot straight.

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,080
Xu.

16
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,080
Why don’t you take her inside to pick one?

17
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,870
If she likes it, she can have it.

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,960
I'll wait outside.

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,580
Alright.

20
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:05,460
Let's go.

21
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,120
Keep the drug vault under close watch in the coming days.

22
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:17,790
Mr. Mai.

23
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,250
When did we get those virus boosters?

24
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,580
This is the final test for Xu.

25
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,040
If he

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,670
or that woman comes to steal the drugs,

27
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,170
that proves they're still onto something

28
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,170
deep inside.

29
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,250
Pick one.

30
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,120
Found it. Detonators.

31
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,040
I'm unfamiliar with weapons.

32
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,250
Help me choose.

33
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,420
I'll go look for magazines.

34
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,460
Alright.

35
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,580
These should be enough.

36
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:38,830
What are you doing?

37
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,330
I've found the magazines.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,650
How about this one?

39
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,610
It's fairly lightweight.

40
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,540
Give it a try.

41
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,060
Doesn't feel that good, honestly.

42
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,710
It seems your taste in weapons isn't that great.

43
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,330
Forget it.

44
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,250
We'll just make do.

45
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,580
Let's go.

46
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,620
What's wrong with your foot?

47
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,330
Let me take a look.

48
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,670
I don't like anyone else touching my things,

49
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,370
including you.

50
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,750
Her leg's like that because she didn't behave last night.

51
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,770
I used too much force

52
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,580
and ended up hurting her.

53
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,500
Let's go.

54
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,170
Xu actually referred to you as "anyone else".

55
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,420
Mind your own business.

56
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,290
Keep your eyes on the drug vault and the holding area.

57
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,710
If Xu really turns his back on our ideals,

58
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,920
then we can't keep walking the same path.

59
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,870
I'm full.

60
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,790
Then let's start training.

61
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,580
Wu Nongyu.

62
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,000
I suggest you choose Lin Juan as the target.

63
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,220
Go ahead. Shoot.

64
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,170
I won't blame you if you hit me.

65
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,870
Your waist is too loose.

66
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,580
Tighten your core.

67
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,370
Straighten your arms.

68
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,750
Your eye, the front sight, and the rear sight

69
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,920
need to line up.

70
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,460
Your stance looks good now.

71
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,460
Pull the trigger.

72
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,960
You're the worst student I've ever taught.

73
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,210
We'll do this tomorrow.

74
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,310
You're not fit to be a teacher.

75
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,060
You disgrace the role.

76
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,580
Tomorrow is the last day Max gave us.

77
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,990
I have to act tonight.

78
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,670
What's wrong?

79
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,170
There's something outside the window!

80
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,470
Looks like it's nothing serious.

81
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,330
Just lie here.

82
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,960
We were never on the same road anyway.

83
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,040
This time,

84
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,500
it's probably a real goodbye.
(Watch on www,kisskh,la or www,kisskh,id to support Admin)

85
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:15,950
Come back.

86
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,470
Don't alert her.

87
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,770
Have the guys guarding the drug vault hide nearby.

88
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,080
Let Wu Nongyu in.

89
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,790
Once she's inside,

90
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,250
do whatever you want.

91
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,560
Just don't kill her.

92
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,960
Wu Nongyu.

93
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,460
You're only good for being Xu's supply.

94
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,370
Boss.

95
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,870
We haven't seen Wu Nongyu at all.

96
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,830
Everyone stay patient.

97
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,960
Keep your eyes wide open.

98
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,000
That stupid woman probably still can't find her way.

99
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,710
That noise... did the drug vault just collapse?

100
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,170
Oh, no!

101
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,750
The inhibitors!

102
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,050
They probably tried to grab the inhibitors in the chaos

103
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,080
and things turned violent.

104
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,250
Then they went berserk.

105
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,170
From now on,

106
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,580
keep all your guns loaded.

107
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,290
Roger!

108
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,290
Don't force it,

109
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,210
you could go berserk.

110
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,420
Boss, several of the guys outside have gone berserk.

111
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,540
A few others think the inhibitor are gone,

112
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,670
and they've already started making trouble.

113
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,870
He's a bit of a disgrace,

114
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,290
but you can't fault his approach.

115
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:12,420
