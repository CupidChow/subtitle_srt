1
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,000
I heard

2
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,250
you tried to run again yesterday.

3
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,000
So I had to punish you.

4
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:51,690
Remember.

5
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,460
You are something I created.

6
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,730
You will never escape me in this life.

7
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,500
If you behave,

8
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,120
I'll take good care of you.

9
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:31,120
Your combat data and fitness tests last week

10
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,250
showed clear improvement.

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,740
Seems

12
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,160
you deserve a reward.

13
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,800
No need.

14
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,300
When we meet again,

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,670
I'll give you a real surprise.

16
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,790
Xie

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,660
Xin

18
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,350
Xu.

19
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,600
Weren't you dead?

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,200
This...

21
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,500
You explain it.

22
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:26,430
Back then,

23
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,470
the Special Administration Bureau ignored my wishes

24
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,040
and forced me into a secret experiment.

25
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,250
I barely escaped.

26
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,240
After that,

27
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,040
I found myself declared dead.

28
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,130
I would've thought the Special Administration Bureau knew this better than me.

29
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:48,870
So I'll trouble...

30
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,830
you, Siyuan.

31
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,560
I'll look into this

32
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,370
once I'm back.

33
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,200
The Special Administration Bureau tolerates no illegal acts.

34
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,660
What I'm more curious about

35
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,500
is how you two met at Seger Center

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,910
and fell in love.

37
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,040
It was surviving together.

38
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,660
Without Xie Xinxu at Genus,

39
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,750
I'd be dead many times over.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,750
So you two got together back when you

41
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,620
were at Genus.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,760
But I fell for Wu Nongyu instantly.

43
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,370
The moment I first saw you,

44
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,790
I had

45
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,370
this evil little thought.

46
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,130
In this life,

47
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,570
you will never leave my side.

48
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,200
In this life, you will never leave my side.

49
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,000
Siyuan, don't worry.

50
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,910
I will

51
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,410
take good care of you.

52
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,620
If you behave,

53
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,410
I'll take good care of you.

54
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,160
Siyuan, are you okay?

55
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,430
Were the chopsticks too slippery?

56
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,500
A little.

57
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,120
I know Nongyu.

58
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,500
You're not her type.

59
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,730
Is that so?

60
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,790
But

61
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,450
I'm the one Nongyu chose.

62
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,930
Look.

63
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,120
Your knees listen better than your mouth.

64
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,390
Don't be so resentful.

65
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,290
You'll never overcome

66
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,350
what I carved into your bones myself.

67
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,370
So,

68
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,120
were you angry just now?

69
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,410
Figures.

70
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,290
After all, Nongyu is very attached to me now.

71
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,410
All I have to do is wave,

72
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,000
and she'll come running.

73
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,000
Nongyu.

74
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,700
Coming.

75
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,910
Help me roll up my sleeves.

76
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,030
- Oh. - No need.

77
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:47,490
I've got it.

78
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,040
Siyuan, your hands are all wet.

79
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:55,670
Alright.

80
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,070
You two finish the dishes.

81
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,040
Thanks.

82
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,620
You're welcome.

83
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,660
Whatever you're after,

84
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,290
come at me.

85
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,250
Don't drag Nongyu into this.

86
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,620
I truly love Nongyu.

87
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,160
I want to be family with her for life.

88
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,750
No matter what you want,

89
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:18,790
stay away from Nongyu.

90
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,370
Money,

91
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,370
status,

92
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,120
or a lifelong supply of inhibitors.

93
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,040
Name it,

94
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,000
and I'll give it to you.

95
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,370
That won't do.

96
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,750
After all, Nongyu and I have formed a pact.

97
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,000
Intimate relations is part of it.

98
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:34,080
And I need to stay healthy.

99
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,660
Nongyu still needs me to suppress the virus in her body.

100
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,110
You tell me.

101
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,600
Siyuan?

102
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,430
Since

103
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:54,690
you've just formed a pact,

104
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,230
the virus in your bodies shouldn't go berserk so easily.

105
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,430
Then being apart for a short time

106
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,490
shouldn't be much of an issue.

107
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,020
Nongyu,

108
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,230
let me tell you some good news.

109
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,750
The Bureau recently freed up a position.

110
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,120
Five hundred thousand a year,

111
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,370
full benefits, weekends off.

112
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,540
I was thinking

113
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,230
your husband could fill this position.

114
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,200
Siyuan.

115
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,720
Why wouldn't you give your own sister a shot first?

116
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,360
Sit properly.

117
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,580
But,

118
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,660
after your husband finishes on boarding next week,

119
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,230
he'll be sent to Sunset Creek Town on assignment.

120
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,620
Right on the border.

121
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,290
What's he going there for?

122
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,370
Just last week,

123
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
the Bureau sent a team there on a mission.

124
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,120
They lost contact the moment they arrived.

125
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,290
There's been no word since.

126
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,910
That's unsettling.

127
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,910
Could it be

128
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,620
some place like the Bermuda Triangle?

129
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,660
Disappearances are indeed frequent in that area.

130
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,040
That's why the Bureau is offering high pay

131
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,910
to get someone in to investigate.

132
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,200
This mission won't be easy.

133
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,790
Can you handle it?

134
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,340
The Bureau really

135
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,180
has no one else to take this on.

136
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,790
I've been worrying myself sick over it.

137
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,660
Your capabilities are obvious to everyone.

138
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,120
You wouldn't turn down

139
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,750
such a small favor, would you?

140
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,870
Of course not.

141
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,960
Then come in tomorrow to handle onboarding.

142
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,710
I should head to work as well.

143
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,210
I'll walk you out, Siyuan.

144
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,120
You're exhausted after just washing dishes.

145
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,830
I'm seriously starting to think you planned all this

146
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:05,790
just to live off me.

147
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,630
You latch onto me

148
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,120
and suddenly your life's on easy mode.

149
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,620
Then as compensation,

150
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,870
I'll make sure to take good care of you tonight.

151
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,690
No need.

152
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,410
A simple working partnership is enough.

153
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,140
I've arranged for Xie Xinxu

154
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,910
to investigate the disappearance in Sunset Creek Town.

155
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,100
Take Lin Juan with you

156
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,410
and quietly escort him back.

157
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,000
Then stage it as
(Watch on www.kisskh,la or www.kisskh,id to support admin)

158
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,750
an accidental disappearance there.

159
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,450
Why not just kill him?

160
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,680
No.

161
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,620
He and Nongyu have already formed a pact.

162
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,490
I need him alive.

163
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,340
I need regular samples of his body fluids

164
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,250
to keep Nongyu's condition stable.

165
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,790
Understood.

166
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,370
Mr. Ding,

167
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,540
such a big incident just happened at the institute.

168
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,370
There's still a mess waiting to be cleaned up.

169
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,160
Can't you postpone this family visit a couple of days?

170
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,580
Mo,

171
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,120
with so many people here,

172
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,620
you're the most promising one.

173
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,660
You just lacked an opportunity before.

174
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,180
So with me leaving now,

175
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,670
you know what that means.

176
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,340
Don't worry, Mr. Ding.

177
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,910
I'll do my best.

178
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,120
Good.

179
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,870
Hello. Li Mo, right?

180
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,120
This is Hu Ji, the incoming director.

181
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,950
You've got the wrong institute?

182
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,080
We haven't been told about a director change.

183
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,120
You didn't get the notice?

184
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,040
Mr. Ding falsified his resume

185
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,330
and has been dismissed.

186
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,060
[Xu]

187
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,480
I'm on my way.

188
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,670
I'll be there in two hours.

189
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:56,140
[Lawson Convenience Store]

190
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,540
Did everything go smoothly?

191
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:09,510
Mr. Ding.

192
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,050
I finally understand now

193
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,170
what you told me back then.

194
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,290
If you don't want to die of pneumonia from a high fever,

195
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,630
drink the medicine.

196
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,580
I know you're a Ren who escaped the Special Administration Bureau.

197
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,410
I once was too.

198
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,410
After the side effects

199
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,500
left me crippled,

200
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,370
they discarded me.

201
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,660
Now I'm researching a cure to eliminate the virus.

202
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,870
Interested in joining me?

203
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,750
Working at this institute

204
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,970
[Genus Biological Research Lab]
will make it easier to obtain inhibitors.

205
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,120
[Recruitment Notice]
At the same time,

206
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,370
it also offers better conditions for drug research.

207
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,750
I'll find a way to get hired first,

208
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,250
then bring you in.

209
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,030
But

210
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,750
I want to find someone first,

211
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,620
and make a trip to the Special Administration Bureau

212
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:18,870
to settle some old scores.

213
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,790
I wouldn't advise you to

214
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,500
walk straight into the Special Administration Bureau right now.

215
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,000
Xu,

216
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,030
some paths look close at first,

217
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,410
but once you walk them,

218
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,220
they demand tremendous resolve,

219
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,500
and enough patience,

220
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,410
sometimes even a bit of luck.

221
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,630
You're right.

222
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,110
That road isn't as short as it seems,

223
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,010
because that man

224
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,620
has almost no weaknesses.

225
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,810
So I can only take a detour,

226
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,180
and go find Nongyu first.

227
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,710
Enduring the longing for her

228
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,620
has already reached its limit.

229
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,070
Then

230
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,790
luck suddenly favored me.

231
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,090
Nongyu

232
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,030
turned out to be that man's sister,

233
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,950
his greatest weakness.

234
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,160
That means

235
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,930
as long as I invest enough resolve and patience,

236
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:07,930
the reward I gain

237
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,750
will be doubled.

238
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,030
I'll have, in the worldly sense,

239
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,010
a life that can be called happiness.

240
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,600
And I'll keep Wu Siyuan

241
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,700
on edge every single moment.

242
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,080
Mr. Ding,

243
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,150
you didn't see today

244
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,520
how Wu Siyuan looked,

245
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,450
furious to the breaking point yet unable to touch me.

246
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,250
Such a shame you missed it.

247
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,280
So

248
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,080
Wu Siyuan was the one who imprisoned you?

249
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:40,970
Yes.

250
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:43,650
So

251
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,790
I hope I can successfully form a pact with Nongyu next,

252
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,080
then spend some time making her hate Wu Siyuan,

253
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,250
until she relies on me alone with her whole heart.

254
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,120
Wu Siyuan will live every day in fear.

255
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,870
In the end,

256
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,160
he will even be abandoned by his own sister.

257
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,700
There is no punishment more entertaining than that.

258
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,500
You and Nongyu have not formed a pact yet?

259
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:09,540
She has to stay with me for a lifetime.

260
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,290
I have to wait patiently until she truly falls in love with me.

261
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,040
Only then can I bind her completely.

262
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,870
But if you make a move against her brother,

263
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,160
how could she ever fall in love with you?

264
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,250
She will never know about this.

265
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,370
She is very perceptive.

266
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,870
If she cannot feel your love,

267
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,620
she will not give you her emotions.

268
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,120
I can't form a pact with you.

269
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:34,160
We don't truly like each other yet.

270
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,370
Personally, liking someone

271
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,120
is showing respect and understanding.

272
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,040
A relationship

273
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,330
where you can hand over your most cherished thing to the other person.

274
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,040
A relationship that you might never understand.

275
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,160
Mr. Ding,

276
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,870
is there any medication

277
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,180
that could let me experience emotions

278
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,790
like a normal person?

279
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,870
Pretending to be normal is not difficult for you.

280
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,750
As long as you invest more time and patience,

281
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,660
maybe you really can make her believe

282
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,500
that you have fallen in love with her.

283
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,620
I am genuinely curious

284
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,370
what real love and being loved

285
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,870
actually feel like.

286
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,750
Xie Xinxu.

287
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,700
Besides,

288
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,950
I have already found a very good test subject.

289
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,370
After meeting her,

290
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:40,000
it was as if a switch inside me had been flipped.

291
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,080
Every particle of my being

292
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,910
surged toward her

293
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,450
in a sudden blaze of heat.

294
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,620
That intensity often scorches her,

295
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,840
yet somehow never drives her away.

296
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,040
It took me some time to realize

297
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,870
that the thread

298
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,120
binding us so tightly wasn't something

299
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,910
I had stubbornly wound

300
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,290
around her palm.

301
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,410
From the beginning,

302
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,500
it had always been

303
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,830
her choosing to hold me gently.

304
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,950
Mr. Ding, you really know how to launch a surprise attack.

305
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,750
Was it more sudden than your wedding?

306
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,950
You had me rushing around

307
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,830
to prepare a wedding gift.

308
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,910
Wow, that is way too generous.
