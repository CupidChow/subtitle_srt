6
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:24,540
What a fool.

7
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,910
You surprised me just now.

8
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,620
I didn't expect you

9
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,250
to die together with me willingly.

10
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,660
That was just an accident.

11
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,830
Besides,

12
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,750
I crawled back

13
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,250
because I was worried

14
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,250
that you might haunt me in my dreams.

15

16
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,500
What was that just now?

17
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,500
An octopus?

18
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,500
It's so huge.

19
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,160
It probably mutated after contacting the Affinity B Virus.

20
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,040
Affinity Virus can also infect some animals.

21
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,620
However, the chances are low.

22
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,250
So, the Special Administration Bureau sent Ren

23
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,410
on missions

24
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,040
to exterminate mutated animals.

25
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,120
Is it because they will go berserk and hurt people?

26
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,040
Did it

27
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,540
go berserk just now?

28
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:17,870
Looking at its condition,

29
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,160
it didn't simply go berserk.

30
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:22,750
It feels more

31
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,910
like someone was manipulating it.

32
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,750
No way.

33
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,540
How can humans simply control the actions of animals?

34
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,370
Genus didn't just

35
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,290

00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,500

40
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,620
So,

41
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,080
is this an animal that has mutated after being infected

42
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,120
by the Affinity B Virus?

43
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:53,790
Yes.

44
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,750
It is the same type of virus inside a Ren.

45
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,370
So,

46
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,500
the superiors requested us to study

47
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,120
if the virus can be used

48
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,290
to establish a connection between them and a Ren's brain.

49
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,160
The goal

50
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,000
is to control them with the Ren's mind.

51
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,370
Was the experiment a success?

52
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,040
I'm not sure.

00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,620
I heard they picked a Ren

56
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,120
called Nan Xing.

57
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,160
He formed a connection with this animal.

58
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,910
So is this octopus controlled by Nan Xing?

59
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,040
Oh.

193
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,500
All the inhibitors were taken away by the group of Ren.

194
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Are you thinking about...

195
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,870
I'll search for one with him

196
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,910
while ensuring his safety.

197
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,290
No.

198
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,120
I can do it.

199
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,910
I must give it a try.

200
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,540
I'll give you an hour at most.

201
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,580
After an hour, the train will depart.

202
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,620
Gu Yanqing,

203
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,000
you want it, right?

204
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,500
I am an Yin.

205
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,660
I'm willing to relieve your pain.

206
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,290
Mr. Gu,

207
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,250
since the day I became your assistant,

208
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,370
I stopped falling for someone else.

209
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,790
I was worried that I couldn't be with you,

210
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,500
until I discovered

211
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,540
you are a Ren.

212
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,540
A Ren and an Yin make a perfect match.

213
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,700
Get lost!

214
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,620
If you don't form a pact with me today,

215
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,500
I'll tell everyone

216
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,620
that you are a Ren.

217
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:02,870
Do you think

218
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,040
everyone will rush here and kill you

219
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,870
when you're weak?

220
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,500
Let go!

221
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:44,910
Xie...

222
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,160
Mr. Gu.

223
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,250
I hate her smell.

He has gone berserk.

233
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,250
