1
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,560
Who did you get into a fight with this time?

2
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,230
How many times have I told you?

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,540
You are supposed to get along with your classmates.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,290
You are an adult now.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,290
Can you take better care of your body?

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,160
One hospital visit costs hundreds.

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,170
Noisy.

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,120
You're driving me crazy.

9
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,410
This was the only thing,

10
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:28,950
the very last thing,

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,000
I ever said to them

12
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,520
before what had happened to them.

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,700
Then you must really regret

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,250
not saying a proper goodbye to them.

15
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,500
Regret?

16
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:04,620
I used to.

17
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:06,750
But not anymore.

18
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,870
Because of you,

19
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,580
that night

20
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:16,610
became something different.

21
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,370
You could even call it

22
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,790
a happy ending.

23
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,120
So, there is nothing left to regret.

24
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,320
You can talk about "regret" and "happiness" now.

25
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,210
By the way,

26
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,500
can I ask

27
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,250
what happened to your mom afterward?

28
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,500
My mom never woke up.

29
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,340
As for my dad,

30
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,250
he was prosecuted for conducting illegal experiments.

31
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,120
He set a car on fire

32
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,500
and left this world with my mom.

33
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,460
So after my brother graduated from college,

34
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,080
he went to work for the Special Administration Bureau.

35
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,210
He believes Ren are people

36
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,250
who are deeply obsessive without normal emotions

37
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,830
and must be strictly controlled.

38
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,120
What about you?

39
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,080
You did not say anything about yourself.

40
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,960
Your arms were covered in needle marks from your dad.

41
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,920
Do you not resent him?

42
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,330
I would be lying if I said I did not.

43
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,040
Sometimes, I felt sad

44
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,710
and wondered

45
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,250
if my father even loved me

46
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,920
until I found

47
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,120
the real cause behind all that pain.

48
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,920
It was the Affinity virus.

49
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,670
My dad's obsession

50
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,000
was actually caused by the Affinity B virus.

51
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,000
That is why I majored in biological sciences in college.

52
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,250
Instead of tearing myself apart,

53
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,580
I might as well spend my time

54
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,000
trying to crack this virus.

55
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,120
Simply put, choose to love.

56
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,750
Choose to change things.

57
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,500
It is much happier and easier than hating.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,870
By the way,

59
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,370
I prepared a small gift for you today.

60
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,750
I might have dropped it on the way.

61
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,420
I will go look for it.

62
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,540
Wait here. I will be right back.

63
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,710
Hello, sir.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,170
Are you still taking the medication I gave you before?

65
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,440
Yes.

66
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,710
And it works much better than I expected.

67
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,790
I am experiencing feelings I never had before.

68
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,170
Mr. Ding?

69
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,790
I was going to tell you

70
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,630
that I grabbed the wrong thing when I made the prescription.

71
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,830
What I gave you

72
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,350
was just vitamins.

73
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,960
But if you are certain you are having new emotional experiences,

74
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,190
the only explanation is that you suddenly gained

75
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,510
normal emotional perception.

76
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,210
Understood.

77
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,170
Are these

78
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,000
my tears?

79
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,400
I had only ever seen them

80
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,020
on people I thought were soft.

81
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,180
I once believed they were a sign of weakness.

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,410
Until she appeared.

83
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,580
I started to envy her tears

84
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,000
and her wholeness.

85
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,480
Maybe when her virus entered my body,

86
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,530
it brought that wholeness with it.

87
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,790
Then what could be called a miracle of happiness

88
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,560
happened.

89
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,210
For someone who can love,

90

when facing the one they love,

91
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,370
what is the instinctive reaction?

92
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,250
Found it.

93
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,170
Luckily, I did not lose it.

Go take a hot shower.

97
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,610
So I made the first move just now?

98
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,930
This is such a mess.

99
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,900
I actually fell for someone with emotional deficiency.

100
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,000
But he really acts as if he likes me.

101
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,310
Maybe his condition got better.

[Emotion Emotional Supplement]

104

emotional states can be simulated.

105
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,120
Is he taking medicine that simulates emotions?

106
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,790
All the care and affection he's shown me during this time,

107
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,620
was it all just because of the medicine?

108
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,670
Did he take it to trick my feelings

109
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,070
so I would willingly form a pact?

110
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,970
If that is really the case,

111
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,340
I will cut things off completely.

You're not sick.

Would you be willing to sell it to us?

191
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,120
We can match the price, or go higher.

192
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,500
You managed to trace it back to me.

193
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,000
You're not ordinary.

194
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,040
I can give you the fragment for free.

195
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,580
But

196
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,370
you'll have to do me a favor.

197
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,550
This

198
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,670
is my friend's wife.

199
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,000
Her name is Qi.

200
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,080
She's very beautiful.

201
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,580
The two of them

202
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,540
started living apart

203
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:41,750
a few months ago.

204
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,000
Later, my friend noticed

205
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,580
that her recent photos

206
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,170
[Qi's post]
didn't look like selfies.

207
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,790
So my friend

208
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,580
suspects she's having an affair.
