1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,500
[PARKING]
I spoiled you previously.

2
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,160
From now on,

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,120
I will be the one

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,660
taking charge in our relationship.

5
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:21,410
It hurts.

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,370
Endure it.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,660
But it looks like your shoulder is hurting.

8
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,120
You fooled me,

9
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,500
and now you care?

10
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,750
Do you think I'll believe it?

11
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,870
I did abandon you just now

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,120
but it's also true that I care about you now.

13
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,790
It just looks like you

14
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,790
injected the inhibitor violently.

15
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,370
No matter how much you hate me and want me dead,

16
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,370
there's no need to harm yourself.

17
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,160
You'll be the only one getting hurt...

18
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,870
Then, don't run away next time.

19
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,410
I can't do it.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,750
Forming a pact

21
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,910
can only be done with two people who like each other.

22
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,250
So,

23
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,120
I must work harder

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,410
to make you fall for me.

25
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:58,790
Is that so?

26
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,120
This is not about working harder or not.

27
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,000
What you're feeling

28
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,000
is purely a Ren's desire to possess an Yin.

29
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,250
You're emotionally detached.

30
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,370
You might not fall in love with anyone in your life.

31
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,500
Might not?

32
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,160
That means

33
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,540
I might.

34
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,160
No.

35
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,790
I don't want to gamble.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,040
When you went berserk, even your parents were...

37
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,750
I did not.

38
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,500
Forget it.

39
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,290
Anyway,

40
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,290
personally, liking someone

41
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,370
is showing respect and understanding.

42
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,790
It is

43
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,540
a healthy relationship where you can

44
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,120
hand over

45
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,000
your most cherished thing to the other person.

46
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,750
A relationship

47
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,120
that you might never understand.

48
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,750
You really don't know how to choose your timing.

49
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,790
I'm dying.

50
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,750
I'm not in the mood to be a third wheel.

51
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,790
Give me your blood.

52
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,790
Why do you want my blood?

53
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,250
You haven't formed a pact with each other, right?

54
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,250
Then, your blood can still save me.

55
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,870
Hurry.

56
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,790
Otherwise, I'll rip both of you apart

57
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,620
when I go completely berserk later.

58
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,000
How scary.

59
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,250
Let's go.

60
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,370
We should escape now.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The people of the Special Administration Bureau

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,750
treated me as a weapon in the beginning.

63
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,910
Later, they sent me here to become a lab rat

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,660
when they felt I was about to outlive my usefulness.

65
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,250
The experimental equipment caused me so much pain every day.

66
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,250
I'm scared of that feeling.

67
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,370
He passed out.

68
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,250
Resuscitate him immediately.

69
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,330
It's too late.

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,910
If kept alive,

71
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,040
these people will become scums who endanger our society.

72
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,250
They should feel honored to be able to contribute

73
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,370
to the scientific development of inhibitors.

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,910
Let's continue the experiment.

75
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:23,660
No!

76
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,580
No!

77
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,660
I beg you!

78
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,080
Please let go of me!

79
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,620
I don't want to die!

80
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,500
I don't want to die!

81
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,790
I just don't want to die.

82
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,540
Don't abandon me here.

83
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,290
Your words are useless.

84
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:54,410
Let's go.

85
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:01,910
Please.

86
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,450
Save me.

87
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,040
Give me your blood.

88
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,500
Are you all right?

89
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,500
You are so annoying!

90
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,750
You ruin my plan all the time.

91
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,000
So it was

92
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,870
all an act?

93
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,160
As expected, it's no use

94
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,750
pleading to an Yin like you.

95
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,500
Gu,

96
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,870
what are you doing?

97
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,790
Gu,

98
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,040
what are you doing?

99
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,040
Listen.

100
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,910
All the Yin are bad.

101
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,250
They are just like those in Administration Bureau uniforms.

102
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,790
They treat you like an animal!

103
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,830
People from the Special Administration Bureau will arrive soon.

104
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,500
Try saying the same thing

105
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,000
to them.

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,450
Let's go.

107
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,870
You're despicable.

108
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,370
I won't let them torture me to death.

109
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,370
I'll also make them feel pain.

110
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,250
I obtained something good.

111
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,870
It will significantly weaken

112
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,290
our vitals

113
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,120
for a certain period.

114
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,000
Those foolish researchers

115
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,750
will surely assume

116
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,160
we died from taking

117
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,950
their new inhibitors.

118
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,410
The truth is,

119
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,870
we are fine.

120
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,910
When we wake up,

121
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,620
I'm going to kill all of them.

122
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,790
I want to eat a candy.

123
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,620
You'll get a toothache.

124
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,250
Eating it makes me happier.

125
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,870
I want it.

126
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,910
In the future,

127
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,080
this place will only be full of

128
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,120
free, happy, and united

129
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,660
Ren and Yin.

130
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,810
[Security]

131
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,250
Did you regret treating me like that just now?

132
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,500
I can't empathize with you.

133
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,160
If you just wanted to escape alive,

134
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,000
why killed so many people?

135
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,000
Everyone feels pain,

136
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,250
not just you.

137
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,040
Also, not everyone

138
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,540
will turn a blind eye

139
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,750
to the pain you feel.

140
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,410
Good job.

141
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,160
Troublesome society scums like him

142
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,790
should be eliminated.

143
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,120
All right.

144
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,250
Let's split up and find Nongyu.

145
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,910
You seem very disappointed. What's wrong?

146
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,250
I'm wondering

147
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,790
if you're plotting something evil again.

148
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,000
Yes.

149
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,660
I am.

150
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,910
I'm racking my brain

151
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,660
to find a way

152
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,120
to slowly

153
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:36,750
and

154
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,790
gradually

155
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,500
tame

156
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,620
a disobedient prey

157
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,660
before eating it.

158
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,000
I'll think about

159
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,370
what you told me just now.

160
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,580
Nongyu!

161
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,330
I...

162
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:02,700
Nongyu!

163
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,870
That's my brother.

164
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:06,500
Remember.

165
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,500
Hide the existence of Xie Xinxu.

166
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,660
After all, I get agitated easily by the people

167
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,870
of the Special Administration Bureau.

168
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,000
If I go berserk and hurt them,

169
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,620
that'll be your fault.

170
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,410
I...

171
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,910
You are free.

172
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,000
Did I really just get rid of him like that?

173
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,870
Siyuan.

174
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,500
Where were you just now?

175
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Don't bark at me.

176
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,250
I've been

177
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,000
running all night to flee from a bunch of lunatics.

178
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,390
[Affinity]

179
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,250
So, did Mr. Ding

180
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,250
tell you everything about Ren and Yin?

181
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,870
As well as Nan Xing?

182
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,040
Stop.

183
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,660
Can you let me get some sleep before we discuss this?

184
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,370
That was scary.

185
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,370
Didn't you say you'd spare me?

186
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,750
I'm taking it back now.

187
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,450
You can't escape from me.

188
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,410
So he didn't appear in my nightmare,

189
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,620
but rather in a wet...

190
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,410
Are we having soup today?

191
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,500
Even the thunder couldn't wake you up,

192
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,660
yet you smelled soup and woke up on your own.

193
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,160
Another day of living happily

194
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,370
and waking up to good food.

195
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:43,660
Siyuan.

196
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,250
Tell me.

197
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,000
Compared to the Ren,

198
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,160
we are considered fortunate

199
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,620
to be Yin.

200
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,910
We don't lose our freedom.

201
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,870
We won't be treated as living weapons

202
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,370
or become test subjects.

203
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,500
Who told you that?

204
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,620
You are shocked too, right?

205
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
The superiors of the Special Administration Bureau did this in secret.

206
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,290
Of course, they are hiding it from everyone else.

207
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I heard it from a Ren.

208
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,000
Not everything he said

209
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,500
is true.

210
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,500
The higher-ups

211
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,250
will have a thorough investigation regarding Genus.

212
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,120
Oh,

213
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,910
do you dream about Xie Xinxu a lot?

214
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,250
Your burning question burns just like your soup.

215
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,000
Do you always dream of him

216
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,250
because you find him scary subconsciously?

217
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,120
If I tell you

218
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,870
that there's a high chance that he didn't kill his parents,

219
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,870
will it reduce your fear a little?

220
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,410
The police did not find evidence of his murder back then.

221
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,540
Later, he died from an illness.

222
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,160
No new clues were discovered

223
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,000
so the case was closed.

224
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,200
Does it mean

225
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,160
he is not dangerous to society?

226
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,250
Keeping his existence a secret should be...

227
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,290
I also have a better way

228
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:09,910
of removing your fear.

229
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,290
What is it?

230
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:12,370
Marriage.

231
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,370
Then, you won't have time to think about another man.

232
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,750
Wu Siyuan!

233
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,290

Isn't this the stadium?

240
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:42,000
There's an official blind dating event here tomorrow.

241
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,870
It's specifically for Yin and Ren.

242
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,750
Mr. Ding probably told you about the pact, right?

243
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,540
The government

244

is very supportive of this endeavor.

245
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,910
Hold on.

246
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,870
I'm a little confused now.

247
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,870
You mean
