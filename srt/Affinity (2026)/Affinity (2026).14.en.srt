1
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,000
What happened?

2
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,160
Lin Juan passed us a message through the food.

3
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,210
They prepared a car for us.

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,590
But

5
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,520
I don't know if they prepared it well.

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,460
If we get caught trying to run away,

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,160
given Mr. Mai's state of mind today...

8
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,700
We still have to give it a try.

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,080
We'll deal with it as it comes.

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,330
Miss Wu has upset her stomach.

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:48,830
She's been vomiting badly

12
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:49,620
and needs to go to the hospital.

13
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:51,560
This is really my fault.

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,520
Prepare a car and get us a wheelchair.

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,080
Alright.

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,700
Thank you for the trouble.

17
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,260
Allow me.

18
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,340
To make it up to you.

19
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:00,750
Please hold on.

20
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,330
This elevator

21
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,440
has been having some minor issues lately.

22
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,580
It can only carry two people at a time.

23
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,620
Any more and it will be overloaded.

24
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,230
Put it down!

25
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,950
Who do you think you are?

26
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:20,950
He's on our side!

27
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,250
Xu.

28
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,620
I suggest you take my advice this time.

29
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,590
You're really a handful.

30
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,340
Getting sick whenever you please

31
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,330
and making Xu worry about you.

32
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:14,800
I...

33
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,200
Hey...

34
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,870
I hate being like this myself.

35
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,250
From now on, I'll...

36
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,750
From now on, I'll make sure to exercise more.

37
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,500
Strengthen my immunity.

38
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,950
Once you really start exercising,

39
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,410
getting hurt now and then is unavoidable.

40
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,620
And that means Xu will have to spend even more energy on you.

41
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,870
That makes me unhappy.

42
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,910
The truth is, Xie Xinxu and I are only bound together

43
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,870
because of the virus.

44
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,250
I don't click with him like you do.

45
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,250
So from now on, except during the stabilization period,

46
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,120
I'll cut off contact with him.

47
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,500
Madam.

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
When you get back from the hospital,

49
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,870
remember, we had a deal.

50
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,040
Take good care of Xu and Miss Wu for me.

51
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,160
Everything's taken care of.

52
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,660
What happens next is up to Xu.

53
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,000
Let go of me.

54
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,330
Your database isn't up to date.

55
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,660
My mom died of illness last month.

56
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,160
I just played along for your act,

57
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,540
and helped Mr. Mai set up a trap for you.

58
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,700
Such a devoted son you are.

59
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:37,580
Move.

60
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,790
Behave yourself.

61
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,370
Why?

62
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,000
Because of you.

63
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,250
How is that my problem?

64
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,310
Because you want the fragments.

65
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,400
Xu.

66
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,040
The guys who badmouthed you

67
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,490
have all been removed from the roster.

68
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,120
I guarantee everyone who's left now

69
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,640
will be just like me,

70
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:59,720
fully on your side.

71
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,080
If everyone were like you,

72
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,080
then I wouldn't need anyone at all.

73
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,120
What do you mean?

74
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,870
To bring in talent

75
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,120
and expand the company,

76
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,250
I worked nonstop on materials and promotion,

77
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,120
just to build the Xuyan Trading you see today.

78
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,540
To track your whereabouts these years,

79
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,410
I personally had my people investigate

80
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,040
every stranger who came in or out of town.

81
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,210
Then have you ever seen

82
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,330
someone carrying a glass hard drive?

83
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,230
Xu.

84
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,000
Why are you looking for this person?

85
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,830
You don't need to know.

86
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,450
Then I can't tell you right now.

87
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,160
I've reported Mr. Mai

88
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,410
about your escape plan.

89
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,790
Mr. Mai is very disappointed

90
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,250
that you joined the Special Administration Bureau,

91
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,120
but

92
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,540
he's willing to give you a chance to switch sides.

93
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,410
He'll even give you the information you want.

94
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,540
Lin Juan and Li Xiang

95
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,120
are the Special Administration Bureau's

96
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,500
top fighters.

97
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,120
Mr. Mai wants you to recruit them.

98
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,000
These two inhibitors,

99
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,120
contain the same thing you drank

100
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,830
at the tavern yesterday.

101
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:23,810
But you still can't...

102
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,230
Xu, are you done?

103
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,370
Xu.

104
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,160
Nicely done.

105
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,660
Give me the info.

106
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,660
The person you're looking for was last seen

107
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,830
three kilometers west of the company, in Sunset Forest.

108
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,160
Hello, Xu.

109
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,080
I knew it.

110
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,290
Xu, you must've been talked into it

111
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,200
by those people at the Special Administration Bureau,

112
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,250
that's why you signed away your freedom.

113
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:17,870
Terminate it.

114
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,250
How much is the termination fee?

115
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,160
Xuyan will cover it.

116
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,200
I don't understand what you're saying.

117
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,290
What?

118
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,640
They didn't even sign a contract with you?

119
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,580
Bleeding you dry right out in the open.

120
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,290
So you all

121
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,610
are being exploited by them too.

122
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,580
I've actually had high hopes for you.

123
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,870
As long as you're willing

124
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,910
to grow Xuyan with me,

125
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,490
I guarantee your treatment
(Watch on www,kisskh,la or www,kisskh,id to support Admin)

126
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,570
second only to Xu.

127
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,120
Above everyone else.

128
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,370
You're Max, right?

129
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,970
Still needs taming.

130
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,580
It's fine.

131
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,800
I can give you time.

132
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,330
Why not think it over again?

133
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:10,890
Five.

134
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,330
Four, three, two, one.

135
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,040
Alright.

136
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,370
Then there's no need to keep discussing this.

137
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,830
As for you,

138
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,830
attempted escape

139
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,660
would normally get you killed.

140
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:32,870
But if that happens,

141
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:33,910
Xu would be done for.

142
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,540
So I'll reluctantly

143
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,410
give you one more chance.

144
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,280
Kill them.

145
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,250
Mr. Mai.

146
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,690
I don't know how to shoot.

147
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,500
You're putting me in a very difficult position.

148
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:15,990
I'll teach you.

149
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,640
Sorry about that.

150
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,200
She's not good at this.

151
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,950
Needs more practice.

152
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,230
In that case,

153
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,120
I'll give her two more days.

154
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,450
That should be enough, right?

155
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,260
You've had a long day.

156
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,790
Let's go.

157
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,200
We'll head back and unwind.

158
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,350
That woman

159
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,130
is the biggest stumbling block in Xu's path.

160
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,540
Go shower first.

161
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,730
Don't touch me.

162
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,870
You want the glass fragments too, don't you?

163
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,770
Our goals are the same.

164
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,090
Since you know we're after the same thing,

165
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,550
then why

166
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,620
didn't you tell me your plan?

167
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,210
Because you know

168
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,380
I would never trade Lin Juan and Li Xiang for information.

169
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,770
You know that perfectly well.

170
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,290
We're not on the same side after all.

171
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,120
That's right.

172
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,370
You want to achieve your goals

173
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,830
but you're afraid of getting your hands dirty.

174
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,620
People who see themselves as righteous

175
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,450
always want everything both ways.

176
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,690
Yes.

177
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,760
I do want both.

178
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,330
Because I can't stop thinking

179
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,080
about this.

180
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,450
If someone can use his own teammates as tools,

181
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,950
how can I be sure he won't do

182
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,460
the same to me someday?

183
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,740
Xie Xinxu.

184
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,070
You may be able to ignore other people's lives,

185
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,200
but I can't.

186
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,350
But at the very least, I truly care about you, and I respect you.

187
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,540
Isn't that true?

188
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,220
Before a cat devours a mouse,

189
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,090
it toys with it first.

190
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,450
All these games you play...

191
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,890
Isn't it simply because you want to form a pact with me?

192
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,790
So this is what you really think of me.

193
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,410
If I had known it would come to this,

194
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,720
when I was choosing a pact partner back then,

195
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,120
I should have chosen Lin Juan.

196
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:47,890
I know.

197
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,370
What you just said was only meant to hurt me.

198
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,450
Stop pretending.

199
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,460
Let's skip the middle part.

200
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,090
Go straight to the end.

201
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,070
Isn't forming a pact what you want?

202
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,080
Come on.

203
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,210
I'm giving you the chance to form a pact.

204
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,490
Fine.

205
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,640
Your words, not mine.

206
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,110
Didn't you say you wanted to form a pact with me?

207
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,370
Then come on.

208
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:32,870
Now.

209
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,330
Kiss me.

210
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,290
Come on!

211
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,370
I'll give you one last chance.

212
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,080
Take back what you said

213
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,670
about choosing Lin Juan.

214
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,500
Don't even think about it.

215
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,710
I don't feel like forming a pact with you now.

216
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,720
Go sleep on the couch.

217
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,250
You decide when it starts,

218
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,650
and you decide when it ends?

219
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,040
You think you get to decide this?

220
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,670
Did you forget?

221
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,510
Your tears only make me more excited.

222
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,150
Stop acting so tough.

223
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,140
Because I can't stop thinking about this.

224
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,290
If someone can use his own teammates as tools,

225
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,710
how can I be sure he won't do

226
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,290
the same to me someday?

227
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:47,750
You're awake.

228
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,620
If you're hungry,

229
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,460
go wash up first.

230
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,180
Why are your eyes so swollen?

231
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,500
And those dark circles.

232
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,080
Is it all the dirty work you've done,

233
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,210
haunting your dreams,

234
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,420
keeping you up all night?

235
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,620
May I help you?

236
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,830
Xu.

237
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,870
I wanted to show you around the company.

238
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:24,620
After all,

239
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,870
a lot of decisions will need you to make going forward.

240
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,310
Sure.

241
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,640
Perfect timing.

242
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,870
I can take you out for some air too.

243
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,790
We use these tunnels to transport key supplies and equipment.

244
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,790
You know, some things

245
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,040
just can't be brought in openly.

246
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:54,740
This way.

247
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,500
Up here

248
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,250
is where we store inhibitors and other drugs.

249
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,620
We just received a batch of good stuff.

250
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,250
I heard it can cause

251
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,790
a Ren's viral load to surge.

252
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,710
Xu, want to take a shot?

253
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,000
It could restore your combat strength,

254
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,790
and who knows,

255
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,870
it might even make you stronger.

256
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,000
Not interested.

257
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,080
Wouldn't that help Lin Juan and Li Xiang

258
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,750
get their strength back too?
