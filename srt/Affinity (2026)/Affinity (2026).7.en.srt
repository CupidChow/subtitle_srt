[Affinity]

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,910
Sorry.

3
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,250
The intensity of the kiss

4
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,290
just now

5
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,870
isn't enough to form a pact, right?

6
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,160
The viral load in the saliva is low.

7
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,120
It can only suppress the condition for a short while.

8
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,040
So,

9
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,870
before we find an inhibitor,

10
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,500
I'll have to trouble you

11
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,410
to calm me down multiple times.

12
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,500
Let's search for the inhibitors at Block A.

13
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,540
Let's disguise as Ren and sneak inside to get the inhibitor.

14
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,750
No.

15
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,250
I've met some of the Ren before.

16
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,120
This is a dangerous strategy.

17
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,660
Go first.

18
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,500
I'll go alone.

19
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,620
We just need to avoid those we've met before.

20
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,250
Don't worry.

21
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,040
I remember that every Ren

22
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,500
has a bracelet with their name carved on it.

23
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,620
I remember the names of every Ren

24
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,750
we met.

25
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,540
Before we get the inhibitor,

26
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,620
you mustn't do anything...

27
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,750
The perfume works well.

28
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,120
It hides the smell of blood.

29
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,290
Everyone!

30
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,000
You've done well tonight!

31
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,750
We must give out some rewards!

32
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,250
Work harder later

33
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,910
and find the remaining rats!

36
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,910
Quick, check on those bracelets.

- Kill them all! - Kill them all!

38
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,620
Hurry.

39
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:20,620
- Kill them all! - Kill them all!

40
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,250
It's safe. We'll go this way.

41
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,290
We used half a bottle of perfume.

42
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:53,120
I'm sure it can hide the smell of the wound.

43
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,620
Dude!

44
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,750
When did you last shower?

45
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,450
You stink.

46
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,750
You. Move forward.

47
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,330
Take it.

48
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:43,910
Hurry.

49
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:48,790
Here you go.

50
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,080
All right.

51
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:55,830
Here. Take it.

52
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,000
These two people look familiar.

53
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,120
Sorry.

[Genus]

55
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,120
It smells like an Yin.

56
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,620
Let's go.

57
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,330
Come with me!

58
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,410
I hear some noise in the garage.

[PARKING]

60
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,620
It hasn't even been that long

61
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,370
and they have disappeared already?

62
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,660
I'm sure they are hiding somewhere.

63
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,080
Let's search every car.

64
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,120
No need for the hassle.

65
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,790
Even if they are hiding here, I'm sure they are dead.

66
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:23,790
Let's go.

67
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,370
We'll search somewhere else.

68
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:25,870
Let's go.

69
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,080
All right.

70
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,290
They are gone.

71
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,660
You've been shot.

72
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,790
It's just a scratch.

73
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,290
I like the look on your face when you are worried about me.

74
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,830
I feel awful.

75
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,870
Help me

76
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,040
inject the inhibitor.

77
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,160
I'll go and close the door.

78
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,790
Go.

79
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,000
After all, what will happen soon

80
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,750
can be quite intimate.

81
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,250
After injecting the inhibitor,

82
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,620
you'll recover completely.

83
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,500
Thank you for saving me.

84
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,410
We are even now.

85
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,370
There's not much time left. I must rush back to Block B.

86
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,000
Miss,

87
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,200
I've been waiting for you for so long.

88
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,120
Why are you alone?

89
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,250
Where are the others?

90
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,250
Oh, I see.

91
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,870
You are going to find them, right?

92
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,370
Why don't you bring us along?

93
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,620
It's the people from the Special Administration Bureau.

94
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Blow up the crane

95
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,500
and crush those scums!

96
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,250
Kill everyone

00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,870
besides Nongyu.

Siyuan!

110
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,500
Find Nongyu.

111
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,040
Got it.

112
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:09,290
Help...

113
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,410
Don't ever think that you can run away from me.

114
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,080
You...

115
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,870
You are burning up.

116
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,250
Because I encountered

117
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,620
some trouble

118
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,620
when I was looking for you.

119
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,160
Open it. Quickly.

120
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,120
If you hadn't abandoned me,

121
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,950
things would have been less complicated.

122
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,370
Suppressing myself

123
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,120
and waiting patiently,

124
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,540
I've been doing that for so long that I'm good at it now.

125
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,370
Siyuan!

126
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,620
So, in the short period when we were separated,

127
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,120
I came to one conclusion.

128
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,750
You don't get to decide on our relationship.

129
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,410
You are a heartless little liar.

130
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,580
I spoiled you previously.

131
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,250
From now on,

132
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,870
I will be the one

133
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,870
taking charge in our relationship.
