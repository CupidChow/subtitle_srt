You head to the satellite signal station.

00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,540

83
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,540

I have to escape.

94
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,800
The rope is too short.

95
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,500
Or should I jump?

96
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,000
Too risky.

97
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,290
If I get hurt,

98
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,830
it will draw the Ren.

99
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,040
I can only try the platform across from here.

100
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,620
Are you mad?

101
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,830
I need inhibitors to deal with those Ren.

102
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,940
If you stay nearby,

103
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,870

And besides,

105
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,870
you hit my shoulder when you opened that cabinet.

106
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,870
I did not even get angry.

107
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,310
You really are

108
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,560

109
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,140
So the mark on his shoulder was from that.

110
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,120
And he was just complaining that I slowed him down.

you were down there the whole time,

117
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,290
quietly watching me

118
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,160
climb the rope?

119
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,540
You looked so focused,

120
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,750
I did not want to interrupt.

121
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,290

123
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,410
Do you have to look so disgusted?

124
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,900
In this weather,

125
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:44,840

128
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,120
They kept rushing us to wait by the nearest elevator,

129
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,620
and this broken thing still is not fixed.

130
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,710
Are they expecting us to take the stairs?

131
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,620
Leaders are always like this.

132
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,750
They are not the ones climbing.

133
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,200
Exactly.

134
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,500
I'll draw them away.

135
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,870
Use the key and get back to the dorm area.

136
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,410
I'll shake them off and find you.

137
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,620
I still have a few inhibitors.

138
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,870

139
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,830
