My brother must have done something to my bedtime milk last night.

I slept so deeply.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Mr. Wu asked me to go with you

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,520
and see you through the whole event.

12
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:08,870
Well, since you're already here.

13
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:10,040

Senior?

18
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,790
Didn't you form a pact with Mr. Gu?

19
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,970
Last time,

20
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,560
I even turned off the lights for you two.

21
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:24,790
So it wouldn't kill the mood.

22
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:28,560
What an eyesore.

23
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,410
Well, thanks a lot.

24
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,290
The fact you're here

25
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,750
means you never formed a pact with Mr. Gu, right?

26
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,160
I still have half a year before I turn twenty-five.

27

You'd better be smart.

00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,370

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,370
It's fine.

So what?

42
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,120
One would be sentenced to death if they failed to get married by twenty-five?

43
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,370
You really don't know?

44
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,040
Once an Yin reaches twenty-five, they must form a pact with a Ren.

45
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,000

Alright.

53

Then I'll send a squad over.

54

I'll head to the Genus to wrap things up.

When an Yin turns twenty-five, the virus erupts.

Only a Ren's virus can suppress it.

59
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:31,500
You knew all along,

60
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:31,870
didn't you?

61

00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,500
I would handle the trouble myself.

64
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,750
So your solution was

65
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,370
to pick a Ren I barely know,

66
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,540
then one day tell me outright

67
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,500
that I have to marry him?

68
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,120

That's enough.

71
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,750
You don't need to love him.

72
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,770
Just treat him like a caretaker,

00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,120
or even a blood supply.

I don't know how to explain this to Mr. Wu.

203
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,290
Well, I have a question for him too.

204
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,410
Why was there someone not on the list?

205
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,120
Caught me off guard,

206
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,250
and let that kid show off.

So,

208
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,330
did it go okay?

209
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,070
Mm.

210
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,660
Let's start preparing for the wedding.

211
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,060
Are you sure?

212
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,920
You're worried about my brother, right?

213
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,130
All he cares about is me forming a pact with a Ren.

214
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,660
As long as I do it, he'll accept it.

215
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,790
How about this?

216
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:24,410
Don't let my brother know

217
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,540
I've chosen someone else just yet.

218
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,120
I'll explain it to him later.

219
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,120
But...

220
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,000
I agree as well.

221
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,320
Your sibling issues are yours to handle.

222
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,220
Don't drag me into it.

223
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,450
Besides,

224
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,010
it's not like no one wants me.

225
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,780
Thanks for understanding.

226
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,460
Mr. Wu won't be back until the wedding day.

227
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,450
We'll handle the preparations together.

228
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,670
And of course, all you need to do is cooperate.

229
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,920
I'll give it my all.

230
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,180
As if I would.

231
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,910
Will this really make my face look smaller?

232
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,870
Miss, don't worry.

233
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,820
It's a key step to becoming a beautiful bride.

234
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,500
Is this garment even made for humans?

235
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,500
The size is too small.

236
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,290
There's no time to let it out.

237
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,160
You'll have to eat less for a while.

238

Please.
