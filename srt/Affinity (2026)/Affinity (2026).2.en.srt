190
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,670
I keep having nightmares,

191
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,670
always dreaming of his unsettling eyes.

192
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,920
You dream about him often?

193
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,960
- Why tell me only now? - Because

194
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,930
I was afraid you'd react like this,

195
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:25,790
so I did not dare tell you.

196
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,620
So what happened to him?

197
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,000
Siyuan.

198
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,170
He died four years ago, illness.

199
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,920
That puts me at ease.

200
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,210
Siyuan, look.

201
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,170
I'm settled in here,

202
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,710
safe and sound.

203
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,670
You do not need to worry.

204
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,140
Don't stay up late. Good night.

205
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,080
The surveillance system failed.

206
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,110
It did not capture how the two bodies disappeared.

207
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,020
This incident stays within these walls.

208
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,040
Pull all surveillance from this building.

209
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,290
Do not miss a single lead.

210
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:03,710
Understood.

211
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,310
[Morgue]

212
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,680
[Morgue]

213
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,750
Why is there no signal in the cafeteria?

214
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,420
Mr. Gu must have misunderstood earlier.

215
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,330
He probably thought I was tempting him or something.

216
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,790
That was painfully awkward.

217
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,500
She is mine.

218
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,560
You have no right to touch her.
