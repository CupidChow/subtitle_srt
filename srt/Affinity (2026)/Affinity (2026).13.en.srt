1
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,450
We don't know who they are.

2
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,330
Don't make any sudden moves.

3
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,080
Should I say you're being cautious or just stupid?

4
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,700
No wonder Wu Nongyu is not into you.

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,160
Wu Siyuan hates stupidity as well.

6
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,580
What did you put in the drink?

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,660
High-dose inhibitor.

8
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,200
It won't affect ordinary people.

9
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,450
But if it's a Ren,

10
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,160
their viral load

11
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,790
will plunge and hold at an extremely low level.

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,080
As a result, they fight no better than an ordinary person.

13
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:49,330
You...

14
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,340
Don't worry.

15
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,000
He'll recover in five days.

16
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,580
I don't want to kill anyone.

17
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,080
All I want

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,410
is a bit of money.

19
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,160
That's it.

20
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,910
Now you need to pay.

21
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,330
Don't move.

22
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:17,620
Who do you work for?

23
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,290
Take him away.

24
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:21,750
Move.

25
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:23,450
Hurry up.

26
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:26,930
Move.

27
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,290
Move it.

28
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:02,740
Mr. Mai.

29
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,680
We've found him. The one you've been looking for!

30
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,080
How dare you touch him?

31
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,270
Mr. Mai, I…

32
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,200
Xu.

33
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,250
You've been through a lot.

34
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,790
So you are Xu!

35
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,830
Hail to Xu!

36
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,700
Hail to Xu!

37
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,040
Do we know each other?

38
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,290
I'm Max. Two years ago, we escaped the Special Administration Bureau together.

39
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,540
That was us!

40
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,450
I can't believe it! We really escaped that place!

41
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,250
I don't want to die anymore.

42
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,080
Where are you heading?

43
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,080
Take me with you.

44
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,370
I'm the strongest in this team.

45
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,040
Everyone calls me Max.

46
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,370
Max.

47
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,040
You two knew each other already?

48
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,290
Starting today,

49
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,290
Xu

50
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,290
is Xuyan Trading's new vice president.

51
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,700
If anyone dares to betray him,

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,440
they will be executed and dumped out from here!

53
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,700
I'm not interested in being your vice president.

54
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,730
Xu,

55
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,410
you're being too modest.

56
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,080
Look over here.

57
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,480
It was exactly what you said two years ago

58
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,580
that inspired me to found Xuyan Trading.

59
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,080
I specifically designed this logo

60
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,950
to remind myself of where it all began.

61
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,950
Two years of searching

62
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,080
and the effort finally paid off.

63
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,210
One of Xuyan's founding members

64
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,540
has finally returned.

65
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,410
Applause, everyone!

66
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,750
You had a company?

67
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,450
I...

68
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,950
I just found out myself.

69
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:08,790
Xu,

70
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,080
if it hadn't been for your words,

71
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,080
there would be no Xuyan Trading today.

72
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:13,950
So

73
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,160
I'm giving it to you now.

74
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,160
You deserve it.

75
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,620
That's what happens

76
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,700
when a fan and their idol find each other.

77
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,290
An idol?

78
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,660
You made your debut?

79
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,450
Do you have to define idols so narrowly?

80
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,700
Xu is my spiritual mentor,

81
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,160
someone far beyond your understanding.

82
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,200
It was him,

83
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,540
who, at my lowest point,

84
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,910
when I wanted to end it all,

85
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,950
gave me a new life.

86
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,660
Are you sure?

87
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,770
Who are you, anyway?

88
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,290
I've had enough of you.

89
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,430
You talk way too much.

90
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,580
She's my wife.

91
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,500
We've already formed a pact.

92
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,600
All of you, cover your ears.

93
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,790
Xu,

94
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,980
your career is on the rise.

95
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,390
Better keep it under wraps.

96
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,750
None of us here have formed a pact with an Yin yet.

97
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,640
If people find out,

98
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,810
it'll cause friction.

99
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,750
Everyone here,

100
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:09,950
are they all Ren?

101
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,020
Yes.

102
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,080
We "recruited" most of them

103
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,990
from the Special Administration Bureau.

104
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,630
In terms of numbers,

105
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,180
I'd say about a hundred.

106
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,690
Just last week,

107
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,200
the Bureau sent a team there on a mission.

108
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,650
They lost contact

109
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,250
the moment they arrived.

110
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,620
Xu, you must be hungry.

111
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,110
Come.

112
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,290
Let's talk while we eat.

113
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,370
Have a seat, Xu.

114
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,160
Xu,

115
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,410
you suggested I try my luck at the border. That was good advice.

116
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,290
Setting up import-export trade here
(Watch on www,kisskh,la or www,kisskh,id to support Admin)

117
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,500
has natural advantages.

118
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,870
By dealing in weapons and inhibitors,

119
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,750
Xuyan expanded quickly.

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,120
Your company's business

121
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,370
is entirely illegal.

122
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,040
Madam,

123
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,870
could you keep a lower profile?

124
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,500
How about this?

125
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,620
You two keep talking.

126
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,000
I'll step out.

127
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,200
Madam,

128
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,870
are you giving Xu an attitude?

129
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,290
With me,

130
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,620
she only needs to be herself.

131
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,250
Xu,

132
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,330
you both can stay here

133
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,200
for some time.

134
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,500
We can make Xuyan a thriving company,

135
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,950
fulfilling our dream

136
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,330
of building a world ruled by Ren.

137
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,330
I'm not interested.

138
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,620
No rush. Take your time, and think it over.

139
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,750
Stay a few days first.

140
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,780
Madam,

141
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,800
you must be worn out by now.

142
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,270
Why not go back and get some rest?

143
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,380
Xu and I

144
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,000
still have some business to discuss.

145
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,830
Since you're not interested...

146
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,080
Take this lady to the deluxe private room to rest.

147
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,080
Pack some food and send it over.

148
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,660
Go.

149
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,580
Don't be too late.

150
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,080
Mm.

151
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,040
Xu.

152
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,120
Come.

153
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,750
Asleep?

154
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,810
Are you angry with me?

155
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:44,950
For being too late?

156
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,200
Don't worry.

157
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,500
I won't agree to stay here for long.

158
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,250
The heating's blasting in here.

159
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,500
Isn't it stuffy under the blanket?

160
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,540
Why are you burning up?

161
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,990
Max drugged you.

162
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,090
Help me undo it.

163
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:47,700
- Okay. - Hurry.

164
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,970
Your hands feel cool. They are soothing.

165
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,000
You should sleep in another room.

166
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,210
Now you're just an ordinary man.

167
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,250
If I lose control,

168
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,620
you'd be in real danger.

169
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,000
You can do anything you want to me,

170
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,830
as long as it makes you feel better.

171
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,620
Okay?

172
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,370
Why are you so hard to deal with?

173
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,200
If you won't change a room,

174
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,950
then I will.

175
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,700
Should I run a bath for you?

176
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,500
It might help.

177
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,450
If you keep acting like this,

178
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,410
I'm really going to misunderstand this.

179
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,120
Help me.

180
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,620
How?

181
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,030
Anything you ask, I'll do it.

182
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,660
Thirsty.

183
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,220
Okay.

184
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,580
Sit tight.

185
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,550
I'll get some water.

186
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,980
Cold water will make you sick. Come out first.

187
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,290
Don't worry about me.

188
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,290
This feels better.

189
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,710
What are you doing?

190
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,280
This way it won't feel so cold.

191
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,800
I know you hate being a burden.

192
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,360
But sometimes,

193
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,390
you need someone covering for you.

194
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,610
That sharp pain in my chest just now...

195
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,450
Was that the medicine Mr. Ding gave me taking effect?

196
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,450
Xu.

197
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,090
How were last night's dishes?

198
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,350
From now on,

199
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,040
the food should suit your taste.

200
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,290
Not you forcing yourself to suit the food.

201
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,120
Remember this.

202
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,540
She is with me now

203
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,840
and from now on, whatever I get,

204
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,330
she gets.

205
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,000
I need to handle something.

206
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,790
You two keep eating.

207
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,080
Eat.

208
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,410
Your plan to pull them out...

209
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:38,910
Do you think it'll work?

210
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,750
Bing.

211
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,120
Long time no see.

212
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,620
The Bureau thought you went missing.

213
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,370
So you landed here instead.

214
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,580
Lin…

215
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,090
Lin Juan.

216
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,580
Let's skip the catching up.

217
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:16,660
Do me a favor.

218
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,080
I... I'm just a newcomer here.

219
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,160
What do you want?

220
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,540
Back when we worked together at the Bureau,

221
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,500
I remember you had an elderly mother.

222
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,540
Xu.

223
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,950
Did that affect your appetite?

224
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,120
Say, two employees asked to quit.

225
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,200
They wouldn't listen.

226
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:06,410
so I had to "take care of them".

227
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,120
That's not a threat to make you stay.

228
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,370
You can take your time to think it over.

229
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,090
There's no rush.

230
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,070
Lettuce again.
