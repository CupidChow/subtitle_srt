1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,408
Please accept this.

2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,678
UNIVERSITY STUDENT - KOZO'S SON

3
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:12,879
I don't need this.

4
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:16,249
Please don't come and see me again.

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,618
You came all this way, but…

6
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,820
We will never meet again.

7
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:22,355
Please leave.

8
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,460
KOZO'S SECRETARY

9
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:28,528
In 2015,

10
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:32,332
Royal Hope, who narrowly
finished second in the Japan Derby,

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,936
ran in the Kikuka Sho that same year,
and also in the long-awaited Arima Kinen,

12
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:39,672
raising the hopes of many
horse racing fans,

13
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,908
but was unable to secure a victory
in any of them.

14
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:42,809
You did well.

15
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:45,445
We'll win next time.

16
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:51,518
Then, in 2016,

17
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:54,654
he ran in the Spring Tenno Sho,
the Takarazuka Kinen,

18
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,891
and his second Arima Kinen,

19
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:00,026
but all ended without a win.

20
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:03,163
The following year, 2017,
he entered the Spring Tenno Sho,

21
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:06,833
the Japan Cup, and his third Arima Kinen,

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,935
all G1 races, without a win.

23
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,337
Hope was always
one step away from victory,

24
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:15,241
gaining him more and more fans each year
who wished for him to win, at least once.

25
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:17,944
They are all calling your name.

26
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:21,214
It's a shame.

27
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:24,150
We've got to come back next year.

28
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:25,852
Kurisu,

29
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:31,024
have you ever entered a racecourse
early in the morning?

30
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,593
No, I have not.

31
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,530
They once humored me and allowed me to see

32
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:41,401
the Nakayama Racecourse
one winter morning.

33
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:46,639
Because of the frost,
the entire turf looked frozen,

34
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:51,044
and then a soft, orange light
streamed across it.

35
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:56,916
The entire course then began
to glow as if it were slowly melting.

36
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,988
When I see that view,

37
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:06,092
I feel like humanity
has become more honest.

38
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:12,599
When I need to have an important
conversation with someone,

39
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,736
I'd like to take them there if I can.

40
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:21,608
Understood.

41
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:29,015
For your important conversations,
I'll get you a morning racecourse.

42
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:32,652
I'm counting on you.

43
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,089
After next year's Arima,

44
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,124
we'll retire.

45
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,295
Both Hope and I…

46
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,731
We have one year left.

47
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:50,503
The Arima Kinen.

48
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,573
A Grade I race where the horses
are selected based on fan voting

49
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,842
and their performance that year.

50
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,711
The horses carry
the fans' massive expectations

51
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:01,181
as they run
in this glamorous year-end race.

52
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,384
The course is 2,500 meters long
on the inner track,

53
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,786
with many corners
and steep changes in elevation.

54
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,255
Therefore, the outcome relies heavily on

55
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:12,725
not only the horse's ability
but the entire team's race plan.

56
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:16,262
IMAGINE DRAGON

57
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:17,797
What?

58
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:21,100
I will step down as Chairman.

59
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:23,970
The rest is up to you.

60
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:27,807
Yutaro, you're the new president.

61
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,810
ROYAL HUMAN HR DIRECTOR

62
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,280
What are you planning?

63
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:42,055
You wanted me to step down so badly,
but now that I am, you're sad about it?

64
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:46,326
Just promise me this.

65
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,362
Don't abandon people.

66
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,565
No matter what happens,

67
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,937
please protect our employees.

68
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,941
I'll do all I can.

69
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,178
And also,

70
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,815
the Horse Racing Division you all despise…

71
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:15,888
I'll set up a new company
and manage the horses there.

72
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,291
I'll do it by myself.

73
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,827
I won't buy new horses either.

74
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,830
No more complaints, right?

75
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,366
And one more thing.

76
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,741
You look like a man
who's been left completely speechless.

77
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,211
No response.

78
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:42,515
You're probably thinking,
"I should have quit sooner."

79
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,858
Hey, when your boss tells a joke,
you're supposed to laugh.

80
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,861
Sorry, sir.

81
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,064
It didn't sound like a joke to me.

82
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,970
All that's left to handle is him.

83
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,172
You mean Koichi?

84
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,642
Are you still in touch with him?

85
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,981
For the past two years,
I've sent him seasonal greetings,

86
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,850
but he has not had a change of heart.

87
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,386
Here's your crab.

88
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,057
Excuse me.

89
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:30,029
Even so, I'll make sure he accepts my aid.

90
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,033
For that,

91
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,403
Hope has to earn more prize money too.

92
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,278
Why are you retiring, President?

93
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:50,083
I still can't accept it.

94
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,187
I can understand Hope's retirement.

95
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:58,691
No, I think even Hope can still race more.

96
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,562
Even if Hope retires,

97
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,632
don't you have the obligation
of furthering his bloodline?

98
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:09,635
Please.

99
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:11,971
Give me a convincing reason.

100
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:18,878
I have cancer.

101
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,148
They don't know how long I have.

102
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,784
Right now, only my family knows.

103
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:31,124
I'll tell everyone when I feel it's time.

104
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:44,637
Accounting…

105
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,006
After the Horse Racing Division
goes independent,

106
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,575
I hope you'll stay
in the Accounting Division.

107
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:51,444
Well…

108
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:55,114
We should talk about his illness first.

109
00:06:55,648 --> 00:07:00,286
He ran amok all over the place,
and now he just announces this.

110
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,723
I wish he would consider how I feel too.

111
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:05,258
Good grief.

112
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:14,667
Keeping you in the company
is my father's wish.

113
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:17,770
And one more thing,

114
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,406
let Kurisu stay with the company.

115
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:24,877
I can't drag him into this any further.

116
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,081
Please consider this offer.

117
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:33,953
FIGHT - IZANA

118
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:43,663
Excuse me.

119
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:44,797
What is it?

120
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,033
I've come to help.

121
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,970
There's nothing for you to help with.

122
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,343
I heard from Yutaro.

123
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,079
You even worried about my employment.

124
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,180
Thank you very much.

125
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,350
I told him not to say anything!

126
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:10,623
Be honest. You wanted to work
for the Accounting Division, right?

127
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,825
Aren't you glad your wish came true?

128
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:14,727
I must refuse.

129
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,597
I am a member
of the Horse Racing Division.

130
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,732
It's going to disappear, you know.

131
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,634
You'll be fired.

132
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:25,671
-Just move to Accounting, okay?
-I'm afraid I cannot betray you.

133
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:29,442
-I made you that promise.
-I'm telling you that I don't need you.

134
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,544
It wouldn't be a betrayal.

135
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,213
But what about my dream?

136
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:40,052
The dream of winning
the Arima Kinen with you, President.

137
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,126
Are you planning to…

138
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,797
succumb before the Arima Kinen?

139
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,835
Do you have so little faith in yourself?

140
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:56,769
What?

141
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:59,438
If the owner is so weak-willed,

142
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,642
I feel pity for the horse that has to run.

143
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,176
I've decided.

144
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,280
I will absolutely not quit
being your secretary.

145
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,183
If you want to fire me,

146
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,320
please wait until
after the next Arima Kinen.

147
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:18,524
That's the responsibility
of a man who talks about dreams!

148
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:22,962
So insolent.

149
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,535
I bet there will be
a generation change this year.

150
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,637
I think Valshare still has it.

151
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,774
-Well, that one's a separate case.
-What about Royal Hope?

152
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,377
Hope just can't win G1 races.
It's probably impossible now.

153
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,514
-Nakajo.
-What?

154
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,382
Someone is looking at us.

155
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:44,383
Where?

156
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,918
Do you know him?

157
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,828
I've told you many times.

158
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,930
I don't need any aid.

159
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,167
I have the savings my mother left me,

160
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,070
I can manage until graduation.

161
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,172
Then at least, your father…

162
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:12,645
I mean, our company's Kozo Sanno…
Can you meet and talk--

163
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,413
Talk about what?

164
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,052
There's nothing to talk about.

165
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:23,990
How about horse talk?

166
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,127
Talk about Royal Hope.

167
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,964
You're in the Horse Racing Research Club.
Perhaps you can give us some ideas.

168
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,099
Did my mother tell you?

169
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,501
I apologize.

170
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,870
I just feel like it was meant to be.

171
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,775
You mean, like father, like son?

172
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,278
Quit it with your fantasies.

173
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:51,283
I just like horse racing, that's all.

174
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:53,519
Are we done?

175
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,287
Excuse me.

176
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,795
The first race of that year…

177
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,664
Yes, I saw it!

178
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,432
He won, didn't he? I was surprised.

179
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,335
Royal Hope was entered
into an overseas race

180
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:13,339
at Kozo Sanno's suggestion,
and brilliantly won the Dubai Gold Cup.

181
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:18,077
Afterwards, in the Summer Sapporo Kinen
and the Fall Tenno Sho,

182
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,446
he won second place.

183
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,149
Although the dream of a G1 win
remained out of reach,

184
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:27,787
he was steadily increasing
his chances of entering the Arima Kinen.

185
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,256
I think you're the one in fine form.

186
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,525
It's all about skill.

187
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:34,460
The next one.

188
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:36,362
All right.

189
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,966
Is Hope doing well?

190
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:45,971
Yes. As planned,
he'll run in next month's Japan Cup.

191
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:50,876
At this point, he's thriving,
both mentally and physically.

192
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:56,015
I knew running him in Dubai
was the right call.

193
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:01,821
A change of environment
seems to wake Hope up instantly.

194
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,756
It's the same for my son.

195
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:06,892
He's admirable.

196
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:07,993
THE NEW LEADER'S VISION

197
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,597
I've never done anything for him.

198
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,067
How is Koichi?

199
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,004
I've been contacting him every month, but…

200
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,311
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

201
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:28,848
I'll call for the nurse.

202
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,583
No, I'm fine!

203
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:31,817
Dad?

204
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,886
Dad, are you all right?

205
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,422
Are you okay?

206
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,125
He's not responding well to the treatment.

207
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,029
I've never seen him like this.

208
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:46,699
I…

209
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,302
It's all right.

210
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,672
He'll make it. I'm sure of it.

211
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,687
Mr. Kurisu!

212
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,422
Hello.

213
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,529
He's not here today either?

214
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,067
He's acting strong,

215
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:25,771
but the treatment is draining
his stamina somewhat.

216
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,207
Actually…

217
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:34,547
The article I promised to write
about the President and Hope.

218
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:38,584
I stopped writing it
after last year's Arima.

219
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:45,057
I believe the only thing missing,
the one thing…

220
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,229
is the moment he wins Arima.

221
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,166
Mr. Kurisu.

222
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,236
He'll make it to the goal, right?

223
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,139
Yes.

224
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,577
Come on, Mr. Taira…

225
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,745
SORYU CO. CEO

226
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,380
SHIINA'S SECRETARY

227
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,483
I've decided to retire Valshare
and Imagine Dragon

228
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,918
at the end of this year.

229
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,755
But they are
the two strongest horses this year!

230
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,657
Both can still run.

231
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:22,027
They have the power to create history!

232
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:26,098
They'll keep contributing as stud horses.

233
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,034
I want to meet him
at this year's Arima Kinen.

234
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,538
Please tell your boss that.

235
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,217
In the final stretch,
Imagine Dragon is in the lead,

236
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,186
with a three-length, four-length lead.

237
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,622
The lead isn't shrinking.
The pace isn't slowing.

238
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:53,459
Imagine Dragon, after a perfect race,
crosses the finish line first!

239
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:56,562
In first place, Imagine Dragon.
In second place, Royal Hope.

240
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,731
Hope also missed the win here,

241
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,901
but he secured second place
in the Japan Cup,

242
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:06,205
which all but guaranteed
his fourth entry into the Arima Kinen.

243
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,139
Hey!

244
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,109
-President!
-Have a seat.

245
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:12,111
-President!
-Hey there.

246
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:17,950
I've realized that I love horses,
but I love the racecourse too.

247
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:23,589
That massive, jostling crowd,
the great roar like an earthquake…

248
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,025
That's what makes horse racing.

249
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,393
Sit down.

250
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,462
If I were just watching from afar,

251
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,599
I probably wouldn't have gotten
this absorbed in it.

252
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,668
Then please see the Arima in person, sir.

253
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,202
He's not in yet.

254
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,637
It's basically a given.

255
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,572
Everyone loves him.

256
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,442
-You mean my dad?
-No, Hope.

257
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,945
I mean, the President is…

258
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,579
Don't trip me up like that!

259
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,517
Well, for now, should we have a toast?

260
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,954
-Who put you in charge?
-Because no one else was going to!

261
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,088
You can drink today.

262
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,436
We'll win the Arima.

263
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,640
Then Hope will retire.

264
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,009
I'll quit too.

265
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,179
I'm sorry.

266
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:23,315
I was agonizing over when to tell you all.

267
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,753
And the moment ended up being now.

268
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:33,359
Thank you so much
for bringing Hope this far.

269
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,595
I'm glad I could tell you directly.

270
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,601
It's you, President.

271
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:47,006
The man who brought us this far is you.

272
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,643
If you hadn't believed in us back then,

273
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,513
I don't think Hope
would have been able to run this far.

274
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:56,782
That's certainly true.

275
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,056
Kanako.

276
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,726
I'm truly glad you were here.

277
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,396
Hironaka,

278
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,899
Sumire, Daichi,

279
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,202
Grandpa Nozaki,

280
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,038
Ryujiro,

281
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,874
and you, Reporter.

282
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,911
Everyone, thank you.

283
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:32,885
Oh, actually,
Shohei also wanted to join us,

284
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,521
but he had school today.

285
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:37,356
Shohei, it's the President.

286
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,224
Good evening.

287
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,061
How is the Horseracing School?

288
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,564
Well, it's so-so.

289
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,170
I'll definitely go to see the Arima,
so please do your best, everyone.

290
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,506
He's so well-mannered now.

291
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,242
Stop! It'll go to his head!

292
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,045
See you, Shohei. Keep up the good work.

293
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,413
Excuse me.

294
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:08,554
What we need to do is the same as before.

295
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:13,192
All of us will bring
Royal Hope to victory.

296
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,795
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

297
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,255
If…

298
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:20,826
It's just an "if."

299
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:25,130
If Hope wins the Arima Kinen…

300
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,271
will you marry me?

301
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:36,975
The President is retiring,

302
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:40,946
and now I'm in a position
where I can't see the future at all,

303
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,550
but precisely because of that,
I think I can do anything,

304
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,652
and create any future.

305
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,091
I'm serious.

306
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,230
I want to marry you.

307
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:07,606
No, I don't want that.

308
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,842
-What? You don't want to?
-Of course not.

309
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,246
What the heck?
Did you think I would say yes to that?

310
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,415
Well… Sorry?

311
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,850
My whole life has been dictated by horses.

312
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,986
Since childhood, it's all been horses.

313
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:24,423
Even my only son
was taken by horses, and now what?

314
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:28,760
You want to gamble my happiness
on the result of a horse race? No!

315
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:31,230
Let me decide my own life.

316
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:33,398
I see.

317
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,701
That's true.

318
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:36,702
So…

319
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,238
This has nothing to do with Hope.

320
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,641
I'll decide everything.
Including marriage.

321
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:45,410
Meaning?

322
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,846
Meaning…

323
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,485
-I won't marry you.
-You won't?

324
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:54,486
Not right now.

325
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:57,322
For now, I don't want to take you away.

326
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,659
Don't be distracted by love.

327
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,228
Focus on staying
with the President until the end.

328
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:06,565
I can wait

329
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:10,535
ten years or even twenty.

330
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,275
Thank you.

331
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:22,514
All right, let's write one of those.

332
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:23,448
Sure.

333
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:25,751
KOZO SANNO'S RECOVERY
VICTORY AT ARIMA

334
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,052
Okay.

335
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:29,988
Seriously?

336
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:31,790
What?

337
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:34,793
TO LIVE HAPPILY WITH EIJI

338
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,764
I'm not sure things
will work out between us.

339
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,967
-Come on. Both are correct!
-Right.

340
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:45,237
-Please let me marry Yuriko.
-What?

341
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:46,805
What is it?

342
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:48,540
Nothing. Pardon me.

343
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:51,143
Please.

344
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:57,449
Young folks never fail to surprise me.

345
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,520
What do you say, Dad?

346
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:07,759
If I win the Arima,
please let us get married.

347
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:09,695
-Sorry.
-What's up with you?

348
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:10,595
My apologies.

349
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,167
Did you ask her?

350
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,169
Do you mean Mom?

351
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,371
I'll ask her later.

352
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:21,907
I'll tell you now.

353
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:26,411
Some people hate horses, you know.

354
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,081
Really?

355
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:30,449
Yeah.

356
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,118
Make sure to get results.

357
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,286
It will be fine.

358
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,921
Mom just hates horses,

359
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:38,457
but otherwise,
she's a very sensible person.

360
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,626
Wait. That sounds
the least advantageous to me.

361
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,265
It's fine. You relax too.

362
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,368
I'm okay.

363
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,772
I thought he'd be against it.

364
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:55,841
That was easy.

365
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,644
But he remembers promises.

366
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,913
So if you don't win,
who knows what will happen.

367
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:03,448
Right.

368
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:17,996
Wait. Really?

369
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,332
Oh, this year's Arima
is going to be amazing.

370
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,600
-I know.
-Right.

371
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,669
-Should we go see this one?
-It's their last.

372
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,905
I'm not sure…

373
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:29,941
I apologize for calling you here.

374
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:33,178
Hope is retiring, isn't he?

375
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:34,980
Yes.

376
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,717
Thanks to that, he's even featured
in the sports newspapers.

377
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:39,918
That's a pity.

378
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:46,057
I thought Hope was a horse
that genuinely loved to run.

379
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:49,294
I knew it.

380
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,196
You truly understand.

381
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,931
No, stop that kind of talk.

382
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,902
You keep trying to pull me
into your world.

383
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:58,837
I apologize.

384
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:00,605
Thank you for waiting.

385
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:05,977
Enjoy.

386
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,385
So? What is this about?

387
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:17,689
It's about the President's health.

388
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:24,796
Given his age,
his doctor says remission is unlikely.

389
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,565
Along with Hope,

390
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:28,867
the President will also retire.

391
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:32,170
Please.

392
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,573
Could you possibly meet
with the President?

393
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:40,879
I will prepare
a special place for the two of you.

394
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:45,150
-Nakayama in the morning?
-Yes.

395
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:47,886
I begged the staff,

396
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:51,656
and they agreed to open it
two days before the Arima.

397
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:56,127
So I'll have Koichi join you at 6:00 a.m.

398
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:59,965
Before 7:00 a.m., the two of you
can watch the sunrise from the course.

399
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,969
You are a man who goes to extremes.

400
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:07,339
All thanks to your guidance, President.

401
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:12,978
But, Kurisu, I am like this now.

402
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,213
What could I say to him?

403
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,984
What can I do for him right now?

404
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,855
Just meet him.

405
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:29,327
Meet him and watch the sunrise together.

406
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:30,362
Isn't that enough?

407
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,697
As for what comes after,

408
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,934
I believe Koichi can decide that.

409
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:42,541
President, congratulations
on the confirmed entry!

410
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:44,643
Congratulations!

411
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:48,914
Hope, who has yet to win a G1,
should get a grand send-off.

412
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:53,351
This desire from the fans
made his Arima Kinen entry possible.

413
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:55,887
He can tell!

414
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:58,757
-You know, don't you? Hope!
-Can you see him, President?

415
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:00,358
Hey, Hope. Smile.

416
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:01,726
Hey, smile.

417
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:06,264
He might be in his best form now.

418
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:10,268
He's calm. He's matured.

419
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,939
He probably realizes it too.
That this is the last.

420
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:18,710
This will be his fourth Arima Kinen.
Are there any differences this time?

421
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:21,279
Winning the Arima Kinen is the owner's…

422
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,981
Our dream.

423
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,384
We want Hope to retire with a win.

424
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:27,953
That's all.

425
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:39,130
-Mr. Kurisu.
-How is the President?

426
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:40,932
He was in pain all of a sudden,

427
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:44,069
lost consciousness,
and is now in the treatment room.

428
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:54,112
Madam.

429
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:55,280
Madam.

430
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:58,883
Are you all right by yourself?

431
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:01,620
Yes, I'm fine.

432
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:05,323
When's the next race?

433
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:08,426
The Arima Kinen is two days from now.

434
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,530
He often used to say…

435
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:18,069
that winning the Arima Kinen
would be the best feeling.

436
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:23,875
At the end of his life, he wants to win
and then wrap it all up.

437
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:31,282
Yes. But life doesn't always go to plan.

438
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:42,193
NAKAYAMA RACECOURSE

439
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,130
Please.

440
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:47,599
Could you possibly meet
with the President?

441
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,550
Sorry. I'm here by myself.

442
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:16,795
Could you walk along the outside boundary?

443
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,464
We don't want to damage the inside turf.

444
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:20,965
Sure.

445
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:36,881
Today's sunrise will be before 7:00 a.m.

446
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:37,849
Yes.

447
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:42,654
They once allowed me to see
the Nakayama Racecourse

448
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,489
on a winter morning.

449
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:01,606
Because of the frost,
the entire turf looked frozen,

450
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,877
and then a soft, orange light
streamed across it.

451
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:10,348
The entire course then began
to glow as if it were slowly melting.

452
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:51,923
It'd be nice if he won.

453
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,892
Royal Hope, I mean.

454
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,461
What?

455
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:59,164
You see, I'm a fan.

456
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:03,835
An employee of JRA
shouldn't be saying this,

457
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:07,272
so I'm just talking to myself.

458
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:10,375
That horse's competitive spirit…

459
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,510
My gosh.

460
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:13,978
I love it.

461
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,681
The last race.

462
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:19,217
I have high hopes for him.

463
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:21,519
Yes.

464
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:23,688
Thank you.

465
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:58,623
It's the final adjustments.

466
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,793
Take your time and enjoy this.

467
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,261
Yes!

468
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:47,305
IMAGINE DRAGON, VALSHARE, ROYAL HOPE
A GLORIOUS LAST RUN

469
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:50,642
The forecast says it'll rain.

470
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:56,214
A race in the rain, huh?

471
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:06,391
What is Shohei even doing?

472
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:08,426
-Oh, Shohei!
-'Sup!

473
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:11,729
Wow! You look all grown up!

474
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:14,832
-You haven't caught a cold, have you?
-Shut up, Mom.

475
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:17,302
Good. We can watch it all together.

476
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:20,972
Do you want to go to the paddock too?
To see Ryujiro?

477
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,340
I'll pass.

478
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:24,943
He's not my idol anymore.

479
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:26,911
He's my rival.

480
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,414
Well said.

481
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,319
That's unfortunate.

482
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:38,156
I wanted to see their last race
along with him.

483
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,961
May I ask you one thing?

484
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:45,663
What is it?

485
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:49,901
Why do you still respect
our President so much?

486
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:52,337
I've always wondered.

487
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,874
It's because he carries a lot
on his shoulders.

488
00:32:57,508 --> 00:33:01,479
I like people who take on
the dreams of many others.

489
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,414
People like that are rare.

490
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,551
Also, he always seemed to be
enjoying himself.

491
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:07,752
I apologize.

492
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:11,456
My horse is running, you see,
and I want to watch it on the big screen.

493
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:15,893
Seeing someone truly enjoying
something makes me happy as well.

494
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:17,662
I respect that person.

495
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:20,131
When I talk to him,

496
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:23,301
I feel like it soothes my loneliness.

497
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,173
Let's have a race without regrets.

498
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,109
Yes.

499
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:38,116
Definitely.

500
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,958
BECOME A LEGEND, ROYAL HOPE

501
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:49,193
Any orders?

502
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,796
The President had only one order.

503
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:53,998
"Win."

504
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:57,101
Roger that.

505
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:00,805
Good luck.

506
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:04,509
I'll do my best.

507
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,113
Everyone.

508
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:14,252
Thank you so much for everything.

509
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:18,656
Until the very end,

510
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:22,226
please keep supporting us.

511
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,832
Stop!

512
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:38,910
Hope.

513
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,446
Let's do this.

514
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:43,347
-Okay, let's go.
-Yes.

515
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:52,190
All right!

516
00:34:57,495 --> 00:35:01,399
Thank you for bringing me this far.

517
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:05,803
If I hadn't met you, President,
I wouldn't have become a manager.

518
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:09,874
And I'll never be a manager
under anyone else but you.

519
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,143
Therefore,

520
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,914
along with you,
I'll also step away from this world.

521
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:20,318
Thank you for all this time.

522
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:22,453
The last run.

523
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,021
Let's all pray together.

524
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:36,734
Over here!

525
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,012
The horses for the eighth day

526
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,982
of the Fifth Nakayama Race,
the 63rd Arima Kinen…

527
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:52,216
Dad!

528
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,521
-Yuriko, it's starting.
-Hold on a minute.

529
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,189
426 kg.

You can do it!

536
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,306
Is the rain that's starting to fall
a farewell rain,

537
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:24,141
mourning the great horses
who are retiring?

538
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:27,979
Or is it a divine prank,
imposing an ordeal on their final race?

539
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:30,648
Nakayama Racecourse, turf, 2,500 meters.

540
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:33,351
The odd-numbered horses
have settled into the gates,

541
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,854
and the even-numbered horses
are steadily heading toward them.

542
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:41,092
Will victory smile upon
fan-favorite Royal Hope?

543
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:44,228
Japan Cup winner Imagine Dragon?

544
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:47,832
Or the Derby horse, Valshare? The dreams
of all racing fans are gathered…

545
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:49,100
Hope.

546
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,168
…here at the Nakayama Racecourse!

547
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:54,605
Finally, Number 16, Valshare,
enters the gate.

548
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,741
Hope.

549
00:37:58,042 --> 00:37:59,543
The boss is watching.

550
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:03,681
It's 2018, the final Arima Kinen
of the Heisei era.

551
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:08,352
Which horse will close out
this chaotic year and usher in a new era?

552
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:13,090
It's the 63rd Grand Prix Arima Kinen,
and they are off!

553
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,993
Taking the lead first is Royal Hope!

554
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,295
Royal Hope is the leader!

555
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:19,430
-Did he get carried away?
-What?

556
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:21,666
-Did they mess up?
-Or is this Ryujiro Saki's strategy?

557
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:23,401
-The leader is Royal Hope.
-Hope…

558
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,102
Following him are Number six,
South Knight,

559
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:26,537
and Number Nine, Horai Estate.

560
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,205
In fourth is Number 16, Valshare.

561
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:30,708
In the middle is Number Four,
Imagine Dragon.

562
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:32,209
They are between corners.

563
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:35,246
-Two lengths behind is Number 12, Arti.
-Hope won't keep this up.

564
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,282
Another three lengths back
is Number Two, Michael Columbia.

565
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,488
Third from last is Number 11…

566
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:46,757
Go. Do your best.

567
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:49,393
Number 14, Love Panther is running last.

568
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,961
They passed the winning post.

569
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:54,098
Number 15, Royal Hope,
pulling away from the inside rail,

570
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,966
maintains a five-length lead.

571
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:58,169
The first 1,000 meters
were run at a fast pace…

572
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:00,204
He won't last till the end like this.

573
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:03,974
Number 13, Binan, Number 16, Valshare,
are approaching the first corner.

574
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:05,476
Royal Hope is in the lead.

575
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:09,347
From the first to the second corner,
they have formed a long line!

576
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:12,450
It's your debut too.

577
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,784
I'm also trying again.

578
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,053
Shall we run together?

579
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,790
But I'm captivated by
Hope's true strength.

580
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,826
In his refusal to yield,

581
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:24,195
I feel a power and fighting spirit.

582
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:30,534
Do you have the will to win?

583
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:31,769
It's all I want.

584
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:33,671
Then please, I beg you!

585
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:34,972
My father's dream

586
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,843
is the dream of everyone in Hidaka.

587
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,979
See you, Hope.

588
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,681
Do your best!

589
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:45,950
Do your best!

590
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:47,451
Do your best!

591
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:49,453
ROYAL HOPE

592
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,357
Now, Number 16, Valshare,
passes Number 13, Binan into second place.

593
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:55,593
-Yes! Go!
-The gap is three to four lengths.

594
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:59,130
The leader is nearing
the halfway point of the backstretch.

595
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:03,701
The three horses about to retire after
this Arima dash down the backstretch.

596
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:05,469
Number 13, Binan, is in third.

597
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:10,007
Behind him is Number Two, Michael
Columbia, by a gap of nearly ten lengths.

598
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,676
Now, all the horses
are starting to increase their pace!

599
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,779
The leader is still Number 15, Royal Hope.

600
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:18,516
Number 16, Valshare, in second,
is closing the gap furiously!

601
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,786
Between the third and fourth corners,
Valshare is alongside Royal Hope!

602
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:26,257
And now, Number Four, Imagine Dragon,
is moving up from the middle of the pack!

603
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:28,526
-Hope! Dad!
-Royal Hope and Valshare.

604
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,728
The two rivals from the Derby
are side-by-side!

605
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,596
Now, the Nakayama straight is short!

606
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:34,799
Imagine Dragon
is coming up on the far outside!

607
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:37,435
A three-way battle
of the top horses this year!

608
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:39,870
Want to come over to my place?

609
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:45,776
They are not giving an inch!
Royal Hope won't yield!

610
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:49,480
-We did it!
-It's just one win!

611
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:50,915
Now, Valshare has taken the lead!

612
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:53,751
From the outside, Imagine Dragon!
Has Royal Hope run out of steam?

613
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:55,052
Promise me one thing.

614
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,787
You must never betray me.

615
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:58,022
Never.

616
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:00,491
It's a duel between Valshare
and Imagine Dragon!

617
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:03,227
Go.

618
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:06,864
Go!

619
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:16,941
Go!

620
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:18,042
Go!

621
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:19,109
Go!

622
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:20,211
No! It's Royal Hope!

623
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:21,378
Royal Hope is back!

624
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:23,013
-Royal Hope is pouncing…
-Hope!

625
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:23,814
-Hope!
-Go!

626
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:25,616
-Hope!
-Hang in there!

627
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:27,017
-Go!
-Go!

628
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:28,319
Go!

629
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:29,753
Imagine Dragon is…

630
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,422
-Hang in there!
-Go!

631
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,690
-Hope!
-Go!

632
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:33,691
Go!

633
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:35,926
Royal Hope!
Three horses reach the goal together!

634
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:39,096
Which horse won?
It's impossible to tell the three apart!

635
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,532
-Valshare? Imagine Dragon?
-Dad!

636
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,101
Or Royal Hope?

637
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:48,372
-Are you okay?
-Nakayama Racecourse. Race 11.

638
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:52,142
-He made it.
-Please wait a moment.

639
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:27,845
Nakayama Racecourse. Race 11.

640
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:31,448
The first, second, and third places
are as follows…

641
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:33,984
In first place, Number Four.

642
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:37,054
-Yes!
-In second place, Number 15.

643
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:41,358
In third place, Number 16.

644
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,377
Damn it.

645
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:26,036
Royal Hope! Thank you!

646
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:29,139
-Thank you Hope!
-Hope!

647
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:33,477
Hope!

648
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,049
Hope! Thank you!

649
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:41,285
Hope!

650
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:43,020
Listen to them.

651
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:47,458
Hope, it's all for you!

652
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:51,729
Hope!

653
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:53,731
Let's go.

654
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:54,965
Hope!

655
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:01,271
Hope, thank you!

656
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:20,724
PRESIDENT

657
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:22,960
Hello?

658
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:24,695
What the heck was that email?

659
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:28,399
-What?
-You make it sound like I'm about to die!

660
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:32,369
Lately, aren't you talking
as if my death is a certainty?

661
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:35,739
-Well…
-Come on! Don't kill me off yet!

662
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:38,175
Go to the tempura place now!

663
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:39,443
-Dad!
-What?

664
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,145
It's not the time for tempura…

665
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:44,648
Shut up! How can I die when I'm losing?

666
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:47,818
I still have to find a bride for Hope.

667
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:51,255
There's no time to rest.

668
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:56,126
You're right.

669
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:58,495
You're right!

670
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:20,417
Mr. Kurisu, I apologize
for not coming the other day.

671
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:22,720
I'd like to meet you sometime.

672
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:27,725
I'd rather talk to you first,
before I talk to my father.

673
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:30,728
Koichi Nakajo.

674
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:40,137
Hope's foal?

675
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:43,073
I will assist fully with the inheritance.

676
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:47,010
Can you be there for them
when they really need you?

677
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,946
Enough already.

678
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:49,980
