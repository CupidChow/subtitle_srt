1
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,441
Please accept this.

2
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:09,442
I don't need this.

3
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:12,812
Please don't come and see me again.

4
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:17,650
Kozo Sanno announced he would retire
along with his horse, Royal Hope.

5
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:22,489
This was a difficult decision he made
after being struck by illness.

6
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:23,923
ARIMA KINEN

7
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,360
On a rainy-day Arima Kinen,
Royal Hope's final powerful run…

8
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:28,728
-Go!
-Hope!

9
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:33,033
…failed to mark
the beginning of a new era.

10
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:35,702
A THREE-WAY BATTLE BETWEEN IMAGINE DRAGON,
VALSHARE, AND ROYAL HOPE!

11
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,303
AFTER A FIERCE FIGHT, IMAGINE DRAGON WINS!

12
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:45,045
-Welcome!
-One coffee, please.

13
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:46,179
Coming right up.

14
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:51,584
ROYAL HOPE BLOODLINE

15
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:52,619
MOROCCO DESIGN'S PROGENY

16
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,554
Is it Nakayama?

17
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,424
Am I early?

18
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,160
-Not at all.
-Oh, keep going.

19
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,028
Nakayama Kimpai's predictions, right?

20
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:06,299
It will be an interesting race.
They are all skilled horses.

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,903
By the way, what are your predictions?

22
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:13,106
Please stop addressing me so politely.

23
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:15,708
Understood.

24
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:29,823
I think the Number Three and
Number Nine horses are good candidates.

25
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,258
Three and Nine, huh?

26
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:33,760
Will you buy a betting ticket?

27
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:37,230
Oh, I only bet on our horses.

28
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,833
I don't know much about horses, so…

29
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:41,401
Thank you for waiting.

30
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,774
I'm sorry I couldn't go.

31
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,443
-There's no need…
-That morning at Nakayama.

32
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,483
I'm sorry for asking too much of you.

33
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,953
I first wanted to apologize for that.

34
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:00,987
It's nothing.

35
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:04,991
And also…

36
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,529
Is he doing all right?

37
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,198
The President?

38
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:15,034
Yes, thankfully.

39
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,270
Even his doctor is surprised.

40
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:19,339
Is he going to keep being a horse owner?

41
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,077
As much as possible.

42
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,916
Are you not struggling?

43
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:36,156
Royal doesn't have any
promising horses other than Hope.

44
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:40,894
Hope has the role of carrying on
the bloodline as a stud.

45
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,031
To win the Arima with a horse from Hidaka.

46
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:48,801
Our goal will be passed on
to the next generation.

47
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,970
And the candidate for the broodmare?

48
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,472
We're working on that.

49
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:56,376
We have a broodmare
the President acquired, so…

50
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,746
Is there something wrong?

51
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:07,820
Can I meet with the President once?

52
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:09,889
-What?
-Please.

53
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:16,095
Hope, good morning.

54
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:22,135
Oh, you're not drinking much water.

55
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:28,741
Today, we will do some light exercise,
mainly walking,

56
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,777
to loosen up the body.

57
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:33,146
Hope, look. It's the President! Hello!

58
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,914
Hope, how are you?

59
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,849
Oh, it's old man Kurisu.

60
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,986
I'm not that old, you know.

61
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,657
He will be moving to a new stable
next month as a stud.

62
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,895
We are letting him release
the stress of racing for a while.

63
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,230
I'll leave it up to you.

64
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:52,432
As for the broodmare candidates,

65
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:56,169
can we go ahead as planned
with Warsaw, born in 2016?

66
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,372
Yes, she should have a strong child.

67
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,276
Understood.

68
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,715
-Kurisu.
-Yes?

69
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:12,418
Why did he change his mind?

70
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,220
He just said…

71
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,924
There's something I want
to tell him as soon as possible.

72
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,125
That's all.

73
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,527
Bloodlines.

74
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,197
In the world of horse racing,
the value of a racehorse

75
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,799
is heavily influenced by its bloodline.

76
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,902
Breeders not only consider
the performance of the sire and dam,

77
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:33,539
but also examine the track record
of close relatives and pedigrees

78
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,875
spanning several generations
to explore new breeding options.

79
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:40,880
Horse owners have the important mission
of protecting their bloodlines.

80
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,417
ROYAL FAMILY

81
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:47,620
What a great sound.

82
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,490
Eating what you like
is the best after all.

83
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:51,624
I think so, too.

84
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,261
Welcome.

85
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:56,396
Welcome.

86
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,399
-I've brought him.
-Okay.

87
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:03,836
Hey.

88
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,840
Let's go over there.

89
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:10,843
-Let me.
-Thank you.

90
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:17,583
Here's your daikon.

91
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,193
I see.

92
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:30,229
You're not good at handling your alcohol.

93
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,998
It's not that.

94
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:35,501
But, I don't go to many drinking parties.

95
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,104
Then I bet university isn't fun.

96
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,939
That's not true.

97
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,175
He's going there to study.

98
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:47,013
And even if he doesn't go drinking,
he has many friends.

99
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,417
There are only one or two people
I can call my friends.

100
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:53,920
A select few.

101
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,457
Do you like horses?

102
00:05:58,791 --> 00:05:59,892
So-so.

103
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,330
-Me too. So-so.
-That can't be true.

104
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,833
You can't be a horse owner
unless you do, right?

105
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:14,340
You can't continue being a horse owner
just because you love them.

106
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,243
-So it's only business to you?
-Here's your soft roe.

107
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:22,548
I can't put it simply in one word.

108
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:25,485
Horses cannot be raised by calculation.

109
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:29,021
If you only have ideals,
people will leave.

110
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,627
This is a learning experience,
as it's a world I have no connection to.

111
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,899
-Could we get another, please?
-Yes!

112
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:41,801
I'm sorry.

113
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:47,306
I didn't know anything.

114
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,742
I'm really sorry.

115
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,778
That's enough.

116
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,281
-Let me support you.
-I don't need it.

117
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,582
I will not be satisfied.

118
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,192
Do you think I'm unhappy?

119
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,662
Is that why you're so sorry?

120
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,633
Then why are you not satisfied?

121
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,803
Forcing things on me that I don't want,
how will that make you satisfied?

122
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:21,741
Both of you,
please eat before it gets cold.

123
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:24,177
You say that,

124
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,681
but humans are all about
self-satisfaction.

125
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:30,550
President, you too…

126
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,020
Thank you for waiting.

127
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,788
Excuse me.

128
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:42,595
Why didn't you retire with Hope?

129
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,731
Is it because you couldn't give up?

130
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,901
Was it because you were so close
to winning the Arima?

131
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,104
Aren't you just toying with everyone
for your own satisfaction?

132
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:54,774
-Koichi!
-What about breeding Hope?

133
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,010
You know how many years it takes

134
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:02,048
for a newborn horse
to become a racehorse, right?

135
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:06,886
During that time, will you be able
to responsibly support those foals?

136
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,523
Can you be there for them…

137
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,863
when they really need you?

138
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:27,273
I will take responsibility
for their future, so--

139
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,775
Then don't tell me
you know nothing about horses.

140
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:33,312
Don't pretend you know about horses
and take them seriously.

141
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,914
Enough already.

142
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:37,984
He has nothing to do with it.

143
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,655
President, are you okay?

144
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:45,892
Do you want to take your medicine?

145
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,830
That's the worst.

146
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,465
Yes, it was.

147
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:56,802
He speaks calmly
and at first glance seems like an adult.

148
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,541
But he gets mad quickly and is stubborn.

149
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,544
And the President?
As usual, he refuses to give in.

150
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,347
I'm sorry, but they are exactly alike.

151
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,050
You should have said that to them.

152
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,218
I can't do that.

153
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,786
What is that?

154
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,922
"What is that?"

155
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,358
But…

156
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,162
I know now that he's opposed to him
continuing to be a horse owner.

157
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,999
What? He's opposed?

158
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,001
-What?
-Well…

159
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,704
Koichi knows a lot
about horse racing, right?

160
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,106
Didn't he win
at the Nakayama Kimpai this year?

161
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,576
Oh, right. Yes, he did.

162
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,112
I can't believe he'd get Number Three
and Number Nine right.

163
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,982
That kind of person…

164
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,685
He knows that if the President gives up,

165
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,521
Hope's bloodline
will come to an end, right?

166
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,589
Yes.

167
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:53,759
Maybe it's not that he's opposed to it,
but he's worried about it.

168
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,795
About the President and the horse.

169
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,496
Worried?

170
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,066
Maybe he just can't
express himself properly.

171
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:04,070
Wasn't he saying, "Think about the horses
that will be left behind."

172
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,206
I see.

173
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,041
Yes.

174
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:14,380
But is that even possible?

175
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,783
-Horse inheritance?
-Yes.

176
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,754
I was wondering if Koichi
could inherit your horses.

177
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,324
He's enthusiastic about horses.

178
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,126
That would be impossible.

179
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:31,130
To own a racehorse,
you need a horse owner's license.

180
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,467
If that's the case,
then there's no problem.

181
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,168
I think we can do that.

182
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:40,439
There's a license which grants
ownership to inherited horses only.

183
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,642
-Inheritance-only Horse Ownership?
-Yes.

184
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:48,347
All of the horses he owns
will be inherited by his legal heir.

185
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,217
In this particular case…

186
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:54,487
The original ownership
requirements don't apply.

187
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,659
Even if your income up to the previous
year was less than 17 million yen,

188
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:02,862
and your total assets
don't reach 75 million yen,

189
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:07,566
if you can afford the cost of feed,
you can become a horse owner.

190
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,801
Even Koichi?

191
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,604
He can be a horse owner.

192
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,006
However, only racehorses

193
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:18,577
that were registered by the owner
during his lifetime can be inherited.

194
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,583
If you like these terms,

195
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:29,655
I will assist fully with the inheritance.

196
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,060
Inheritance…

197
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,103
President.

198
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:54,680
You…

199
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,750
You may not be unhappy,

200
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:02,254
but I want you to be happy.

201
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,556
That's how I feel.

202
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,259
Even if you are at your happiest,

203
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,595
I'd still want more for you.

204
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,432
That's what parents are.

205
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:28,647
I won't apologize anymore.

206
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,084
I won't assist you, either.

207
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,188
Just…

208
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,192
Could you take over my horses?

209
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,667
Don't worry.

210
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:51,403
Kurisu will help you.

211
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,507
If you have any concerns, ask him.

212
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,678
Never once in my life have I imagined

213
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,815
that I would become a horse owner.

214
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,251
Me too.

215
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:14,126
Thank you very much
for thinking so much about this.

216
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,164
But, still…

217
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:20,466
I must refuse.

218
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:26,372
I don't think I could be a horse owner.

219
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,307
-Besides…
-Besides?

220
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,676
Besides,

221
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,580
it's also because there are no horses
currently owned by Royal

222
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:38,217
that I would like to inherit.

223
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:48,194
Is that so? I see.

224
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,862
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

225
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,231
You are talented.

226
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,367
I see.

227
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,938
If there's none, then it can't be helped.

228
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,243
President. I heard that you came.

229
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,445
-Please stop by.
-Okay.

230
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,355
President, your complexion is good.

231
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,092
The air here is good.

232
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,529
The hospital doesn't smell like horses.

233
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,464
He needs a veterinary hospital.

234
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,199
Oh, shut up.

235
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,704
Good morning, Mr. Kurisu.

236
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,739
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

237
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,544
Why did you want to meet
with the President?

238
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,049
You don't need anything.

239
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,119
You don't need his apology and assistance.

240
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:51,557
You wanted to tell
the President something, right?

241
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,492
Please tell me.

242
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,695
What are you thinking?

243
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,374
At first, I thought
I should definitely tell him,

244
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,043
but then I thought
it was none of my business.

245
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,077
What is it?

246
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,014
Well…

247
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:20,486
I think I should say it, so I'll say it.

248
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:21,954
To me?

249
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:25,424
I'm only worried about Hope's foal.

250
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:29,261
I wonder if you're really
thinking about Hope's foal.

251
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,563
-I'm super worried--
-Wait! Let's go somewhere else.

252
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,267
Let's go somewhere else. Okay.

253
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,635
Hope's foal?

254
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:37,736
Yes.

255
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:40,005
I did a bit of research on Royal's horses.

256
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:44,510
The broodmare isn't Warsaw,
the one you bought last year, right?

257
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:45,411
-It is.
-No!

258
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:46,745
-You can't!
-What?

259
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,614
-No, you can't do that!
-Why?

260
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:49,848
It won't run.

261
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:50,950
How can you--

262
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:52,985
Did you look into bloodlines?

263
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,020
Bloodlines, well, yes…

264
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:57,323
This isn't something so trivial.

265
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:01,794
-What?
-I did research. Do you have time?

266
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,296
Excuse me! Sorry for interrupting, but…

267
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:08,400
Come in, if you like.
We can hear you really well.

268
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,939
Sorry, my saying,
"It won't run," was a mistake.

269
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,009
If you trace the bloodline back,

270
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:20,646
there is a high possibility that a horse
with an extreme temper will be born.

271
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:26,018
Also, if you trace the sire's bloodline,
you will find this horse, Morocco Design.

272
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:29,355
Apparently,
he's not working out as a stud.

273
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:34,927
Hope was a miraculous success
by his sire, Phase Unbeatable, but…

274
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,130
I summarized it in a table,
so please take a look.

275
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,767
There is not a single horse
in the award-winning class.

276
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:45,437
In the first place, Hope is a horse
with stamina and fighting spirit,

277
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,473
but he's not particularly fast, right?

278
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:51,110
I don't think it would do well
to breed him with the American, Warsaw.

279
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:55,180
However, we have to pass on
Hope's power to the next generation.

280
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:58,984
No, Mr. Kurisu.
I'm not saying he doesn't have options.

281
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:03,956
Among the broodmares
owned by the President,

282
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:07,059
there is one horse that I think
would be a good fit for Royal Hope.

283
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:12,631
This is a hypothetical situation.

284
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,634
If I were to inherit
one of the President's horses,

285
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:21,006
I would definitely want to inherit
the one born of those two horses.

286
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,108
Hope's foal?

287
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,009
Yes.

288
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,478
-Wait a minute.
-Which horse is it?

289
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,213
I want to know first.

290
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,649
This horse.

291
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,219
She's old, but…

292
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:40,592
Royal Happiness.

293
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:43,095
ROYAL HAPPINESS

294
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:47,666
With this horse, there is no concern,
no matter how far back you go.

295
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,638
If you want to make use of Hope's power,
Royal Happiness is the best choice.

296
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:54,907
Are you…

297
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:57,443
saying this, knowing that?

298
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:01,780
Knowing what?

299
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,250
Royal Happiness…

300
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,054
was the horse your mother chose.

301
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,657
Royal Happiness.

302
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:18,397
This is the broodmare
chosen by Mikiko Nakajo

303
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:20,532
for the President.

304
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,103
If it's her foal,

305
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,172
will you inherit it?

306
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,577
Hope and Happiness' foal…

307
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:37,282
Is a horse that only you can receive.

308
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,588
May I?

309
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,757
The horses eligible for inheritance

310
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:48,494
are those the previous owner
registered as racehorses.

311
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:53,065
Even if we inseminate her now,
the foal won't be born until next year.

312
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:57,903
It will take about two years after that
before it can be registered.

313
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:02,841
This means we'll have to wait
three years before he can inherit it.

314
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:10,115
In that case…

315
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,488
you need to stay alive.

316
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,298
Three more years…

317
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,301
Stay alive that long.

318
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:36,775
Until the horse bred from Hope
and Happiness is handed over to me.

319
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,778
Until the day it becomes a racehorse,

320
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,349
promise me you'll stay alive.

321
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:49,555
Don't be stupid.

322
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,558
It won't be until I hand them over to you.

323
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:55,861
But until that horse…

324
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,164
finishes first.

325
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,271
Don't just kill me off.

326
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:11,910
Okay.

327
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,853
ROYAL IZANA, ROYAL HAPPINESS,
ROYAL FIGHT, ROYAL HOPE

328
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,857
So the only thing
he will inherit is the horses?

329
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:27,859
He will not be involved in anything else?

330
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,628
Can you promise me that?

331
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,130
-Yes.
-Well…

332
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:35,634
I had no intention
of inheriting them to begin with.

333
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:40,606
It's fine with me. What do you think?

334
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:43,508
Do as you like.

335
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,945
Thank you very much.

336
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,148
Okay, then.

337
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:52,884
I will be present
when the documents are prepared.

338
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:55,287
-Understood.
-How cruel.

339
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:59,024
I can't believe you'll be continuing
his treatment for three more years.

340
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,010
How is it?

341
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,945
Amazing! Dad!

342
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,713
-Kanako.
-Yes.

343
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,022
Happiness.

344
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,324
You did great.

345
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,994
-Kanako, it's a colt.
-Oh, wow.

346
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,365
-Here.
-Okay.

347
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:45,170
Oh, my!

348
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:48,373
They're both healthy!
Happiness and the colt!

349
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:52,544
This is Hope's first colt!

350
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,146
Congratulations.

351
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,083
You two…

352
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,252
Go and meet them.

353
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,087
Okay.

354
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,288
Understood.

355
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:06,958
Kanako, thank you.

356
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:13,665
I still have the naming rights
to this horse, right?

357
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,334
Yes.

358
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,005
In that case,

359
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,308
I'll name him "Family."

360
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:26,478
"Royal Family."

361
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,683
Family will get us what we are missing.

362
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:33,552
The Arima Kinen.

363
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:37,856
Yes.

364
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:13,992
Come here.

365
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,026
Come here.

366
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,269
Yes.

367
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:25,437
Good.

368
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:29,808
Family.

369
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:41,653
Nice to meet you.

370
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:45,390
Family.

371
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:57,135
Yes, that's good. Right?

372
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:04,676
After that, another year passed by.

373
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,278
Sixth race, lane eight.

374
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:07,446
Spring.

375
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,915
Horses weren't the only ones
making their debut.

376
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,719
Sixth race, lane five.

377
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:15,821
Okay.

378
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:19,658
-Shohei.
-Yes?

379
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:21,259
-Do your best.
-Thank you.

380
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:24,362
-Okay.
-Sixth race, lane six.

381
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:27,399
Okay.

382
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:34,739
…they cross the line together!

383
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,010
How did Shohei do?

384
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:41,279
-Hey! How did he do?
-I don't know.

385
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:45,150
-What's with that?
-The horses were tightly packed.

386
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,085
He wasn't first place.

387
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:50,589
The way you say it…

388
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:54,025
But, he finished safely. I'm glad.

389
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,764
Shohei.

390
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:04,836
The only people who paid attention
to the debut of newcomer Shohei Nozaki

391
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:05,737
were his family.

392
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:09,674
It was a quiet, unremarkable debut.

393
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,516
Hey, it's Grandpa.

394
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:18,884
He has nice eyes, right?

395
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:22,387
He takes after me.

396
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:23,722
Stop, will you?

397
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:25,056
How soft.

398
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:26,024
RYUJIRO AND YURIKO'S SON

399
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:27,726
-Such a good boy.
-He's so cute.

400
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:29,928
Oh, no!

401
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:30,996
It's fine.

402
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:33,598
I'll take a walk around the area
after changing his diaper.

403
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:34,733
Come here.

404
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,803
-Call me.
-Okay, take care.

405
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,206
That's impressive. He must be busy.

406
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:44,609
I think you are the busy one.

407
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:47,812
And yet you always
find an excuse to meet Kotaro.

408
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:50,415
It's strange, even to me.

409
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,118
Originally, I'm not good with kids.

410
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:54,619
I was, too.

411
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:58,590
When I was young, I thought, "A kid, huh?"

412
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,294
"I'll never call you cute,
even if I die," I thought.

413
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:05,263
It's all thanks to you.

414
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,899
My way of thinking changed.

415
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:11,369
What? Have you been told you're cute?

416
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:12,871
I don't remember.

417
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:14,940
Even so, it has been decades.

418
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,742
Mom, has he told me that I'm cute?

419
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,679
I forgot if I said it or not.

420
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,847
-But I was thinking it.
-What?

421
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:24,916
-I thought it.
-You…

422
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:26,484
-You need to tell us.
-Yes?

423
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,923
Oh, come in.

424
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:37,529
Pardon me for disturbing your family time.

425
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:41,099
I heard from Mr. Kurisu

426
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:44,169
that your son will inherit it.

427
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:45,837
He's still young, but…

428
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,473
he understands horses more than I do.

429
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,309
Oh, my.

430
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:55,447
I also have a son,

431
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,684
and lately, he's been saying that he wants
to become a horse owner.

432
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:03,388
That's good. He earns his money, right?

433
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,857
Yes, he has met the requirements…

434
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:08,960
You don't want him to do it?

435
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:11,963
I didn't say that.

436
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,897
Afraid to lose?

437
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,065
I'm not afraid.

438
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,204
But I can't just lose so easily.

439
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:26,077
Battles that cannot be lost will continue.

440
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:29,080
When I think about it, I feel overwhelmed.

441
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:34,352
I was utterly absorbed
in competing with you every day.

442
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:37,789
It's going to be all right.

443
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:39,924
A child grows.

444
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:41,726
You should let him do it.

445
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:43,595
Yes.

446
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,702
I never said such silly things before.

447
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,939
Maybe I've matured a little bit.

448
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,714
President.

449
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,284
There's something
I'd like to consult with you about.

450
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:12,691
I'm still immature, you see.

451
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:20,065
Similarly, few racing insiders
paid much attention

452
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:22,701
to Royal Hope's first born.

453
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,169
That hurts, Family!

454
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:25,170
What's the matter?

455
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:27,338
He got scared of the puddle.

456
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,775
Sorry, he's incredibly timid.

457
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:31,976
And he bites!

458
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,514
We've had horses like this before.

459
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:39,417
In the meantime,
let's pair him with Shohei.

460
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:42,721
-It's hot.
-It's okay.

461
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,291
-Oh, it's good.
-Okay?

462
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:48,626
All right.

463
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:53,098
How's Shohei?

464
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:54,766
He's doing his best.

465
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:05,577
He's hit-or-miss, isn't he?
He's really good when he does do well.

466
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:08,980
It's his first year. It can't be helped.

467
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:16,020
How about you see him?
I think you should support him in person.

468
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,761
You know…

469
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,397
When I was watching

470
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:30,368
Shohei's back after his debut race,

471
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:33,905
I thought,

472
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:38,510
"Oh, this was my child, right?"

473
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:43,681
I was struck by that feeling.

474
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,358
I was happy.

475
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:58,096
But…

476
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,702
I realized that we're growing
separately as people.

477
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,642
I'm the one…

478
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,212
who needs to grow up fast.

479
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:19,217
I'll help.

480
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,654
Let's do our best.

481
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:38,203
Thank you.

482
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:51,716
Excuse us.

483
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,551
President.

484
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,521
I've brought Koichi.

485
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:03,995
President, congratulations.

486
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:08,766
Today, we registered
Royal Family as a racehorse.

487
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:10,168
Thank you very much.

488
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:18,676
Here you go.

489
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:24,349
I haven't handed it to you yet.

490
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:29,320
As my representative,
make sure he wins his debut race.

491
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,758
Of course.

492
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:43,468
His temper is worse than Hope's,

493
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,204
but he has agility.

494
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:50,341
Once the new year begins,
we'll put him in an outside stable.

495
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:53,411
He needs to be ridden
as much as possible before his debut.

496
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:54,512
Please do.

497
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:59,584
Also, please leave open the possibility
of focusing on short distances.

498
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:02,787
-What?
-To make use of his agility.

499
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:06,724
If it's a short-distance race,
it might work well with his temper.

500
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,727
Please wait a minute.
We can't do short-distance races.

501
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:11,763
-What?
-I mean…

502
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:15,667
I'm sorry. I'm just an amateur.

503
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:20,438
I never thought the day would come
when I'd say something like this to you.

504
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,877
The Arima Kinen
is a long-distance race of 2,500 meters.

505
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:28,046
Even if he wins in short-distance races,

506
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,415
I don't think he'll be able to win
at the crucial Arima race.

507
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:34,252
Our goal is to win
the Arima which Hope didn't win,

508
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,887
with Family, right?

509
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,288
So…

510
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:39,791
I'm sorry, but…

511
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:44,529
We can't do short-distance.

512
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:51,402
Understood. We'll keep exploring.

513
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,540
Shall we try the shadow roll?

514
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,409
What? I don't think he's going to like it.

515
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,677
I'll try it.

516
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,487
Are you not cold?

517
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:15,927
How is Koichi's thesis going?

518
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:18,629
I wonder.

519
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,834
He said he'd come
if he had the time and yet…

520
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:27,171
How long is he staying in that university?

521
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:29,407
It is a graduate school.

522
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:32,677
He's not repeating the year,
so don't worry.

523
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:35,913
I wanted to get out into society
as soon as possible.

524
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:42,086
I was only thinking about making money.

525
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:48,359
"The accumulation of all that effort
led me to the horses," right?

526
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,830
And now,

527
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,100
I can't imagine any other life.

528
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:01,939
Me too.

529
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,413
Let's wait for Family here.

530
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:23,628
I dream a lot these days.

531
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,765
I dream of winning the Arima.

532
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,605
I still haven't given up.

533
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:43,981
I'll say this first.

534
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,085
If…

535
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:50,788
I appear in your dreams,

536
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,126
don't think of me as a bother.

537
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:04,969
That's…

538
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:12,276
Understood.

539
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:24,288
I was an ordinary horse owner,

540
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:31,529
but getting you onto this path
was a great achievement.

541
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:12,436
What a great smell.

542
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:24,849
1800M ON TURF

543
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:28,753
Good morning.

544
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,022
-This one.
-Okay.

545
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:33,324
-For two, please.
-Understood.

546
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,660
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

547
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:40,164
The President had been planning
to come here today,

548
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:42,300
but he was not feeling well.

549
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,335
Can he watch the live broadcast?

550
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:46,370
He's with his family.

551
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:48,372
If he's not sleeping,
I'm sure he's watching.

552
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:50,374
Dad?

553
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:51,709
Mr. Sanno!

554
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:55,112
Can you hear me?
Mr. Sanno, do you recognize me?

555
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:57,648
THE WINNER'S CIRCLE

556
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,351
Is it okay?

557
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,087
For me, a representative, to be here?

558
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,924
It's the horse you picked.

559
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:08,759
Please be confident.

560
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:11,862
Hope! It's Family's debut!

561
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:17,368
The 100m was thrown
into chaos due to heavy rainfall.

562
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:19,170
-Next up we have…
-Let's do our best, okay?

563
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:23,341
You went all the way to the training
center to check up on Family?

564
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,376
Sorry for overstepping.

565
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,178
Hironaka made you ride him, right?

566
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,316
-What did you think after riding him?
-Moody, and he has a bad temper.

567
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:34,151
But, how do I put it?

568
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:38,055
He doesn't believe
that he'll take first place.

569
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:40,925
You're right.

570
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:44,161
Both the rider and horse
must first realize their own strength.

571
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:47,632
For the President's sake, we'll win.

572
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,438
-Can you hear me?
-Mr. Sanno!

573
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:56,974
-Mr. Sanno, can you hear us?
-Yutaro.

574
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,242
Yutaro.

575
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:02,213
Come, quick. Tell Mom, too.

576
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,581
Please tell her.

577
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:09,353
I wonder how he felt when seeing them off.

578
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,355
-Dad.
-Tokyo Racecourse, fifth race.

579
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:14,358
-Make Debut Tokyo Two-Year-Old.
-Dad, the race is starting.

580
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:17,128
-Family, you can do this.
-The 12 runners are entering the track.

581
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:19,363
Dad, Family's going to run.

582
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,299
Dad, watch!

583
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:26,370
-The doctor? Where is he?
-We'll explain.

584
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:27,204
Mom…

585
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:29,206
What is his condition?

586
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:38,983
What are you doing?
Connect it to the broadcast! Quickly!

587
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:41,285
Elena S. Henry.

588
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:45,690
Sired by Mezobach, 434 kilograms,
ridden by Norifumi Yokota.

589
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:48,125
Number Five, Nekowan Pence.

590
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:52,263
Sired by Making House, 464 kilograms,
ridden by Shota Kisaki.

591
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,266
-Do you want some?
-Number Six, Dip Babylon.

592
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:59,904
Sired by Valshare, 444 kilograms,
ridden by Ryusei Sakai.

593
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:00,805
There, there.

594
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:02,740
Face right and let go, please.

595
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:04,375
-Ridden by Yuki Takeda.
-Dad.

596
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,777
Number 12, Royal Family.

597
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:12,149
Sired by Royal Hope, 430 kilograms,
ridden by Ryujiro Saki.

598
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:14,218
These are the 12 horses for today.

599
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,055
-Dad!
-Tokyo Racecourse, fifth race.

600
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:20,558
-Watch, please watch!
-Make Debut Tokyo Two-Year-Old.

601
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:24,261
-Darling.
-A 1,800 meter turf, twelve horse race.

602
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:27,665
The starting gate is set up
at the entrance to the backstretch.

603
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:31,335
The turf is slippery due
to the continuous rainfall last night.

604
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:35,840
The jockeys' decision-making skills
will be tested by the damaged inner track.

605
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:39,343
Dip will get the win Valshare didn't.

606
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:43,347
They have entered the gate,
and the attendants have left.

607
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:46,617
The race has started!

608
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:48,686
All twelve horses set off together!

609
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:51,522
Number 12, Royal Family, started late!

610
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:54,358
In the pink helmet,
Royal Family takes after his sire!

611
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:56,694
He didn't need to inherit that.

612
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:59,964
Dip Babylon, sired by Valshare
is in a good position.

613
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,867
It's okay. You're fast.

614
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:04,635
Number One, Routh O. Heart, is leading.

615
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,370
Next is Number Six, Dip Babylon,

616
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:09,140
neck and neck
with Number Nine, Hourai Harlan.

617
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:11,842
Two lengths behind
is Number Eight, Oliver Kiss.

618
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,044
On the inside is Number Seven, Charlmino.

619
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:17,047
The condition of the inner track
has them running slightly wider.

620
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:19,183
The first 600 meters
were run in 36 seconds.

621
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,218
-Can you see?
-He knows.

622
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:24,822
Five lengths behind the mid-pack
is Number 11, Lucky Glamis.

623
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:29,093
Behind them is Number Two, Laia Ryoran,
neck and neck with Number Three, Kobre.

624
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,395
And Number 12, Royal Family, who was last…

625
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:33,697
-He's here!
-He's close to the inner track.

626
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:38,769
Saki powers through the rough track.
Royal Family advances on the inside.

627
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:41,472
-They're now approaching the third corner.
-Yes!

628
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,309
We'll show the President, Family!

629
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,212
You're seeing this, right?

630
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,381
1,000 meters remain.

631
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:53,250
Number 12, Royal Family, is moving up.

632
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:55,019
Number One, Routh O. Heart,
is running for it.

633
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:57,655
Number Six, Dip Babylon,
is in a good position in second place.

634
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:00,658
And only one-length away, Number 12,
Royal Family, has risen to third place.

635
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:03,661
We're in the middle of the third
and fourth corners…

636
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:07,298
Number Eight, Oliver Kiss, comes up to
fourth place lining up with Royal Family.

637
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:09,033
They're very similar.

638
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:12,937
Approaching the final corner.
The frontrunners are settled! 800 meters…

639
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:15,339
-Ryujiro, move to the outside!
-Get out of there, Ryu.

640
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:18,275
I can't get out.

641
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:22,112
Leading is Routh O. Heart,
Sakai makes his move with Dip Babylon.

642
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:23,514
They are only one half-length away.

643
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:25,149
Oliver Kiss is also coming up…

644
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:27,952
-On the inside is Royal Family!
-This is it, Family!

645
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:29,987
-He's coming up!
-Dad!

646
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:32,356
-They are in the fourth corner.
-Come on, Family!

647
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:33,724
Go, Family!

648
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:36,594
Fan favorite, Dip Babylon,
advances towards the lead.

649
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,663
-Go, Family!
-Can Dip Babylon meet fan expectations?

650
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:42,700
He gains a length!
Dip Babylon takes the lead.

651
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:43,934
Now!

652
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:48,439
Number 12, Royal Family,
is steadily making advances.

653
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,742
Dip Babylon is living up to his title
of fan favorite on the track!

654
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:53,244
Will one of the others take first?

655
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,846
Royal Family is speeding up.

656
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:58,215
The green helmet is in the lead.

657
00:41:58,282 --> 00:41:59,116
Go!

658
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,819
Royal Family overtakes from the inside.

659
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:05,789
Royal Family has advanced
towards the lead!

660
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,391
Please, Ryusei! Hang on!

661
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:09,360
Will they line up? He's advancing!

662
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:12,363
They have lined up. He overtakes…

663
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:16,500
Royal Family takes the lead!

664
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:18,068
Go! Family!

665
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:19,470
-Good.
-Okay.

666
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,906
Royal Family took the lead! What speed!

667
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:25,376
He is creating a two,
now three-length distance.

668
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:28,846
Will Dip Babylon catch up?

669
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:30,414
What a gap!

670
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:33,751
Royal Family is displaying
some incredible speed!

671
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:35,486
Dip Babylon can't catch up!

672
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,022
And Royal Family wins!

673
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:40,357
-Yes!
-Yes!

674
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:42,760
Number 12, Royal Family!

675
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:44,895
We did it!

676
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,031
Thank goodness!

677
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:49,300
He did it!

678
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,102
Dad, we won!

679
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:53,103
We won!

680
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,172
Okay!

681
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:03,380
I have decided on the article's title.

682
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:06,417
You need to take over.

683
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:07,418
Yes!

684
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:08,852
"Inheritance."

685
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:13,424
Congratulations.

686
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,900
It was great.

687
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:26,370
It was great.

688
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:38,682
Okay.

689
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:39,650
Koichi!

690
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:41,185
Koichi! Here!

691
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:43,020
-No, I'm fine here.
-Thank you.

692
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:44,888
Come on! You're the representative!

693
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,824
-No, I'm fine.
-Let's go.

694
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,592
Um, Mr. Kurisu is…

695
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:53,197
Mr. Kurisu,
could you please go in my place?

696
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:02,940
Mr. Kurisu?

697
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,162
The one standing beside Family,

698
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,499
should be you, Koichi.

699
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:32,903
From this moment on,

700
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:38,609
Family's owner…

701
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:43,947
is you, Koichi.

702
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:52,423
Horse Owner, please come.

703
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,997
Congratulations on your debut.

704
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:05,135
Let's go.

705
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,855
Everyone, please look here.

706
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,091
Smile!

707
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,198
Congratulations.
