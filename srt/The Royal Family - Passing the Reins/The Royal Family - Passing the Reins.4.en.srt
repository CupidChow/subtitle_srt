1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,440
Our next challenge.

2
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,476
We must get a horse at the auction.

3
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:11,511
<i>Eiji Kurisu is the secretary</i>

4
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:13,680
<i>for the Sanno Group's</i>
<i>Horse Racing Division.</i>

5
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:17,784
<i>Seeking a new racehorse,</i>
<i>he headed to Hokuryo Farm's premier sale.</i>

6
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:21,421
<i>However, after a bidding war exceeding</i>
<i>300 million yen with Yoshihiro Shiina,</i>

7
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:23,656
<i>he missed out on the promising new horse.</i>

8
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:26,993
<i>Kurisu then recommended</i>
<i>a 100-million-yen colt,</i>

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,462
<i>born at the family home of his ex,</i>
<i>Kanako Nozaki.</i>

10
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,031
Do you have the will to win?

11
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:33,099
- Cut it out, Dad!
- Oh, wow, well said.

12
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:36,536
<i>What seemed like a certain falling out…</i>

13
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:37,904
<i>I'll win the G1.</i>

14
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:40,340
<i>For that, I need a Hidaka horse.</i>

15
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,375
Let me join your dream.

16
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,910
Please, I beg you!

17
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:47,213
<i>Moved by Sanno's passionate sincerity,</i>
<i>Takeshi softened his stance.</i>

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,649
<i>Kurisu's team acquired the colt,</i>

19
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:53,053
<i>named him Royal Hope,</i>
<i>and aimed for the Arima Kinen, but…</i>

20
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,674
Hope!

21
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,784
See you, Hope.

22
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,925
Oh, three tail wags.

23
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:33,393
He's in a good mood.

24
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:35,395
Really?

25
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:38,865
<i>After building up his body</i>
<i>for a year at Nozaki Farm,</i>

26
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:42,936
<i>Hope moved to a training farm</i>
<i>for basic racehorse training,</i>

27
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:44,571
<i>known as breaking.</i>

28
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,146
Do your best!

29
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:54,948
Do your best!

30
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,752
Do your best!

31
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,725
Do your best!

32
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,094
Do your best!

33
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:28,815
Sorry to keep you waiting!

34
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,351
Oh, it's okay.

35
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:33,620
Sorry for calling you
all the way out here.

36
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,555
Where's the president?

37
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:38,057
He had to go to Maebashi
for his main business.

38
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:38,958
My apologies.

39
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:42,028
No, maybe it's for the best.

40
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:45,798
I don't know what he'd say
if he saw Hope now.

41
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:48,434
Let's discuss how to report it later.

42
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,469
Go ahead.

43
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:55,175
They say he hasn't
let his guard down at all.

44
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:58,511
No matter which staff member tries,
he won't run properly.

45
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,380
He's completely uncontrollable.

46
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:09,756
Looking for a jockey at this stage
is virtually unheard of.

47
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,827
If we don't have a breakthrough soon,
even his debut is in jeopardy.

48
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:20,567
I've been looking for a jockey
skilled at riding difficult horses,

49
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,402
but no one is interested.

50
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,038
Isn't there one person left?

51
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:26,973
Ryujiro Saki. What about him?

52
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,378
Oh, he's a candidate,
but maybe not realistic.

53
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,349
He's a jockey in the Iwate
local racing circuit right now.

54
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:37,750
Iwate?

55
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:44,891
<i>Hironaka and Kurisu</i>
<i>headed to Iwate to find a jockey</i>

56
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,594
<i>who can handle the wild horse, Hope.</i>

57
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,163
SAKI STABLES

58
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,402
- Ryujiro.
- You actually came.

59
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,371
How are things?

60
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,075
Oh, just so-so.

61
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:07,480
Oh, right. This is Eiji Kurisu,
the one I told you about on the phone.

62
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,382
Please, have this.

63
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:10,984
Thanks.

64
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,753
I'm Kurisu from Royal Human.

65
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:15,388
I'm Saki.

66
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:16,489
SAKI STABLE, JOCKEY

67
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:17,523
I'm a jockey.

68
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,891
Sorry.

69
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,693
- He's like this.
- It's fine.

70
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,629
Did you watch the video I sent?

71
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,932
Yeah, he's really giving you trouble.

72
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,500
It was funny.

73
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:31,938
Hey.

74
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:33,906
Mr. Saki.

75
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:37,877
I watched the video of you
riding in the Teio Sho.

76
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:41,347
It may be weird to be telling you this,

77
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:46,386
but your racing sense and your handling
of the reins really impressed me.

78
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,989
- Well, a national horse still overtook me.
- That's not…

79
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:51,791
Since your debut,

80
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,927
you've always ranked high
among the Iwate circuit's jockeys.

81
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,596
Which is no surprise.

82
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,965
No, it's nothing, really.

83
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,867
Let me get straight to the point.

84
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,103
Would you consider riding our Royal Hope?

85
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:05,738
What?

86
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:09,442
I told him that licenses for local
and national racing are different.

87
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,244
- Then you know I can't.
- We'll figure it out.

88
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:16,049
I knew it was a long shot
when I told him about you.

89
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,484
But it's not actually impossible, right?

90
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,286
Ryujiro, you were originally…

91
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:21,387
- Tanaka.
- Yes?

92
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,723
- Contact the farrier for tomorrow.
- I will.

93
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,824
Would you…

94
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,694
consider transferring
to the national circuit?

95
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:30,029
Hey.

96
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,331
Don't be unreasonable.

97
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:34,701
If you meet Hope,
I'm sure you'll understand his appeal.

98
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:36,803
Please consider it.

99
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,509
Only if that horse truly has talent.

100
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,879
I want horses that are easy to win with,
plain and simple.

101
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,316
But your horse…

102
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:52,552
seems questionable.

103
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,529
<i>Jockeys.</i>

104
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:04,597
<i>The JRA,</i>

105
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:08,468
<i>Japan's national racing authority,</i>
<i>currently employs about 150 jockeys.</i>

106
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:12,505
<i>In addition,</i>
<i>licensed foreign jockeys also participate.</i>

107
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,040
<i>To become a jockey,</i>

108
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,909
<i>one must generally graduate</i>
<i>from a racing school,</i>

109
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:20,446
<i>pass rigorous examinations,</i>
<i>and obtain a jockey license.</i>

110
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:25,051
<i>However, local racing operates</i>
<i>under a different type of jockey license.</i>

111
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,553
<i>Therefore, jockeys affiliated</i>
<i>with local racing</i>

112
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,191
<i>are not permitted to ride in</i>
<i>the national races, with some exceptions.</i>

113
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:33,693
<i>Local and National.</i>

114
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,929
<i>Even though they are all jockeys,</i>
<i>they live in different worlds.</i>

115
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:41,167
ROYAL HOPE

116
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,670
Local racing also has many unique horses.

117
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:48,708
Jockeys must have the skill to tame them.

118
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,748
I've been in a few
interleague races with him,

119
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,817
and his riding technique is genuine.

120
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,686
He has experience with unruly horses,

121
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:04,223
so Hope should be comfortable
running with him.

122
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,825
There are precedents, right?

123
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:08,828
People who transferred
from Local to National.

124
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:13,032
Only a handful.
It's that difficult a choice.

125
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:16,269
If the person isn't motivated,
we can't force him to.

126
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:24,010
<i>- Did you say, Ryujiro Saki?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

127
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:26,279
I see. Not bad.

128
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:27,680
He's very skilled.

129
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:31,851
However, he's completely
unenthusiastic about transferring.

130
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,086
Oh, I see.

131
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,088
Mr. Taira, if you know anything at all.

132
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,424
Any intel that may help me negotiate.

133
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,959
Could you tell me?

134
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,261
I could, but…

135
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,163
Can I write about it?

136
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,164
What?

137
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:49,168
"Widely detested, infamous horse owner,
Kozo Sanno

138
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,771
appoints troublemaker, Ryujiro Saki.

139
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,040
The full story!"

140
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:54,941
Troublemaker?

141
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:59,045
Did you know that Saki was enrolled
in the JRA Horseracing School?

142
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:02,615
No. So his debut was in National Racing?

143
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,383
No, he dropped out.

144
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,119
He got involved in a fight.

145
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,088
What?

146
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,058
Horseracing School students,
in their second year,

147
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:17,096
<i>are assigned to a stable</i>
<i>for practical training.</i>

148
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,800
That's when Saki and another student

149
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,236
got in a fight,
right in the training center.

150
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:28,908
Saki, labeled a troublemaker,
got isolated at the stable and the school.

151
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:32,812
<i>Not long after, he dropped out,</i>
<i>went back to Morioka, his hometown,</i>

152
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:36,015
<i>and made his debut as a Local Jockey.</i>

153
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,284
What was the cause of the incident?

154
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,554
Who knows? It was just some kids fighting.

155
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:47,126
Man, this would make
for an interesting article!

156
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,596
What do you think?

157
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:55,101
Mr. Hironaka recommended him.
So I believe he is the right choice.

158
00:08:58,804 --> 00:08:59,639
What?

159
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,875
"The Elites' Future Forecast."

160
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:06,379
Oh, this is Mr. Shiina's horse.

161
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:07,813
Valshare.

162
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,817
The problem is that Hope's name…

163
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:12,818
Is it in there?

164
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,355
It's not.

165
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,827
Those reporters haven't done
enough homework.

166
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,764
Those aren't the only horses!

167
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:28,601
But a horse doesn't run alone.

168
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:33,039
It depends on the people around it
and the passion poured into it.

169
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:37,043
So I think we can rewrite
this forecast if we want to.

170
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,912
You're getting bolder, aren't you?

171
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:41,948
Oh, my apologies.

172
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,918
So, President,
what about Mr. Saki's transfer?

173
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:47,887
I don't like him.

174
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,355
What?

175
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:53,392
Why did Hironaka choose
such a difficult guy?

176
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,962
Shouldn't he pick one
that's won a national race?

177
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,764
It's because…

178
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:05,071
He is a jockey with that much potential.

179
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,076
President.

180
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,079
To turn the odds,

181
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:17,016
sometimes we must go off the rails
and take a bold strategy.

182
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:21,854
"A notable jockey transfers from Local,
choosing to ride Royal Hope!"

183
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:24,924
The media would eat it up.

184
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:26,692
Media attention, huh?

185
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,462
- Yes.
- Can you convince him?

186
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,299
I will go to Iwate again.

187
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:40,473
You're persistent.
I already told you it was unreasonable.

188
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:44,377
All the more reason to.
The satisfaction would be immense.

189
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:48,047
If you transfer and succeed in National,

190
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,650
I believe many racing fans
would be delighted.

191
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,086
That was your dream back then, right?

192
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:57,823
I apologize.

193
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,860
I heard about your time
at the Horseracing School from a friend.

194
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,428
I see.

195
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,097
How about this?

196
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:12,071
If you want me, no matter what,
entrust that horse to a stable in Morioka.

197
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,607
If you stable him here, I'll ride him.

198
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,409
Sounds reasonable, right?

199
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,412
I'm afraid we can't.

200
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,515
We are aiming to win a G1,

201
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,850
the Arima Kinen, with Royal Hope.

202
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,155
I see. That's good.

203
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:30,756
You dream big.

204
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,561
Everyone wants to race nationals.

205
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:38,998
You're arrogant.

206
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,201
- I'm done here.
- Mr. Saki!

207
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:46,272
Not every jockey
can be lured by the national circuit.

208
00:11:58,484 --> 00:11:59,852
RYUJIRO'S FATHER

209
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,456
<i>His old man is a trainer in Morioka.</i>

210
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:06,659
Indeed, local racing has its own pride.

211
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,561
I acted carelessly.

212
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:12,598
I thought there was no "local"
or "national" in horse racing.

213
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:13,733
<i>What should we do?</i>

214
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,668
Should I look for another jockey?

215
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,370
<i>You do that, Mr. Hironaka.</i>

216
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:22,408
I'll try to think on Mr. Saki some more.

217
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:27,379
<i>I just can't see him</i>
<i>as a mere troublemaker.</i>

218
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,183
I've confirmed the facts.

219
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,352
It's quite a serious problem, isn't it?

220
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,087
ROYAL HUMAN HR DIRECTOR

221
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,123
Thank you for notifying me.

222
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,193
I will conduct
an internal investigation immediately.

223
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,261
Really?

224
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,563
Then we'll publish this next…

225
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:02,148
I'll make the payment today.

226
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,249
Thank you.

227
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,986
Actually, I have one more thing.
A different story.

228
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,622
Are you interested?

229
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,696
You okay?

230
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:19,331
Oh, my.

231
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:20,866
Hello.

232
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,601
Oh, Ryujiro!

233
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,605
- I'll take over.
- Thanks.

234
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,941
There, there.

235
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,709
There, there.

236
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:34,046
Huh? It hurts, doesn't it?

237
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,182
You want to run full tilt, right?

238
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,417
Let's take our time to heal.

239
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,520
Take it slow.

240
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:44,356
There, there.

241
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,158
- All yours.
- Okay.

242
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,333
How is he?

243
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,869
He's okay.

244
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,909
You can still run.

245
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,347
This is why you left National
to come to Iwate!

246
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,954
<i>That was your dream back then, right?</i>

247
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,757
Try saying that again!

248
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,659
- Stop it!
- How are we different?

249
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,995
- Hey!
- Stop it, Ryujiro!

250
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:25,130
- Let me go!
- What are you doing here?

251
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,213
Sorry.

252
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,382
This horse is too difficult.

253
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:48,287
I understand you want to stick
to Hidaka horses, but…

254
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,223
Thank you. I'll consider it.

255
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,904
Completely hopeless.

256
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,039
The trainers want to give up too.

257
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,608
Mr. Saki is our only hope.

258
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,412
What about his assault case?

259
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,349
I'm trying to find someone
who knows what happened.

260
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,086
They all seem to agree
Mr. Saki was the aggressor.

261
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,455
You'll have to ask him yourself.

262
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,624
That's impossible.

263
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,326
He's still wary of me.

264
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,495
Just like Hope.

265
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:32,464
Indeed.

266
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:40,005
Sorry for burdening you with this.

267
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,710
But please, keep doing your best.

268
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,214
MR. TAIRA

269
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,349
Oh, it's Mr. Taira.

270
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:52,651
Yes, hello?

271
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,220
<i>I found out who fought with Saki.</i>

272
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:56,755
What?

273
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:58,524
<i>A jockey named Matsui.</i>

274
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:04,163
<i>His father is also a jockey,</i>
<i>and he's an up-and-coming rookie.</i>

275
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,000
Mr. Matsui!

276
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,737
No, he attacked me first.

277
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,039
That was years ago.

278
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:17,042
Everyone who goes to that school
has a dream, you know.

279
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,646
- Is it something one simply gives up on?
- Leave me alone.

280
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,815
Please. Tell me something, anything.

281
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:23,849
Excuse me.

282
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,584
I have to go.

283
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:29,955
Hello.

284
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,293
It's about Ryujiro Saki, isn't it?

285
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,694
What?

286
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:40,099
You have been asking around about him.

287
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,967
It's become a bit of a rumor.

288
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,203
Oh, I see.

289
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,205
I don't know what to say…

290
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:47,873
How embarrassing.

291
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,376
- President, your meeting…
- I know.

292
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,380
Are you free tonight?

293
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:56,949
What?

294
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,752
So he rode one of your horses
during training?

295
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:00,652
Yes.

296
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,321
I remember it well.

297
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,457
He worked as hard as a professional.

298
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:10,295
He was dedicated
to building trust with the horses.

299
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:14,299
Mr. Ogino thought highly of him.
It's a shame he got into that fight.

300
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,238
Do you know the cause?

301
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:21,573
More or less.

302
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:25,244
That jockey, Matsui, whom you talked to…

303
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:29,481
It seems he would mock Saki
about him being from a local stable.

304
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,283
On that day too.

305
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:35,788
Hello.

306
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,891
Good morning, sir!

307
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:40,959
How's our horse doing?

308
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,094
Oh, right.

309
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:44,363
Looking good.

310
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,132
It's like he knows how to win.

311
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:49,768
I think he will grow more.

312
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:53,639
Perhaps we'll work together someday.

313
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:55,707
Keep up the good work.

314
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:57,509
Yes, sir.

315
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,448
Thank you!

316
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,454
Sales talk, huh?

317
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,658
It must be tough trying to get ahead.

318
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,028
I was just talking about the horse.

319
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,196
There aren't any…

320
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,098
Horses like that in Morioka.

321
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,667
He's wasted on you.

322
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:27,005
It's not your own talent.

323
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:30,175
The horses here
are all on a different level.

324
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,911
Compared to your local horses.

325
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,550
Try saying that again!

326
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,453
<i>No one defended Saki.</i>

327
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,623
Matsui is the son
of a famous jockey, and besides,

328
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,025
Saki threw the first punch.

329
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:48,127
It was inexcusable.

330
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,297
Still, he shouldn't have quit.

331
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,399
If you run away, everything's over.

332
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,169
Was this helpful?

333
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,037
Thank you.

334
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:00,806
It's more than enough.

335
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,376
Valshare debuts next year.

336
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:08,247
I plan to appoint Matsui as his jockey.

337
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:10,949
He has grown, too.

338
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:14,520
It's only natural to want
an in-demand jockey.

339
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,998
This is an accusation regarding
double dispatching.

340
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,432
I already gave them money.

341
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,668
So this matter…

342
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,205
is handled.

343
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,441
But shady dealings continue.

344
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,811
We need to stop
those transactions right away

345
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,947
and reorganize the staff.

346
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:43,916
Can you leave this to me?

347
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:45,918
I will handle this.

348
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:47,553
Father.

349
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:50,622
I'll make changes.
But I won't fire anyone.

350
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,325
This is my responsibility.

351
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,128
You sure talk big.

352
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:57,863
What?

353
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,800
One more thing I want to talk about…

354
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:04,603
Oh.

355
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:09,241
What is it?

356
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,445
Never mind.

357
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:14,346
Hey!

358
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,417
Why not just leave it to him?

359
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:19,718
KOZO'S WIFE

360
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:20,886
It's unseemly…

361
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,589
to always want to get ahead.

362
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:30,596
Shorten the distance.

363
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:31,563
Okay.

364
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:33,298
That's right.

365
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:35,634
- Don't be scared.
- Sorry.

366
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,010
Do you have travel fees to burn?

367
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,512
I heard your story from Mr. Shiina.

368
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:50,849
Let's talk again.

369
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,021
<i>He must also have been desperate.</i>
<i>Go ahead.</i>

370
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:00,759
I think he just didn't want to lose
to someone from Local,

371
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,394
who he thinks is inferior.

372
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:05,464
But…

373
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,798
I couldn't bear it.

374
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:11,603
How are we so different?

375
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,740
No matter where you're born,
people are people.

376
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,541
Horses are horses.

377
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,410
You're right.

378
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:21,513
So can you really blame me for giving up?

379
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,923
It's the same with our Hope.

380
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:37,129
Hope was born in Hidaka,
and his breeders had high hopes for him.

381
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:43,535
But no owner believed in his ability.

382
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,341
"If you go to Hokuryo Farm,
you can find sure-win horses."

383
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,545
And so, they dismissed Hope.

384
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:59,551
But our president declared,

385
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,855
"We will win with a Hidaka horse."

386
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:09,528
For both horse and rider,
where you are born doesn't matter.

387
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:12,130
Talent is talent.

388
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:17,803
We will win the Arima Kinen
with Royal Hope.

389
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:23,842
A Hidaka horse from a small farm
will beat Hokuryo's ones.

390
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,920
I didn't think
you were this passionate, Mr. Kurisu.

391
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:43,962
We have a week to register you
for the JRA jockey license exam.

392
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:45,731
Please.

393
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,568
Come with us and win the Arima.

394
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,241
I understand how you feel.

395
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,377
But…

396
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:03,515
those feelings are not enough
to win me over.

397
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,752
Is there nothing
that can be done with Hope?

398
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,355
<i>We've done everything we can,</i>
<i>but nothing is working.</i>

399
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,925
Does Kurisu know about this?

400
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:14,826
<i>Yes.</i>

401
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,497
He's still working on our last chance.

402
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:22,134
I apologize for the delayed report.

403
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,069
So?

404
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,939
- Do you want me to give up on Hope?
- No.

405
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:29,741
That's not it.

406
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:30,742
<i>Then what?</i>

407
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,845
It's true that if you look at Hope now

408
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,348
and say you're aiming for Arima,
people will laugh at you.

409
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:41,620
But I'm captivated by
Hope's true strength.

410
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:43,822
<i>In his refusal to yield,</i>

411
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:48,059
<i>I feel a fighting spirit and a power</i>
<i>that speed alone cannot measure.</i>

412
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:52,798
Could you please trust us
and wait just a little longer?

413
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:56,468
<i>Can you bet on us?</i>

414
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:58,170
<i>Mr. Saki.</i>

415
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,940
Are you fine with running away like this?

416
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,446
You don't understand, Mr. Kurisu.

417
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,652
If I leave, what will happen
to this place?

418
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:18,623
I left once before, aiming to go National.

419
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:26,298
And then, when I turned tail and ran home,
they welcomed me back.

420
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:31,403
They didn't say anything.

421
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:36,575
So…

422
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,447
Do you think I can just leave again?

423
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:49,855
I'm sorry for not understanding anything.

424
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,458
Now you know.

425
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:00,832
What are you doing?

426
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,168
Don't use us as an excuse.

427
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,504
What?

428
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,908
Hey!

429
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,710
Don't mess with me!

430
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:16,748
Even if you aren't here,
this place won't go under.

431
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:20,752
I'll stand on my own two feet
until I die, so…

432
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,588
Stand on your own too!

433
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:28,026
<i>Hironaka.</i>

434
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:32,397
I've told you many times,
I don't know anything about horses.

435
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:36,067
<i>So I have no choice but to bet on you two.</i>

436
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:39,337
Don't give up.

437
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,307
I won't either.

438
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:44,743
Yes.

439
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:51,383
I'm betting on me too.

440
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:57,489
- Oh, thank you.
- Hello, President Okabayashi.

441
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,024
It's been a while.

442
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,358
You look well as always.

443
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,128
- Sorry for the sudden call.
- It's fine.

444
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,197
- What is it today?
- Oh, right.

445
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:07,699
You're scaring me.

446
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:08,600
No…

447
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:10,835
SANNO BUILDING

448
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,638
All 150 people
who were dispatched to the port

449
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:16,875
were transferred to a different industry.

450
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:19,711
Of course, it was all done legitimately.

451
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,414
No one had to be let go.

452
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,717
Money can be recovered,

453
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:29,054
but once you sack someone,
they won't come back.

454
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:32,757
I always say this,
but people are our greatest asset.

455
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:38,964
Oh, Chief.

456
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,131
Excuse me.

457
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:41,967
What is it?

458
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:43,501
Well…

459
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:48,506
We've finally found a jockey
who will ride Royal Hope.

460
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:51,876
A hiring?
In HR, that's all in a day's work.

461
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:54,346
I don't see how this is important.

462
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:57,849
<i>It's me.</i>

463
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,517
Regarding you-know-what,

464
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:03,355
I will not be involved at all,
so do what you want.

465
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,530
Please wait!

466
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:14,966
They are waiting for your reply.

467
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:16,101
You do that.

468
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:18,603
- No, but…
- I'm leaving it to you!

469
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:22,507
At least tell me what business you are…

470
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,779
Ms. Takeda, what's wrong?

471
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,916
Mr. Kurisu, this needs
to be finalized today,

472
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,218
but I have a meeting.

473
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:34,152
<i>Then I'll handle it.</i>

474
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,620
<i>Thank you!</i>

475
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:47,432
Oh, my.

476
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,035
- Can I pay by card?
- Yes.

477
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,076
MAEBASHI GENERAL HOSPITAL

478
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:09,020
I told you it was just an examination.

479
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:12,223
I thought it was a surgery.

480
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,658
How are you feeling?

481
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,193
I think I can eat today.

482
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,561
That's good.

483
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:18,797
Thank you.

484
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,768
ROOM 121
MIKIKO NAKAJO

485
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:25,937
You're overreacting.

486
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:07,078
Ryujiro.

487
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:09,380
He's here.

488
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,862
He's very spirited.

489
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:32,003
Is that so? There, there.

490
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:35,507
It's your debut too.

491
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,244
I'm also trying again.

492
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,084
Three times.

493
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:47,952
What?

494
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:49,521
Three tail wags.

495
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:51,322
There, there.

496
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,858
Shall we run together?

497
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,462
Okay. There, there.

498
00:29:58,429 --> 00:29:59,564
One, two.

499
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:01,466
Okay.

500
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,602
There, there. Let's do our best.

501
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:08,540
Let's go. Good boy.

502
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:11,976
Okay. Calm down. Take your time.

503
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:13,311
Hello.

504
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:14,946
Even if we're behind schedule,
don't panic.

505
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:16,447
Yes, I understand.

506
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:20,151
RIDING TECHNIQUES
NATIONAL CIRCUIT EXPLAINED

507
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:21,753
NATIONAL CIRCUIT JOCKEY EXAM

508
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,692
That's good.

509
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:31,362
VALSHARE

510
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:37,769
There, there.

511
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:39,971
There, there.

512
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,156
Ryujiro.

513
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,091
The exam…

514
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:01,926
The exam results…

515
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:06,931
<i>Congratulations.</i>

516
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:14,706
I thought once he got in the JRA,
he would want to start racing immediately.

517
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,476
But he insisted on debuting with Hope.

518
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:21,579
He's a great person.

519
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:23,147
I'm sure you will like him.

520
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,583
Let's see him run first.

521
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:30,021
Ryujiro.

522
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:31,356
Hey.

523
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:42,867
Is that him? What a playboy.

524
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:45,904
His appearance is rather unique.

525
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,255
What?

526
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:06,090
Who is it?

527
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,693
- Hello!
- Ryujiro's parents.

528
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,594
Please follow me.

529
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:12,030
No, we'll stay here.

530
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,631
Oh, but…

531
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:17,702
Don't tell him we came. Please.

532
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:21,973
Understood.

533
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:26,611
- Please give this to him.
- Of course.

534
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,449
For getting him to come all this way…

535
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,651
Thank you so much.

536
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:36,454
Oh, I didn't do anything…

537
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:39,424
He's a wonderful manager.

538
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:54,806
Good job!

539
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:56,240
Thanks.

540
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,409
- Good job.
- Thanks.

541
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,779
What? What is this?

542
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:02,880
<i>Gomasuri dango</i>!

543
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:05,016
Nice one, Mr. Kurisu.

544
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:13,291
When I was at the Horseracing School,

545
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:21,566
my parents would bring some
when they came for the annual meeting.

546
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:22,467
GOMASURI DANGO

547
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,969
That school's diet restrictions
are very strict.

548
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:29,440
So I looked forward to these.

549
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:36,681
Yeah.

550
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:39,951
This is it.

551
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:46,657
Oh, right. Mr. Kurisu.

552
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:47,558
Yes?

553
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,229
From now on, call me Ryujiro.

554
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:52,330
What?

555
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:55,033
That's my lucky charm.

556
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:58,136
Then I'll tell the president that.

557
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,670
No, you do it too.

558
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:01,606
But I'm just his secretary.

559
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:03,041
We're a team, though.

560
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:04,609
Oh, my.

561
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,277
Well then…

562
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,913
Ryujiro.

563
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:12,116
Jeez, you're making it weird!

564
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:13,051
Don't blush.

565
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:15,319
I'll get used to it, gradually.

566
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,354
Okay.

567
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:22,060
How did I do?

568
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:24,362
On today's run.

569
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,697
Your honest thoughts.

570
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:29,734
I'll buy one.

571
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:31,836
A betting ticket.

572
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:33,704
I'll bet on you.

573
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,574
Okay.

574
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:38,810
Thank you.

575
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:44,615
Oh, it hurts!

576
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:47,218
- Did he bite you again?
- Yes!

577
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:49,954
Tomorrow is his debut.
He's probably pumped up.

578
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:51,923
- Do you get bitten too, Ms. Yasukawa?
- Me?

579
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,458
No, I don't.

580
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:54,492
Why?

581
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:58,696
<i>What are the odds?</i>

582
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:02,567
Tenth out of twelve horses, 101.9.

583
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:06,771
Which is the favorite?

584
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,241
The one we failed to get.

585
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:12,076
Valshare.

586
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:14,245
Mr. Shiina's horse.

587
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:15,880
Thank you for waiting.

588
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,784
- Congrats on your debut race!
- Yes!

589
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:23,554
Gotta show the kid a good race.

590
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:25,857
Hope!

591
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:28,759
ROYAL HOPE

592
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:35,833
Well then, please do your best.

593
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:37,802
Long time no see.

594
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:45,643
I apologize for the trouble
I caused back then.

595
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:48,279
I'm excited for our race.

596
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,652
- I'll come by later.
- Understood.

597
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:03,895
I'll teach you the difference
in our levels.

598
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,501
A message from the president.

599
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:16,274
"No matter what, we will not remove you.

600
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:19,977
Don't focus on immediate wins.
I want you to nurture Hope."

601
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,014
I told you before,

602
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,284
it's up to Hope whether I keep riding him.

603
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:29,787
"Immediate wins"?

604
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:35,626
- Of course I ride to win.
- Stop!

605
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,795
<i>Leading jockey, you say?</i>

606
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,164
But that was in Local, right? I wonder.

607
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:43,534
And he's on a Royal horse
with an unknown pedigree.

608
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,603
A horse from Hidaka.

609
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:47,872
Yes.

610
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,607
Valshare's a sure win.

611
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:56,314
I think so too.

612
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:03,688
But what are these
expectations I'm having?

613
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:31,082
<i>Tokyo Racecourse Fourth Race,</i>

616
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:38,456
<i>On the topic of debuts,</i>

617
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:41,926
<i>one of the jockeys, Ryujiro Saki,</i>
<i>has been active in Iwate racing,</i>

618
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:44,962
<i>and he will be making</i>
<i>his national debut in this race.</i>

619
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:46,330
<i>Let's look forward to it.</i>

620
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,300
<i>His aggressive riding style</i>
<i>is his trademark,</i>

621
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,535
<i>but the JRA circuit is unfamiliar to him.</i>

622
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,405
<i>Let's see what kind of race he'll give us!</i>

623
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:58,542
Hello.

624
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,811
Hope looks a bit nervous.

625
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,347
TOKYO FOURTH RACE - MAKE DEBUT TOKYO

626
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,354
Is that our new jockey uniform?

627
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:12,323
It looks great on the turf.

633
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,204
<i>The start is from the backstretch.</i>

634

<i>Oh, no.</i>

636

<i>Number 12, Royal Hope,</i>
<i>is resisting going to the gate.</i>

637
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:39,617
- Hope…
<i>- Number 12 is refusing to enter.</i>

638
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:41,519
It's okay.

639
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:43,688
I'm here with you.

644

<i>The handler moves away.</i>

645

<i>They're off!</i>

646
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,070
<i>- Number 12, Royal Hope, is slow to start.</i>
- Oh, no.

Sorry, please look at the camera.

712
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:52,670
To the victory of the Royal Family.

713
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,839
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

714
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,775
Wait. Why are you taking charge?

715
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:59,810
- We're a family, right?
- Family.

716
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:01,845
Sorry, he fell asleep.

717
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,047
It's okay.

718
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:04,515
Sleep well, grow well.

719
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:08,385
President.

720
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:14,091
Please let me ride that horse
until you don't need me anymore.

721
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:15,392
Please.

722
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:18,362
I'm counting on you.

723
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:23,834
Thanks!

724
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,837
Thanks.

725
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:31,342
President. Hope.

726
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:33,410
And Ryujiro Saki.

727
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:35,879
I like that they all have
their own struggles.

728
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:39,283
Let's eat.

729
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:42,186
- Mr. Kurisu.
- Yes?

730
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,724
I think the article
will take a bit longer.

731
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:49,960
I want to see you guys reach the goal,

732
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:55,399
then tell the fans
that a loving family like this exists.

733
00:43:57,868 --> 00:43:59,003
I understand.

734
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:01,839
By the way,
can we change the jockey silks?

735
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:03,674
They're so tacky, aren't they?

736
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:07,044
If we're going to win the Arima,
that silk's too…

737
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:08,078
Hey, Ryujiro.

738
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,213
You're going too far.

739
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:10,881
But, Mr. Hironaka…

740
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,017
All right.

741
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:15,019
- I'll change them.
- What?

742
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:16,453
- Oh, wow!
- You approve?

743
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,421
Here we go!

744
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,456
But no flamboyant stuff!

745
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:22,426
Come on, President,
let's think about this.

746
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,328
<i>Their winning streak starts now.</i>

747
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:27,531
<i>Without a doubt,</i>
<i>Hope will be the center of his generation.</i>

748
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:31,402
<i>Kurisu and everyone on the team</i>
<i>had that feeling.</i>

749
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:33,103
<i>At least for now.</i>

750
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:37,541
I get my treatment at ten, okay?

751
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:40,844
Got it.

752
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:45,482
Buy me a cream puff as a treat.

753
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:46,917
You can't eat those.

754
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:48,819
I want to.

755
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,322
Cake would be fine too.

756
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,262
Got it. I'll go buy one.

757
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,133
I'll buy it, so…

758
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:07,304
Do your best, Mom.

759
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:09,807
Thank you, Koichi.

760
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,478
<i>Mr. Kurisu.</i>

761
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:16,547
Have you read this?

762
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:18,315
What?

763
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,452
THE PRESIDENT HAS AN ILLEGITIMATE CHILD

764
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,621
THE PRESIDENT HAS AN ILLEGITIMATE CHILD

765
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:25,355
<i>Excuse me.</i>

766
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,425
You dropped this.

767
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:30,627
Thank you.

768
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:39,937
I'll handle it myself.

769
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:43,273
I still haven't found the courage
to tell him about his father.

770
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,509
<i>I'm cheering for Royal Hope.</i>

771
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:48,946
You have a mission, to take Hope to Arima.

772
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:49,947
