1
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:12,879
How's Royal Family doing?

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,583
He's doing all right, thankfully.

3
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:19,152
His eye is recovering well, too.

4
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,353
Excellent.

5
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,722
Will you aim for it?

6
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:26,426
This year's Arima Kinen?

7
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:29,696
Yes.

8
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,934
Before the Arima Kinen,
we are planning to run

9
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:38,104
in three major races,
including next week’s Sapporo Kinen.

10
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:43,009
For Royal Family to meet
the Arima entry requirements,

11
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:48,581
he needs to win
at least one of those three races.

12
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,785
Is it reckless?

13
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:56,389
As the owner, it’s only natural
to have high expectations.

14
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,428
We will win at least one
of the remaining three races,

15
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:04,097
and meet the entry requirements
for the Arima.

16
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:05,999
Our horse…

17
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,602
will be ridden by Ryujiro Saki.

18
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:10,637
Which horse?

19
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:11,938
Big Hope.

20
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:15,442
Sired by Royal Hope.

21
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:23,183
This is the only one of Hope's that I own,
approved of by President Sanno.

22
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,087
I wanted to tell you both in person.

23
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:29,856
Is that so?

24
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:31,925
Thank you.

25
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:36,629
It may have been in Royal Family’s
shadow in terms of attention,

26
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,400
but it continues to grow stronger.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,504
I've always wanted to ask you.

28
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:51,077
Why was Royal Hope chosen to be the sire?

29
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:56,950
Hope, who's from a small farm in Hidaka,
and retired without ever winning a G1.

30
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:58,985
Why did you purchase his semen?

31
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:06,226
It's Royal Hope, a horse you said
you couldn't help but despise.

32
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,597
There's only one reason
for choosing a horse,

33
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:12,298
it's to win.

34
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:15,602
The reason stays the same,
no matter which horse you choose.

35
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:20,707
However, what they choose to inherit
differs from person to person.

36
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,445
With President Sanno gone,

37
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,148
I've felt really lonely.

38
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,289
FIRST RACE - SAPPORO KINEN

39
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:44,464
Are dreams a fantasy,

40
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,466
or something to be achieved?

41
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,534
ROYAL FAMILY

42
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,037
Four months left until the Arima Kinen.

43
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:57,710
Royal Family had fully healed
from his corneal transplant.

44
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:02,282
However, in his comeback race,
the Sapporo Kinen, he finished second.

45
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,018
The fans applauded him,

46
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,754
but there were no smiles
among the Royal team.

47
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,423
Five years old, huh…

48
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,226
It's impossible for him to win this year.

49
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:17,096
Meanwhile, the rival team with So Perfect…

50
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:21,201
After capturing all the three-year-old
Classics without a single loss,

51
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:24,804
they declared their intention
to enter the Arima Kinen,

52
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,773
seeking to achieve an unprecedented feat.

53
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:30,476
Congratulations!

54
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,146
Just as you declared,
you've surpassed your father!

55
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,183
I wonder why.

56
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:40,753
It's disappointing.

57
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,161
And next, The Autumn Tenno Sho.

58
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,866
-Ryusei. Do your best.
-Thank you.

59
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:57,003
Their opponent was the champion
Rainbow Camp,

60
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,072
owned by Yoshihiro Shiina.

61
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:02,208
Let's do our best.

62
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,346
All horses are in position.

63
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,582
TENNO SHO (AUTUMN)

64
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:10,917
And they're off!

65
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:15,221
The Royal team once again
challenged the Autumn Tenno Sho,

66
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,090
where they previously fell to rock bottom.

67
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:20,627
He came close,
but once again fell short of first place.

68
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,198
What a champion!
Rainbow Camp crosses the finish line!

69
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,968
With Family's current prize money,

70
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,571
they were unable to secure
the coveted ticket to his dream,

71
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:38,311
his only remaining path to the Arima Kinen
was to win the next Japan Cup.

72
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,780
"Royal can't win it,"

73
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:43,249
the fans’ opinions
had become increasingly severe.

74
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:46,786
RAINBOW CAMP

75
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,892
I'm dreaming of the peak.

76
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,561
I want to make our horse
the best in Japan.

77
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,332
At the Arima Kinen.

78
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:05,805
My goal is to win a G1
with a horse from this farm.

79
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,173
My father's dream

80
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,477
is the dream of everyone in Hidaka.

81
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,513
I have one more dream.

82
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:18,284
To achieve that win with a Hidaka horse.

83
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,825
It's the autumn G1, the Japan Cup.
Mr. Katsuura?

84
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,026
-Yes.
-A win here…

85
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,529
It could be a game-changer,
making the Arima Kinen a reality.

86
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:32,532
Absolutely. It’s a huge race
with 500 million yen on the line.

87
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:35,568
It's very important
for those targeting the Arima.

88
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,070
WINNING CHARM

89
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,472
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

90
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,708
Thank you.

91
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,547
Under the name Yoshihiro Shiina,
for three, please.

92
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,583
I don't mean to get in your way.

93
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,355
Just know that there isn’t a single race
we can afford to lose.

94
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:57,623
Please consider this as fate.

95
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:03,396
It almost sounds as if you’re saying
we’re the ones who’ll lose.

96
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:08,167
Our team and Royal Family,

97
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:12,205
we have not given up,
not a single one of us.

98
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:15,608
Some laugh and say
it's impossible for us to win.

99
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,377
I've got it.

100
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:22,615
Others try to console us,

101
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,017
saying we did our best.

102
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:29,589
But this isn’t the first time
we’ve heard those words.

103
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:32,692
The path to glory is open.
Which horse, and which jockey, will it be?

104
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,694
-Takeshi!
-Hey!

105
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,363
-Let's watch together!
-We're going to win this!

106
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,165
Our dream still hasn't changed.

107
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,968
We’ll cross the finish line
before anyone else,

108
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:44,437
and earn our place in the Arima Kinen.

109
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,979
I'm looking forward to it.

110
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,463
I want to watch Family run

111
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,498
up close today.

112
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,568
Understood.

113
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,373
Are dreams a fantasy,

114
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,375
or something to be achieved?

115
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,610
They would surely say,

116
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:27,079
"A dream is something you live."

117
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,316
As you live pursuing your dreams,

118
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:33,853
before you know it,
you find yourself living with them.

119
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:38,057
All right. We can win this.

120
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,292
JAPAN CUP

121
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:40,760
Tokyo Racecourse, Race 12.

122
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,663
Today's main race is
the Japan Autumn International…

123
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:44,697
You can do it.

124
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,032
The 42nd Japan Cup…

125
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,967
He's bothered by the crowd.

126
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,435
You can do it, Family.

127
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,672
This year, there are
three foreign contenders.

128
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,740
From France, Number Three Brulo.

129
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,343
Excuse me, one with kakiage, please.

130
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,578
-Okay.
-Why now?

131
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,880
Okay, then for me…

132
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,515
-Kitsune noodles, please.
-Okay.

133
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,250
-Can we turn the TV on?
-Go ahead.

134
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,186
As for Royal, he hasn't won
a single race since his comeback.

135
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:10,122
Yes. His sire, Hope, also never won a G1.

136
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,191
It does feel like
they don't have it in them.

137
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:15,495
Number 18 Caban. And from Ireland…

138
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,597
-Thank you for waiting.
-Thanks.

139
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,131
With those three horses…

140
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:22,068
That international horse,
Great Escape, is good.

141
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:27,206
I didn’t realize
it was this hard for a horse,

142
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,375
to earn the money it needs to live.

143
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,010
Over these past five years,

144
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,514
we’ve done all we possibly could.

145
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,251
Number Five, Rainbow Camp,
winner of the Autumn Tenno Sho.

146
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:41,787
Now, it’s up to Shohei and Family.

147
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,557
Oh, a rider is down!

148
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,326
Royal Family's jockey,
Shohei Nozaki, is down!

149
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:48,461
Family.

150
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,297
Royal Family, runner-up
in the previous Tenno Sho,

151
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,100
watches for a winning chance today
as the sixth favorite.

152
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,771
All horses are now in position.

153
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:02,608
And they’re off!

154
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:06,712
Number Three, Brulo,
and Number Ten Court Mayel trail behind.

155
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,048
They sweep past the grandstand.

156
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,384
Number Five Rainbow Camp
is also trailing behind…

157
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,952
Hey.

158
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,287
On the inside, Number Nine…

159
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,389
-Family!
-Go!

160
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:18,658
In second place is Number 11,
Jato Thieves.

161
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,927
In third, racing on the outside,
is Number 17, Kaganerian.

162
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:23,329
Number Two, Royal Family,
is toward the front of mid-pack.

163
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,598
What will happen if we lose today?

164
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,701
But first, no accidents.
They need to finish it safely.

165
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:31,370
In front is Great Escape, the champion
of the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe!

166
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:34,307
The lead is three to four lengths ahead,
passing the second corner.

167
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,776
In second place is Number 17, Kaganerian.

168
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:39,312
In third is Number 11 Jato Thieves.
And in fourth…

169
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:40,413
Shohei!

170
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,782
In fifth is Number Four Shake Whirl.

171
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:47,153
Behind them is Number 12, Siren Pocat
rounding the curve into the backstretch.

172
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:51,557
One length behind, Number Two,
Royal Family, is following mid-pack.

173
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:52,725
On the outside is Number 14…

174
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:53,793
Family!

175
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:57,430
They passed the 1,000-meter mark
in one minute and 2.2 seconds.

176
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,966
Number Five, Rainbow Camp, is climbing up.

177
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,867
Here he comes!

178
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:03,970
He's good…

179
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:07,440
Rainbow Camp is pushing hard
on the outside and surging forward.

180
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:11,310
Ryusei Sakai coming from outside,
took the leading position in a flash.

181
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,512
He made his move early!

182
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:14,614
He's so fast.

183
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:19,952
Here comes the third corner curve.
The champion, Rainbow Camp, is leading.

184
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:23,189
What overwhelming power!
Will he be able to keep the lead?

185
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:26,392
He's six, now seven lengths ahead,
going towards the fourth corner.

186
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,526
We'll win this.

187
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:29,295
In seventh place is Number 12.

188
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,631
-You can do it, Family.
-In eighth place, Number Two Royal Family.

189
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:34,467
-Shohei!
-On the outside Number 17 Kaganerian.

190
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,236
There are two in second place,
heading towards the fourth corner.

191
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,638
Number Seven Ono Kaldi,

192
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:41,140
and slowly coming up,
Number Four Shake Whirl.

193
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:45,311
Two lengths away, Number Two,
Royal Family, turns the fourth corner…

194
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,579
-Here!
-Go!

195
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,147
-Go!
-Go!

196
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:52,318
I became a jockey to win the Arima.

197
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:53,386
Go!

198
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,122
Shohei! Please!

199
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:57,390
A five length lead.

200
00:10:57,456 --> 00:11:00,126
All the horses are after him.
500 meters remaining.

201
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,861
They tackle the rise!

202
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:05,798
In third is Number Nine, Great Escape,
followed by Shake Whirl.

203
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,634
On the inside, Number 11,
Jato Thieves is battling for fourth.

204
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:14,774
And here he comes! From the center
with a white helmet, Royal Family!

205
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,977
Number Two, Royal Family, moves up!
Rainbow Camp…

206
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,879
-Hang on!
-Hang on!

207
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,013
Go! Shohei!

208
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,481
Okay!

209
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:24,750
Ono Kaldi holds the lead
past the 200m mark.

210
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,252
Royal Family breaks from the pack…

211
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:27,153
Hang on!

212
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:28,120
Hang on!

213
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,989
-Okay! Go!
-Go!

214
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,858
Will he overtake Ono Kaldi? He did it!

215
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:36,862
Royal Family is in the lead!
Royal Family, ridden by Shohei Nozaki!

216
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:40,633
The comeback King,
Royal Family, is widening his lead.

217
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,474
So cool!

218
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,477
Royal Family is in the lead!

219
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,447
Royal Family crosses the finish line!

220
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:55,414
-All right!
-Okay!

221
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,783
-Yes!
-The winner of the Japan Cup crown is…

222
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,485
Not the one from Hokuryo Farm,

223
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:04,490
or from overseas either,
it's Royal Family and Shohei Nozaki!

224
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,759
It's the star of Hidaka!

225
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,894
-He made it!
-Overcoming countless injuries…

226
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,931
They conquered the Japan Cup!

227
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:14,700
-Family!
-It hasn't been an easy road.

228
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,135
We did it!

229
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,605
They now shine brilliantly
at the very top of the G1 Japan Cup!

230
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:20,873
Koichi!

231
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,346
Shohei!

232
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,853
Shohei!

233
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,288
Shohei!

234
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,023
You're so cool!

235
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:39,759
Mr. Hironaka.

236
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:41,994
Mr. Kurisu.

237
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,462
-Shohei!
-Congratulations.

238
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:44,730
-I'm so glad.
-We did it!

239
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,566
-Thank you. You did great.
-Thank you, too.

240
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,436
Family.

241
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,240
Hanako.

242
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,075
Did you cry?

243
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,576
No, I didn't. Did you?

244
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,345
-I didn't.
-Right…

245
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,391
-Koichi.
-Yes?

246
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,893
We finally won a G1.

247
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:15,961
But, we're not done.

248
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,230
This is only a checkpoint.

249
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,133
We can only say we’ve truly won
when we win the Arima Kinen.

250
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,334
Just as you said.

251
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,537
Hey.

252
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:27,273
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

253
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:32,278
-You're so cool!
-Mr. Kurisu.

254
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:33,345
Okay.

255
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:35,981
It was delicious.

256
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,250
The fan votes for
the Arima Kinen have begun.

257
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,219
The Triple Crown horse, So Perfect.

258
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,288
Autumn Tenno Sho winner, Rainbow Camp.

259
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:43,022
And…

260
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:48,460
Royal Family can now enter the vote thanks
to their winnings from the Japan Cup.

261
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:51,864
Okay, everyone!

262
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,533
Please face this way!

263
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,904
We’ve finally made it
to the starting line.

264
00:13:58,971 --> 00:13:59,805
Owner!

265
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,541
Please smile!

266
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,678
Mr. Kurisu!

267
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,513
-Yes?
-Your tie is crooked.

268
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,915
-What?
-It's crooked!

269
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:13,018
-Oh, I didn't know!
-I know nothing about them.

270
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,223
You did it, partner.

271
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:23,696
Thank you very much for all the support
you’ve given me up to this point.

272
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,699
I didn’t really do anything to help.

273
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:33,239
For the next race, the Arima Kinen,
could you come to Nakayama to watch?

274
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,110
You heard him, Mom.

275
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,579
Thank you, that’s very kind of you.

276
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:44,316
Madam.

277
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,019
Please come to the racetrack once more.

278
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,487
Please.

279
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,656
I wonder if this is the first time

280
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,626
you’ve ever stepped over
the threshold of this house.

281
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:55,861
Yes.

282
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,365
It's peaceful, right?

283
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,700
This house used to be a place
where I could never relax,

284
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,136
because of a certain someone.

285
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,140
Mr. Kurisu.

286
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:12,645
Have you forgotten what it is that I hate?

287
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:17,283
I'm well aware, but, Madam…

288
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,685
Must be tough for both of you.

289
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:24,056
If you had lost,
perhaps you could have given up.

290
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,994
Sorry you came
all the way here for nothing.

291
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,162
No, it's okay.

292
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:35,234
I’m truly grateful that you’ve carried
on my father's dream.

293
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:37,536
Thank you.

294
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,546
LAUREL R.C SHO
THE 13TH NAKAYAMA HIMBA STAKES

295
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,157
-Was that really okay?
-What?

296
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,359
Not to tell her.

297
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,295
About what comes after the Arima Kinen.

298
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:04,930
Right…

299
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,200
I felt it would be a bit underhanded.

300
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:13,205
"After the Arima Kinen,
Family will retire,

301
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,040
so please come."

302
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:19,411
If I said that,
I'd feel like I'm forcing her to come.

303
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:24,984
But someday, we need to tell the team.

304
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,592
Are you really sure about this?

305
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,096
Yes.

306
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,631
Family has earned enough prize money

307
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,967
to live comfortably
for the rest of his life.

308
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,470
No need to be injured or fight.

309
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:52,211
And I know,
that now, Family is at his peak.

310
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,181
All that's left is to win the Arima.

311
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:00,919
Yes.

312
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:09,328
Seriously?

313
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,330
What is it?

314
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:15,334
-Let me borrow your hand.
-Okay.

315
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,237
No. This…

316
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,539
-I'll leave it to you.
-What?

317
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,177
Hello?

318
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,048
Koichi left to go to the restroom.

319
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:30,449
Yes.

320
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:32,985
Tonight?

321
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:39,058
To celebrate you winning
the Japan Cup, cheers!

322
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:40,292
Cheers!

323
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,493
Congratulations.

324
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,633
Just take whatever you like.

325
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:48,801
I see.

326
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:53,672
It really felt good,
watching the unshakable Rainbow Camp

327
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,274
flailing around.

328
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,242
Serves them right.

329
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,813
By the way, Family…

330
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,648
He sinks when he's at his best.

331
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:03,615
Sinks?

332
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,651
-As expected, you pay attention.
-Is that true?

333
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:07,786
-What do you mean "he sinks"?
-I think so too.

334
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,856
It's because he has a flexible body.
He becomes elongated.

335
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,527
When he's at his best,
he bends his body as if he's sinking.

336
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,297
I think that is the secret
to his strength.

337
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:22,134
On the other hand,
I realized why So Perfect wins.

338
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,635
-What?
-The owner has good eyes.

339
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:24,770
Pleasantries!

340
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,873
Thanks to Family,
we got a lot more to talk about.

341
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,843
The media is really hyping it up
from all sides.

342
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:34,379
"Who will win, the father or his child?"

343
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,982
"What will be the ending
of the story of the owner

344
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:40,986
who couldn’t fulfill his dream,
and the child who carries that dream?"

345
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:43,155
Hokuryo vs Hidaka.

346
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,657
It's so interesting.

347
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,494
Hey, do you remember?

348
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,264
When you told me at the sale
that So Perfect is a good horse.

349
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:53,832
Yeah.

350
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:56,468
You're the only one who said that.

351
00:18:57,002 --> 00:19:00,339
The people around us had absolutely
no expectations for So Perfect,

352
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:02,774
whose body was still underdeveloped.

353
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,811
But now, everyone…

354
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,352
I discovered a new bloodline

355
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:16,121
and shattered everything
people thought they knew.

356
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,857
I created a new era.

357
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:23,662
You resemble him.

358
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,297
-What?
-Your father.

359
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:28,300
That's absurd.

360
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:32,971
Even if we were similar,
I'm the one who's delivering results.

361
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,606
Having to rely on a horse
like Rainbow Camp,

362
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:40,112
strong, but with no real charm,
that’s the limit of what he can do.

363
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,381
You certainly have a lot to say.

364
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:43,215
Yes.

365
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,084
I hate him, after all.

366
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,353
Do you remember?

367
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:54,693
The race where Royal Hope and Valshare
faced off in the Make Debut.

368
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,628
-I was watching from inside the grounds.
-What?

369
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,730
No kidding! Me too.

370
00:19:58,797 --> 00:19:59,898
-What? You too?
-What?

371
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:02,534
-What, you were there, too?
-Yes, I was.

372
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,637
-It must be fate.
-Shut up.

373
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,172
So…

374
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:11,510
I was cheering for Royal Hope.

375
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,979
The reason why I hate my father is simple.

376
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:17,983
Someone who pours everything
into horses and ignores their family…

377
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:18,884
He's a piece of shit.

378
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:22,254
Is it really something you’re supposed
to pour your whole life into?

379
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,157
That debut race,

380
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:28,961
Valshare was raised with a huge amount
of money poured into him,

381
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:32,130
and yet the unregarded Royal Hope
challenged him, and won.

382
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,233
It was amazing.

383
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,736
I thought, "Serves him right."

384
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,539
After the race, I went to see him.

385
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,541
-He wins by an overwhelming margin!
-And then…

386
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:43,809
All right!

387
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,010
Nobuyuki.

388
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,945
This is what horse racing is.

389
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:50,449
It keeps throwing challenges in my face.

390
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,185
It's still not good.
It's still not enough.

391
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,520
Even with a flawless pedigree,

392
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,290
perfect preparations,
and an excellent jockey,

393
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:01,593
no matter how certain you are of victory,

394
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,129
you can still have your legs
swept out from under you.

395
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,467
Horse racing is my life itself.

396
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,772
Talk about old-fashioned.

397
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,208
It's seriously lame.

398
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,315
That's why I won't lose.

399
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:28,220
I'll make sure to win without losing,
not even one time.

400
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:33,292
You don’t want to lose to someone
who’s drunk on their own tragedy, right?

401
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:35,494
You too, Koichi.

402
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:39,965
Inheritance…
You'll end up becoming a slave to it.

403
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,201
"Inheritance" sounds impressive.

404
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:45,570
In the end,
it’s just carrying over a debt.

405
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:49,574
We're not living to clean up
after our parents.

406
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:54,346
Royal, Hope, Family.

407
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,581
They are all just chains.

408
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,617
Be free, Koichi.

409
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:02,087
The Arima Kinen will be our fight.

410
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:14,700
I look forward
to your support until the very end.

411
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:16,835
I see.

412
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:20,339
Well, nothing about
what I have to do is going to change.

413
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:24,543
I also look forward to your support.

414
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:26,011
Thank you.

415
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:29,681
If he's retiring,
what will you do after that?

416
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:30,816
What?

417
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:35,687
Well, Koichi is
an inheritance-only horse owner,

418
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:38,490
you won't be able to stay
as his manager anymore.

419
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:39,558
Yes.

420
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:41,393
Where will you go?

421
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:49,301
I will think about it
after winning the Arima.

422
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,302
I see.

423
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:01,980
Where will I go…

424
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,652
Where will I go?

425
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:16,061
Do you have a dream?

426
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:18,163
Do you have a dream?

427
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,281
What a nice smell.

428
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:42,120
PUBLIC LOTTERY FOR STARTING ORDER

429
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:43,922
Sorry, we had bad luck with the lottery.

430
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:45,857
-Hello.
-Hello.

431
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,794
Gate Seven, Number 14. Sorry.

432
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,728
No, it's okay.

433
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:53,832
Most predictions
have So Perfect as the favorite,

434
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:55,901
with Rainbow Camp as the main challenger.

435
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:59,004
As expected,
we need to look out for these two, right?

436
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,605
Yes, we should.

437
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:02,774
In last year’s Arima Kinen,

438
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,976
Rainbow Camp conserved
its strength in the second pack,

439
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:07,245
then broke away from the third corner
and won by a wide margin.

440
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:11,082
With its wealth of experience,
its overall ability is still the best.

441
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:13,285
But this year, aside from them…

442
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:15,887
The strong finisher, So Perfect.

443
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,323
-That's right.
-He's a real monster.

444
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,292
He can move
to the front from any position.

445
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:22,494
That kind of explosive power
is something else.

446
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,429
Tactics don’t work on this horse.

447
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,866
But if you let him run freely,
he becomes unstoppable.

448
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:31,069
Most likely, So Perfect will come
from behind and make a late charge.

449
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,705
I plan to position myself
behind Rainbow Camp

450
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,874
but ahead of So Perfect.

451
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:38,410
I hope they take each other down.

452
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,479
I still have one concern.

453
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:44,983
Gate One, Number One.
The front-runner, Big Hope.

454
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,254
What’s scary about Ryujiro
is that he manages to pull into

455
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,622
this exact position.

456
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:54,226
Pairing the front-runner
Big Hope with Ryujiro,

457
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:57,562
as expected from President Shiina.

458
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:00,632
If he has inherited Hope’s temperament,

459
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:03,902
then Ryujiro’s skill will matter
even more, won't it?

460
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:07,973
And on top of that, the first gate.
It’s ideal for trying to lead all the way.

461
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:12,077
But in a long race like the Arima Kinen,
there’s no way he can last until the end.

462
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:16,047
Be careful not to get impatient
and chase after them.

463
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:16,982
Okay.

464
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:18,116
ROYAL FAMILY

465
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:23,188
So it's finally happening.

466
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:28,827
ROYAL FAMILY

467
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,865
If we’re going to shut down
both So Perfect’s final burst

468
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:35,333
and Rainbow Camp’s persistence,

469
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,637
then Family will have to create
a tough pace himself.

470
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:41,640
The timing of the move will be crucial,

471
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,375
so give a signal
that Family can understand.

472
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:44,109
Okay.

473
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,981
Okay, you can slow down.

474
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:52,350
You paced down a little early.

475
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:54,920
Let's keep the speed a little longer,
or else we won't win.

476
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:58,757
A toast.

477
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:02,227
Koichi!

478
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:03,395
Could you propose a toast?

479
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:04,663
No, not me.

480
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,031
How about you Mr. Hironaka?

481
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:08,333
No. I'm not good at it.

482
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,702
Okay. I'll do it.

483
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,804
-Good work, everyone!
-Oh, good!

484
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:13,805
Thank you.

485
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:17,642
Today is our kick-off party.
So, let's toast!

486
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,277
Cheers!

487
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,313
-Thank you!
-Cheers!

488
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:22,981
-Cheers.
-Excuse me.

489
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,049
There's a spy here.

490
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:24,950
What?

491
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:27,686
Mr. Kurisu said you
would be sad if I didn't come.

492
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,287
Did I ever say that?

493
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:30,956
-You did!
-For today…

494
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:35,260
Today, we are the Royal family,
which includes Ryujiro's family, too.

495
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:37,662
But in the real race,
it’s going to be a total beatdown.

496
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:40,398
Bring it on! I will not lose!

497
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,500
It's okay. They actually get along well.

498
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,035
Let's eat.

499
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:47,439
If I could, I would want
to keep running with all of you,

500
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:50,775
next year, the year after that,
and for many, many years to come.

501
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:56,815
I don’t want to feel lonely,
so starting tomorrow,

502
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:59,384
let's throw ourselves into work
with everything we've got!

503
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,485
-Yes!
-Okay!

504
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:02,621
Let's win this. Win this…

505
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:04,956
and achieve our dream.

506
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,458
We'll win this.

507
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:07,926
-We will.
-Of course.

508
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:11,896
Please watch, President.

509
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:17,335
-Mom, juice.
-No, you can't!

510
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:22,741
Excuse me.

511
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:24,743
Um…

512
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:28,546
I'll say this again.

513
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:32,117
After this year's Arima,

514
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:35,453
Family will retire.

515
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:40,358
He was injured many times,
he even had eye surgery.

516
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,028
He truly did his best.

517
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:45,530
-Yes.
-He did his best.

518
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:47,098
Everyone.

519
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:52,470
Thank you so much,
for earning enough prize money

520
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,941
for Family to walk his own path in life.

521
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:57,976
No.

522
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,078
Don't mention it.

523
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:04,783
Please continue to take care
of Family until the very end.

524
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:08,453
-Likewise.
-Of course.

525
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:20,432
Shohei.

526
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,600
You're walking home?

527
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:23,668
Just to the station.

528
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:24,903
How about a taxi?

529
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:26,604
Let's walk, Shohei.

530
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:27,806
It's cold.

531
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,076
You're from Hidaka!

532
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:32,177
We said it in unison.

533
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:34,813
Fine.

534
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:37,482
It's cold…

535
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,350
Hey! You're from Hidaka!

536
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,322
Me too.

537
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,093
-What is this? You're both heavy.
-No, we're not.

538
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:51,362
Hey, how about you stay
at our place tonight?

539
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,933
-I didn't bring any underwear.
-You can borrow mine.

540
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,538
If you do that, he'll bite you.

541
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:02,140
Don't bite me.

542
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,409
Family. Don't.

543
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,377
Stop. Family.

544
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:21,626
ROYAL HAPPINESS, ROYAL FIGHT,
ROYAL IZANA, ROYAL LAUGH

545
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:23,328
Fight!

546
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:24,963
Fight!

547
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:28,500
-Go!
-Go!

548
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,469
Run!

549
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,071
Run! Izana!

550
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,073
Run!

551
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,308
We did it! President!

552
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,710
It's just one win!

553
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,812
We're aiming to win a G1!

554
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:43,248
ROYAL IZANA, ROYAL LAUGH,
ROYAL SKY, ROYAL CANNON, ROYAL HOPE

555
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:45,183
Go!

556
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,418
Royal Hope is in the lead!

557
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,521
Royal Happiness.

558
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,090
Go!

559
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:53,792
Hope!

560
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:09,007
SANNO'S FAMILY GRAVE

561
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:17,515
When Family retires,
my part here will also be done.

562
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:21,052
Thank you for everything over the years.

563
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,163
I talked…

564
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,267
to my wife, Kanako.

565
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,204
After I quit being a manager,

566
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:42,006
I’m thinking of working at the farm.

567
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:44,909
I would like to work in a job

568
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:47,612
where I can continue watching over
horses until the very end.

569
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:50,615
"Until the very end"?

570
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,885
A retirement farm.

571
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:59,791
It’s a farm where they take in
retired racehorses

572
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,261
and let them live out
their lives in peace.

573
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,499
For the horses who won,
and for the ones who didn't.

574
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:14,505
My new dream is to build the best farm
where every horse can live out

575
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:18,810
its life peacefully and with equal care.

576
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:56,014
This is how dreams continue, huh?

577
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:06,124
How about you? What's your plan?

578
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:07,759
Well…

579
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,929
It's still a blank canvas for now,

580
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,234
but I hope I’ll find the right path.

581
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:19,337
You can choose whatever you like.

582
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,272
I see.

583
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:29,781
My dream, huh?

584
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:53,071
-It's finally happening.
-Yes.

585
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,139
Oh, I heard.

586
00:32:57,408 --> 00:33:00,445
I'll transfer to Kansai this spring.
I'll be commuting to Ritto.

587
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:02,380
It will be lonely without you here.

588
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:05,183
What are you talking about?
You're quitting, too, right?

589
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:09,554
My "Inheritance"…

590
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,457
The last article.

591
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:15,560
I want to close it out
by writing about you.

592
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:16,627
What?

593
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:20,365
The final piece
on the President’s Arima victory

594
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:22,133
never fell into place,

595
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:26,871
but there is no better way

596
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:31,309
to express the beauty of horse racing
than by telling your story.

597
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,345
You're exaggerating.

598
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:35,580
No.

599
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:40,485
From the start of the race to the end,

600
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,188
its two minutes and thirty seconds.

601
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:50,428
Win it, and bring the story
of Eiji Kurisu to a close.

602
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:53,931
Okay.

603
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:08,646
You, my old man, everyone.
I’ll blow past you all and win.

604
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:13,951
That old, worn-out dream clinging to you,
I’ll tear it off myself.

605
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,626
You can deny my inheritance all you want,

606
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,562
but this dream can’t be torn off.

607
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,931
It's not my father's dream,

608
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:29,233
it's mine.

609
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:34,972
Inheritance isn’t something forced on you.

610
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:37,508
It’s something you choose for yourself.

611
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:44,048
There are as many forms of inheritance
as there are people who receive it.

612
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:48,753
I chose to take on the dream,

613
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,788
and I made it my own.

614
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,527
It would be uncool if you lose this.

615
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:01,699
We'll win.

616
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,769
We'll definitely win.

617
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:06,204
The Arima Kinen.

618
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:10,975
-Shohei, good luck.
-Thank you.

619
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:16,814
-I look forward to today.
-How are you?

620
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,916
-I'm good.
-That's good.

621
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:20,785
So Perfect looks good, too.

622
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:24,188
Hello.

623
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:25,656
-Hello.
-How are you?

624
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:26,691
I'm feeling good.

625
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:28,593
-Good.
-I'll do my best.

626
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,194
-Okay.
-Thank you.

627
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:32,196
-Just believe in the horse.
-Yes.

628
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:33,865
-I'll do my best.
-I look forward to it.

629
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,166
Thank you.

630
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,072
-Understood.
-It finally came.

631
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,540
How are you?

632
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:44,142
I'm good.

633
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:45,843
I'll go win this.

634
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,246
-Looking forward to it.
-Leave it to me.

635
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:52,116
We're counting on you, Shohei.

636
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:59,223
Actually, I don’t think I’ve ever truly
brought out Family’s full power.

637
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,658
-What?
-What?

638
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:01,959
What did you just say?

639
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:05,396
So, can I do it today?

640
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:07,632
You heard him.

641
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,567
-Of course.
-Go, do it.

642
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,802
He says he has never gone all out…

643
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:13,771
What happens if he does?

644
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,140
I don't know, but I know he can.

645
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:17,108
I know he will.

646
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:21,512
So we'll get to see it?
The best version of Family.

647
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:24,115
You will. I'll see to it that you will.

648
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,151
Stop!

649
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,422
Let's go.

650
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:46,771
-Family.
-Family.

651
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:49,840
-You're so cool, Family.
-Family.

652
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:53,144
You look so cool today, Family!

653
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,747
Run a lot today,
and eat a lot later, okay?

654
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:58,516
-You need to do it like this.
-Yes.

655
00:36:58,583 --> 00:36:59,951
You're great.

656
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:04,789
I just felt it

657
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,692
from the bottom of my heart,

658
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:11,329
that we'll definitely win.

659
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:16,300
Some efforts
only mean something if you win.

660
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:19,403
If I can,

661
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:24,208
I want to honor all the time
up until this point.

662
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:36,687
Family. Do your best.

663
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:43,261
Together, let's win and be rewarded.

664
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:49,634
Family.

665
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:54,805
Thank you for getting me here.

666
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:56,707
Go, Family.

667
00:37:57,975 --> 00:37:59,777
Family, shall we go?

668
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:08,419
Okay.

669
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:09,987
The Royal family?

670
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:13,691
Okay. Thank you.

671
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:23,267
You must be in shock.

672
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:26,170
I heard that you're retiring.

673
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:28,406
I heard from Mr. Kurisu.

674
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,410
How was life as a horse owner? Was it fun?

675
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:36,681
It has been nothing but hardships.

676
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:41,218
I’ve always felt like I was carrying
so much on my shoulders.

677
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:45,990
But if we win, it will all be worth it.

678
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:52,096
He's saying the same thing as Sanno.

679
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:05,142
Nakayama Racecourse, Race 11,
today’s main event is the Arima Kinen!

680
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:08,212
Everyone has brought us all the way here.

681
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,915
The horses will be coming out shortly.

682
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:21,158
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

683
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:41,345
Gathered at the starting gates of
the Nakayama 2,500-meter turf course

684
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:44,181
are 16 star horses,
all chosen by fan vote.

685
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:46,650
The horses are loading into the gate
in an orderly manner.

686
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,186
Number Nine Rainbow Camp
is going to the gate.

687
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:50,988
How will Sakai make his move?

688
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,656
In his previous Tenno Sho run,

689
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,559
he posted an incredible time
of one minute 50 seconds.

690
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:58,996
-Big Hope has drawn the ideal position…
-All right.

691
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,465
Many see him as the leading front-runner.

692
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:04,368
Coming from the G2 Stayers Stakes
and the Nihonkai Stakes…

693
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:06,003
Let's go, Hope.

694
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,371
All right.

695
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,707
Big Hope, has now moved into the gate.

696
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:13,978
Now, the even-numbered horses.
The favorite, Number Two, So Perfect.

697
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:17,014
A revolutionary closer, we’ll see
from where he makes his move today.

698
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,349
Let's go!

699
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,619
Winner of the Japan Cup
and having announced their retirement,

700
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:24,522
Number 14 Royal Family enters the gate.

701
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,790
I'm not letting you get away.

702
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:28,159
We'll win this.

703
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:29,460
God.

704
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:32,163
I give all of my luck.

705
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:34,098
They are all gathered at Nakayama.

706
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:37,401
There's a beautiful sunset
over the racecourse.

707
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:41,505
Number Four, Isle No Seldar
is being led into their gate.

708
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:42,673
They are in position.

709
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,142
Shohei, don't panic.

710
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:48,145
All horses are now in position.

711
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:50,714
Now, it's time.

712
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:56,086
The Arima Kinen has started.

713
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:58,823
Front-runner Big Hope starts late.

714
00:40:58,889 --> 00:40:59,723
No way!

715
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,826
-Ryujiro.
-Number 16 Squeeze Aries.

716
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:05,463
From the inside, Number Four,
Isle No Seldar pushes forward.

717
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:07,531
Calm down! We'll win this!

718
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:09,066
He's lost it.

719
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,935
This is where the jockey’s skill
truly gets tested.

720
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:14,638
Number 11 Hermy.
On the outside, Number 14 Royal Family.

721
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:16,106
That's a good position.

722
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:17,741
Number Two, So Perfect,
sits on the inside.

723
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,878
The Arima's course is long, don't panic.

724
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:24,415
Midfield comes Number 12 Wine Allison,
followed by all-rounder

725
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:28,619
Number Nine Rainbow Camp who has
settled toward the rear of the midfield.

726
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,488
They have entered the fourth corner.

727
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:33,123
Under the evening sun,
they come before the grandstand.

728
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,391
He made his move.

729
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:37,795
Number Nine Rainbow Camp is moving
effortlessly up into third, then second!

730
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:39,497
He keeps rising and has taken the lead!

731
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:44,134
Roaring cheers rise from the grandstand
as Number Nine Rainbow Camp leads…

732
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:45,169
Isn't his pace fast?

733
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,271
He’s pulling.
It's a turf with 2,500 meters, you know?

734
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,607
Not yet, Shohei. Don't panic.

735
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:53,010
-Don't panic.
-Squeeze Aries in the first corner.

736
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:57,748
Ryusei Sakai pushes into a fast tempo,
with 59.4 for the first 1,000 meters.

737
00:41:57,815 --> 00:42:01,252
Number Four Isle No Seldar, and Number 16
Squeeze Aries are starting to drop back.

738
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:02,887
Number 14 Royal Family,

739
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:05,990
and Number Two So Perfect,
are moving up into second and third.

740
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:07,591
That’s some impressive acceleration.

741
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:09,193
Number 11, Hermy is on the outside.

742
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,595
Family. Go.

743
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:13,998
They're at the final 1,000 meters.

744
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:16,133
Number One Big Hope is at the very back.

745
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,035
They pass the 800-meter mark,
into the third corner.

746
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:19,537
Rainbow Camp still holds the lead.

747
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:22,106
Pace down!

748
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:25,009
Running in close formation
with Wine Allison.

749
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:28,612
The champion, Camp is tough! Number Five,
Xenverse sits fifth from last.

750
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,414
Veepland is fourth from last.

751
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:32,082
It's almost time…

752
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:34,118
Number Eight, V-Hook and Number Three…

753
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:35,886
-He made his move!
-Here it comes!

754
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:39,456
Number Two So Perfect makes his move!
So Perfect is accelerating rapidly!

755
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:42,826
Number 14 Royal Family is also moving up!

756
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,796
Number Nine Rainbow Camp
is getting swallowed up by the pack!

757
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:48,165
So Perfect takes the lead!
He’s making a bid for it!

758
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:49,133
Number 14, Royal Family…

759
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:50,668
-Shohei!
-Keep up!

760
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,337
Royal Family is biting at his heels!

761
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:00,044
He's sinking…

762
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,245
Family!

763
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,380
No, not yet!

764
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:06,283
So Perfect holds firm!
He leads by a length.

765
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,252
-Perfect! Let's go!
-Here he comes!

766
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:09,587
He can still speed up?

767
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:11,589
You’ve got more in you.

768
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:13,624
Family!

769
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:16,126
Into the straight!
Into the short Nakayama straight!

770
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:19,029
It’s a battle for the lead between
So Perfect and Royal Family!

771
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,632
-Family!
-Go!

772
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:22,700
Shohei!

773
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:25,135
So Perfect or Royal Family?
They are alone in the lead!

774
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:28,606
So Perfect or Royal Family?
They hit the incline!

775
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:31,875
Neither is giving an inch!

776
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:32,810
They’re neck and neck.

777
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:34,078
Go! So Perfect!

778
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:35,145
Go!

779
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:36,113
Hang on!

780
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,681
Go!

781
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:38,983
Who will take the lead?

782
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:41,485
It's Royal Family!
Royal Family is in the lead!

783
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:44,555
200 meters to go! Here comes a challenger!

784
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,794
The real battle starts now!

785
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,801
Run, Family!

786
00:43:57,868 --> 00:43:58,802
Run!

787
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:01,472
Surging from the outside! He's closing in!

788
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:04,808
Look at that stretch!
He has left fifth and fourth place behind!

789
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:08,078
The White Bullet, Big Hope!
He's come out of nowhere!

790
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,446
He’s into third!

791
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:10,614
Go!

792
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:12,249
Go past him!

793
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,485
Hope!

794
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:16,120
Hope!

795
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:19,823
I'm still immature, you see.

796
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:26,497
Do you want to create
the best horse with me?

797
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:27,431
LIGHTNING NEO

798
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,967
I want to purchase Hope’s semen.

799
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,537
When the real fight comes,

800
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:37,808
you and I will be the wall
that stops the young ones.

801
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,879
You sure are greedy.

802
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:46,517
That "real fight" you're talking about…

803
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,953
It's the Arima, right?

804
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:51,755
Of course.

805
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:55,726
I promise that Hope's foal
will win the Arima.

806
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,604
I'm on board.

807
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:18,982
BIG HOPE

808
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:23,520
Big Hope chases the leads!
Keep running Royal Family!

809
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:25,022
Hope!

810
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:26,857
So Perfect falls back! Royal Family leads!

811
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:27,758
President…

812
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:29,626
-Big Hope won't stop! He’s surging!
-Hope…

813
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,375
-Go Family!
-Go!

814
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:49,313
He catches So Perfect!
Is it Family? Or Hope?

815
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:53,150
BIG HOPE

816
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:57,988
-President…
-Family!

817
00:45:58,055 --> 00:45:59,490
Your horses…

818
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:03,360
They are locked together!
The brothers are side-by-side!

819
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,428
Ryujiro! Do your best!

820
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:05,896
Family!

821
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:07,531
Your children.

822
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:08,599
Hope!

823
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:09,466
They're here…

824
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:14,438
Hope!

825
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:19,743
They cross together!

826
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:23,981
Royal Family and Big Hope
cross the line neck and neck.

827
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:25,516
Is it Hope or is it Family?

828
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:29,086
Big Hope's strong finish was amazing!

829
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:30,621
We don't know the result of this one!

830
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:36,260
The Photo Finish sign is flashing!
The 70th Grand Prix, Arima Kinen.

831
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:38,695
First and second place
will be decided through photo.

832
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:45,836
Nakayama Racecourse, Race 11.

833
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:48,172
First and second place.

834
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,810
The first place is Number One.

835
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,513
The second place is Number 14.

836
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:03,854
A Hidaka horse won the Arima!

837
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:04,988
Takeshi!

838
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:07,591
It's the Arima!

839
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:11,628
Hope's stallions placed first and second!

840
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:32,783
I also made him a promise.

841
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,790
To win the Arima,

842
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,260
with the President's horse.

843
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:04,047
-Congratulations.
-Thank you very much.

844
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:09,019
Thank you very much.

845
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:14,258
It's the strong horse
that Owner Sanno left behind.

846
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:17,995
Royal Hope, who was born in Hidaka,

847
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:22,900
and the horse from Hokuryo
chosen by Owner Shiina…

848
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:29,139
President.

849
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:32,676
You won the Arima, after all.

850
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,379
Hidaka or Hokuryo,
in the end, it makes no difference.

851
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:41,485
The two owners joined forces
for the sake of victory.

852
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:44,988
No, it was the two fathers
who joined forces.

853
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:46,890
They got us.

854
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:00,704
Koichi.

855
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,205
Damn it.

856
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,486
Unbelievable!

857
00:49:16,553 --> 00:49:19,389
And on top of that,
the jockey is Ryujiro Saki!

858
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:25,329
At last, I've fulfilled my promise.

859
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:26,530
Thank you.

860
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:33,003
Damn it!

861
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:35,806
It's no good.

862
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:39,576
My old man has such a nasty personality.

863
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:43,146
Let’s go to see Ryujiro.

864
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:44,815
-Thank you.
-Mr. Aiso.

865
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,755
Let's plan for next year.

866
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:54,858
I will be in your care.

867
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:57,928
We didn't win again this time.

868
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:03,233
With this, all the horses
I've rooted for have lost.

869
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:08,905
I probably will never come
to the racetrack again.

870
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:11,008
You were rooting for him?

871
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:13,110
Madam.

872
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:20,550
This is where your true life begins.

873
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:24,888
I know that he wishes it for you, too.

874
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:27,891
Thank you for coming today.

875
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:31,128
Let’s have a good,
long talk over the New Year.

876
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:34,097
Not a serious talk.

877
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,901
I want to talk about trivial things,

878
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:39,669
because you're family.

879
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,813
What do you like?

880
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:53,250
Curry.

881
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,954
ROYAL FAMILY

882
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:04,795
Look at that.

883
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:08,698
That's the first time
I've seen Family like that.

884
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:16,473
You're right.

885
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,522
I've always wanted to throw away my ego.

886
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:38,462
Stop projecting my own dreams
and feelings,

887
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:40,931
and focus only on the horse.

888
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:43,500
That's why I wanted to retire.

889
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:47,771
But…

890
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:53,076
sometimes it's the other way around.

891
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:57,814
"What if Family still wants to run?"

892
00:51:57,881 --> 00:51:59,382
Is that what you are thinking?

893
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:04,988
If I retire him now,

894
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:09,659
that would be my ego as well, right?

895
00:52:12,395 --> 00:52:13,597
Koichi.

896
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:16,199
Are you hesitating?

897
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,667
What?

898
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:20,604
About retiring,
thinking it may be too early.

899
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:22,339
Oh, no.

900
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,876
I've already announced it.

901
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:34,451
It would be embarrassing
to withdraw my retirement.

902
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:40,991
Hypothetically,

903
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:44,628
if you were to take back
your retirement now,

904
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,330
it would take a lot of determination.

905
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:51,701
You may face criticism.

906
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:55,005
I don't care about that.

907
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:56,973
It's just…

908
00:52:58,375 --> 00:52:59,743
I just…

909
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:06,583
Then, let's let the horse decide.

910
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:08,952
Family.

911
00:53:11,888 --> 00:53:13,990
If Family says so,
then it can’t be helped.

912
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:16,760
In any case,

913
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:23,266
I will do my utmost,
for you and for Family.

914
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:29,472
So…

915
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,441
Let's go see Family.

916
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:34,911
Mr. Kurisu.

917
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:37,247
Yes?

918
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,294
Don't you ever…

919
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:54,631
betray me.

920
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:02,672
Ever.

921
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:08,645
Understood.

922
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:25,161
Looking back now, I have to say
that your decision at that time

923
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:27,264
turned out to be the right one.

924
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:28,431
No.

925
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:29,933
Thank you very much.

926
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:33,670
Now then, up to this point,

927
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:36,339
we looked back from the time
of the previous owner

928
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:37,674
to Family’s first retirement.

929
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:40,577
Now, I would like to ask
about your outlook for the future.

930
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:44,381
Now that you have officially acquired
your horse owner’s license,

931
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,582
what are your thoughts?

932
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:47,884
I feel anxious.

933
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:51,988
Are you going to do it alone this time?

934
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:55,859
That's my intention, for now.

935
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:56,926
But…

936
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:00,297
there's someone
I really want to tell about this.

937
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:04,234
I’m going to see them now.

938
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:07,570
Give him my regards.

939
00:55:09,606 --> 00:55:10,840
I will.

940
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:13,643
Is there someone
who hasn't received it yet?

941
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:15,312
Okay.

942
00:55:15,378 --> 00:55:16,579
Here you go.

943
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,014
You're welcome.

944
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:20,383
This white horse

945
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:22,252
is Royal Izana.

946
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:24,554
She's cute, right?

947
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:29,993
You do it like this,
slowly feed them, okay?

948
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:33,830
This one is Royal Hope.

949
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:35,532
He sometimes bites.

950
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:38,001
Be careful, okay?

951
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:40,036
Try feeding them, slowly.

952
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:42,405
No, like this.

953
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:43,673
He ate it!

954
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,442
Everyone, look.

955
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:49,279
This one is Royal Fight.

956
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:53,850
He and that white horse Izana
are very close.

957
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:56,052
"I want to eat, too…" Try feeding him.

958
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:57,554
Yes, just like that.

959
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:00,724
Good for you, Fight.

960
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:02,392
ROYAL HOPE

961
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:08,665
What time are you leaving Haneda?

962
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:10,700
Okay.

963
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:13,737
It's really cold here, be careful.

964
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,144
Family!

965
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,179
-Family!
-Family!

966
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:25,849
The horses are in position.
The Osaka Hai. And they're off!

967
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:28,518
Royal Family takes the lead right away!

968
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:30,653
What a finishing speed!

969
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,090
Following the Osaka Hai,
he has now conquered the Spring Tenno Sho!

970
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:37,961
At long last, the title goes to Japan!
A truly "Royal" victory!

971
00:56:38,027 --> 00:56:40,196
The dream of a nation
has just become reality!

972
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:44,267
Japan's Royal Family
wins the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe!

973
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:46,636
ROYAL FAMILY

974
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:51,274
It’s 2026, and the fans have packed
the Nakayama Racecourse once again.

975
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:54,411
Race 11, the 71st Arima Kinen.

976
00:56:54,477 --> 00:56:56,045
All the attention is on the gates.

977
00:56:56,112 --> 00:57:00,383
Which horse will make history?
The 71st Grand Prix Arima Kinen!

978
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:02,685
They're off! He messes up!

979
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:05,789
Number 11, Royal Family, starts late!

980
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:09,526
Royal Family's final race
begins from the very back!

981
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:11,795
The crowd is in shock!

982
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:13,496
But the race has only just begun!

983
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:18,868
This track has six corners,
two hills, and a grueling 2,500 meters.

984
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:21,037
Will he get revenge?

985
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:24,207
Last year's runner-up, Royal Family,
pushes up to midfield.

986
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:27,277
Nozaki is holding him steady,
whispering "Don't panic."

987
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:29,813
He retracted his retirement
for this moment!

988
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:32,849
He returns this year as the fan favorite!

989
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:35,051
The heartbreak of an Arima
must be healed at an Arima!

990
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,953
Rounding the fourth corner!
Into the final straight!

991
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,455
It's still anyone's race!

992
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:41,124
From the outside it's Number 11,
Royal Family!

993
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:45,094
He passes four horses in a flash!
This is it! Remember this moment!

994
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:47,163
This is Royal Family!

995
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:49,933
He is strong! A glorious finale!

996
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:52,936
The pride of Hidaka, Royal Family!

997
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:54,137
Family!

998
00:57:57,006 --> 00:57:58,775
All right!

999
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:03,379
We did it!

1000
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,218
Family!

1001
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:14,924
Eiji!

1002
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:18,027
Koichi will arrive
at the airport at 6 p.m.

1003
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:22,098
Right… Let's eat Genghis Khan for dinner.

1004
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:23,066
What?

1005
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:24,300
Again?

1006
00:58:24,367 --> 00:58:26,736
You surely don't get tired of it.

1007
00:58:26,803 --> 00:58:30,073
Why not? It's a hundred times
better than what you get in Tokyo.

1008
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,474
Okay.

1009
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:37,280
2026 ARIMA KINEN

1010
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:38,615
Let's go.

1011
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:40,517
