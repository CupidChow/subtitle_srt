1
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:08,441
I want to win
the nation's top Grade I race

2
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,410
and make our horse the best in Japan.

3
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:11,611
At the Arima Kinen.

4
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:12,979
Understood.

5
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:15,482
Eiji Kurisu left
a major tax accounting firm

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:20,387
to join Royal Human President
Kozo Sanno's Horse Racing Division

7
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:21,888
as his private secretary.

8
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:23,656
Win one central race within the year.

9
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:25,425
If you can't win even once,

10
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:28,061
the department will be abolished
by the year's end.

11
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:30,563
Kurisu and Sanno
placed their hopes on Royal Fight,

12
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,566
who was in good form
after coming in second place,

13
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:37,804
and entrusted the challenge
to a new trainer, Hiroshi Hironaka.

14
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:42,042
But the one who caught Hironaka's eye
was a maiden horse the same age as Fight,

15
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:44,711
born at the Hayashida Ranch, Royal Izana.

16
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,479
Royal Fight and Royal Izana…

17
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,914
I'd like to switch them around.

18
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,483
I really believe we can win this way.

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,951
-Do it.
-Izana!

20
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:53,520
Hang in there!

21
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:54,587
Go!

22
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:56,890
-Go!
-Run, Izana!

23
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:00,894
Izana showed her aptitude
on the turf course and won.

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,896
It saved the Horse Racing Division, but…

25
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:04,397
We did it, President!

26
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:05,532
You're a great team.

27
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:07,634
A team? We're nothing so fancy.

28
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,668
THE ROYAL FAMILY BEGINS

29
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,043
Kanako, that's unacceptable!

30
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:20,046
I'm sorry for my father's rudeness!

31
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:21,481
"Do you even want to win?"

32
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,583
Every horse owner wants to win!

33
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,784
He's so rude!

34
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:25,952
I'm truly sorry.

35
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:28,855
I will make him apologize.
Please, give us one more chance.

36
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,390
I'm sorry to say this,

37
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:34,127
but Hidaka ranches are not
in a position to be picky right now!

38
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:37,263
Hokuryo Farm has countless
good horses on offer!

39
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:39,666
Just shut up and sell horses!

40
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,869
Or your tiny farm will be ruined!

41
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:51,778
Please, people's livelihoods
are at stake here!

42
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,113
I know.

43
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:55,048
NOZAKI FARM, RANCH OWNER

44
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,716
This one is the last.

45
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,486
NOZAKI FARM

46
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,787
Last?

47
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:04,124
What do you mean?

48
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:08,228
What do you mean by last?

49
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,329
Hey, welcome back.

50
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,498
I'm home.

51
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:13,366
Welcome back. How was school?

52
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:14,400
KANAKO'S SON

53
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,372
Go ahead.

54
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,841
I don't want to do it. Ask someone else!

55
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,676
You do it every year!

56
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:25,311
Right?

57
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:32,552
Well then,
a toast to Yuriko Sanno's birthday!

58
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,588
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

59
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,557
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

60
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:41,227
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

61
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,128
Thank you.

62
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:45,899
Oh, take a picture with me too!
Can I upload it to Facebook?

63
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:46,933
Sure!

64
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:52,505
-Too bad!
-You should try again.

65
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,841
I'm frustrated. I'll try again.

66
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,711
Business is booming, it seems.

67
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:01,314
My mother's F&B business.

68
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,349
I'm glad.

69
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,320
In the end,
they only won once, didn't they?

70
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:13,059
I should have made the condition
two wins within the year.

71
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:16,129
Then that Horse Racing Division
would be long gone by now.

72
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:21,167
But, Chief, the situation is not so grim.

73
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:24,537
Relations with the trainers
and farms are good,

74
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,240
and everyone is sure
that results will come this year.

75
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,043
They're sure, huh?

76
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:36,482
Gambling addicts always say that.

77
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,386
Kurisu, where have you been?

78
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:41,688
Wait.

79
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:43,223
What?

80
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,892
Okay, come on.

81
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:46,993
Here.

82
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,261
Use this.

83
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,629
Would you like some water?

84
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,130
No, no need.

85
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,635
Gosh, it's rare for him to be this drunk.

86
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:04,577
It's fine. He's just sleeping.

87
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,820
-Here you go.
-Oh, uh…

88
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,755
Thank you very much.

89
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:23,896
Do you know what made Kozo
start horse racing?

90
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:25,932
Well… No.

91
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,735
My father recommended it.

92
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,803
My father was a horse owner too.

93
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:37,910
I hate horses, but I hated my father more.

94
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,913
He was self-righteous and domineering.

95
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,084
Whenever the horses lost,
he would blame it on my mother.

96
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:51,357
Then this man stumbled into that world.

97
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,560
He was a timid person,

98
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:58,464
and my father provided
his company's funds,

99
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,634
so he couldn't refuse.

100
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,340
The day he first bought a horse,

101
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,145
I saw my father in Kozo's proud smile.

102
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:16,115
And I almost fainted.

103
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:24,957
Injuries are part of the game,

104
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,361
but for them both to get hurt
at the same time…

105
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,364
They're still young enough to race,
and yet…

106
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:32,699
I know.

107
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:36,269
But we can't risk even worse injuries.

108
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,273
Although they didn't win big,

109
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:45,144
Fight and Izana
absolutely saved our division.

110
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,847
When Izana won,

111
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:52,018
I thought we could just keep
progressing to bigger races.

112
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,688
But it really is a distant goal, isn't it?

113
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:57,090
The Arima Kinen.

114
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,995
That said, there's no need to be sad.

115
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,430
Our next challenge.

116
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:07,367
The auction?

117
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:14,640
Right now, all the top horses
are from the Hokuryo farm.

118
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,442
That can't be denied.

119
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,947
Read through this.

120
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,550
We must get a horse at the auction.

121
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:29,622
Also, I want to stop by the Hayashida
Ranch to check on the breeding.

122
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:32,825
Understood.

123
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,162
The Hidaka region.

124
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,065
Nestled between the majestic
Hidaka Range and the Pacific Ocean,

125
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:43,302
this land, lush with nature
is home to many thoroughbred ranches.

126
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:49,308
From as far back as the Meiji era,
it has produced numerous racehorses.

127
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,677
It is Japan's premier breeding ground.

128
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:56,149
However, most Hidaka ranches
are individually owned,

129
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:59,218
and over time, due to Japan's
generally declining population,

130
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,988
and a lack of successors to take over,

131
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:05,258
the number of breeding ranches
has halved in the last century,

132
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:07,026
following a trend of decline.

133
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,696
Meanwhile, a few large-scale ranches,

134
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,033
by managing everything
from breeding to training horses,

135
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,604
have claimed great results in both
the number of horses and their winnings.

136
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:24,310
Right now, farm management
is undergoing a major shift.

137
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:28,981
ROYAL HAPPINESS

138
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:32,685
SPECIAL SONIC (BORN 1997)

139
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:35,421
They're all fathered
by horses even I know.

140
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,928
Do you like horses?

141
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:43,796
A bit.

142
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,898
Sorry to take up your time.

143
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,000
No. It's a nice change of pace.

144
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,369
Welcome. Here you go.

145
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,741
Oh, this is…

146
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,577
It's fine. Don't be so awkward.

147
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,313
Everyone wants a horse from Hokuryo Farm.

148
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,849
The auction is next week, huh?

149
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,151
How about you? How's business?

150
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:06,886
A complete failure.

151
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,722
I just can't find a buyer.

152
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,757
VASILITINO
SOLEIL BRIGHT

153
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,092
Really?

154
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,495
Doesn't the Hidaka auction
start next month?

155
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:18,231
If you put one up,
it will garner interest.

156
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:21,200
What?

157
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:24,570
We have one horse,
but my father won't put it up.

158
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:26,372
Really?

159
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:29,709
Yes.

160
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,212
In an auction,
a starting price is set, right?

161
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,680
-Yes.
-Right.

162
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,950
A number that says,
"You must pay at least this much."

163
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,787
So, at the very least,
you can recoup the costs of raising them.

164
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,656
Yes, roughly like that.

165
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,460
In exchange, at an auction,
you don't know who gets the horse.

166
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:51,264
In an auction, you must hand
the horse to the highest bidder,

167
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,032
no matter who they are.

168
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:53,966
Right.

169
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,036
My father doesn't like that.

170
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:03,209
He wants to talk directly with the owners
and only sell to the right person.

171
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,111
Oh, that's noble.

172
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,713
I can understand his feelings.

173
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:13,619
As a buyer, if the ranch is so picky,
I would have high hopes for the horse.

174
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,288
Do you think so?

175
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:16,188
I do.

176
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,392
Even if the horse costs 100 million?

177
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,461
100 million…

178
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:29,235
At the Hokuryo Farm auction,
100 million is small change.

179
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:33,306
But a small Hidaka ranch asking
for 100 million yen in a private sale

180
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:34,774
is practically a joke.

181
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,210
Even so, some people
were somewhat interested,

182
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,380
but my father kept refusing.

183
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,917
That horse…

184
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,119
What kind is it?

185
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,390
-What's wrong?
-No…

186
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,993
Don't get the wrong idea.

187
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,662
I didn't come here to… Wait…

188
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,332
I'm not here to ask you
to get Mr. Sanno to buy the horse.

189
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:00,433
I mean it!

190
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,834
I just…

191
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:05,137
-I wanted you to listen to my complaints.
-I know.

192
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:09,041
Trust me, I'm not interested
because it's you.

193
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:12,211
We're looking for a new horse too.

194
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:20,686
Hokuryo Farm has all the facilities
needed for thoroughbreds,

195
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:26,926
including breeding, rearing,
training, and stallion management.

196
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:30,429
They trade hundreds of horses annually.

197
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,798
It is the largest ranch in Japan.

198
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,839
Hello! I've been waiting for you!

199
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:41,807
-Pleasure doing business.
-Yes.

200
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:43,342
Do you have a horse in mind?

201
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:46,245
-Oh, you look like you do.
-No, I'll have to see them first.

202
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,215
Really? You look like a man
with a target already!

203
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:53,586
For the horse Mr. Sanno wants,
I fear we will have stiff competition.

204
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,656
-You sure about this?
-What do you think, Mr. Hironaka?

205
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:58,724
It is certainly a well-bred horse.

206
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,627
Anyone would expect it to win.

207
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,398
But that doesn't fit
the president's style.

208
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,466
I think so too.

209
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,969
The horse is certainly good.

210
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:13,072
But I wonder
if it's really the right choice.

211
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:17,977
Fight and Izana were both rare finds,
discovered by Mr. Sanno.

212
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,479
You're really speaking up now.

213
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:21,881
No, I didn't mean to…

214
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:26,719
But right now,
Hokuryo is dominant in every aspect.

215
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:30,489
To have better odds, he must either
get a horse with an excellent pedigree

216
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,491
or go against the tide

217
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,994
and discover an as-yet-unknown
promising horse.

218
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:38,297
He also has difficult choices to make.

219
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:44,336
Next is No. 142. Born to Golden Rail and…

220
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,806
I think this next horse is interesting.

221
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,875
A mare, huh?

222
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,677
Its pedigree excels at 1600 meters.

223
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,046
If you choose the races,
it could be a contender.

224
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:54,980
President?

225
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:56,348
No.

226
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,551
The goal is the Arima Kinen,
not the 1600 meters.

227
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,687
The Arima Kinen, Kozo's dream,

228
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,290
requires a tough horse
that can run long distances

229
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,292
to have a chance at the top spots.

230
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,794
Last call. 97 million yen.

231
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:09,829
Any bids?

232
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:14,166
-Sold for 96 million.
-Our target is the Seal brown one.

233
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,269
Seeing it in person determined it.

234
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,705
Thank you for your winning bid.

235
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,908
Sorry. I can't say anything yet.

236
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,211
Mr. Sanno's favorite is coming up.

237
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:26,312
Got it.

238
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:28,047
Sorry to make you do this.

239
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,215
It's fine.

240
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,649
And, besides…

241
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:36,122
Depending on the bid price,
he may choose to just buy this horse.

242
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:40,326
The presale rumors alone say
it will exceed 100 million yen.

243
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,595
We're also on a budget.

244
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,196
It's okay.

245
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,032
But… I see.

246
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:53,506
I want him to win the bid,
but I also don't want him to.

247
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:55,508
It's complicated.

248
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:01,413
Of course, if we can't win the bid here,
we plan to visit ranches later.

249
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:09,755
Sorry, I have to go.

250
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:16,262
Next up is lot number 151.

251
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:21,834
Black Flash, born March 15th 2011.
Male, Seal brown.

252
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:24,003
Fathered by Disc Eye.

253
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,405
The stud we've all been
waiting for is here!

254
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,141
All right! 190 million yen?

255
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,010
Can we get 200 million?

256
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,179
-200 million?
-Yes!

257
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:34,747
210 million yen?

258
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:35,714
210 million yen.

259
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:36,816
220 million yen?

260
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,884
230 million yen?

261
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,452
The owner on the first row.

262
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,956
-240 million?
-Yes!

263
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,024
240 million.

264
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,194
250 million?

265
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,462
-Yes!
-250 million.

266
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,398
-260 million?
-Yes!

267
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:53,299
260 million.

268
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,067
-270 million?
-President.

269
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:57,002
We're 100 million over budget.

270
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:57,937
Are you sure…

271
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:58,838
-Yes!
-270 million.

272
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:02,141
-280 million?
-Yes!

273
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,209
280 million.

274
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,810
-290 million?
-Yes!

275
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:05,711
290 million.

276
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,780
-300 million yen?
-Yes!

277
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:08,781
300 million yen.

278
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,083
We've reached the milestone
of 300 million yen.

279
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,752
Do I have 310 million yen?

280
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:16,989
310 million yen?

281
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:19,458
-A stud with a strong sire.
-President.

282
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,227
-We can't afford…
-310 million?

283
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:22,194
Yes!

284
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,363
310 million yen.

285
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,566
320 million yen?

286
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,335
-Yes!
-320 million yen.

287
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,071
Do I have 330 million?

288
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:34,907
330 million yen?

289
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:37,743
Soon, we'll have our last call.

290
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,845
Do I have 330 million yen?

291
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,449
330 million yen, last call.

292
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,952
No bids for 330 million yen?

293
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:54,059
It goes to the owner by
Spotter Sugiyama for 320 million yen.

294
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:07,373
Horses purchased at the Hokuryo auction
will spend their time there

295
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:10,209
until they become full-fledged racehorses.

296
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,680
In human terms, this place
is like a prestigious boarding school.

297
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,283
If you consider their debut
as entering the workforce,

298
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:21,754
then that horse is a super elite,
who has had the best education possible

299
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,956
from kindergarten to university.

300
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,659
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

301
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:29,862
Mr. Hironaka.

302
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,331
Congratulations on winning the other day.

303
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,400
-The Japanese Derby.
-Thank you.

304
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:35,801
Hironaka!

305
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:37,603
Hello.

306
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:39,905
This is Hokuryo's CEO.

307
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,974
-Oh, hello, sir.
-Hello.

308
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:43,342
Where's Mr. Sanno?

309
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,110
He's working on the next strategy.

310
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:49,014
Mr. Sanno always
livens things up every year.

311
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,683
We're grateful. I'm Nomura.

312
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:52,851
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

313
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,153
My pleasure.

314
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,223
I now need you to buy
another ten horses, Mr. Shiina.

315
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,426
We still have to check out other ranches.

316
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:02,261
-Oh, that's right. Hironaka.
-Yes?

317
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,496
I would like to introduce you to someone.

318
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:05,664
Oh, okay.

319
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,466
Excuse us then.

320
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,568
Have fun. This way.

321
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:17,076
I won the bid for Akino Lily
who just won the Japan Derby, here.

322
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,646
In a one-on-one bidding war
with Mr. Sanno.

323
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,917
My first thought after I won

324
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:28,520
was how glad I was
not to have lost the bid to anyone.

325
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:35,627
I feel sorry for Mr. Sanno,
but because we had that bidding war,

326
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,831
my faith in Akino Lily became unshakable.

327
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:44,203
Thanks to him, they're the best in Japan.

328
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,274
Please pass along my thanks.

329
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,644
Understood.

330
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,893
Why didn't you go with your friends?

331
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,230
They said the car
would take two hours to fix.

332
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,132
And I knew you were here.

333
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,068
We have a lot of places
we need to go to, you know?

334
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,538
-Oh, is that her?
-Where?

335
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,607
Oh, there. There she is.

336
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:22,508
Gosh.

337
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,343
HAYASHIDA RANCH

338
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:29,148
-Oh, no! I'm scared!
-Yuriko.

339
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,049
Scary!

340
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,684
-Oh, they're cute from further away.
-Yuriko!

341
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,354
-They're cute further away.
-Sorry.

342
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:38,390
-I didn't mean to bring her here.
-Oh, it's fine.

343
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,492
Look. Happiness is doing fine like always.

344
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,995
Oh, look at that coat she has!

345
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,663
What? Is this horse Happiness?

346
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,165
Royal Happiness?

347
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,267
She won a big race once, right?

348
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,702
-What was it?
-Nakayama Himba Stakes, a G3.

349
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:51,904
I knew it.

350
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,607
He kept going on
about Happiness back then.

351
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,509
But he never let us see her.

352
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,013
He never lets us see the good parts!

353
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,182
You're weird, Dad.

354
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,784
You're the ones that never came
when I asked you to!

355
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,787
Royal Happiness, owned by Kozo Sanno,

356
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:12,491
is a broodmare,
a female horse used to produce foals.

357
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:16,028
Horses that performed well
during their careers

358
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:20,499
or have excellent pedigrees
are often returned to a breeding ranch

359
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:24,236
to live out their lives
as a mother horse for breeding.

360
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:25,137
President.

361
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:30,843
Before the year's end,
I'm thinking of closing the ranch.

362
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,946
Thank you for everything.

363
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:38,217
This year? But it's almost New Year's!

364
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,386
Breeding, training… I can't do it anymore.

365
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:46,859
President, you've been so good to me.

366
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,761
Do you have any health issues?

367
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,830
It's not that, but…

368
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:55,534
We don't have a successor,

369
00:18:56,668 --> 00:19:00,973
and I don't think we can fight
against the tide.

370
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:03,408
I understand.

371
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,078
Sorry for all the trouble.

372
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:07,746
Not at all.

373
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,582
Thank you for the memories.

374
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,686
Leave Fight and Izana to me.

375
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:19,758
Happiness, can you take her in too?

376
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,860
I'll take care of her.

377
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:26,665
Mr. Kurisu.

378
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,467
You saved us.

379
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,502
-Thank you.
-No…

380
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:36,241
Can't you hold on a bit longer?

381
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,379
Enough for one more win?

382
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,182
That's the difficult part.

383
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:48,320
I don't feel like we can win
against the Hokuryo horses.

384
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,394
Everyone wants a horse from Hokuryo Farm.

385
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:59,031
A small Hidaka ranch asking
for 100 million yen in a private sale

386
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,399
is practically a joke.

387
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:05,804
Twelve point seven.

388
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:07,673
Twelve point two.

389
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,708
She's in great shape.

390
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,878
Worth every penny.

391
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:14,980
The price is just a stepping stone.

392
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,084
It's not enough.

393
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,454
I want her to exceed my expectations.

394
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,323
Contact the trainer.

395
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,625
Understood.

396
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:32,497
Your family also ran a ranch
in Hidaka, right?

397
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,267
It doesn't exist anymore, though.

398
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:39,004
I wanted to save it, but I was too late.

399
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,707
Just go home already!

400
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:44,243
I just want to tag along for a while!

401
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:45,177
Gosh!

402
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,245
President.

403
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,148
Actually, there's a horse
I would like you to see.

404
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:55,454
So Mr. Nozaki bred them in America?

405
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,958
He's a hardworking, determined man,
but few understand him.

406
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,494
No, but 100 million…

407
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,430
Why is he asking for such a high price?

408
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,967
An unknown ranch
would never get a sale at this price.

409
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,838
All we can do is take a look at the horse.

410
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:14,906
I don't like him.

411
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:16,642
Why?

412
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:18,810
He doesn't understand business.

413
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:22,914
"I bred it over in America, so buy it
for a higher cost," doesn't work.

414
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:24,116
Private sales are about trust.

415
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,619
If you don't plan to sell,
you shouldn't breed it!

416
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,154
-But…
-Okay.

417
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:31,023
Let's go to this farm.

418
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:31,923
What?

419
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,059
With uncooperative ranches like this,

420
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,728
it's better to go there
and talk to them directly!

421
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:41,767
Actually, it's my friend's farm,
so please be nice to them.

422
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:42,901
Why should I care?

423
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,269
-Let's go!
-Okay!

424
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:50,108
Sorry for making you wait!

425
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:54,579
Hey. Is that person really your friend?

426
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:55,547
What?

427
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:57,316
Your "friend"?

428
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:00,419
Sorry.

429
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:03,722
Mr. Hironaka is going back
to Miho tonight, so it has to be now.

430
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,190
-Sorry for the surprise visit.
-It's fine.

431
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,091
Well then…

432
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,160
Yes, show us the 100 million yen horse.

433
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:09,328
Don't hold out on me!

434
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:12,164
-It's actually him.
-What?

435
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,933
Oh, nothing! This way, please.

436
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:24,076
Dad, this is the owner of the Royal…

437
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:26,211
Hi. I am Kozo Sanno.

438
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,579
A horse owner.

439
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:31,783
My secretary insisted, so we dropped by.

440
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,589
This is my friend from college…

441
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:40,892
-It's been a while. I'm Kurisu.
-Skip the greetings. Show me the horse!

442
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,361
Are you sure?

443
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:43,962
What?

444
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,864
Compared to Hokuryo horses,

445
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,266
our pedigrees and environment
are very different.

446
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,167
Dad.

447
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:53,605
Perhaps Hokuryo
will have a better horse for you.

448
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:54,806
Dad.

449
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,611
Mr. Nozaki, we didn't come here
for no reason.

450
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:03,382
-Kanako recommended it to us.
-Quit the talk. Show me the horse.

451
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:04,549
President.

452
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:08,820
Do you truly have the will to win?

453
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,489
-Cut it out, Dad!
-What?

454
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,591
I'm asking if you have the will to win.

455
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:14,459
I'm sorry. I'll take you to the horse.

456
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:16,528
How many years have you been doing this?

457
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:18,563
-Don't talk like an amateur!
-President.

458
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,198
This isn't business.

459
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,401
It's a fight.

460
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:26,004
A fight where, to win, we stake our lives!

461
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,573
Oh, wow, well said.

462
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,577
I'm also fighting for the livelihoods
of hundreds of employees!

463
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:34,813
We can't sell to someone
who doesn't intend to win!

464
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,315
-Stop it!
-I said we won't sell!

465
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:39,151
-Dad…
-Sir! We haven't seen the horse…

466
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:41,953
-Should I lend you my hearing aid?
-President…

467
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,923
-He'll have a cup of tea.
-Okay, sure.

468
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,125
Is there no other place around?

469
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:50,962
Everyone around here uses this place.

470
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:51,997
You want some kelp?

471
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:54,366
Oh, anything is fine. Bring it quickly!

472
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:57,469
I am truly sorry.

473
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,070
No, we are too.

474
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:02,240
What are you doing?

475
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:04,009
-Facebook.
-I see.

476
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,449
Okay, here are your drinks. Thank you.

477
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,527
I think he's too emotionally attached.
It makes him stubborn.

478
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:24,162
Hello!

479
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,164
Put the Fighters on.

480
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:29,167
-They're not playing today.
-What? Seriously?

481
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:31,436
That's so boring.

482
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:32,971
What do you think?

483
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,641
About your horses?

484
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,411
You'll take over, right?

485
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,814
Many ranches are closing
due to a lack of successors.

486
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:47,152
But you have to live on
even after your father dies.

487
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,921
Does your father understand that?

488
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,791
He doesn't understand.

489
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,560
That old man knows nothing!

490
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:58,230
-Hey!
-It's not about winning or losing.

491
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:00,832
We're desperately trying to make a living!

492
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,901
He doesn't understand any of that.

493
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,437
I'm not asking you guys.

494
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:07,405
I'm asking her.

495
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:08,373
Oh, my!

496
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,609
So scary.

497
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:14,913
I believe…

498
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,217
my horse won't lose to anyone.

499
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,152
There it is.

500
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,955
I understand how you all feel.

501
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:28,593
However, the ultimate goal
of a racehorse is to win.

502
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,763
-To produce a horse that can win--
-How many ranches have you ruined?

503
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,601
How many breeders have been
sweet-talked by your father,

504
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:40,238
spent a fortune, then gone bankrupt?

505
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:46,144
Before the year's end,
I'm thinking of closing the ranch.

506
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,581
You can't afford to dream.

507
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:53,184
As long as you live here,
you have to do what you must!

508
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,855
Breed horses and sell them,
even if the price is low!

509
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:59,024
That's how a respectable ranch is run!

510
00:25:59,090 --> 00:25:59,925
You mock us all.

511
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:02,561
-We're not mocking--
-You are!

512
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,030
You said, "Things can't go on like this."

513
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:07,332
That's basically rejecting
our way of life!

514
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,466
I apologize.

515
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:15,974
What you said resonates with me.

516
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:17,375
But…

517
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:21,379
we are making this deal to win.

518
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:22,514
Of course,

519
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:27,118
I fully understand that every horse
carries the wishes of its carers'.

520
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:29,688
But we…

521
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,824
We want hope.

522
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:35,760
Hope that we can win.

523
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,463
We are looking for such a horse.

524
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,999
We want to meet such a breeder.

525
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,401
"Hidaka ranches are no good."

526
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,705
"Only Hokuryo is good."
We absolutely don't believe that.

527
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:51,843
You come from the city and demand hope?

528
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:54,980
It's easy for you to say, you know?

529
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:58,617
Easy for you to say.

530
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,171
Now, in Hidaka,

531
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:23,675
there are many ranches
that are ignored in auctions.

532
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:27,045
Few people remember the good times.

533
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:29,914
It's tough to know that times were better.

534
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,950
But it's also tough not knowing.

535
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,989
-I'll take her home.
-Okay.

536
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:42,661
Mr. Sanno, I'm truly sorry
we couldn't show you the horse.

537
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:44,896
No worries.

538
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,665
See you.

539
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:48,767
Let's go.

540
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:50,468
Okay.

541
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:51,836
Keep fighting.

542
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:57,375
You are the ones
who will make the horses stronger.

543
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,956
I got married six months
after breaking up with you.

544
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:17,062
Things like that really do happen.

545
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,869
After marrying and having a child,

546
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:28,506
my way of thinking gradually changed.

547
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:35,313
Before,
I never intended to take over the farm,

548
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:38,083
even though I loved it.

549
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:47,726
Did your husband disagree
with you taking over the farm?

550
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:51,029
For a while,

551
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:54,232
we tried living in two locations,
Tokyo and here.

552
00:28:54,733 --> 00:29:00,238
But I just felt like it would be better
for Shohei to live here.

553
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,642
So we talked about it seriously,

554
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,145
but it didn't work out.

555
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:10,248
It was an amicable divorce.

556
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:13,685
And then I came back here.

557
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,292
But I was so scared.

558
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,963
Scared that I might ruin my child's life.

559
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,198
I was so scared,

560
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,269
I tried to forget it by working.

561
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:34,572
And yet…

562
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:38,676
This is frustrating.

563
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:49,854
-Well, thank you.
-Sure.

564
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:54,559
Mr. Hayashida…

565
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:57,695
He's closing his ranch.

566
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:59,631
What?

567
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,702
It was my first time witnessing it.

568
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,805
It was anticlimactic.

569
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,407
Mr. Hayashida too?

570
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:16,447
Of course, a horse won't run forever,

571
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:19,150
people get old,

572
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:22,887
and separation can come suddenly.

573
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:28,393
But still,
I can't just say goodbye that easily.

574
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:33,965
By sticking together,
maybe we can find a new dream, right?

575
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,634
Even if it's tough now,

576
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:40,605
you won't get there unless you continue.

577
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:42,640
Yes.

578
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:44,943
So…

579
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,881
let me think about it with you.

580
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:53,985
About the farm and about the horse.

581
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,491
Let's think about them.

582
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:02,126
Together.

583
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:09,868
Oh, Shohei.

584
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:11,603
What are you doing?

585
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,105
Nothing. You weren't coming in…

586
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,141
Good evening.

587
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,643
Oh, Shohei.

588
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,281
Well…

589
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,817
-See you.
-Yeah.

590
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,294
Happiness?

591
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:37,962
I thought about it all night.

592
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:42,901
Can we move Happiness
from Mr. Hayashida to the Nozaki Farm?

593
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:46,471
Happiness is a broodmare.

594
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,675
Boarding a broodmare
requires us to pay a boarding fee.

595
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,144
If we're going to pay anyway,

596
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:57,482
then let's hire Nozaki Farm
to help them out.

597
00:31:57,548 --> 00:32:00,418
Why would we want to help that farm?

598
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:04,689
You said it yourself.

599
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,592
"You are the ones
who will make the horses stronger."

600
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:12,697
Well, we need time for that.

601
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:15,533
Time to keep the farm going.

602
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,469
And by doing this,

603
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:21,839
we will have a chance
to meet a strong horse.

604
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,175
That's poor logic.

605
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:30,648
But it would be a shame
to waste a successor.

606
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:33,851
We're not helping that geezer.

607
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:35,486
We're betting on the young.

608
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:38,823
Make that clear.

609
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:42,026
Understood.

610
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:48,299
We've already arrived at the paddock area.

611
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,970
No, we should be the ones apologizing
for coming so suddenly.

612
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:56,774
Well, we're around the dead end
straight ahead from the entrance.

613
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,310
Yes, that's right.

614
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:03,748
We'll be waiting here.

615
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:16,127
Hey.

616
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,347
No way.

617
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:11,949
It took a liking to him.

618
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,587
That shy horse…

619
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:33,104
Are you sure you want to hire us?

620
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:40,945
Yes.

621
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:44,482
Please take care of Royal Happiness.

622
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:48,319
Please help her produce a healthy foal.

623
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:51,289
Thank you very much.

624
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,525
Hey. Do you have a glass?

625
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:56,360
A cup is fine too.

626
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,863
I suddenly want a drink.

627
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:00,731
Gosh.

628
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,835
Sake in the morning is the best, isn't it?

629
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:09,740
By the way, what's with that horse?

630
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:14,745
He's a little thin,
but calm and dignified.

631
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,650
You could confidently sell him.
Why be so stubborn?

632
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:22,887
I am confident.

633
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:27,925
If I weren't, I wouldn't have put
a price of 100 million.

634
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,697
I don't get it.

635
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:38,536
You're always so demanding of others,
but don't want to talk about yourself.

636
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:42,607
That's not fair.

637
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:45,943
Talk to us. That's what business is.

638
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:50,681
Thanks for the drink.

639
00:35:57,955 --> 00:35:59,123
In the past,

640
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,660
thoroughbreds meant Hidaka.

641
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,863
But now it's tough.

642
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,900
Hokuryo Farm dominates.

643
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:13,237
The people in Hidaka have given up.

644
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:16,507
We're just surviving now.

645
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:19,243
But I want to win.

646
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:21,579
I want to win.

647
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:27,752
Otherwise, I don't know
what I even live for.

648
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,289
It's the same for the horses.

649
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:35,860
What were they born for,
and what will they die for?

650
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:42,500
That's why I decided to take a gamble
that Hokuryo wouldn't.

651
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:47,405
You went all the way
to America for breeding?

652
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:51,709
Everyone around me called me a fool.

653
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:56,714
"No one is looking
for that kind of bloodline anymore."

654
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:58,849
They called me a gambler.

655
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:02,286
But I am serious.

656
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:05,089
I will win with that horse.

657
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,594
My goal, no matter what anyone says,

658
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,530
is to win a G1
with a horse from this farm.

659
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:18,636
To stand at the pinnacle of over
8,000 thoroughbreds born each year.

660
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:23,274
I want to win
the nation's top Grade I race

661
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:25,576
and make our horse the best in Japan.

662
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:26,978
At the Arima Kinen.

663
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:32,583
I appreciate the boarding contract.

664
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,720
I can also tell that you,

665
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,423
as my daughter's friend,
are trying to help us.

666
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,758
Thank you.

667
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:42,693
However,

668
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,697
regarding that horse, I don't need pity.

669
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:49,300
I just really want

670
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:53,037
to sell him to someone
truly determined to win.

671
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:54,839
That's all.

672
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:57,441
It's not that I don't want to sell.

673
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:02,546
The 100 million is a price
I set to test that resolve.

674
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,550
Who do you think you are?

675
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:11,422
You make it sound like we,
horse owners, don't want to win.

676
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:14,859
Resolve?

677
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,162
Stop insulting us!

678
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:28,572
Why are you so convinced
that only you want to win?

679
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,776
What does winning mean to you?

680
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:41,652
My father stands for…

681
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,690
his fellow farm owners,

682
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:49,894
who grew up and worked alongside him.

683
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,097
Their emotions make him carry on.

684
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:56,167
Many tried their best,

685
00:38:57,201 --> 00:39:01,472
yet had to close down
or died with their dreams unfulfilled.

686
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,675
We carry on the dream of those people.

687
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,283
My mother was one of them.

688
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:15,786
My father's dream

689
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:21,625
is the dream of everyone in Hidaka.

690
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:32,536
Dream, huh?

691
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,441
Sorry, but my dream is also the G1.

692
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,611
To take first place at Arima.

693
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,347
How about that?

694
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:47,451
Someone who shares your dream is here.

695
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:52,022
And now,

696
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,892
I have one more dream.

697
00:39:57,161 --> 00:40:01,165
To achieve that win with a Hidaka horse.

698
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:09,240
If I win with a Hokuryo horse,
no one will be surprised.

699
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,242
I will have bought that win.

700
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,145
They'll just say, "Of course, he won."

701
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:19,984
That's not what I'm aiming for.

702
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,721
If people aren't shocked, it's no fun.

703
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:25,589
"I don't care about horse races."

704
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:27,792
"I don't know about horses."

705
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:31,328
People like that will say,
"What is this horse?"

706
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:35,466
I'll bring such a horse
to the race and win.

707
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:40,237
I'll win the G1.

708
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:45,075
For that, I need a Hidaka horse.

709
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,517
Let me join your dream.

710
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:06,130
Do you have the will to win?

711
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:11,202
It's all I want.

712
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,472
Then please, I beg you!

713
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:28,986
All right, let's toast!
A celebratory toast!

714
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,156
We're all drunk with ambition!
In the same boat!

715
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,658
-Yes!
-Yes.

716
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:36,060
Good answer.

717
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:38,562
Cheers.

718
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:40,631
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

719
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:07,157
I wonder if Mr. Hironaka will like it.

720
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,160
Even if he doesn't like it,

721
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:12,930
I'm betting on this horse.

722
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:15,633
The horse is the main star.

723
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:17,268
Yes.

724
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,538
Kurisu.

725
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:22,873
You name it.

726
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:26,110
What? Me?

727
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:29,213
You brought everyone together.

728
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:30,848
Take responsibility.

729
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:32,616
What?

730
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:38,088
How about "Thunder"?

731
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,191
-Thunder?
-I mean, come on.

732
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:47,398
Royal Thunder.

733
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:50,301
Thunder, huh?

734
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:53,237
Thank you for reaching this decision.

735
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:55,339
"Reaching"?

736
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:00,811
I made my decision
the moment I saw this farm.

737
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:02,279
What?

738
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:05,983
Have you looked at the grass
in this paddock?

739
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,686
The tips of the grass are properly mowed.

740
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,821
For the horses' sake, this is essential.

741
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:15,125
But many ranches skip it
because they don't have enough manpower.

742
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:19,964
But this place…

743
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:24,969
Despite having only two people,
they managed it perfectly.

744
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:30,007
That makes them trustworthy.

745
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,044
I told you.

746
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:36,547
About horses, I don't know…

747
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,983
You don't know much. Even so…

748
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:40,918
That was the deciding factor?

749
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:44,288
Who do you think I am?

750
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:46,357
Oh, right.

751
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:47,691
That woman…

752
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:49,393
She's your ex, right?

753
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:53,263
What? Are you stupid?

754
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:56,400
You're single, right?

755
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,203
Hold her hand, at least.

756
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:01,805
Did you hold hands last night?

757
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:04,308
We didn't! Are you stupid?

758
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,444
You just called me stupid twice,
you bastard!

759
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:21,859
-Mr. Kurisu.
-Yes?

760
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:24,094
-The president is asking for you.
-Okay.

761
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:33,070
Royal Hope.

762
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:36,473
What? Wait, what?

763
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:38,509
Not bad, right?

764
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:44,114
Yes.

765
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:47,685
I was looking for a horse
with a name like that.

766
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:54,158
And so they finally met

767
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:59,263
a great hope
that will turn the wheels of fate.

768
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,166
Hope?

769
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:04,668
Hope, huh?

770
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:07,004
It's good.

771
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:08,939
It's really good.

772
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,916
MY DREAM FOR THE FUTURE
JOCKEY - SHOHEI NOZAKI

773
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,190
Shohei? Are you back?

774
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:27,624
Yes, I'm home!

775
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:33,397
The race continues
until the legacy is passed on.

776
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,699
Would you ride our Royal Hope?

777
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:37,434
-You're arrogant.
-Can you convince him?

778
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:40,204
"Kozo Sanno appoints troublemaker,
Ryujiro Saki."

779
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,339
Would you consider transferring
to the national circuit?

780
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,575
Not everyone can be
lured by the national circuit.

781
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:46,310
I have no choice but to bet on you two.

782
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:48,445
"Before I knew it, I was running."

783
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:49,947
