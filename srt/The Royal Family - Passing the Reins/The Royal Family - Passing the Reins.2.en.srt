00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,211
<i>Eiji Kurisu, a tax accountant,</i>

2
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:15,482
<i>in an effort to revitalize</i>
<i>the temp company, Royal Human,</i>

3
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:18,018
<i>was asked by Mr. Yutaro Sanno,</i>
<i>the head of HR,</i>

4
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:21,388
<i>to investigate the unprofitable</i>
<i>Horse Racing Division</i>

5
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:22,622
<i>so it could be shut down.</i>

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,556
<i>However…</i>

7
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:26,026
Do you have a dream?

8
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:31,831
<i>While being messed around with by</i>
<i>the president and horse owner, Kozo Sanno…</i>

9
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:34,968
The value of a horse
can't be measured with mere numbers.

10
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,604
This man is your friend, too.

11
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,908
<i>He got to know the joy of horse racing</i>
<i>and was captivated by it.</i>

12
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:45,445
<i>If no owner can be found to take them in,</i>

13
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,514
they'll likely be put down.

14
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:50,016
Put down?

15
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:55,155
<i>In order to keep them as racehorses,</i>
<i>he went against Yutaro's plan</i>

16
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:58,024
<i>and decided to help</i>
<i>the Horse Racing Division.</i>

17
00:00:58,091 --> 00:00:59,793
This is an act of embezzlement!

18
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,831
Personally,<i></i>I'd like Mr. Sanno
to stay in the horse racing world.

19
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:05,732
<i>Go!</i>

20
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,501
- Go!
- Go!

21
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,770
<i>After seeing a serious race</i>
<i>by Royal Fight,</i>

22
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:13,006
<i>who had just avoided being sold…</i>

23
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,776
For the first time, I've done something
that earned someone's gratitude.

24
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:18,311
Want to come over to my place?

25
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:19,846
<i>You've got no place to go, right?</i>

26
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,848
<i>I want to win</i>
<i>the nation's top Grade I race</i>

27
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,817
<i>and make our horse the best in Japan.</i>

28
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:25,351
At the Arima Kinen.

29
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,886
Want to give it a try?

30
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:29,489
In exchange, you must never betray me.

31
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:31,257
Understood.

32
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:37,297
<i>He quit his job at the accounting firm</i>
<i>and chose to work with Kozo Sanno, but</i>…

33
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:39,632
The tax accountant acted unexpectedly.

34
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,367
Think about what to do next.

35
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:45,138
You have to protect that company.

36
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:53,313
Oh, you're here.

37
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,314
President.

38
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,315
Do you know about him?

39
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:56,683
I do.

40
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,619
First, read through
all the horse documents.

41
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:02,122
Wait. Look at this.

42
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,091
"Horse Racing Division,
Private Secretary."

43
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:07,360
I had them made for you. Pass them out.

44
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,295
I thought I was to be an accountant.

45
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:10,797
- Morning.
- Good morning.

46
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,165
I'm a tax accountant.

47
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:14,534
I don't know anything about horses.

48
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:16,569
It's fine.

49
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,906
Since a tax man is here,
everyone will think we're doing fine.

50
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,207
It's camouflage.

51
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:22,075
What?

52
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,210
Sir, we need to hurry
for your next meeting.

53
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:25,145
Right.

54
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,714
- All right, we're departing at five.
- What?

55
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,817
Let's win a G1!

56
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,187
I've prepared a spot for you.

57
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:34,921
Okay.

58
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:35,788
HORSE RACING DIVISION

59
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,429
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

60
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:50,803
Come.

61
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,473
It's your official introduction. Come on.

62
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,414
Is it not to your liking?

63
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,415
What?

64
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,951
You haven't touched the wine at all.

65
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,252
Oh, no.

66
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,288
I shouldn't get drunk.

67
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,522
Why?

68
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:10,924
- Please drink.
- Hey.

69
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,158
Where's Yutaro?

70
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,293
I don't know.

71
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,495
He doesn't even read my messages.

72
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,730
Just like his father.

73
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,032
A workaholic.

74
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:21,201
A migratory fish
that dies if it ever stops.

75
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,969
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,205
That not all of us could be present here.

77
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,273
Oh, it's nothing. Thank you.

78
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,741
Still, we're lucky.

79
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,878
We were able to find
a new manager right away.

80
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:34,280
And it's someone your type.

81
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,883
- In what way?
- Come on.

82
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,751
The obedient type.

83
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,120
He will follow you into hell.

84
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,256
- Come on.
- What you're doing is gambling.

85
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,058
Mr. Kurisu, too.

86
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:46,960
Please control yourself.

87
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:48,895
Hey. That's enough already.

88
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,439
- Mr. Yamada.
- Yes?

89
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,274
- May I get some water?
- Yes, Miss.

90
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:07,080
Well…

91
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:12,952
I actually have an old friend
who's in the ranch business.

92
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,153
Horse ranch?

93
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,154
Yes.

94
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,457
A family farm in Hidaka.

95
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:22,929
My friend said their role is to protect
the possibility of evolution

96
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,331
and pass it on to future generations.

97
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,668
And if so, I think my role

98
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:32,438
may be to safely advance
the president's horses

99
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,774
to the next race.

100
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,777
Sorry, I'm rambling.

101
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,848
You're a cocky one.

102
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,120
On the rocks, sir?

103
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,988
Oh, don't worry about me.

104
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,957
Don't be shy.

105
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,826
Mr. Yamada, I'll have one, water-diluted.

106
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:54,827
Yes, sir.

107
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,262
You'll have the same, right?

108
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:57,664
Yes.

109
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,565
- Make his weaker.
- Understood.

110
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,533
Let me do it.

111
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,267
YUTARO

112
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,535
It's alright.

113
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:05,838
I'm tired.

114
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,043
They'll say lots of things about us.

115
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,545
But don't let it get to you.

116
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,249
Our horse division
isn't the only one in the red.

117
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,785
How dare they act
like they're better than us?

118
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:20,586
I spent today

119
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:24,590
going through the documents left
by my predecessor, Mr. Kaneshiro.

120
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,393
They were very well-organized.

121
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,065
Does that excuse what he did?

122
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,701
Of course not.

123
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,570
What Mr. Kaneshiro did was inexcusable.

124
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,405
However…

125
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:44,944
I won't waste those documents
and use them in my own way.

126
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,748
There are still lots of things
I don't know.

127
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:51,617
Please bear with me.

128
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,823
Why are you being so formal now?

129
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:03,529
Uncomfortable situations, like today,
are also part of your job.

130
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,164
Don't forget that.

131
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:09,235
If possible, I'd like to focus
only on the horses going forward.

132
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,603
That's a no.

133
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,073
All right, here.

134
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,008
- Cheers.
- Yes.

135
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,945
Don't you ever betray me.

136
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,246
Yes.

137
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:29,622
Mr. Kurisu!

138
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,357
- Yes?
- I'll take you home.

139
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:33,693
- Oh, it's fine!
- No.

140
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,428
- No, but…
- I'll get scolded.

141
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,029
In that case…

142
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:39,999
- Sorry for the trouble.
- It's fine.

143
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:41,467
Go ahead.

144
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,938
Please accept this as well.

145
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,140
What?

146
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,442
The president said to give it to you.

147
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,079
He said it's a gift for your new job.

148
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,216
Oh, wow.

149
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,190
- Ms. Takeda!
- Hello, sir!

150
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,659
I had Advertising estimate

151
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:09,295
the cost-effectiveness
of our racing business.

152
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,297
These are the results.

153
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,566
Unfortunately,

154
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:17,136
no matter how much Royal's horses run,
they won't be good advertising for us.

155
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,671
And why is that?

156
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:20,606
They don't win.

157
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:25,812
Unless a horse wins several famous races,
no one will pay attention to it.

158
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,480
You never give up, huh?

159
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:33,453
The department's continuation was
only just approved at the last meeting.

160
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,488
Of course, I respect that.

161
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,523
However, the young employees won't wait.

162
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,393
They say, "We're hounded for KPIs,

163
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,796
while the horses are let off the hook
no matter how much they lose."

164
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:47,900
So I have a proposal.

165
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:53,606
Win one central race within the year.

166
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:55,708
Just one win is fine.

167
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,143
Just once.

168
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,712
If a Royal horse gets a win,

169
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,782
we can use that to reassure
the young employees.

170
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,852
However, if you can't win even once,

171
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:09,422
the department will be abolished
by the year's end.

172
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,724
- How about it?
- Wait!

173
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,593
"Just one win is fine."

174
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:15,761
You say it so easily.

175
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:21,334
Even now, hundreds of thousands of horses
are working their tails off to win.

176
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,802
Interesting.

177
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:24,470
Let's try it.

178
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,404
President!

179
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,340
Don't underestimate our horses.

180
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:30,610
Then I'll take that as your consent.

181
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,146
Just in case.

182
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:38,351
I know this is a tough first task,
but I wish you the best of luck.

183
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:48,227
Are you sure it's a good idea, President?
Agreeing to his proposal.

184
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:52,698
He didn't say we had to win a G1.

185
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,535
A win in any race is a win.

186
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,771
Don't worry.

187
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,374
We have one that might.

188
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,109
Fight.

189
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:07,713
<i>At this time,</i>
<i>Kozo Sanno owned a total of 11 horses,</i>

190
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,683
<i>including the yearlings</i>
<i>he had just purchased.</i>

191
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,053
<i>However,</i>
<i>they were mares that had been retired,</i>

192
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,589
<i>mid-level horses</i>
<i>whose performances had plateaued,</i>

193
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:20,960
<i>or two-year-olds troubled by injuries</i>
<i>with no clear debut in sight.</i>

194
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,062
<i>Few of them had strategic value.</i>

195
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:26,899
<i>The only one with potential was the one</i>
<i>who finished second in the Niigata race.</i>

196
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,834
<i>Royal Fight.</i>

197
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:33,205
<i>After the 400-meter mark, Number Four,</i>
<i>Royal Fight has gained speed!</i>

198
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:35,207
<i>From sixth to fifth, now fourth place!</i>

199
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:36,275
<i>Third place now!</i>

200
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,744
<i>Charging straight!</i>
<i>Will Royal Fight make it?</i>

201
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:40,313
- Go!
- Go!

202
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,185
We'll expedite his training

203
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,221
and have Fight run
in as many races as possible.

204
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,325
We go to the training center tomorrow.

205
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:53,726
Get ready to go to Miho.

206
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,328
Yes, sir.

207
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,857
<i>A bit of a special horse.</i>

208
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,526
<i>She has a crooked leg.</i>

209
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:29,662
<i>That kind of horse usually doesn't sell.</i>

210
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:32,632
<i>With a leg like that,</i>
<i>there's no guarantee they can run.</i>

211
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,875
<i>A racehorse.</i>

212
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:48,347
<i>Generally, thoroughbreds born in Japan</i>
<i>that enter a national race,</i>

213
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:53,185
<i>are purchased by owners</i>
<i>at a breeding farm,</i>

214
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,354
<i>and trained at a specialized facility</i>

215
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:58,491
<i>to learn the fundamentals</i>
<i>of being a racehorse.</i>

216
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,428
<i>In addition, the owner</i>
<i>selects a trainer to entrust its care to,</i>

217
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,765
<i>and as the horse grows,</i>
<i>it is moved from the farm</i>

218
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,900
<i>to a training center.</i>

219
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:12,304
<i>Only horses that are registered there</i>
<i>can take part in actual races.</i>

220
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,305
Morning, Fight.

221
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,740
<i>For a horse,</i>

222
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,643
<i>this is as tough as entering</i>
<i>a top-tier elite school</i>

223
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:22,014
<i>and overcoming numerous trials</i>
<i>to enter society.</i>

224
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:27,586
<i>Their race</i>
<i>starts the moment they are born.</i>

225
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,791
ROYAL IZANA

226
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,113
Quite a view, huh?

227
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,351
Every horse here is elite, trained to win.

228
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,428
Let's go see Tadokoro.

229
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:10,429
Okay.

230
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,004
Good morning.

231
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,958
That's why I'm telling you to move it up!

232
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,226
It's impossible!

233
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:43,562
We were preparing
for the race in two weeks' time.

234
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,498
Fight can't be ready on time!

235
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,934
First place isn't something
you can get so easily!

236
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:51,170
It's the trainer's job
to aim for that, isn't it?

237
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,239
All horses are bred to win.

238
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:56,809
That's precisely why we must
follow the right procedures.

239
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,411
Horses are living creatures. Not machines.

240
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:03,048
Every horse has its own personality
and the right way to train it.

241
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,384
Seeing to that is our job as trainers!

242
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,586
Oh, quit babbling on.

243
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,021
- What?
- Fine!

244
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:10,823
- I'll find another.
- What?

245
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,858
- We'll change stables.
- What?

246
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:16,128
- Let's look for another one.
- Wait, President! Wait…

247
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:17,830
I'm so sorry.

248
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,332
I'll consult with him again
after he's calmed down.

249
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,700
It's impossible.

250
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:23,502
I can't work with him!

251
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:24,470
What?

252
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,739
I've been very patient with him too.

253
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,641
I've had enough of his whims.

254
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,710
If you change Fight,
Izana goes with him, right?

255
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,512
No, but…

256
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,714
They need you, Mr. Tadokoro.

257
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,918
It's all right.
Another trainer can do just as well.

258
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:39,952
They're a calm bunch.

259
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,826
I did my best to care for them. My utmost.

260
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:50,429
But to want a first-place win right away?

261
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,365
No offence to the Hayashida Ranch,

262
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:56,902
but those horses, they're like commoners,
thrown in among the elites.

263
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,640
You should prioritize giving them
a good life over trying to win.

264
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:03,209
Especially Izana.

265
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,489
SORYU CO. CEO

266
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:22,461
Alright.

267
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:24,463
Oh, sir.

268
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,131
We just arrived.

269
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,501
No. Thank you.

270
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,103
Okay. Thank you.

271
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:35,040
This is a horse we purchased
at the Hokuryo auction last year.

272
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,142
This one…

273
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,678
It's worth 230 million yen.

274
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,781
I took a look at it
and thought it was amazing.

275
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:44,950
It's stabled at Hokuryo for now,

276
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:49,421
but I'd like to have this one race
as soon as possible.

277
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:50,556
Why?

278
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,826
They're the type
that grows with experience.

279
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,663
If it doesn't see faster horses,
it won't try to run fast.

280
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,132
Of course, we must win,

281
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,768
but I'd like to enjoy watching it
mature in the races.

282
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,703
With you.

283
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:06,405
How about it?

284
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,742
Won't you accept
one of our offers already, sir?

285
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:14,546
- Oh, please stop calling me "sir."
<i>- A trainer manages racehorses.</i>

286
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:18,450
<i>There is a limit to the number</i>
<i>of racehorses a trainer can manage,</i>

287
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:24,523
<i>and trainers with many wins naturally</i>
<i>receive a lot of requests and good horses.</i>

288
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,058
Do you know Ogino?

289
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,092
What?

290
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,594
Ogino.

291
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,930
The leading trainer last year.

292
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,533
Tateaki Ogino, I think?

293
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,868
I'm afraid I don't.

294
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:38,904
Do your homework first!

295
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,240
He's the top-ranking trainer right now.

296
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:44,777
- We're just going to talk to him?
- Enough. Just look him up already!

297
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:47,913
Wow, owners like him are the worst.

298
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,786
Just do as you're told!

299
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:55,020
I'm sorry.

300
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,162
Excuse me.

301
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:05,497
Mr. Ogino is extremely busy right now.

302
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,766
It's fine, thank you
for making time for us.

303
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:08,801
It's nothing.

304
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,437
My name is Kurisu.

305
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,940
You manage the Royal horses?

306
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,076
Yes. Oh, the documents.

307
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,879
Mr. Ogino is truly amazing.

308
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:23,349
Ten horses just for this weekend's races?

309
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:24,817
I expected nothing less.

310
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:30,322
These two horses are from the same ranch
and were purchased together,

311
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,624
so I figured they should be
transferred together.

312
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:33,692
I apologize.

313
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,228
You came all this way.

314
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:39,932
Our policy is to meet in person
and hear the details.

315
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,435
However right now,
Mr. Ogino has no vacancies.

316
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,742
Thank you. We'll try others.

317
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:51,710
Hey.

318
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,446
Sorry if I'm being nosy, but…

319
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:58,417
This year's Maiden Race ends
in the first week of October, doesn't it?

320
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:01,854
It does, you know. In October.

321
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,524
Of course, if you miss that,
you can still enter other races.

322
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:10,195
But it will be a harder fight
for the horses.

323
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:13,932
Excuse me.

324
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,605
<i>The Maiden Race, as the name suggests,</i>

325
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:24,343
<i>is a race for horses</i>
<i>that have never won before.</i>

326
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:28,981
<i>Most horses that haven't won a maiden race</i>
<i>by the autumn of their third year</i>

327
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:33,419
<i>are forced to transfer</i>
<i>to local racing or retire.</i>

328
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,792
Oh, excuse me.

329
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:43,195
Is Mr. Sugimoto's stable up ahead?

330
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,863
That's right.

331
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:53,105
Their owner has a bad reputation,
you know.

332
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,106
What?

333
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,509
You should trust the staff.

334
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:02,147
Mr. Sugimoto's stable
is on the next left turn.

335
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,349
Excuse me.

336
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:13,025
<i>During that time, Fight and Izana,</i>
<i>with nowhere to transfer to,</i>

337
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,663
<i>were moved to a nearby ranch</i>
<i>which serves as an external stable.</i>

338
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:25,437
Let's eat.

339
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,607
We need to change strategies.

340
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,277
Finding a stable just for Fight
should be easy.

341
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,513
What?

342
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:38,550
Are you saying we keep Fight
and Izana in separate stables?

343
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,220
Listen.

344
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,890
Though they share a stable,
they can't be together forever.

345
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:49,161
Once they become racehorses,
in a way, they're all alone.

346
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:50,963
But…

347
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,398
First place, at all costs. Right?

348
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:58,470
In any case, if Fight can't win,
they'll be separated anyway.

349
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:01,673
Reevaluate. We need a trainer who can win.

350
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,744
Say, "I understand."

351
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,785
I under…

352
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:17,356
I can't.

353
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,259
- What did you say?
- Of course.

354
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,861
As you said, I will prioritize Fight.

355
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:26,965
But I myself hate this idea.
I want to inform you of that. Sorry.

356
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,069
You're so cocky.

357
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:57,496
Yeah.

358
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,565
Yeah.

359
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:00,599
KANAKO'S SON

360
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,833
It's a game.

361
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,101
3DS.

362
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,137
- They have it in Tokyo.
- Hey.

363
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,738
- Kyohei.
- I'm home.

364
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,774
3DS!

365
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,409
3DS!

366
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:11,710
- Thank you.
- Your total is…

367
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,445
- Cheers!
- Thanks.

368
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,353
- This is yummy.
- Yes, the best!

369
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,356
Okay.

370
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:25,991
- Hey.
- Yes?

371
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,859
You don't live around here, do you?

372
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:30,062
No, my workplace is just nearby.

373
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,097
Gosh, I was so scared.

374
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:34,666
Let me see your business card.

375
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,068
Oh, sure.

376
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,138
Here.

377
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,912
Oh, my. "Royal Human.
Horse Racing Division, Private Secretary."

378
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:49,047
Don't say it out loud!

379
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:52,551
I can't believe
you came over to this side.

380
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:53,919
Seriously.

381
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:56,655
How are things on your end?
Tomorrow's race?

382
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:59,424
I have a jinx that if I go watch
the race, my horse will win.

383
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:00,926
Oh, really?

384
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,561
Then come watch our race too.

385
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:05,330
Though it's limited
to the horses bred at my farm.

386
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:06,365
What the heck?

387
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,268
Besides, that jinx
was already broken long ago.

388
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:10,235
What?

389
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,171
But doesn't thinking that way
give you courage?

390
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:15,340
"I've never lost," or something like that.

391
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:16,808
What the heck is that?

392
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:18,510
Thank you.

393
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:23,915
Wait, really?

394
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:25,917
- Is it good?
- Yum!

395
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:30,322
Yeah.

396
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:34,159
I can't believe I used to work
in a city like this.

397
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,330
Is ten years that long?

398
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,364
Yes.

399
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,700
Oh, right.

400
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:42,834
Shohei.

401
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:44,036
Shohei, my son.

402
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:45,737
Oh, right. Shohei.

403
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:51,076
When I told him I was going to Tokyo,
he got really mad.

404
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,011
Divorces are awkward like that.

405
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:57,416
I promised to send him photos
and get him a souvenir.

406
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,217
- Take a nice picture of me.
- Sure.

407
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,753
- Oh, do you want to be in it?
- No, I shouldn't.

408
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,989
Oh? Really?

409
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:06,191
Here, thank you for waiting.

410
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:10,462
Honestly, I really don't know
what to do anymore.

411
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:14,933
All you've got is a Hidaka horse
with no wins.

412
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,803
The trainer bets his life on his horses.

413
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:22,140
If I'm going to take a horse,
I want one from a famous ranch

414
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,910
with good breeding and lineage.

415
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:26,511
Like Hokuryo Farm.

416
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,448
You're from Hidaka, though.

417
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,983
I'm not self-deprecating.

418
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,318
It's the reality.

419
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:37,723
But there are trainers with a philosophy.

420
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:43,929
Not just winning, but how to win,
and what horse to win with.

421
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:47,966
There are many trainers
who are particular about that.

422
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,135
For example?

423
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,039
Please.

424
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,708
We're on a cliff's edge.

425
00:22:57,476 --> 00:23:00,379
I want Fight to win.

426
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:08,153
Well, I can think of one person,

427
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,056
but he's a weirdo.

428
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:12,824
What?

429
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:30,575
HIRONAKA STABLE

430
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:31,810
Here you go.

431
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,413
Eat up.

432
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,313
Huh?

433
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,049
My notebook is gone.

434
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,020
It's gone.

435
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,892
Yoshida, my notebook is gone.

436
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,093
I don't know.

437
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,928
- You haven't seen it?
- No.

438
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:51,563
Excuse me, sorry.

439
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:53,398
Excuse me.

440
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:54,633
- Excuse me!
- What?

441
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:58,270
- I'm Kurisu, from Royal Human…
- Mr. Royal!

442
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:03,141
Excuse me.

443
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,543
Nice to meet you.

444
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,510
I'm Hironaka.

445
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:06,711
Hello.

446
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:07,846
Come in.

447
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:09,381
Thank you.

448
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:10,916
HIRONAKA STABLE

449
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,751
This way, please.

450
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:13,985
Excuse me.

451
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:19,090
Oh, come in!

452
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,126
Here, if you would like…

453
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:23,028
Thank you very much.

454
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:24,996
- It's nothing much, sir…
- Oh, don't!

455
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,165
- Don't call me "sir."
- What?

456
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,367
Hironaka. Just Hironaka is fine.

457
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:32,137
- Understood.
- Please wait a moment.

458
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:35,607
I lost the data for the horse
running two days from now.

459
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:36,741
- What?
- Oh, no!

460
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,211
- It's still on the computer, but…
- Found it!

461
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:40,312
I prefer handwritten.

462
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:41,746
- I can…
- Found it!

463
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:42,881
Where?

464
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:43,982
In the car.

465
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:46,251
- What?
- I wasted an hour!

466
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,152
What?

467
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:50,055
- It took me an hour to look for that.
- Sorry.

468
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:51,723
I put the horse blankets out.

469
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,091
- Oh, thank you!
- Sure.

470
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,259
You're amazing.

471
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,261
I have a vacancy, you know.

472
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,965
I was also looking for a good horse.

473
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:02,000
I see. Well…

474
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,302
In the last race, in Niigata,
he came in second…

475
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:05,537
Its lineage?

476
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:10,342
Oh, I guess I can read this and find out.

477
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:12,911
Yes, I prepared these materials for you.

478
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:13,845
Okay.

479
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:15,647
ROYAL FIGHT

480
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:21,887
For the race this weekend,
I'll come to greet you with the owner.

481
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:24,789
- Please…
- Leave that for after we have a deal.

482
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:25,690
See you.

483
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:27,826
Oh, are we done…

484
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:32,998
There's nothing left but to go over
the files. I'll let you know my answer.

485
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,535
Goodbye.

486
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:44,709
Thank you very much.

487
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:49,247
- Thank you for this.
- Yes.

488
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:50,949
Goodbye.

489
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:55,654
Well, then, let's proceed with this.

490
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,555
Understood.

491
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:59,324
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

492
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,259
- Thank you for today.
- See you.

493
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:02,794
Thank you very much.

494
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:07,499
He's arrived.

495
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:13,605
I'm sorry for calling you here.

496
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:18,009
You won't be going back
to the office, right?

497
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,044
Yes.

498
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,313
Then you can have a drink.

499
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:23,615
Don't hold back.

500
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:25,517
I'm much obliged.

501
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:34,626
The other day, my family was present,
so we couldn't talk much.

502
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:53,011
You know, I am in charge
of the F&B department.

503
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,747
I would like to ask you to transfer there.

504
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:59,517
Rest assured that the position
and salary will be satisfactory.

505
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:01,953
- I can guarantee that.
- Wait. This amount is…

506
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,957
My eldest son is in charge of HR,
so there will be no issues.

507
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:12,664
He highly regards you, Mr. Kurisu,
as a person with great enthusiasm.

508
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:19,871
This will enable you
to showcase your full potential.

509
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:24,509
But the Horse Racing Division…

510
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:27,946
It's having trouble
finding a trainer, right?

511
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,416
I wonder if they can win within the year.

512
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:36,688
You shouldn't let
your valuable skills go to waste.

513
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:43,662
May I ask you one thing?

514
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,230
Go ahead.

515
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:49,434
Do you hate it?

516
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,336
Horse racing.

517
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,239
Yes.

518
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:56,107
I loathe it.

519
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,938
Were you drinking yesterday?

520
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:28,707
What?

521
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,543
You didn't answer my call last night.

522
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:34,512
You're my secretary, you know.

523
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:36,581
Were you out drinking?

524
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,718
No way.

525
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:42,220
I'm a lightweight, sir.

526
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:43,221
I was at home.

527
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:45,924
Then that's even worse!

528
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,425
Is that bad?

529
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:48,526
Of course it is.

530
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:50,695
Why were you just lounging around at home?

531
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:54,365
Even when at home,
keep your phone around your neck.

532
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:55,533
Jeez.

533
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:57,669
Understood.

534
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,039
So? What did that trainer say?
Whatever his name is.

535
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,142
Mr. Hironaka.
I'm still waiting for his answer.

536
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:07,746
You aren't thinking, "If it were just
Fight, this would have been decided"?

537
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,281
You suggested this.

538
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:12,484
Stand tall and own it.

539
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:14,319
Yes.

540
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,221
I apologize.

541
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:18,056
We just need one win.

542
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,725
One win with Fight.

543
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:21,860
Yes.

544
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,429
Horse racing is truly difficult, isn't it?

545
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,034
See you.

546
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:32,804
See you.

547
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,474
Is it Mr. Shiina's horse?

548
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,447
What's that horse?

549
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:44,883
What?

550
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:49,721
See you.

551
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,109
Good morning.

552
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:13,311
Oh, Mr. Kurisu.

553
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:16,548
I apologize for taking so long.

554
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:18,583
To get straight to the point,

555
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:23,688
I will take on both
Royal Fight and Royal Izana.

556
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,657
I look forward to working with you.

557
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:30,128
What?

558
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,498
Are you sure?

559
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:36,034
I mean, you asked me to.

560
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,869
That's true, but…

561
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,206
Those two are better off together.

562
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:43,608
Their lineage is interesting too.

563
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:47,345
It's meetings like this
that make Hidaka horses fun.

564
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:53,017
Of course, that's not the only reason,
but I think it's worth the challenge.

565
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:56,421
Thank you.

566
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:58,423
- Thank you so much.
- It's nothing.

567
00:30:58,489 --> 00:30:59,657
I'm so glad.

568
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,759
- I'll call my boss.
- Wait.

569
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:04,629
Before that, I have a proposition.

570
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,530
What?

571
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:06,731
This way, please.

572
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,467
He's here.

573
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:13,071
Well, our boss decided on them.

574
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:16,975
It's my job now. I'll do it right.

575
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,243
For the horses' sake.

576
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:29,587
Mr. Hironaka.

577
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:31,556
Hello.

578
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:33,524
Nice to meet you.

579
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:37,629
- Nice to meet you, sir. Let's get along.
- Wait, don't call me…

580
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:39,697
Hey. What strength!

581
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:41,399
Sorry.

582
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:44,969
He's young too.
They must call you handsome a lot.

583
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:46,304
No, not at all.

584
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:53,278
President, please sit down first.

585
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,245
Sure.

586
00:31:57,882 --> 00:31:58,917
To get right to it,

587
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,320
Mr. Hironaka has an idea
about the race entries.

588
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:06,958
- Don't be ridiculous!
- You can win this way!

589
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:08,326
That strategy won't work.

590
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:11,095
Let's hear him out first. Let him explain.

591
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:14,766
Are you telling us
to throw away all our work up to now?

592
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:16,067
Of course not.

593
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:18,970
I can't force something
you don't agree with.

594
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,106
But there isn't much time.

595
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:23,141
Mr. Sanno.

596
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:25,576
I really believe we can win with this.

597
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:26,711
I don't like it.

598
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,746
President!

599
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,718
I apologize.

600
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,854
No, I understand the owner's feelings.

601
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:39,490
We both share the desire to win.

602
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:42,627
Mr. Kurisu, the rest is up to you.

603
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:55,073
Find someone else.

604
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,345
Before Fight ran in Niigata

605
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:05,516
I visited those two horses
at the Hayashida Ranch.

606
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:08,486
What's the dam's name?

607
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:10,388
It's Izana.

608
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:11,622
What does it mean?

609
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:13,524
A place in Spain.

610
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:18,096
My son, who died nine years ago,
named her.

611
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,766
"Royal Izana."

612
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,602
Exactly nine characters. Not bad.

613
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,237
Mr. President.

614
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:29,340
Her and that colt for 30 million.

615
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:31,476
If you agree to that price,
I'll take them right away.

616
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:33,644
Izana's lineage…

617
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:38,483
is the work your son started,
which I'll preserve.

618
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,155
What's your point?

619
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:46,391
I thought you were a compassionate person.

620
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:49,727
Don't be ridiculous.

621
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:53,197
Do you think I'm someone

622
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:56,267
who buys a meaningless horse
just out of sentiment?

623
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:59,370
- Then, you saw a chance at winning?
- I don't know.

624
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:15,453
What's with that face?

625
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,158
I told you.

626
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:23,394
I don't know about horses.

627
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:26,564
I buy them by trusting people.

628
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,502
I simply bought them
by trusting Hayashida.

629
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:34,605
Then…

630
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,876
why don't you try trusting
Mr. Hironaka too?

631
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:45,183
I also don't know about horses.

632
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:49,220
And if you don't either,

633
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:53,357
then shouldn't we trust the person
most familiar with horses?

634
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:58,362
I want to trust Mr. Hironaka.

635
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:02,400
After all,
he told us something no one else did.

636
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:03,301
That we can win.

637
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:05,369
What he's trying to do is a gamble.

638
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,839
Then everything has been a gamble!

639
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:10,007
My career change to manager.

640
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:12,944
And you, President,
becoming a horse owner.

641
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,412
It's all a gamble.

642
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:18,616
In that case, I want to trust people.

643
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:22,720
Make a bet.

644
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:24,889
On me.

645
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:33,030
Tell him to explain it in a way
I can understand.

646
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:35,900
No need for complicated logic.

647
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,338
Explain so I can understand.

648
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:41,606
Tell him to do that!

649
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:43,708
You're the manager here!

650
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:47,445
I will.

651
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,059
NOZAKI FARM

652
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:03,794
Grandpa.

653
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:04,695
<i>See?</i>

654
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,597
I knew he was a strange person.

655
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,066
Did your introduction turn out well?

656
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:10,635
<i>It was fine.</i>

657
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,803
<i>My savior has finally appeared.</i>

658
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,238
Thank you so much.

659
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:17,608
But isn't that plan a little too bold?

660
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,211
<i>I can see why the president was hesitant.</i>

661
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:23,548
Well, I don't know much about horses.

662
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:29,220
But Mr. Hironaka
said he believes we can win.

663
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,457
<i>You must be happy.</i>

664
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:35,927
Yes, I am.

665
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:41,265
I mean, when someone says
your horse can win,

666
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,367
it makes you feel happy.

667
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:44,969
<i>So happy.</i>

668
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:49,040
<i>And to top it off,</i>
<i>he's taking on both horses.</i>

669
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:51,576
<i>No one else would do that.</i>

670
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:56,113
I'll watch the race.

671
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,683
I have work, so I'll watch it on TV,

672
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:02,386
but trust my jinx.

673
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:04,488
<i>Yes.</i>

674
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:08,559
I hope you win.

675
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:12,897
Yes.

676
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:18,436
<i>This is Hironaka. Mr. Shiina.</i>

677
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,940
<i>- I tried to fit them in but</i>…
- That's a 230 million yen horse, you know.

678
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:27,411
<i>- Unfortunately, I just don't have…</i>
- Hello, it's Shiina.

679
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:29,347
Thank you for the other day.

680
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,249
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>
- It's fine.

681
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:33,451
<i>- I mean it.</i>
- Understood.

682
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:36,420
We had no luck this time,
but I hope we'll have another chance.

683
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:37,688
<i>Yes.</i>

684
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,156
<i>I apologize.</i>

685
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:40,224
Goodbye.

686
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,795
He probably went with Royal Human.

687
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:52,436
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

688
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:54,872
This is an important time
leading up to the fall races.

689
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,207
Yes.

690
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,010
<i>Fight and Izana,</i>
<i>the two new horses we've taken in,</i>

691
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:00,978
<i>already have racing experience,</i>

692
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:03,714
<i>but first, they need to get used</i>
<i>to our training and environment.</i>

693
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,950
<i>For Fight, we need to handle</i>
<i>his eagerness</i>…

694
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:08,452
<i>His relationship</i>
<i>with the jockey is crucial.</i>

695
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:09,453
<i>Yes.</i>

696
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,856
ROYAL FIGHT - YASUKAWA

697
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,225
<i>Two uphill gallops.</i>

698
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,061
<i>The first in 70, the second in 65.</i>

699
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,196
<i>Then the gate.</i>

700
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,300
<i>For Izana, don't hold her back too much,</i>

701
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:25,002
<i>let her use her stride properly,</i>
<i>and improve her rhythm.</i>

702
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:28,239
<i>Since they just arrived,</i>
<i>small changes are likely.</i>

703
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,440
<i>Take good care of them.</i>

704
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:30,341
<i>Yes!</i>

705
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:33,110
Let's divide the buckets by type.

706
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:34,445
Uphill gallop today?

707
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:37,381
No, I'll have them finish strong
on the wood chip course.

708
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:39,684
Next is Royal Fight.

709
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,486
Fight will proceed with the 1800m.

710
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:43,754
Are things okay?

711
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:44,855
Yes.

712
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:56,400
He doesn't look like he's engaging
his hindquarters well today.

713
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:59,170
- What's it like riding him?
<i>- Oh, I agree.</i>

714
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,906
Okay. Let's decide tomorrow's schedule.

715
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,942
<i>The other day,</i>
<i>Fight had an issue with his hoof,</i>

716
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:10,081
<i>and we had him fitted with special shoes,</i>
<i>but I need to discuss the cost for that.</i>

717
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:11,916
Understood.

718
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:15,820
I'll check the itemized bill
and inform the president.

719
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:17,088
- Mr. Tsuchiya!
- Yes?

720
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:19,256
- Go ahead.
- Got it.

721
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:41,979
<i>- They dislike apples.</i>
<i>- I see. So that's why they don't eat them.</i>

722
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,748
<i>I'm sorry, it's my fault.</i>

723
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:45,583
How's their gait?

724
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:48,953
The same as before.

725
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,125
Let's do one and a half legs tomorrow.

726
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:55,960
Okay, I'll tell them.

727
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:57,395
Oh, Yasukawa.

728
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:00,598
- Have you seen my walkie-talkie?
- What?

729
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:02,767
- It's Kurisu. Excuse me.
- Yes?

730
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:06,070
Their participation in the race is set.

731
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:09,073
This is Mr. Shiina's horse.

732
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,574
Not again.

733
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:15,880
Good morning, Fight!

734
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:19,250
<i>Trainers should abandon their egos.</i>

735
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:21,352
<i>Everyone should let go of their egos</i>

736
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,888
<i>and dedicate themselves</i>
<i>only to the horses.</i>

737
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:25,790
All right, let's start.

738
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,024
Yes!

739
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:34,432
- 2,000 meters on turf?
<i>- Yes.</i>

740
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:35,800
Turf?

741
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:36,967
<i>Yes.</i>

742
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,673
I will definitely go see it.

743
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,108
<i>Please do.</i>

744
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:45,075
Yes.

745
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,349
It's from Mr. Hironaka.

746
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:56,654
Nakayama, third week of September.
They will run as scheduled.

747
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:03,594
It's completely different
from the Niigata race.

748
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:05,262
What is?

749
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:08,566
- My state of mind, waiting for the race.
- Here you go.

750
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:12,470
How could you bear this feeling
so many times?

751
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:14,238
Do you get used to it?

752
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,840
Of course not.

753
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:18,876
I'd give anything to have
someone take my place.

754
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,434
A new start.

755
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:46,370
Come on, let's go.

756
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:47,638
- Yes.
- Yes.

757
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:50,274
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

758
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,309
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

759
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:16,333
Hello.

760
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,935
- Hello.
- Good luck.

761
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:25,042
I wonder how they will fare.

762
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:27,378
Oh, right.

763
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:30,080
This.

764
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:34,718
I feel kind of bad
receiving something so expensive.

765
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,021
No need to thank me.

766
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:43,160
However, it's too fancy for me,
I felt unworthy.

767
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,462
I almost returned it immediately.

768
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:48,532
But if we win today,

769
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:52,736
this watch will be
an incredible good luck charm.

770
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,707
So, from now on,
I intend to only use it for major races.

771
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:58,542
Like a charm.

772
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,178
What if we lose?

773
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:06,083
If we lose, what will you do with it?

774
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,585
President.

775
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:10,721
Nobody thinks about losing
a race before it starts.

776
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:11,822
So you'll sell it?

777
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:12,723
I won't!

778
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,058
You're going to sell it off!

779
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:15,292
I won't.

780
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:16,560
Hello!

781
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:19,196
You're quite something, huh?

782
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,899
You think you can win?

783
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:23,367
I'm here. Can't you tell?

784
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:29,039
This is why the race is only fun
with Royal around!

785
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,908
That guy is noisy.

786
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:37,648
- Do your best.
- I will.

787
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:47,725
You can have your fun after
you've seen how this ends.

788
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:51,128
<i>The third day of the fourth Nakayama Race.</i>
<i>We're on the fourth race.</i>

789
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:54,498
<i>The runners for the 3-year-old Maiden Race</i>
<i>will be entering shortly.</i>

790
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:56,066
Orne Regis.

791
00:43:56,133 --> 00:44:00,070
Despite being a maiden horse,
its current odds are 2.5.

792
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:03,273
Pedigree, body, temperament,
it's flawless in every way.

793
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,608
Truly a sure winner.

794
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:10,114
<i>The weather is good, it's a bright day.</i>

795
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:16,053
<i>Now, I'll announce the horses'</i>
<i>as well as the dirt and turf conditions.</i>

796
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,256
- I'll make coffee.
<i>- Number Four, Smart Imal.</i>

797
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,893
<i>472 kilograms.</i>
<i>Plus two kilograms. Shintaro Ogi.</i>

798
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,294
I'm home!

799
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:25,262
Welcome home.

800
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,730
I'm starving.

801
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:28,399
- It's starting.
- Okay.

802
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:29,767
<i>Tetsuya Mizue.</i>

803
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,635
- Oh, right.
- So cool.

804
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:33,337
<i>- 462 kilograms.</i>
- You can do it!

805
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:35,906
<i>No change. Toru Kaneshiro.</i>

806
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:38,075
<i>Number Seven, Gold Aerial.</i>

807
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:42,413
<i>476 kilograms.</i>
<i>Minus eight kilograms. Takashi Sugawara.</i>

808
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:44,615
<i>Number Eight, Orne Regis.</i>

809
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,116
<i>438 kilograms.</i>

810
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,185
- Odds at 2.5.
<i>- Plus two kilograms.</i>

811
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:49,720
- A safe bet, huh?
<i>- Shoichi Yamazoe.</i>

812
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,790
<i>Number Nine, Sun Garbo.</i>

813
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:57,127
<i>474 kilograms.</i>
<i>Minus four kilograms. Ryu Yasuda.</i>

814
00:44:59,496 --> 00:45:00,330
Here they come.

815
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:05,703
ROYAL IZANA

816
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:07,971
<i>Number Ten, Royal Izana.</i>

817
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,606
<i>482 kilograms.</i>

818
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:11,041
- What? Why?
<i>- Plus two kilograms.</i>

819
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:12,276
<i>- Keita Tosaki.</i>
- It's not Fight?

820
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:14,945
<i>- It's Izana!</i>
<i>- That's all ten horses.</i>

821
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:17,548
<i>President, please sit down first.</i>

822
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:19,983
To get right to it,

823
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,720
Mr. Hironaka has an idea
about the race entries.

824
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:23,687
What?

825
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:26,457
Royal Fight and Royal Izana

826
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:29,526
both have races
in the third week of September.

827
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:31,095
I'd like to switch them around.

828
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:32,429
What?

829
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:35,733
We're putting Izana,
who has always run on dirt,

830
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:37,401
into a turf maiden race,

831
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:41,205
and Fight, who has always
run on turf, into a dirt race.

832
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:43,006
What are you talking about?

833
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:46,777
<i>Royal Izana,</i>
<i>since she debuted at Tadokoro Stables,</i>

834
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:48,612
<i>has suffered many losses on turf,</i>

835
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:51,715
<i>and for the past year,</i>
<i>she's raced exclusively on dirt,</i>

836
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:53,317
<i>but without results.</i>

837
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:56,620
<i>She hasn't been in a race for six months.</i>

838
00:45:56,687 --> 00:46:00,557
<i>Fight, on the other hand,</i>
<i>has never run on dirt.</i>

839
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:02,559
The 2,000 meters on turf, must be Fight!

840
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:05,028
2,000 meters on turf is Fight's distance!

841
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,063
Besides,

842
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:09,166
what does Fight gain by running
in a race he has no experience in?

843
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:11,268
Certainly, there is no benefit for Fight.

844
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:13,670
- Don't be ridiculous!
- You can win this way!

845
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:16,774
- That strategy won't work!
- Let's hear him out first.

846
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,008
Let him explain.

847
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:21,044
Are you telling us
to throw away all our work up to now?

848
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:23,213
She can do it.

849
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:31,622
It's Royal Izana.

850
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:46,970
It's Izana!

851
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:47,871
Mom!

852
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,707
<i>It's Izana!</i>

853
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,681
Interesting.

854
00:46:57,748 --> 00:46:58,949
You can do it!

855
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:22,940
Izana!

856
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:24,808
Izana!

857
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:25,776
Do your best!

858
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:39,923
THREE-YEAR-OLD MAIDEN RACE

859
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:41,658
<i>Nakayama Racecourse, fourth race.</i>

860
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:44,261
<i>A 2000-meter turf maiden race</i>
<i>for three-year-olds.</i>

861
00:47:45,495 --> 00:47:46,730
Her gait is good.

862
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:48,265
Dead last in popularity, huh?

863
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:51,568
- Don't underestimate her.
<i>- It's a grandstand start for this race.</i>

864
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:54,438
- Izana is on the turf.
<i>- The wind has picked up a little.</i>

865
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:57,274
<i>Both the turf and dirt tracks</i>
<i>are in good condition.</i>

866
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:59,910
- Have fun!
<i>- Kono Blade and Martani…</i>

867
00:47:59,977 --> 00:48:04,047
<i>Are both out due to injury,</i>
<i>making this a ten-horse race.</i>

868
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:05,883
<i>Last is Number Ten, Royal Izana.</i>

869
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:08,752
<i>She's hesitating before the gate.</i>

870
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:10,153
<i>What's it going to be?</i>

871
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,222
- <i>Royal Izana.</i>
- It's okay.

872
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:13,690
Izana, calm down.

873
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:16,727
<i>Led by the handlers,</i>
<i>she's now settled in the gate.</i>

874
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:21,365
This is a strategy to run Izana on turf.

875
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:23,100
When I looked at the documents,

876
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:25,435
a few generations back
in Izana's pedigree,

877
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:27,804
there was a horse I know well.

878
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:29,172
Mighty Plat.

879
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,875
That horse was very strong
in the 2000-meter turf races.

880
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:36,847
However, looking at Izana's race record,
it's all sprint races on dirt.

881
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,383
They probably avoided
middle-distance races

882
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:40,851
due to her crooked leg,

883
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,053
but frankly,

884
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,490
this is a terrible choice
that wastes Izana's strength.

885
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:50,227
She should be allowed to run freely.

886
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:51,328
Excuse me.

887
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:55,132
Why put Fight into a dirt race
where he has no experience?

888
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:58,302
Why not use both horses
in the same turf race?

889
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:01,638
Have you ever heard
of preferential entry rights?

890
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:04,441
<i>At that time, in a maiden race,</i>

891
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:07,577
<i>the main condition</i>
<i>for getting preferential entry</i>

892
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:12,549
<i>was to have placed fifth or higher once</i>
<i>within the last four races.</i>

893
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,184
<i>That's how it was.</i>

894
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:17,454
In other words,
if Fight is entered in that race,

895
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:20,257
his preferential entry would be certain,

896
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:23,460
and the maiden Izana may be excluded.

897
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:25,095
That's right. So…

898
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:27,698
We'll change Fight's entry

899
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:30,400
to increase the chance
of Izana being able to run.

900
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:33,503
She's a spirited yet sensitive.

901
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:36,239
The type who prefers
expectation and attention

902
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,841
over gentle care.

903
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:40,277
That's my first impression of Izana.

904
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:41,845
As for Fight…

905
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:43,981
He's more hardy than carefree.

906
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:47,451
Fight might be the type
who doesn't care where he's running.

907
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:51,888
These are Yasukawa, our assistant trainer,
and Toyama, a veteran stable hand.

908
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:52,923
I'm Kurisu.

909
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:53,991
Nice to meet you.

910
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:54,891
Likewise.

911
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:57,127
These two will be in charge of the horses.

912
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:02,499
Just to confirm,

913
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:08,138
you are so determined
to run Izana on turf because…

914
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:14,411
I believe Izana
has a higher chance of winning than Fight.

915
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:19,182
<i>All the horses are in the gate.</i>
<i>The gate attendant is moving away.</i>

916
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,588
<i>The red light is on, and they are off!</i>

917
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,725
<i>A somewhat messy start for the ten horses.</i>

918
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:31,361
<i>First, Number Ten with the pink helmet.</i>

919
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:34,364
- Yes.
<i>- Royal Izana got a good outside start.</i>

920
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:36,133
No way! Leading from the start?

921
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,100
<i>- She's in the lead!</i>
- What?

922
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:38,101
Oh, she's first!

923
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:39,102
<i>- Royal Izana!</i>
- Amazing.

924
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:41,238
<i>Number One,</i>
<i>Nagano Finite moves up into second!</i>

925
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:42,172
Hey.

926
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:46,943
Izana's ancestor, Mighty Plat,
was a famous front-runner.

927
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:48,745
The other horses don't matter!

928
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,949
Yes, Izana, run!

929
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:55,452
<i>- Royal Izana is in the lead!</i>
- Run!

930
00:50:58,588 --> 00:51:00,390
<i>The lead is widening</i>
<i>from one horse to two!</i>

931
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:04,361
<i>Number Two, Honolulu Even,</i>
<i>has smoothly moved into second place.</i>

932
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:06,663
<i>From the inside, Number One,</i>
<i>Nagano Finite,</i>

933
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,166
<i>and in fourth place</i>
<i>is Number Eight, Orne Regis.</i>

934
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:12,002
<i>Then one length back</i>
<i>is Number Three, Togen Marilyn.</i>

935
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,737
<i>- On the outside is Gold Aerial.</i>
- Go!

936
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:16,940
<i>They're midway down the backstretch,</i>
<i>the lead is about one length.</i>

937
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:19,142
<i>Number Six, Karasos,</i>
<i>is running third from last.</i>

938
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:21,778
<i>Two lengths back,</i>
<i>on the inside is Number Four, Smart Imal.</i>

939
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:24,214
<i>One length further outside</i>
<i>is Number Five, Pangoose.</i>

940
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:26,349
<i>They passed the 1,000-meter mark</i>
<i>in 58 seconds.</i>

941
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,418
<i>- </i>That's fast.
<i>- It's a quick pace!</i>

942
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:31,588
<i>The horses are now heading</i>
<i>from the backstretch to the third corner.</i>

943
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:36,326
<i>The leader is Number Ten, Royal Izana,</i>
<i>six to seven lengths ahead of the rest.</i>

944
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:39,329
<i>Number Ten, Royal Izana,</i>
<i>heads into the third corner.</i>

945
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:42,466
<i>Six to seven lengths ahead of the rest,</i>
<i>she's built up a good lead.</i>

946
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:43,467
She can do it.

947
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:46,336
<i>Into the third corner,</i>
<i>with a significant lead!</i>

948
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:48,572
<i>Royal Izana is in the lead,</i>
<i>with the pink helmet.</i>

949
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:51,875
<i>And Number Eight, Orne Regis,</i>
<i>in the orange helmet…</i>

950
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:52,943
Here they come.

951
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:55,412
- All right!
<i>- The favorite, Orne Regis.</i>

952
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:57,414
<i>Is Yamazoe making his move here,</i>

953
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:59,883
<i>gaining ground</i>
<i>in the middle of the third corner?</i>

954
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,253
<i>The leader is Number Ten, Royal Izana.</i>
<i>The gap is closing slightly.</i>

955
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,921
<i>The pink helmet, Royal Izana.</i>

956
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:05,956
Go!

957
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:07,891
<i>- The final turn…</i>
- Run!

958
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,993
<i>Heading towards Nakayama's final slope.</i>

959
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,628
<i>- The leader is Number Ten.</i>
<i>- </i>Run!

960
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:12,596
Run!

961
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:14,831
<i>- Orne Regis is closing the gap.</i>
- Run!

962
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:16,600
Run, Izana!

963
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:18,068
Run!

964
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,770
<i>Number Eight, Orne Regis,</i>
<i>has now moved up to second place.</i>

965
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:23,039
<i>- Passing the 400-meter mark.</i>
- Hang in there!

966
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:25,408
<i>- The fourth corner! The final turn!</i>
- Make your move!

967
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:28,178
<i>Heading towards Nakayama's final slope.</i>

968
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:02,445
<i>They've passed the 200-meter marker.</i>

969
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:05,182
- Keep it up!
- Go!

970
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:07,117
<i>Will they live up to expectations?</i>

971
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,385
- Catch her…
<i>- Orne Regis!</i>

972
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:09,619
<i>Will they meet expectations?</i>

973
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,288
<i>- Royal Izana in the lead.</i>
- Catch her!

974
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,789
<i>- Two lengths. One length.</i>
- Catch her!

975
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,524
<i>Half a length. The lead has shrunk!</i>

976
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:16,660
<i>- The favorite, Number Eight, Orne Regis!</i>
<i>- </i>Do it.

977
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:18,662
- Izana!
- Do it!

978
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:20,597
- Catch her!
<i>- They're side by side!</i>

979
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:22,799
<i>Will it be Royal Izana or the favorite?</i>

980
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,968
<i>They're side by side!</i>

981
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,570
<i>An incredible final dash!</i>

982
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:29,172
<i>Orne Regis is going all out!</i>

983
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:30,173
Go!

984
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,609
- Go!
<i>- Smart Imal is coming up from the outside.</i>

985
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:34,244
<i>Honolulu Even from the inside!</i>

986
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:35,812
<i>- Is it Royal Izana?</i>
- Go!

987
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,414
<i>Or Orne Regis?</i>

988
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,649
- Go!
<i>- Will Orne Regis make it in time?</i>

989
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:42,619
<i>Two horses in the lead!</i>

990
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:47,591
<i>Royal Izana showing her strength</i>
<i>at the end! Passes the finish line!</i>

991
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:48,992
- Amazing!
- Yes!

992
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,161
Izana!

993
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:59,736
She won! She actually won!

994
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:17,153
- She won!
<i>- Number Ten, Royal Izana!</i>

995
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,756
- She won!
<i>- The favorite failed to meet expectations!</i>

996
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:23,860
A 111 to 1 payout!

997
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:28,431
ROYAL IZANA

998
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:33,770
President.

999
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:35,438
We did it.

1000
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:38,575
- We did it, President!
- Idiot!

1001
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:41,578
It's just one win, at the lowest type,
a maiden race!

1002
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:43,913
We're aiming to win a G1!

1003
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:54,357
Take care of your charm.

1004
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:57,327
Yes.

1005
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,975
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

1006
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:14,210
You really hung in there, you know.

1007
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:15,512
- You did great.
- Thanks.

1008
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:16,946
You did great, truly.

1009
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:18,715
You gave it all you got.

1010
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:21,051
He knows it too!

1011
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:27,724
Yes!

1012
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:29,926
Izana won!

1013
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,429
Fight, she did it!

1014
00:55:34,597 --> 00:55:37,067
That's right. Next is Fight's turn.

1015
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:38,868
You're definitely going to win!

1016
00:55:43,606 --> 00:55:45,308
We won! Oh, wow! How much?

1017
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:47,310
- I don't know.
- You don't?

1018
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:50,313
Mom!

1019
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,015
Mom!

1020
00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:57,787
The ancestor horse, Mighty Plat,
is a horse from my family's ranch.

1021
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:00,457
I see!

1022
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,959
That one probably earned the most for us.

1023
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,894
Sorry for not telling you.

1024
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:07,964
No one would have noticed that connection!

1025
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:12,035
Hey, tabloid trash, pay for the drinks
in exchange for the story!

1026
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:14,571
- Thank you!
- Seriously…

1027
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:19,075
So my intuition told me
that kind of race would be her strength.

1028
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:23,646
But if I said it, it would sound
like me favoring my family.

1029
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,348
Seriously.

1030
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:30,120
That's why I don't trust you.
Hiroshi from the Hironaka family.

1031
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:34,657
No, even if you can't trust me,

1032
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:38,461
please trust in the legacy of the horses.

1033
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:43,933
If Mighty Plat hadn't existed,
I might not have become a trainer,

1034
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,238
and if Fight and Izana weren't here,
that bloodline might have been lost.

1035
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,142
Thank you.

1036
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:54,277
No, it was all of us.

1037
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:56,846
- We won thanks to everyone's efforts.
- I mean…

1038
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:59,916
With this, Izana can run again next time.

1039
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:01,084
Fight too.

1040
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:03,420
The Horse Racing Division
can also continue.

1041
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:05,221
Thank you.

1042
00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:06,423
Thank you so much.

1043
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:07,390
No…

1044
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:09,325
You're a great team.

1045
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:11,728
A team? We're nothing so fancy.

1046
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:12,896
Come on.

1047
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,064
Oh, thank you.

1048
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:16,966
Huh?

1049
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:20,537
I forgot my phone.

1050
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:21,871
Again?

1051
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:23,206
Oh, it's at Nakayama.

1052
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,008
- Let's call it.
- Hey.

1053
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:26,676
Let's have a toast.

1054
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:29,479
- A toast!
- A toast? How many toasts have we done?

1055
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:30,380
Are you okay?

1056
00:57:32,482 --> 00:57:34,551
- Welcome home.
- I'm home.

1057
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:37,554
There was a call from the new secretary.

1058
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:41,691
He wants to keep working
in the Horse Racing Division.

1059
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:47,197
Father's rotten luck is unbelievable.

1060
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:56,506
My dream is to win the Arima Kinen.

1061
00:57:57,006 --> 00:57:58,107
The Arima?

1062
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,344
You thought, "Why not the Japan Derby?"

1063
00:58:02,545 --> 00:58:06,316
The Derby and other races
are where strong horses compete,

1064
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:08,751
but the Arima is different.

1065
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:12,789
You're not chosen just for being strong.

1066
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:17,227
Only horses loved by fans and whose
running is recognized are chosen.

1067
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:20,430
And from among those,
the winner is decided.

1068
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:23,666
There's emotion.

1069
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:24,834
There's love.

1070
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,437
Plus, it's a year-end festival,

1071
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:30,907
where all the memories
of that years losses are blown away.

1072
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:33,443
- No, come on.
- You can win it all.

1073
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,744
It's the best.

1074
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:38,047
We will win the Arima Kinen.

1075
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:40,316
Absolutely. Cheers!

1076
00:58:40,383 --> 00:58:41,751
Cheers!

1077
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:48,825
SANNO AND HIRONAKA
THE ROYAL FAMILY BEGINS

1078
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:51,528
- Our next challenge.
- The auction?

1079
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:52,328
<i>We must get a horse.</i>

1080
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:55,865
- We're looking for a new horse.
- People's livelihoods are at stake!

1081
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:57,467
We can't sell to someone
who doesn't intend to win!

1082
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,102
- Dad, please!
- I said we won't sell!

1083
00:58:59,168 --> 00:59:01,704
We are making this deal to win.

1084
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:04,874
My father's dream
is the dream of everyone in Hidaka.

1085
