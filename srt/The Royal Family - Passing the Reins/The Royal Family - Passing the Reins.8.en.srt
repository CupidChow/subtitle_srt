1
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:12,512
Did you name me "Koichi," Mom?

2
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:15,482
My mom's explanation was vague.

3
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:18,551
Rather than the origin of the name,

4
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:22,355
what was more striking
was her speaking hesitantly.

5
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:23,923
Kokura Racecourse, Race Five.

6
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:25,925
The fanfare sounds, and the 16 horses…

7
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:29,195
My mom watched horse racing
broadcasts almost every week.

8
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:34,267
When I asked her if she liked it,
she answered, "Not really."

9
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:37,103
But she kept staring, as if praying,

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,472
whenever the Royal horses raced.

11
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,608
Eat the meal I made for you, okay?

12
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:44,044
-Okay.
-See you later.

13
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,750
That's when I started learning
about horse racing.

14
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,052
Thank you very much.

15
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:57,824
It's been a year
since President Kozo Sanno passed away.

16
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:03,029
How do you feel about having inherited
Royal Family and becoming a horse owner?

17
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,266
It still…

18
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,769
doesn't feel real.

19
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:14,541
You also inherited
your father's dream of winning the Arima.

20
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,376
Are you determined?

21
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:20,380
It's my mission.

22
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:23,550
I think of it as my mission.

23
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:24,717
INHERITANCE

24
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:27,754
-I'm really sorry.
-Why?

25
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,355
I couldn't speak well at all.

26
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:32,425
No. You did great.

27
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:35,795
The President never really answered
reporters' questions properly.

28
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:38,298
I see.

29
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:45,071
There is still time
before the auction begins.

30
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:48,041
You should go and look around.

31
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,177
The scale and facilities here
are unparalleled.

32
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,183
Is something wrong?

33
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:01,654
I was wondering
what kind of expression I should have.

34
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,558
That of a horse owner.

35
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,228
But I'm an inheritance-only horse owner.

36
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:10,964
A horse owner who can't buy horses.

37
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,633
It's true that you can't buy a new horse,

38
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,136
but you can learn from
everything you witness here.

39
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:21,007
Eventually, you will be competing
with the horses of the people here.

40
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:31,618
Chairman, that seat is already filled.

41
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,186
This seat?

42
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:34,154
Oh, no.

43
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,789
I always watch from here.

44
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:37,690
Sorry.

45
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,692
I didn't know it was designated.

46
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,427
No, it's not.

47
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,363
It brings luck here.

48
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:45,665
Chairman Watabe, it's been a while.

49
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,367
Aren't you Kozo's…

50
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,369
Nice to see you. I'm Kurisu.

51
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,739
Sorry, it's his first time here.

52
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,608
Sold for 120 million yen.

53
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,944
Customer Number 16,
thank you for your purchase.

54
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,045
What?

55
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:02,048
I just thought you were so enthusiastic.

56
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:05,685
-Our next horse is Number 43.
-I have to do this much, at least.

57
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:08,121
Thoridin, 2022.

58
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:13,493
Male, bay, born on April 15th,
sired by Lime Cut.

59
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:17,163
-His sire was skilled at long-distance…
-Are you interested?

60
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,165
The dam's line steadily turns out winners.

61
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,801
If I were an ordinary horse owner,
I'd definitely buy it.

62
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,838
The bloodline is interesting.
I think it will fetch a pretty high price.

63
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:29,275
-Yes!
-That's something to look forward to.

64
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:33,413
-38 million?
-Yes!

65
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,547
38 million!

66
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,950
-39 million?
-Yes!

67
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,719
39 million! Do I have 40 million?

68
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:43,189
40 million?

69
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,390
Any other bids?

70
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:46,125
It’s not going as high as expected.

71
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,995
40 million?

72
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:49,963
Last call.

73
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:50,964
40 million.

74
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,498
Do we have 40 million?

75
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:55,835
All right!

76
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:59,839
-What? Is it okay for it to be this cheap?
-Sold for 39 million.

77
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,175
-Customer Number 350.
-Here.

78
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,543
Mr. Aiso?

79
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:09,749
-His son? Mr. Shiina's?
-Yes.

80
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,952
I was reassigned to him this year.

81
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,887
Oh, I see.

82
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,759
Are things going well, Mr. Kurisu?

83
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:20,693
What?

84
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,262
With your young horse owner?

85
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:26,666
Is there any generational gap?

86
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,735
A gap?

87
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,270
So there isn't, huh?

88
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:34,173
-Um… Excuse me.
-Oh, sorry.

89
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,043
You're the owner of Royal Family, right?

90
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,078
Koichi Nakajo.

91
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:40,780
Yes.

92
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:42,815
I knew it!

93
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,519
Oh, my name is Nobuyuki Shiina.

94
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,154
SHIINA'S SON

95
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:52,592
Shiina?

96
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,827
It's a small company, though.

97
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:58,598
It's my first auction
as a licensed horse owner.

98
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,668
Congratulations on that.

99
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:04,404
I want to connect
with owners around my age.

100
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,473
Can I ask for your contact information?

101
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:09,976
Sure, why not?

102
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,784
-You picked a good horse.
-What?

103
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:19,519
Earlier.

104
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,622
I think that horse is going to be great.

105
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,558
Its parents aren't well-known,

106
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,461
but if you trace back
the generations before them,

107
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,930
they have a pretty interesting bloodline.

108
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:32,865
Right?

109
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,902
You really know your stuff!

110
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:41,207
This is the restaurant the President
took me to when we first met.

111
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,076
-Excuse me!
-Yes?

112
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:45,812
-Another two servings of this, please.
-Coming right up.

113
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:49,048
One after the other, like this.
No questions asked.

114
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,317
Please, eat.

115
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,019
"CEO."

116
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,587
It's remarkable, right?

117
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,658
Even though he's not much older than me.

118
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,995
I feel it painfully.

119
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:07,166
My position as a limited horse owner.

120
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,705
I don't have a horse that I bought myself.

121
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:17,443
Just raising Family
has me struggling financially.

122
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,613
Here is your order.

123
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,787
He's what a horse owner should be like.

124
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,224
-Koichi.
-But I…

125
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,595
I don't live in that world.

126
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:40,199
All I need to do is focus

127
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:43,770
on Family, right?

128
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:49,742
Generational shift.

129
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:53,880
The world of horse racing
has seen many generational shifts.

130
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:58,050
While fans and those involved hope
for the continued health of older horses,

131
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:00,953
they also have high hopes
for the emergence of new horses.

132
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,190
Most racehorses retire
around the age of five.

133
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,725
Depending on the horse's performance,

134
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,494
they will become
breeding studs or broodmares.

135
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:12,832
There is no upper age limit for owners.
As long as they have the will

136
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,868
and financial means to continue,
they will not be forced to retire.

137
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:19,105
What is essential for a horse owner?
Financial strength?

138
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,273
Connections?

139
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:21,274
Or…

140
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,811
SO PERFECT

141
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:26,712
Inheritance.

142
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:27,914
Article 12.

143
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:32,718
Royal Family, who inherited the will
of Kozo Sanno and Royal Hope,

144
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:37,723
won his debut race but then suffered
a series of minor injuries,

145
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,726
causing him to miss the Spring
Classic races as a three-year-old.

146
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,261
Then fall came.

147
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:45,164
While horses of the same generation
were winning distinguished races,

148
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:48,701
Family was still stuck
in the two-win class.

149
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:52,138
Number Ten is leading and crossing
the finish line in first place!

150
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:57,310
Despite being fully prepared
for this race, he finished in fifth place.

151
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,011
Sorry, I couldn't go to the front.

152
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:01,047
Still, you came in fifth place.

153
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,583
I should have forced myself to go wide.

154
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,986
I talked to Ryujiro, and we're thinking
of pushing our race schedule up.

155
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:10,523
I think Family's condition
will improve if he keeps running.

156
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,158
There you have it.

157
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,060
-Next time, I'll push harder.
-Yes.

158
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:18,931
You don't have to push so hard.

159
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,335
It's okay to monitor
the situation gradually.

160
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:25,872
Well, he got started late,
so isn't it time to work hard?

161
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:29,275
However, in the next race,
Family lost momentum in the final stretch

162
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,544
and dropped further down the rankings.

163
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,013
The young owner,

164
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,283
who inherited Sanno's ardent dream
of winning the Arima Kinen,

165
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,886
is already facing a time of trial.

166
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:43,155
So if you start to waver…

167
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,002
-Change jockeys?
-Yes.

168
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,170
I'd like to try changing jockeys.

169
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,306
Is that a bad idea?

170
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,776
I think that with more experience,

171
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:07,747
he has the potential
to compete in higher classes.

172
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:11,450
I think so too.

173
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:14,487
However, if we were to change jockeys now,

174
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,089
Family might get confused.

175
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:18,457
Koichi.

176
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:23,429
Can you tell us what you
are trying to achieve?

177
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,565
That's…

178
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,803
Even if he keeps
gaining experience like this,

179
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,507
I don't think things will change.

180
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,511
Even so, I don't think
the issue lies with Ryujiro.

181
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,146
That’s true…

182
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,716
Ryujiro is one of the top jockeys.

183
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,619
He not only has experience
and competitive instinct,

184
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:49,155
but also a deep understanding of the team.

185
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:53,192
I think having him on board
is a big advantage for us.

186
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,361
I know that, too.

187
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:58,364
But…

188
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,568
It's like we're trying
to match Family with Ryujiro.

189
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:07,573
I'd like to try going at Family's pace.

190
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:12,545
Family missed the Spring three-year-old
race season due to injuries.

191
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,082
If we don't pick up the pace now,
we'll never get any results.

192
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,683
-Yes, but--
-Winning the Arima.

193
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,986
We will fulfill
the President's wish, right?

194
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:26,692
How about we wrap it up for today?

195
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:32,031
Would it be okay to leave
the jockey issue on hold for now

196
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:35,601
and continue to consider the matter?

197
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:43,075
I can't speak about horses,

198
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:48,714
but I believe that Hope
was able to run in the Arima Kinen

199
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,884
thanks to the strength of this team.

200
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:55,354
To win the Arima with a horse from Hidaka.

201
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,590
Starting with Ryujiro,

202
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,527
everyone on the team believed
in that without any hesitation.

203
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,463
I think those feelings reached Hope.

204
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,334
But he couldn't get to first place.

205
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,003
I understand what you're saying,

206
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,406
but Hope is Hope.

207
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,908
I think Family has his own
unique way of racing.

208
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,115
Koichi!

209
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,552
I had a meeting with my trainer.

210
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,421
Do you need a ride to Tokyo?

211
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,792
Oh, no, not me.

212
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,026
Please, go ahead.

213
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,029
Am I being a nuisance?

214
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,230
No.

215
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,432
Thank you.

216
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,801
-I’ll ride with you.
-What?

217
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:44,370
Oh, okay.

218
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:46,572
Please take care.

219
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,710
-See you.
-Take care.

220
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:52,812
Thanks for this.

221
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,048
I was surprised.
Did you have a meeting too?

222
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,557
Oh, right. I read them.

223
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,092
The Tonichi Sports articles.

224
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,327
-"Inheritance"?
-Yes.

225
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,097
A newspaper serialization
is really something.

226
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:12,765
I want one too.

227
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:13,999
Thank you very much.

228
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,702
I'll let the reporter know.

229
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:19,505
Okay then.

230
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,340
Thanks again.

231
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,877
Oh, but you know…

232
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,547
The title, "Inheritance,"
is a little bit old, right?

233
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,517
Inheritance is just self-gratification
for the ones doing the passing.

234
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,286
I don't care about
common sense or theories.

235
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:38,090
I want them to listen to my ideas first.

236
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:39,625
Don't you agree?

237
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,363
I do.

238
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,633
-Good work, everyone!
-Thank you!

239
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,603
-Goodbye!
-See you!

240
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,675
Hello. This is Nakajo.

241
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,011
Koichi? Are you done working?

242
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:04,917
This way.

243
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,020
Alcohol? What do you usually drink?

244
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,421
Like, beer and stuff.

245
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:12,424
Oh, nice. They serve everything.

246
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:16,028
Sorry for the wait!

247
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,533
This is Koichi Nakajo.

248
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,501
-Nice to meet you.
-Welcome.

249
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,236
To the Young Horse Owners' Association.

250
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,272
-Young Horse Owners' Association?
-Sit.

251
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,073
Here. Okay.

252
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:34,280
So today, Koichi Nakajo has been invited

253
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:37,082
to join us as our youngest member!

254
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,150
Welcome!

255
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,254
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

256
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,590
Okay, everyone.

257
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,092
You too, Koichi.

258
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:50,196
Congratulations on joining!

259
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:53,132
-Cheers!
-On joining?

260
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,035
Sticking to what's classic is fine.

261
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:59,572
Wanting to preserve
formality and tradition.

262
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:04,443
It's necessary to maintain
the grade of Japanese horse racing.

263
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:10,616
But if we just want to protect it,
it will lead to a decline.

264
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,686
We can't stop growing.

265
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:15,754
He's spouting common sense.

266
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,923
I can when I want to.

267
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,293
But that common sense,

268
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:25,231
if we make those comments
we come off as being cocky, right?

269
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,199
Yes.

270
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,002
I agree.

271
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,137
-Right?
-But…

272
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,040
I don't mean to say anything strange.

273
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:39,211
But when I talk,
they act like I can't read the room.

274
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,980
That's the worst.

275
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,382
They tell you,
"Do whatever you want," right?

276
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,786
But that actually means,

277
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:50,623
"Only to the extent
that I can understand."

278
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,225
There’s a hidden meaning.

279
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:56,195
That's true.

280
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,264
They don't want to take responsibility.

281
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,767
Let's do as we please.

282
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,244
-Excuse me.
-Good work.

283
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,921
This is a column started by Nobuyuki.

284
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:26,825
This article talks about something called
the "Young Horse Owners' Association."

285
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,527
When did you become a member?

286
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,633
A little while ago, at a dinner party.

287
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,340
What about it?

288
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,278
Of course, I have no intention of
interfering in your social relationships,

289
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:49,148
but did you know that this group

290
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:53,118
is not very well-regarded
by people in the same industry?

291
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:55,888
No.

292
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,826
The desire to change
the system is admirable,

293
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,728
but Japanese horse racing

294
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,364
is not fragile enough
to be changed by performance.

295
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,099
It's best to do it in moderation.

296
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,271
Just as I thought.

297
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:13,839
What?

298
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:16,108
It is we…

299
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,011
who need to read the room.

300
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:22,815
Mr. Kurisu.

301
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,284
Can't you be more on my side?

302
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,353
Instead of being a go-between,

303
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:30,089
I want you to stand with me
and fight alongside me.

304
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,325
Fight? With who?

305
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,028
With the team.

306
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,898
No matter what I say,
no one takes me seriously.

307
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:42,101
-But if you say it, everyone--
-I'm sorry.

308
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:47,206
Who we need to fight is not the team.

309
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:50,843
Sorry.

310
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,613
I'll be more careful from now on.

311
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,436
THIRD PLACE / FIFTH PLACE / SEVENTH PLACE

312
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:18,771
HORSE RACING BOOK

313
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,083
Both of them are waiting.

314
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,421
Okay.

315
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,800
-What are you doing?
-Shush!

316
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:52,704
This is the new schedule
I came up with for Family.

317
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,940
Unfortunately,

318
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:59,511
I think Ryujiro is just too busy
to be Family's main jockey.

319
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:05,250
So I would like to change the jockey
and reorganize the future race selections.

320
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,052
Wait.

321
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:11,990
It's not that easy finding a jockey
who can replace Ryujiro.

322
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:13,959
I have a jockey.

323
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,361
I can't think of any.

324
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,333
It's Shohei.

325
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:30,476
Let me change his jockey to Shohei Nozaki.

326
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,077
Wait a minute.

327
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:35,747
When I watch Shohei
at the training center,

328
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:39,318
I think he suits Family
better than anyone else.

329
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:40,219
Have you…

330
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,353
I mean…

331
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,690
Have you spoken to him about this?

332
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:46,825
No, not yet.

333
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,328
In that case, there's no need
to rush into a decision.

334
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:53,165
Let’s listen to everyone
and find a good middle ground together.

335
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,700
How long will you postpone it?

336
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:56,034
It's not like that.

337
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,069
Excuse me.

338
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,738
Training and the real thing are different.

339
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,673
Shohei is doing his best,

340
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,910
but he doesn't have 52 wins
and major race experience.

341
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:09,481
I think Ryujiro's experience is essential
to ensure we get results.

342
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,750
If you decide it's impossible
from the start,

343
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,586
nothing will change, right?

344
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:20,592
Please let me and Shohei
take on the challenge.

345
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,896
Our goal is to win the Arima.

346
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,431
For that, we need results.

347
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,400
The Arima is a race you can only enter

348
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,936
after achieving results
and gaining recognition in Japan.

349
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,204
I agree with you.

350
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,439
We have a race coming up in December.

351
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:41,680
We can give up on the next race.

352
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:47,252
If we do that, we'll never
be able to compete in the Arima.

353
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,353
No, not just compete.

354
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:50,956
We'll win it.

355
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,692
-Koichi…
-Please.

356
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,794
I only have Family.

357
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:57,896
Please.

358
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:07,539
That's right.

359
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,842
Koichi only has Family.

360
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,611
But I…

361
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:15,747
can ride other horses.

362
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,283
-Ryujiro!
-Wait, Ryujiro!

363
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:25,591
You want to win the Arima.

364
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:28,560
You want to fulfill
the late president's wishes.

365
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,897
Everyone feels the same.

366
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:33,699
But…

367
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,835
If Koichi's plan is the only option,

368
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,604
then it's not only Ryujiro,

369
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,307
but me you don't need either.

370
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:45,510
Sorry, Mr. Kurisu.

371
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:48,413
This is as far as we go.

372
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,419
We need to find a new trainer.

373
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,655
It's not as easy as you think.

374
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:00,192
Let's go back. Let's apologize and--

375
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,627
I can't.

376
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:04,763
Mr. Hironaka now has a high chance
of becoming a leading trainer.

377
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,431
He will be focusing on that.

378
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,002
He's cutting us because he can't
afford to keep a horse that can't win--

379
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:11,703
Mr. Hironaka is not like that!

380
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,673
-I'm an inheritance-only owner.
-Positions don't matter!

381
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:20,879
There's not a single trainer
who will listen

382
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,382
to what you have to say unconditionally.

383
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:29,087
Even the President had times
when no one paid any attention to him.

384
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:33,759
However, his strength was his ability
to continue to believe in people.

385
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:39,698
I understand.

386
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,902
You can also quit, Mr. Kurisu.

387
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,572
I'll think about the rest on my own.

388
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,942
Are you serious?

389
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,311
Koichi.

390
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:53,945
Koichi!

391
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:15,500
Are you going to change jockeys?

392
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,936
I don't know.

393
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,038
Even Mr. Hironaka might get changed.

394
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:26,745
It's not that we don't believe in Shohei.

395
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:28,613
I want you to understand that.

396
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:31,316
I understand.

397
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,452
Family is special.

398
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,492
I'm really grateful that he was chosen.

399
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,527
But…

400
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:47,232
Shohei replacing Ryujiro…

401
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,938
If the President were here,

402
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,041
I wonder what he would have said.

403
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,509
Avoid?

404
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,212
You're going to avoid the next race?

405
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:03,315
The next one, or rather,
all of them for the time being.

406
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,116
What?

407
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,451
Just ask him.

408
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:09,921
What's the meaning of this, Mr. Hironaka?

409
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:12,557
Why me?

410
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:14,493
To win.

411
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:18,163
Changing jockeys is common.

412
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:22,167
But Ryujiro is the one
who made Hope stronger.

413
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:23,902
Thanks to him--

414
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,837
How long are you going
to keep being just a fan?

415
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:31,943
Hope is Hope.

416
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:33,745
Family is Family.

417
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,683
You are none other
than Jockey Shohei Nozaki.

418
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:45,257
Shohei will be bringing Koichi.

419
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,459
Please.

420
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:49,961
Please listen to him one more time.

421
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,798
I don't understand.

422
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:55,300
There were some selfish horse owners,

423
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:59,404
and some, I wondered if they had
any love for their horses, but…

424
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,673
Koichi is neither.

425
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,009
That's why he's difficult.

426
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:07,045
I wonder if it's a generational gap.

427
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,015
-Sorry, I kept you waiting.
-Hi!

428
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:13,151
Hello there.

429
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:15,654
My name is Shiina.

430
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:17,522
Are you really sure?

431
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,658
I'll definitely make you ride it.

432
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:21,092
Yes. Thank you very much.

433
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,262
Okay. It's a promise, then.

434
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:25,931
Go to the toilet quickly.

435
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,266
Yeah. Well, then…

436
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,136
Off I go!

437
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,107
What is this about?

438
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:38,643
He said, "Let's drink."

439
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:42,113
That’s enough. Let's go.

440
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,548
Mr. Kurisu is waiting.

441
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:51,590
Honestly, I don't think
anyone is at fault.

442
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,326
Mr. Hironaka, and Mr. Kurisu.

443
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:58,263
Asking me to ride all of a sudden
puts me in a bind too.

444
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:02,934
"No one's at fault.", "A bind."

445
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,170
I can't be so carefree.

446
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:09,040
After becoming a horse owner…

447
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:13,612
Do you have any idea
how much pressure I feel?

448
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:17,816
It's not just a dream.

449
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:22,754
It's not only my father,
I'm also carrying my mother's hopes.

450
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,492
That's what it means to make Family win.

451
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:29,961
That's why I became a horse owner.

452
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,668
Do you understand…

453
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:40,038
how I feel?

454
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:42,574
Don't be so selfish.

455
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:44,509
It's the same for everyone.

456
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,847
I'm carrying the Nozaki name.
Everyone is carrying something.

457
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:53,118
Definitely…

458
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:54,386
Definitely ride it!

459
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:55,654
-Okay.
-Okay?

460
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:57,756
-Let's call a taxi.
-Excuse me!

461
00:25:57,822 --> 00:25:59,824
You're involved in horse racing, right?

462
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,360
What was it called?
That family restaurant sounding…

463
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:03,895
-Oh, Royal Family!
-Yes! Royal!

464
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,498
All-you-can-drink, please!

465
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:10,802
It's great being a horse owner.
Do you go out drinking every night?

466
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:12,437
Koichi!

467
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,044
Don't get too cocky!

468
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,046
It's probably your parents' money, right?

469
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:23,748
At least make a horse that can win!

470
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,384
It's his father's fault.

471
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:29,688
He can't win because his father
did bad things when he was alive.

472
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:30,655
You're right!

473
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,024
You've got it tough as his successor.

474
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:41,366
The person you have dialed…

475
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,034
I'm going to go.

476
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,570
-Mr. Hironaka…
-Maybe this is for the best.

477
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:48,873
Rather than saying the wrong thing
and falling into self-loathing,

478
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:51,476
it's best if we don't meet at all.

479
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:53,778
See you.

480
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,295
Hello?

481
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:14,699
I'm Odaka from the Public Safety Division
of the Minami-Azabu Police Station.

482
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,534
Yes?

483
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:20,138
We have Koichi Nakajo here with us.

484
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:21,406
What?

485
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:26,378
Apparently, he got into a fight
while drunk.

486
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:30,215
Now, he's sobered up
and is feeling quite remorseful.

487
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,384
Come in.

488
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:37,856
Someone is also coming
to pick up his friend.

489
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,726
It was the other person who started it.

490
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:46,031
They're reflecting on the incident
and said that they won't make it an issue,

491
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,867
so you can leave for today.

492
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:53,705
Please excuse me.

493
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:56,608
Sorry for this.

494
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,376
I apologize for the inconvenience.

495
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:10,188
-We'll go ahead.
-Take care.

496
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:17,729
Koichi! See you again at the racetrack!

497
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:21,066
-Bye!
-Take care.

498
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:24,302
Good night!

499
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,944
Thank you very much.

500
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,484
What happened to Shohei?

501
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:45,423
You were together.

502
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:53,631
Before meeting you, he called me
and said he would bring you over.

503
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,534
Why is he not here?

504
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:03,108
He went home first.

505
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,678
I wouldn't move, so…

506
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:11,015
You're careless.

507
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,618
You lack awareness.

508
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,820
That's not adult behavior.

509
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,431
Let's find a new stable for Family.

510
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:29,734
We can no longer rely on Mr. Hironaka.

511
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,940
SANNO FAMILY GRAVE

512
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:42,147
It won't be until I hand them over to you.

513
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:43,815
But until that horse…

514
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,318
finishes first.

515
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:53,258
Family will get us what we are missing.

516
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:54,359
The Arima Kinen.

517
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:03,334
So if you start to waver…

518
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,076
Damn it.

519
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,156
-I'm sorry about the other day.
-It's okay.

520
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,426
Please take this, it's not much.

521
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,962
-Thank you.
-I hope it's not a problem.

522
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:35,300
HIRONAKA STABLE

523
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:45,009
Sorry about the other day.

524
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:48,346
-It seems Koichi got you involved--
-You've got it wrong.

525
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:52,717
I'm really sorry!

526
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:53,885
What?

527
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:05,063
I was waiting for you.

528
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:11,436
The President's favorite place
was a tempura restaurant,

529
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:14,672
and mine is this set meal restaurant.

530
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:17,442
Please sit here.

531
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:19,310
Thank you very much.

532
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,646
-Excuse me. Beer, please.
-Okay.

533
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:26,551
-Thank you for waiting.
-Thank you.

534
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:28,820
Oh, thank you.

535
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:33,925
I heard what happened
that night from Shohei.

536
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:39,797
He can't win because his father
did bad things when he was alive.

537
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:40,999
You're right!

538
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,934
You've got it tough as his successor.

539
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,770
What the hell do you know?

540
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,274
-Everybody's doing it to win.
-Shohei.

541
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,775
Everybody's struggling to win!

542
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:53,878
-Do you want to go? Hey!
-Don't touch him!

543
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:56,047
A jockey being here would be bad. Go!

544
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:57,682
-Hey! Wait!
-Hey!

545
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,485
-Go! Hurry!
-What's with you? Don't touch me!

546
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:03,321
-Don't get in the way!
-What the hell?

547
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:09,961
I'm sorry I said such terrible things
without knowing the truth.

548
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:11,062
No, it's okay.

549
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:13,631
I brought that situation on.

550
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:15,433
No…

551
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:21,139
-Have you decided what to order?
-Oh, the daily special.

552
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:25,443
What about you?
Everything's delicious, by the way.

553
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,847
Then, the daily special for me too.

554
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:32,617
-Two daily specials.
-How about the rice?

555
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:34,319
-Large serving, please.
-Okay.

556
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:49,133
There is something
I need to apologize to you for.

557
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:55,273
Since I started working as your secretary,
I have continuously thought,

558
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,444
"What would the President do?"

559
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:05,850
But… that means that
I haven't been seeing you as you.

560
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,419
I'm a failure as a secretary.

561
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:14,892
Actually…

562
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,998
Before he died,

563
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,235
he told me something.

564
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:26,004
Koichi.

565
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:28,072
From now on,

566
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:34,746
many people will try to impose
what appear to be horse racing rules.

567
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,282
But, you…

568
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:41,052
You are not from that world.

569
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,222
You're…

570
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:47,291
just a man who loves horses.

571
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:51,029
So if you start to waver…

572
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:54,399
prioritize only the horse

573
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,935
and what you believe in.

574
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,709
Okay.

575
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:09,847
I did as I was told,
I only thought about Family.

576
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:13,618
I thought that was
the only thing I could rely on.

577
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,623
But Family needs a team,

578
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:22,126
and I need you all.

579
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,164
I didn't know anything.

580
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:32,270
I just wanted you all to think
that everything's all right,

581
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,339
that I could handle things.

582
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:41,712
I'm sorry for making you bear
all of this alone.

583
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,915
No, it's okay.

584
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:45,983
Thank you for waiting.

585
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:49,454
Thank you.

586
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,190
Let's eat before it gets cold.

587
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:57,228
I always eat dinner alone.

588
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,232
"It's delicious," or…

589
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,935
"I'm happy."

590
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:11,375
I'm not good
at putting my feelings into words.

591
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:17,715
I don't know
if I can convey this properly.

592
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,389
Winning the Arima Kinen.

593
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,391
This dream…

594
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:32,997
is also the dream of everyone
who fought alongside my father.

595
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:36,567
Mr. Kurisu.

596
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,971
Would you let me join in on that dream?

597
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:45,843
I want to make it happen,
together with you all.

598
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:49,313
Would you fight with me again?

599
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,453
Let's win the Arima Kinen together.

600
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,623
I beg of you.

601
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,571
Understood.

602
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:19,010
Thank you very much.

603
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:20,144
Yes.

604
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,552
Just one thing.

605
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:32,223
Don't you ever betray me.

606
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:35,860
Ever.

607
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,498
I understand.

608
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,336
I won't ever betray you.

609
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:48,439
Ever.

610
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:53,978
Let's eat.

611
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:55,880
Yes.

612
00:36:57,915 --> 00:36:59,317
Thank you for the meal.

613
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,651
Thank you for the meal.

614
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,067
-It's delicious.
-Yes.

615
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:20,171
I'm very sorry.

616
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:26,811
Please, could you listen
to Koichi's thoughts one more time?

617
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:39,824
My plan was based on the idea

618
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:44,028
of winning the Arima
two years from now, not next year.

619
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,199
I believe Family is a late bloomer.

620
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,068
So, we don't rush. Let's take our time.

621
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:54,338
I want to create a plan
that will ensure Family wins the Arima.

622
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:59,410
Because I'm an inheritance-only
horse owner,

623
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,681
and Family is the only one I have.

624
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:07,051
In a few years, Family will also retire.

625
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:11,055
Even after that,
it is my responsibility and goal

626
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,457
to continue supporting Family.

627
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,395
But…

628
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:20,998
I don't have the financial means.

629
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:25,503
The only thing I can do is get Family
to produce results in the big races.

630
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:29,273
Making sure he can earn enough
to feed himself until he dies

631
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:34,478
is just as important
as winning the Arima Kinen.

632
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:37,848
So I…

633
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:42,119
want to win no matter what.

634
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,756
It was a plan that came
from thinking about Family.

635
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:50,461
But I'm really sorry that…

636
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,432
I couldn't express it well.

637
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,666
No.

638
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:59,036
Of course, we need to keep winning,

639
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:02,440
but that is just a means to win the Arima.

640
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,476
As for Shohei's appointment,

641
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:09,180
Koichi nominated him with the expectation
that he'd grow in the next two years.

642
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:11,916
Right now,

643
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,120
at this very moment,
Ryujiro is the one who can win.

644
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:19,223
However, I think that in two years,

645
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:22,893
Shohei and Ryujiro
will be competing for the top spot.

646
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:35,773
I understand.

647
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:43,581
I'll go.

648
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,823
In two years, huh?

649
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,529
Interesting.

650
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:02,166
Then there's a lot we can do.

651
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,836
I was being stubborn.

652
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:09,340
All I could think about was getting
to the Arima as soon as possible.

653
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,741
I'm really sorry.

654
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:12,109
No.

655
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:16,447
Don't mind Ryujiro.
That's the kind of job a jockey is.

656
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:21,018
We will proceed
with training based on your plan.

657
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:25,523
Of course, this is based on the assumption
that Shohei will be appointed.

658
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:28,559
But there are many weak spots.

659
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:30,694
Koichi.

660
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:35,800
Would you like to help us redesign
the two-year road map?

661
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:41,472
Thank you.

662
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:43,874
You didn't have to come.

663
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:47,511
I was the one
who got you involved in the first place.

664
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:51,649
Thank you so much

665
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:54,718
for running with us this far.

666
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:00,691
The race is just a moment.

667
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:02,593
I think jockeys

668
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:09,967
carry those moments with them
for the rest of their lives.

669
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:13,070
There are…

670
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:17,908
countless moments living inside me.

671
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:23,414
I'll carry them until I retire,
and I think that’s enough.

672
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,309
It's a problem, right? What I did.

673
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:54,178
If I had been there,

674
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:56,780
I would have done the same thing.

675
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:02,186
It was a problem,
but we won't make it a problem.

676
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:23,040
Shohei will be Family's main jockey
from the next race.

677
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:27,311
Believe in him.

678
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,914
If you don't believe in him, who will?

679
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:35,486
ROYAL HOPE

680
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:38,689
The new year arrived,

681
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:43,360
Royal Family made a new start
with Shohei Nozaki.

682
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:58,542
Stop!

683
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:00,878
Race Ten, mount up.

684
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:23,000
Number 11, Royal Family, is going wide,
and he finishes in first place!

685
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:25,302
-Yes!
-All right!

686
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:27,605
The result was first place.

687
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:31,008
From that day onwards,
Family won three consecutive races

688
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:33,410
and was thrust into the spotlight.

689
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:37,982
However, there was something
that stood in their way.

690
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:40,784
He's fast! He's strong!
A four, five-length lead!

691
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:44,154
Number 11, So Perfect,
finishes in first place!

692
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:48,025
-Jockey Ryujiro Saki is looking relaxed…
-What's with that horse?

693
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:49,793
What a monster.

694
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:57,368
SO PERFECT

695
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:03,440
I wish you could have played
a little longer.

696
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:07,511
-That's the result of playing.
-You're the best.

697
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,446
A picture, please.

698
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,083
Congratulations.

699
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:16,086
That horse still has a long way to go.
It will be from here on out.

700
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,488
-It's amazing!
-Do your best!

701
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:20,090
-I heard you bought it for 39 million?
-You should come by.

702
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,393
-I'd love to.
-Thank you.

703
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,702
That horse! The 39 million from that time!

704
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:33,137
So Perfect!

705
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:36,940
I was truly lucky.

706
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:41,645
Thanks to you cutting off Ryujiro,
I suddenly have the best duo!

707
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:47,418
I'm sorry, I know you had
your eye on this horse too.

708
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:49,286
Not at all.

709
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:53,190
Family is all I need.

710
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:59,263
I don't care about generations
or being the strongest.

711
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:03,634
Family and I will win the Arima.
That's all I need.

712
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:10,741
There's room, right?

713
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:13,577
For a horse owner like me?

714
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,323
-Royal Family's jockey is down!
-Shohei!

715
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,759
He's in pain. He should get looked at.

716
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:30,694
We'll change jockeys.

717
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:33,831
Maybe we should
think about retiring Family.
