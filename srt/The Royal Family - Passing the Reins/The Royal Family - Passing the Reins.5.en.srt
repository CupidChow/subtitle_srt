ROYAL HOPE

2
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:10,643
<i>Royal Human's Horse Racing Division</i>

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,547
<i>purchased Royal Hope, a new horse</i>
<i>born in Hidaka, for 100 million yen.</i>

4
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:18,351
<i>However, once the training</i>
<i>to be a racehorse began,</i>

5
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:20,053
<i>he proved to be uncontrollable.</i>

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,122
Even his debut is in jeopardy.

7
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,958
<i>Hironaka's only hope</i>

8
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,660
<i>was Saki Ryujiro, a jockey in Iwate.</i>

9
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:28,962
<i>Hope trusted him.</i>

10
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,131
<i>Number 12, Royal Hope, is slow to start.</i>

11
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:34,134
<i>Despite being slow in his debut,</i>
<i>he overwhelmed Valshare,</i>

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,735
<i>owned by Yoshihiro Shiina,</i>

13
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:38,405
<i>and shocked the national</i>
<i>horse racing world, but…</i>

14
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:44,577
THE ROYAL HUMAN PRESIDENT
HAS AN ILLEGITIMATE CHILD

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,319
<i>An illegitimate child? What is this about?</i>

16
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:56,322
<i>Everyone is agitated.</i>

17
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,558
<i>Can you explain?</i>

18
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,694
My private life is none of your business.

19
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:02,729
It is.

20
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,666
I don't know how to answer
the stakeholders.

21
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,769
<i>Just tell me what you can.</i>

22
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,672
All men are the same…

23
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,475
We're heading out. We'll be back at four.

24
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:16,409
Take care.

25
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:19,512
President, the fact
that you're not denying it…

26
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,581
May I take this rumor as true?

27
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,616
You only need to think about horses.

28
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:26,286
"Never betray me."

29
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,655
You told me that, President.

30
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,491
I have never forgotten those words.

31
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,694
I believe I've done my best
to live up to them.

32
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:36,229
But…

33
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:39,265
If you don't even trust me
enough to talk to me.

34
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,268
What am I even here for?

35
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,941
Your dream is my dream too.

36
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,279
Get the car. We're going to Maebashi.

37
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,451
The woman's name is Mikiko Nakajo.

38
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:00,520
She used to be a hostess in Ginza.

39
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,423
It's strange, you know.

40
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,992
When someone else is around,
it doesn't happen,

41
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:09,929
but whenever we try
to meet alone, it rains.

42
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,133
<i>Though today you're here.</i>

43
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,237
<i>We hadn't been in touch for a long time.</i>

44
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,240
<i>But I was out drinking in Ginza</i>
<i>with an old friend,</i>

45
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,176
<i>and we got to talking about her.</i>

46
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:28,848
She has about a year left.

47
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,123
Hey.

48
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,397
He works with me on the horses.

49
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:47,200
I'm Eiji Kurisu, his secretary.

50
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:51,571
He kept asking where I've been going,
so I just brought him along.

51
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:52,672
Please excuse me.

52
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:55,708
He knows the situation.

53
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:57,410
You can trust him.

54
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:01,948
Oh, right.

55
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:05,618
Congratulations on your debut race.

56
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,420
Royal…

57
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,022
- It's Hope.
- Right.

58
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,090
Royal Hope.

59
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:12,325
Thank you.

60
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,261
I offered to bet on them for you.

61
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,364
I didn't want to trouble you.

62
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:21,501
I'll take them.

63
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,037
- No, I'll handle it.
- It's fine.

64
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,606
He's restless around me.

65
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:30,143
He always leaves the room so quickly.

66
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:36,449
Why come here
in the first place, I wonder.

67
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,357
<i>He got in a weekly magazine?</i>

68
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:50,029
<i>I guess the President</i>
<i>is just that popular.</i>

69
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:51,531
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:57,604
Oh, um, if you don't mind me asking…

71
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:01,241
About my child?

72
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,914
His name is Nakajo Koichi.

73
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,316
He's in university.

74
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,485
I haven't told him about his father.

75
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,288
And yet, the President

76
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:20,059
suddenly showed up here
without even calling me first.

77
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,962
What do you think he said first?

78
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:29,168
"I prepared a private room.
Give me your bank details."

79
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:32,405
I'm so sick of it.

80
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:39,879
Sir.

81
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,518
My Ginza bar friends,

82
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,888
I used to take them to lots of races.

83
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:54,961
Everyone was excited at first,
but then one by one, they stopped coming.

84
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,998
In the end, only Mikiko remained.

85
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,872
I mean, she had a strange reaction to it.

86
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:10,677
When talking about horse racing,
people often mention betting, right?

87
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:14,881
<i>But when she first sat down, she muttered…</i>

88
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:19,786
<i>The green turf is so beautiful.</i>

89
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,587
That was interesting.

90
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,356
So I even took her to Arima.

91
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:29,829
Kanto around New Year
is usually clear and sunny, but…

92
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,632
It was raining that day too.

93
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,602
<i>Couldn't see the course due to the rain.</i>

94
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:40,406
<i>The race was a mess.</i>
<i>"Sorry, today is terrible," I told her.</i>

95
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:41,708
No way!

96
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:44,043
<i>I felt sorry for her, but…</i>

97
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:45,611
I won!

98
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,313
I can see that. Seriously?

99
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:50,083
You would think it was a fluke.

100
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:53,086
But before the race started,

101
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:55,621
she was looking at the horses
and taking notes.

102
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,126
"In this weather, it takes power to run.

103
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,796
The horse with strong footing
will probably win."

104
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,264
She knew nothing of horses.

105
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,434
She has a good eye for horses.

106
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:10,436
An eye for horses, huh?

107
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,441
She's a strange woman.

108
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:17,877
Nearly 20 years later,

109
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,446
I heard she was sick.

110
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,317
I looked up the hospital
and went to visit.

111
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:26,419
Then she said,

112
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,857
"My son is coming by today.

113
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:34,327
Koichi is coming, so please leave."

114
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,632
I didn't know anything.

115
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,070
Seriously, I'm so pathetic.

116
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:48,508
I'll handle Koichi by myself.

117
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,944
No need to help me.

118
00:06:58,718 --> 00:06:59,786
The key.

119
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,157
I failed to see it.

120
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,727
- See what?
- Everything, I suppose.

121
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,497
The fact you had a secret child,

122
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,867
the things you were doing in secret,

123
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,604
and that you're trying
to handle this alone.

124
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,208
That's just how I am.

125
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,310
If you don't like it, quit.

126
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,312
- If I quit, you would be hurt.
- The key!

127
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,748
How about letting it out a little bit?

128
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:31,184
Have a good cry, then you'll feel better!

129
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:32,618
I…

130
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:36,289
That good-luck watch you gave me,

131
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,592
and all the bet payout money
you allowed me to keep,

132
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,295
I've held onto them,
so I can always give them back.

133
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,630
If you are ever in trouble,

134
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,900
I would gladly give
everything I have to help you.

135
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:55,141
You have a mission, to take Hope to Arima.

136
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,544
<i>I will help take care</i>
<i>of Ms. Mikiko for you.</i>

137
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,348
<i>Leave it all to me.</i>

138
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,651
What I gave you,

139
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,489
I won't ever ask for back.
I'm not that pathetic.

140
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,525
And…

141
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,229
I've put my hopes on you.

142
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,798
Don't ever betray me.

143
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,733
If you betray me,

144
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,638
I'll have no choice but to kill you.

145
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,075
Will you still do it?

146
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:40,620
Even if something
were to happen to you tomorrow,

147
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,090
I would still help you handle it.

Will they get a divorce?

No way.

166

I came to check on Hope.

180
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:55,921
Let me take you.

181
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,356
- This way.
- Yes, please.

182
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,258
- A gift for you.
- Thank you.

183
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,626
Hey, how's it going?

184
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:01,560
Hello, sir.

185
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:03,396
Are things okay at the President's home?

186
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:04,897
For now, nothing has changed.

187
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,165
I see.

188
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,634
But thanks to this,
I'm more motivated now.

189
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,803
I want to make him win no matter what.

190
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,205
<i>Let's win and hush the hecklers.</i>

191
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:14,306
<i>Yes!</i>

192
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,643
<i>They call him the Slow-Start King.</i>

193
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,612
He lacks motivation.

194
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,514
I need to find a way to get him going.

195
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,849
Maybe he dislikes blondes.

196
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,051
Shut up.

197
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:26,652
Well, thank you.

198
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,221
Good morning.

199
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,792
Is the President all right?

200
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,927
Sorry.

201
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,696
He's getting by.

202
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,365
This won't bring him down.

203
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,834
Mr. Hironaka said he's more motivated now.

204
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,536
Oh, that's good.

205
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,604
I'm motivated too.

206
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,740
If we don't win, Hope will be ridiculed.

207
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,576
You're absolutely right.

208
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,615
I want my horse to win.

209
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,253
That's the only way

210
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,858
to make a racehorse happy.

211
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,593
Yes.

212
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,463
First, the Fuyo Stakes.

213
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,299
Our next target is a G3.

214
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,267
The Tokyo Sports Hai.

215
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,337
If we win here,
we'll have a chance next year.

216
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,707
<i>The 2014 Fuyo Stakes race!</i>
<i>This year, it's being held in Niigata.</i>

217
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:22,775
What happened?

218
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:25,878
Please tell me
you didn't cause a scandal too.

219
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,747
I'm doing this for Hope.

220
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,615
To motivate him at the gates.

221
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:30,516
I see.

222
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:34,353
But with your hair like this,
you look like a fine young man.

223
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,222
I've always been one!

224
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,223
Now!

225
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:40,659
I got these new dapper jockey silks too.

226
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:42,128
<i>Let's start fresh.</i>

227
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:44,296
<i>Slow out of the gate again!</i>
<i>Hope's slow start!</i>

228
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,665
<i>He wins even with a late start!</i>
<i>The crowd cheers!</i>

229
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,200
<i>Royal Hope is fierce!</i>

230
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,170
<i>The skies of Niigata welcome</i>
<i>Ryujiro Saki with the black helmet!</i>

231
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:55,875
<i>This fall, Royal Hope also took</i>
<i>first place in the G3, Tokyo Sports Hai,</i>

232
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,344
<i>steadily gaining him</i>
<i>the trust of horse racing fans.</i>

233
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,779
Interesting.

234
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:03,783
<i>With this momentum, the Royal Family</i>
<i>aims for next year's G1 races.</i>

235
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,718
Even with a bad start…

236
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:09,822
<i>The Satsuki Sho, the Japan Derby,</i>
<i>and the Kikuka Sho.</i>

237
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,958
<i>As beyond those three</i>
<i>lies the Arima Kinen.</i>

238
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,295
It's me, Kurisu.

239
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,164
Oh, hi.

240
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,168
I found it.

241
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,702
Thank you.

242
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:24,837
It's nothing.

243
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,312
The horse seems to be doing well.

244
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,514
Thankfully.

245
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,149
A long time ago,

246
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:42,021
the President took me
all the way to Hokkaido

247
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,091
and forced me to choose a horse.

248
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:46,992
Oh, really?

249
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,194
Just one horse.

250
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:54,567
I told him, "It's so expensive,
I can't take responsibility for it."

251
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,336
What was the horse's name?

252
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,873
Royal Happiness.

253
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,877
<i>He never let us see her.</i>

254
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,980
He never lets us see the good parts!

255
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,049
You're weird, Dad.

256
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,284
<i>You're the ones that never came</i>
<i>when I asked you to!</i>

257
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,953
What?

258
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:20,459
Happiness is still living well
at a ranch in Hokkaido.

259
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,294
Is that so?

260
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,231
She's a respectable mother now.

261
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,337
My Koichi,

262
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:35,875
what club do you think
he joined at university?

263
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:37,443
Well…

264
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,146
The Horse Racing Research Club.

265
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:43,349
What?

266
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:47,753
Koichi!

267
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,725
<i>I still haven't told him about his father.</i>

268
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:57,396
<i>But one day, I saw him</i>
<i>earnestly working on something.</i>

269
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:58,464
How was your day?

270
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:02,534
<i>And he was entering</i>
<i>horse data into his computer.</i>

271
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,272
<i>Children…</i>

272
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:11,410
They never fail to surprise us.

273
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:12,311
Yes.

274
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,949
<i>Seeing him grow up</i>
<i>and become a fine young man</i>

275
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,184
<i>has brought me great joy.</i>

276
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:20,886
Take care.

277
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,534
- Why the sudden visit?
- Nothing.

278
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,736
- Just wanted to see her.
- Oh.

279
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:41,540
Shohei.

280
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:49,315
- I actually want to show her to someone.
- Oh, okay.

281
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,118
Okay, taking a picture.

282
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,120
- Look your best, okay?
- Happiness!

283
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:56,822
I see.

284
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,724
So Happiness had such a history.

285
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,758
Yes.

286
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:01,827
We have to cherish it.

287
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:03,829
Yes.

288
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,698
But…

289
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,567
I'm a little hesitant now.

290
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:12,471
Maybe I'm being a nuisance to Mikiko.

291
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:13,739
No.

292
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,608
If she really didn't want it,
she could refuse.

293
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:19,244
Yes.

294
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,214
But your President is terrible.
He's garbage.

295
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:23,816
Garbage?

296
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:24,717
He is!

297
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:28,253
If I were his wife, I would drag him
behind a horse and kill him.

298
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,790
Now, about that Mikiko lady?

299
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:36,095
If you were to say Ms. Mikiko
had an unhappy life, I wouldn't agree.

300
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:41,500
When it comes to the past,
there are no mistakes or wrong choices.

301
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:45,237
The path she walked
is the only correct answer.

302
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,207
At least, that's what I believe.

303
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:52,277
- Okay.
- So you shouldn't hesitate either.

304
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:54,446
Yes.

305
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,382
Understood.

306
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,319
Her son is still a student, isn't he?

307
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,155
It must be tough.

308
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,289
Yes.

309
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:09,294
To see the baby you once held
grow up to be taller than you…

310
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,564
And to keep watching over them…

311
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:15,034
That is a mother's joy.

312
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,878
- Sorry, I made you help out.
- It's fine.

313
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:28,213
Horse Racing Club? Nice hobby.

314
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,349
Be sure to guide Mr. Kurisu, okay?

315
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,917
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

316
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,154
All right, let's go!

317
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,989
- I'm closing the door.
- Huh?

318
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:43,929
See you later!

319
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:57,076
What kind of person is Ryujiro Saki?

320
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,044
What? Mr. Saki?

321
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,013
What kind of person…

322
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,714
I wonder.

323
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,283
Is he a genius?

324
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:11,256
To me, all winning jockeys
look like geniuses.

325
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,126
But I think Mr. Saki is especially unique.

326
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,128
He's good at befriending horses.

327
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,198
He got along with Hope instantly.

328
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:24,336
Maybe it's because he has lived
with horses since he was little.

329
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,872
Like you, Shohei.

330
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:34,379
Can you get his autograph?

331
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,615
Autograph?

332
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:38,617
Of course, I'll ask him!

333
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:41,153
Please get it for me.

334
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,256
Oh, I'm so happy!

335
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,558
He's our main jockey, after all.

336
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:51,263
Knowing that you are his fan
is really heartening.

337
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:52,698
No.

338
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,366
I'm not a fan.

339
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:55,901
What?

340
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,171
I want to surpass him.

341
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,410
Please don't tell my mother.

342
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:10,015
I am applying to the Horseracing School.

343
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,186
I want to be Hope's jockey.

344
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,023
That means I should be
better than Mr. Saki, right?

345
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:23,362
So, I want to put it on my desk
to keep me focused.

346
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:32,671
I'll wait here, okay?

347
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:48,253
<i>Seeing him grow up</i>
<i>and become a fine young man…</i>

348
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,490
<i>And to keep watching over them…</i>

349
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,058
<i>That is a mother's joy.</i>

350
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:07,639
Mothers really are amazing.

351
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,686
Here you go.

352
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,314
I am sorry…

353
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,485
for all the trouble I caused.

354
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:30,922
It's okay.

355
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,525
Things are quiet now.

356
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,707
I gave birth to him on my own.

357
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,811
- I didn't think we would meet again--
- Listen.

358
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,915
I hate horses.

359
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:04,956
Maybe that's why every time I go see
Sanno's horses race, he always loses.

360
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,592
When that happens,

361
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:11,496
I eventually feel like
it's my fault they lost.

362
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,067
And I hate them even more.

363
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:19,771
It's foolish, isn't it?

364
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:26,845
The horses don't care about me at all.

365
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:28,447
It's all in my head.

366
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,555
Did you ever go to the races with him?

367
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:39,825
I did.

368
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:41,526
Is that so?

369
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,663
Did he win then?

370
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:47,666
No.

371
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:51,737
His horses were weak.

372
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:00,612
How rude.

373
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,763
She was interesting.

374
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:30,842
<i>Back at the Yayoi Sho in March,</i>
<i>Hope finished second.</i>

375
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,645
<i>It secured him priority entry</i>
<i>at the Satsuki Sho, the first race</i>

376
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,147
<i>of the Classic Triple Crown.</i>

377
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:37,516
Let's see how the Slow-Start King fares!

378
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:39,918
First race of the Classic Triple Crown!

379
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:42,921
<i>Hope will finally run in a G1 race.</i>

380
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:45,624
<i>Valshare is coming up!</i>

381
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,860
<i>Valshare bursts ahead</i>
<i>and crosses the finish line!</i>

382
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,362
Yes!

383
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,531
<i>However, he finished 16th.</i>

384
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,233
<i>This crushing defeat</i>
<i>betrayed the expectations</i>

385
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,868
<i>put on him as the favorite.</i>

386
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,103
<i>Next is Gaspard Marilyn…</i>

387
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,439
<i>We still have a long way to go.</i>

388
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:03,375
President?

389
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:04,843
President!

390
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:06,912
Hey!

391
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:08,680
President.

392
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:09,648
Any plans tonight?

393
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,418
- A party?
- Not today.

394
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,153
What do you need?

395
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:18,890
Why don't we have a meal together?

396
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:20,926
What?

397
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,762
I've been wanting to talk to you.

398
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,133
No, sorry sir, but he isn't free today.

399
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,367
It's fine.

400
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:32,337
I'll be happy to.

401
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,644
I'm surprised, though.

402
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:42,380
Who knew you were a lightweight
like this guy?

403
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:43,582
Sorry.

404
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,751
I'll pour the next one.

405
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,988
It's fine. No need for formalities.

406
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:51,890
- However…
- Excuse me.

407
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,392
If a fight breaks out,
cover me with your body.

408
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:02,801
Still…

409
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:05,937
Valshare was great today.

410
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:10,742
I believe they call that "flawless."

411
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:11,843
We were just lucky.

412
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,112
You call that win good luck?

413
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:17,115
You plan to take
the remaining Classics, right?

414
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,117
It won't be that easy.

415
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:23,321
I mean, Valshare is
the strongest horse you've got.

416
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:27,926
Although, My Hope beat him once.

417
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:31,363
What? What is it?

418
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:32,931
- Don't, sir.
- Why?

419
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:35,767
- Excuse me.
- Indeed, Hope is a good horse.

420
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,837
A kind that I could never find.

421
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:39,905
Yes.

422
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:45,343
Even if he was put up for auction,
you would never even look at him.

423
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:50,115
You must have studied
his pedigree quite a bit.

424
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:53,752
A decent horse
with an element of surprise.

425
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:58,757
Such a horse
can even change future trends.

426
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:00,458
But?

427
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:04,029
But what?

428
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:05,697
You want to say more, right?

429
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:08,667
- Like, "But our horse still won't lose."
- President!

430
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:10,902
I never said such a thing.

431
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:15,307
No, your face says it all.

432
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:20,645
When I talk about Valshare,
I can't keep a calm face.

433
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:23,315
I can't help but despise him.

434
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:25,550
He's always getting in the way.

435
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,386
I wish that horse would just disappear.

436
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:35,827
I see.

437
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,231
Everyone, let's eat
before the food gets cold--

438
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:41,933
Then I will say it.

439
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:47,138
Indeed, Royal Hope is a good horse.

440
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,941
- But--
- Here it comes.

441
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,543
- But what?
- But…

442
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:54,479
Our horse will never lose to him again.

443
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,183
Speed, stamina, senses, and early pace.

444
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:02,387
In every aspect,
there's no reason for Valshare to lose.

445
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,122
Speed, stamina.

446
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:06,591
You're talking about quite a small scale.

447
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:10,862
A horse is a living creature.
A race is a living thing too.

448
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,564
Speed, stamina…

449
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,233
A truly strong horse
exists beyond such logic!

450
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,868
That is far too simplistic.

451
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,570
Numbers are reality.

452
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,473
If you base your tactics
on such blind faith,

453
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,344
then your horse of some
no-name pedigree cannot win.

454
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:29,814
Right, now he calls Hope a no-name.

455
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:34,119
Do you think I don't hate Royal Hope?

456
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:38,790
Valshare lost to your horse
on his big stage, his debut race.

457
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:43,962
I will never forget the cheers
from the stands that day.

458
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:50,168
That excitement,
as if they were hoping for us to lose.

459
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:57,375
At that moment, I swore I would
never lose to Royal Hope again.

460
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:59,277
Not Royal Hope.

461
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:02,681
That's what I decided.

462
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,486
You're truly a fox.

463
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:10,255
This is the real you.

464
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,758
Take from this what you want.

465
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:23,468
Eat up! You guys barely ate at all.

466
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,969
No, but…

467
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,838
I can't…

468
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:30,842
KOMATSU-YA

469
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,577
Thank you for tonight.

470
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:35,447
- See you at the racecourse.
- Yes.

471
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:40,685
Go ahead.

472
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,058
I'll go flag a taxi.

473
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,193
Hey.

474
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,862
Can I ask you one thing?

475
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,131
Yes. What is it?

476
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:57,669
Why has Sanno never won a G1?

477
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,005
Where are we going wrong?

478
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:05,677
In horse racing,
there's something called "momentum."

479
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:07,812
Don't worry.

480
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:11,683
I think Mr. Sanno will win soon.

481
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,518
This is not flattery.

482
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:23,628
Just please stay out of our way.

483
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,838
Long-term use is okay.

484
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:38,309
That hurt! Hope!

485
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,145
He's biting again.

486
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:42,480
Should we try
taking the blinders off a while?

487
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:44,749
I'm by the sea.

488
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:46,351
Can you see it?

489
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,920
Where?

490
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:50,488
Hey!

491
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,358
Oh, there you are! Kanako!

492
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:56,494
I just got a call. It's decided.

493
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:58,496
He's running in the Japan Derby!

494
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:02,500
Really? Wow! We did it!

495
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,702
If we win, we'll be number one in Japan!

496
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,004
Number one!

497
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,405
Number one!

498
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:09,741
Amazing!

499
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:13,244
Are you inviting Ms. Nakajo to the derby?

500
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,013
No…

501
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,482
That might be difficult.

502
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,418
She said she would cheer
from the hospital.

503
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:25,423
I want to win.

504
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:27,458
Yeah.

505
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,830
It's strange.

506
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:36,634
We never talked
about horses before, right?

507
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,002
Yes.

508
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:41,539
And now, we're crazy about horses.

509
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,109
Life is unpredictable.

510
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:50,882
I never thought we would even talk again.

511
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,585
True.

512
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:58,923
We've known each other for so long.

513
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:05,964
Hey, if…

514
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:10,602
If at the derby, Hope wins…

515
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,439
If he wins…

516
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:21,346
- Could we…
- Then what?

517
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:23,815
Will you treat me to something?

518
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:29,354
Well, I will do that,
but that's not the point.

519
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,857
Oh, that's right.
Shohei said he wanted a new bicycle.

520
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,894
Oh, a bicycle?

521
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,529
Well, a bike is fine.

522
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:41,099
Hey, you want to look around?

523
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:42,100
Sure.

524
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,838
Seriously…

525
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:49,774
<i>This is the final wall before Arima.</i>

526
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:55,280
<i>Soon after, they learned that</i>
<i>Valshare would also be at the derby.</i>

527
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,716
A toast to victory at the derby! Cheers!

528
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:00,251
- Cheers.
- Let me take your jacket.

529
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:01,753
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

530
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:03,388
- Okay, cheers.
- Cheers.

531
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,223
Thank you.

532
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,227
Wait! I haven't got a drink yet!

533
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:10,395
Oh, sorry.

534
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:12,297
We can't wait when it comes to alcohol.

535
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:13,998
Mr. Kurisu, you don't drink, right?

536
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,401
I try to gulp it down
just for times like this.

537
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:18,336
- Good evening.
- Welcome.

538
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,638
Then let's do one more, with me.

539
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:22,540
Oh, sorry. I'm done.

540
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,575
- What?
- He's a jockey, so…

541
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,278
- Cancel the Tempura Kiss and…
- Tea is fine.

542
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:29,514
- Toast with tea.
- You two are so in sync.

543
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:31,215
You should date.

544
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:34,585
- Stop that.
- I wish the President was here too.

545
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:36,821
No! Then he'll kick me out!

546
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:39,958
The President seemed tired, so not today.

547
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,997
Between work and horses, it's tough.
He does well for his age.

548
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:48,232
Right? And his private life too.

549
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:50,902
- Oh!
- Hey!

550
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,972
- Can't I?
- No.

551
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,741
You're his daughter, you can say it.

552
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:01,245
No way, do all of you
have secret kids too?

553
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,815
- No!
- No way.

554
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:04,949
Today is fun.

555
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:08,953
A while back,

556
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:13,558
I had a fight with a big deal trainer.

557
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:17,495
I was hung out to dry,

558
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:22,533
but the President intervened,
then angrily scolded me.

559
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:25,570
"You must try to smile,
even if it's fake."

560
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,541
After I did that, work became fun.

561
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:34,479
- That's how he charms people.
- It's not like that.

562
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:36,948
Hey, are you listening?
He just told a good story.

563
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:37,982
That's right.

564
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:42,020
I also won't forgive anyone
who speaks ill of the President.

565
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,557
Some people even say that a horse
bought by Royal has no future.

566
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:50,995
No, but, he has owned horses
for more than ten years!

567
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,764
That alone is admirable.

568
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,233
They keep criticizing the losses.

569
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:59,437
I wouldn't be racing Nationals
if it weren't for the President.

570
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:01,305
All right!

571
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,775
Let's make the President a derby winner.

572
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:05,276
All right!

573
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:06,911
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

574
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:08,045
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

575
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,283
Are you okay?

576
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:14,485
I'm used to it.

577
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,121
It's late already.

578
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:19,390
You should go home and study.

579
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:20,625
It's fine. Oh, sorry.

580
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:23,995
- Don't you have homework?
- I don't. I'm not in high school anymore.

581
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,963
Maybe reports to write?

582
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,498
I'm on top of everything.

583
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,001
I see.

584
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:34,405
I'll come again.

585
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:36,441
Don't push yourself.

586
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:37,708
I'm not.

587
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:46,551
EIJI KURISU

588
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:53,024
Oh, I have to see that.

589
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,358
Okay, got it.

590
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,428
<i>So? Are you watching?</i>

591
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,364
I am.

592
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:03,201
Do you like our Hope?

593
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:06,304
I don't know…

594
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,006
<i>Stop!</i>

595
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,710
The weather is nice. Thank you.

596
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,246
<i>Which horse do you like?</i>
<i>I'll buy you a betting ticket.</i>

597
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,381
<i>No need to be polite.</i>

598
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:19,617
<i>Tell me what you think.</i>

599
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,552
<i>I want your opinion.</i>

600
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:30,394
I see.

How long has it…
How many years has it been?

607
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:52,917
No kidding!

608
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:56,420
Are you feeling uneasy?

- Look, they even have drinks.
- I'll get a beer too.

612
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,331
Your lawyer sent this.

613
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:11,035
It's about dividing
our assets in the future.

614
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:18,976
Don't ever think you'll be able
to leave money to your secret child.

Valshare is the clear favorite.

But…

625
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:00,885
But?

707
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:31,328

710
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:37,268
<i>They're side by side!</i>
<i>Side by side! Royal Hope…</i>

711
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:39,970

<i>Everyone is ecstatic!</i>

714
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:49,346
<i>There is thunderous applause!</i>

715
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:53,317
<i>Number One, Royal Hope took the lead</i>
<i>in the center of the track!</i>

716
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:56,654
<i>Number Ten, Valshare,</i>
<i>came up from between horses.</i>

717
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,723
<i>Tokyo Racecourse, Race Ten.</i>

718
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,493
<i>Please wait as we review the footage.</i>

719
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,928
That was good.

720
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:07,998
That was a good race.

721
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:13,871
<i>Tokyo Racecourse, Race Ten.</i>

722
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:19,210
<i>First place, Number Ten.</i>

723
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:21,345
<i>The confirmed result mark has now lit up.</i>

724
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,214
<i>First place is Number Ten, Valshare!</i>

725
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,182
<i>He lived up to his status as favorite.</i>

726
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:28,519
<i>He has brilliantly won the Satsuki Sho</i>
<i>and Japan Derby double crown!</i>

727
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:31,021
<i>- Royal Hope finished second!</i>
- I'm glad.

728
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:34,725
I don't want good memories of this place.

729
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:38,429
This is enough.

730
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,078
Koichi.

731
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:57,014
I must tell you something.

732
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:03,787
<i>Royal Hope, and that Number Ten horse.</i>

733
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,422
<i>A quinella bet, please.</i>

734
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:06,857
A quinella bet, huh?

735
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:10,361
You even guessed that he would lose.

736
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:13,831
<i>You're one heck of a woman.</i>

737
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:17,635
MIKIKO NAKAJO

738
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:23,407
MIKIKO NAKAJO FUNERAL VENUE

739
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,748
Koichi.

740
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:35,419
Yes.

741
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:41,792
He's here.

742
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:51,869
<i>Mr. Kurisu, I have a request.</i>

743
00:42:54,939 --> 00:43:00,511
Please let Koichi and him meet each other.

744
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,248
I'm sorry.

745
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,318
I know this is a selfish request.

746
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:12,122
I would like to offer my condolences,
and apologies.

747
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,025
I am…

748
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,596
from a company called Royal Human.

749
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:21,098
I work as secretary
for the Horse Racing Division.

750
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:22,299
I'm Eiji Kurisu.

751
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,169
Thank you.

752
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:30,574
When she was alive,
your mother entrusted me with a request.

753
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:32,676
I'm here to fulfill it.

754
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:34,345
A request?

755
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:36,847
For you, Koichi,

756
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,050
to meet our company President,

757
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:44,288
Kozo Sanno, who is over there.

758
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,562
We don't intend to cause trouble.

759
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:56,667
After a brief greeting,
we will leave right away.

760
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:03,674
Up until a year ago,
I didn't know anything.

761
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:05,709
I'm sorry.

762
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:07,411
It's fine.

763
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,812
About your future,

764
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:12,116
he'll take care of everything.

765
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:16,787
If you have any problems,
please let him know.

766
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,169
Please accept this.

767
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:02,933
I don't need this.

768
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:10,207
Please don't come and see me again.

769
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:17,848
I know you came all this way, but…

770
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:23,787
We will never meet again.

771
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:25,456
Please leave.

772
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,971
<i>We'll win the Arima.</i>
<i>Then Hope will retire.</i>

773
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:42,106
I'll quit too.

774
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:43,841
<i>Hope is retiring, isn't he?</i>

775
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,677
<i>The man who brought us this far is you.</i>

776
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,946
That's the responsibility
of a man who talked about dreams!
