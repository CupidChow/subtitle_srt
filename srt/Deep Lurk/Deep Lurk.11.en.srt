Is she feeling better?

It's been so chaotic these past couple of days.

10
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,729

I'll return it to Mi Lan tomorrow.

I've loved eating candy since I was little.

My father knew I loved candy.

25
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,630
Every time he came back from a business trip,

26
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,150
no matter how busy he was,

27
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,480
he would always bring me candy.

28
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,190

29
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,470

last time you were taken away by the NBIS,

37

it was all because of us.

38

You should give us a chance to make amends.

39

so please don't refuse.

Miss Mi Lan,

48

your father left with so few belongings.

49
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,810
He lived in Shanghai for so many years,

50
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,750
yet he wasn't influenced by Shanghai people's meticulous lifestyle.

51
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,810
He just grabbed a few things and left.

52
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,510
No.

53
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,600
It's not like that.

00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,950
rough on the outside but refined on the inside.

56
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,190
Don't be fooled by how little he was taking with him.

57
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,350
It was all he needed.

58
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,680
Look.

59
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,230
Dad was still the same as before.

60
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,460
He liked to hide a new bill among a stack of old ones.

61
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,110
When he gave me New Year's money when I was a child,

62
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,310
he did the same thing.

63
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,590
Mom often said

64
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,630
that Dad was the kind of person

65
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,490
who was best at giving surprises.

66
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,410

Did you bring this box back from the police station?

73
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,310
Did they say

74
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,130
they'd catch the murderer who killed my father?

75

That might be difficult.

76

The killer dared to commit murder in broad daylight.

77
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,570

00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,030
If we don't capture anyone alive,

189
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,890
their sacrifice would be in vain.

190
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,140
Of course, you can refuse,

191
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,430
but you will miss a chance

192
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,620
to capture Japanese agents

193
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,350
or rather, a chance to get close to the cipher key.

194
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,380
You're very good at doing business without principal.

195
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,990
I'm only responsible for providing you with

196
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,990
such a choice.

197
00:12:58,990 --> 00:12:59,620
Whether you accept it or not

198
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,910
is your own business.

199
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:02,270
Also,

200
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,370
let me remind you of something.

201
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,080
If you really want to get involved,

202
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,210
don't tell too many people about this.

203
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,180
It'll be very disadvantageous for you.

204
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:09,870
Someone's here!

205
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,930
What are you doing?

206
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,190
The two young masters of the Yun family are so handsome.

207
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:18,660
Right?

208
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,630
I think so, too.

209
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,910
I think Young Master Yun is more handsome.

210
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,870
Haven't you noticed?

211
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,400
His smile is very charming.

212
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,520
I prefer Second Young Master Yun.

213
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,330
He has a mysterious aura about him,

214
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,790
And he's such a gentleman.

215
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,990
He's very graceful,

216
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,110
like a nobleman.

217
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,430
Let's go.

218
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:44,740
You know what?

219
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,270
He just smiled at me.

220
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,930
Look how happy that makes you.

221
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,350
Jingyu.

222
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,510
What was the name of that nurse Dao mentioned last time?

223
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,270
Mi Lan.

224
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:10,490
Right.

225
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,790
How is that girl?

226
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,390
I heard she's quite nice.

227
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,520
She's helped both young masters a lot.

228
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,580
Old Madam,

229
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,270
why are you asking about that?

230
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,190
Hongqi is not young anymore.

231
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,310
I think it's time for him to start a family.

232
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,270
Old Madam,

233
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,430
our two young masters

234
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,150
are both one in a million.

235
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:33,150
You don't need to worry about their marriages.

236
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,510
Old Madam.

237
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,320
Why did you suddenly come back?

238
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,830
Didn't you attend the wine reception

239
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,710
together with Hongqi and Shen?

240
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,570
It's like this.

241
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,910
Second Young Master asked me to take you somewhere first.

242
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,000
Please come with me.

243
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,790
Now?

244
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,470
-Well…
-Come on.

245
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:14,960
Keep a close eye.

246
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,590
If you spot anyone attempting to enter Yun's Residence,

247
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,470
apprehend them immediately.

248
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,200
Understood.

249
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,550
I've changed both the quilt and the sheets.

250
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,830
And I've cleaned the room again.

251
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:36,960
It's very clean now.

252
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,160
Thank you, Ms. Yuan.

253
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,710
You can go about your business now.

254
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,350
I'll call you if I need anything.

255
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,150
Alright then.

256
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,120
Old Madam,

257
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,470
if you need anything,

258
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,670
just call me anytime.

259
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,550
Okay.

260
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:50,910
Old Madam,

261
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,310
Second Young Master said

262
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,350
that tonight,

263
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,150
you and Jingyu will stay here for the night.

264
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,000
He'll come to pick you up first thing in the morning.

265
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,460
What about the two of them?

266
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:02,010
There will be thieves breaking into our house tonight.

267
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,230
But don't worry,

268
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,670
Young Master and Second Young Master won't be the ones who will catch the thieves.

269
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,470
It'll be someone else.

270
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,000
They won't be in any danger.

271
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:08,910
Alright.

272
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,230
Hurry up and head back.

273
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,720
Keep an eye on those two for me.

274
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,960
Certainly, Old Madam.

275
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,630
Jingyu,

276
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,470
take good care of the Old Madam.

277
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:14,930
I will.

278
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,110
Old Madam,

279
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,040
let's go sit over there for a while.

280
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:05,740
After him!

281
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:43,350
[Changsha Hotel]

282
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,830
Minister Yang's speech was excellent.

283
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,910
I'm sure you all feel the same way.

284
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,100
As for me,

285
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:54,800
I'm here to state the position of the Changsha Chamber of Commerce.

286
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,030
We, the business community,

287
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,790
are very willing to respond to Minister Yang's call

288
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,470
and actively contribute funds

289
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,630
to purchase medicine for the soldiers on the front lines.

290
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:06,950
It's our small contribution to the war effort.

291
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:15,190
Ten thousand? That much?

292
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,830
That's too generous.

293
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,030
That's ten thousand!

294
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,600
Ladies and gentlemen,

295
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,750
I assume you are all aware

296
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,430
that my father has recently passed away.

297
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:36,030
My brother and I should be in mourning,

298
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,910
and it's not appropriate for us to be ostentatious.

299
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,110
However, before my father's passing,

300
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,240
he repeatedly admonished us brothers

301
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,770
that without a country, there can be no home.

302
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,830
No matter what circumstances we face,

303
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,560
we must always put our country before our family.

304
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,500
As a member of the Yun family,

305
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,320
I dare not forget my late father's teachings.

306
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,200
Nor do I dare dishonor the Yun family's traditions.

307
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,630
Taking this opportunity tonight,

308
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,160
on behalf of the Yun family,

309
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,150
I would like to express our gratitude

310
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,080
to the soldiers on the front lines.

311
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,950
We hope this will help the soldiers on the front lines…

312
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:14,750
One hundred thousand!

313
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,430
get through this cold winter.

314
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:16,990
One hundred thousand!

315
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,120
I also wish everyone

316
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,230
an enjoyable evening.

317
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,710
The Yun family has found a worthy successor.

318
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,510
Indeed.

319
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,710
There's a reason why the Yun family has thrived in Changsha

320
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,070
for a hundred years.

321
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,230
It's precisely because of these righteous family values

322
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,960
that they have built an unshakeable foundation.

323
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,230
Where is Miss Li?

324
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,270
Didn't you say

325
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,190
you would arrange for us

326
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,190
to spend a lovely evening together?

327
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,980
Deputy Commander Jin, don't be impatient.

328
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,190
Miss Li might be hiding out of shyness.

329
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,070
Rest assured.

330
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,040
I'll go find her for you right away.

331
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,640
Calm down.

332
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,570
Hurry up and go!

333
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,310
Slow down.

334
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,550
Get in the car!

335
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,460
Hongqi, wait for me there!

336
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,190
Be careful!

337
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,650
We're even now.

338
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,510
What's even?

339
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,990
The old score of you interfering with my official duties

340
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,590
is wiped clean now.

341
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,760
When did I ever interfere with your official duties?

342
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,110
You're really something, you know that?

343
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,710
I saved your life, after all.

344
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,000
Cut the crap.

345
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,200
Who asked you to save me?

346
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,460
If you didn't want to save me, then don't.

[Kudo Hishiko, Codename Onitetsu, Japanese Agent]

349
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:16,690
You arranged for someone to go to the Yun's Residence tonight?

350
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,780
You wanted to get the codebook from Yun Hongshen?

351
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,530
You fool.

352
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,950
It's something so important.

353
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,950
Do you think he would keep it at home?

354
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,830
I just wanted to try my luck.

355
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,400
It would be best if we could find it,

356
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,550
but if not, we could also eliminate

357
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,870
the old lady of the Yun family.

358
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:37,800
This would surely throw Yun Hongshen into disarray.

359
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,750
Can you use your brain

360
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,910
when you take action?

361
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,010

365
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,390
Yes.

366
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,830
His value is high.

367
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,270

That's impossible.

372
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:11,980
He only answers to me.

373
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,350
This is an order.

374
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:20,740
It seems you haven't taken General Okamura's words

375
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,720
to heart.

376
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,200
Help! I'm being molested!

377
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,860
-I'm being molested!
-Mi Lan?

378
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,530
That day at your doorstep,

379
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,540
if you hadn't interfered,

380
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,190
we would've caught Yun Hongshen by now.

381
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,000
Perhaps

382
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,460
we would have obtained the codebook as well.

383
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,800
You must be dreaming.

384
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,750
I doubt

385
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,100
if you have the ability to run a spy network in Changsha.

386
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:01,950
Miss Kudo.

387
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,310
Am I wrong?

388
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,470
Do you think if you catch Yun Hongshen

389
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,560
and torture him,

390
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,580
he'll hand over the codebook to you?

391
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,300
You're too naive.

392
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:14,150
He would rather die than give you the codebook.

393
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,670
It doesn't matter if he dies.

394
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,750
If he's dead,

395
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,150
the value of the codebook will disappear, too.

396
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,630
I'll find another chance to destroy the cipher key.

397
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,630
Then, this intelligence will be cut off at the source.

398
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:30,750
You're so stupid that it's even impressive.

399
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:33,150
Do you think Yun Hongshen would

400
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,710
leave no backup plan, like you?

401
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,990
How can you be so sure

402
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:39,090
that he hasn't entrusted the codebook to someone else?

403
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,270
I'm stupid?

404
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,550
As an old Chinese saying goes,

405
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,950
when I entered this profession,

406
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,390
you were still suckling at home.

407
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,260
The fact is,

408
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,250
you haven't put General Okamura at ease.

409
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,290
Otherwise,

410
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,040
he wouldn't have sent me here.

411
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,470
Very well,

412
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,470
I'd like to see

413
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,950
your methods, Miss Kudo.

414
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,910
I presume you

415
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,510
can change our difficult situation in one fell swoop.

416
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:11,510
You must be confident of getting the codebook, right?

417
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:14,360
You have no right to question my course of action.

418
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,880
I'll say this one last time:

419
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,070
Don't even think about targeting Yun Hongshen.

420
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,270
No questions allowed.

421
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,830
No secret moves on your own.

422
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:25,040
And that well-connected informant of yours—

423
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,110
you'd better tell him to be careful.

424
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:29,240
He's been far too active lately.

425
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,000
If the NBIS discovers him,

426
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,710
it would be nothing if you all get caught in one swoop.

427
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,550
But if this plan is affected,

428
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,740
all our efforts will go down the drain.

429
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:56,470
I'm sorry.

430
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,070
I shouldn't have gone to the Changsha Hotel without permission.

431
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,750
I'm willing to accept any punishment.

432
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,110
You disobeyed my orders and went out on your own,

433
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,170
and exposed yourself so thoroughly.

434
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,360
Why did you even bother coming back?

435
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,870
You, as you are now,

436
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,380
are more valuable dead than alive.

437
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,120
Please give me one more chance.

438
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,920
If you're discovered again,

439
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,660
don't bother coming back alive.

440
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,200
Get out.

441
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,340
Yun Hongshen and Wen Yeming are not to be trifled with.

442
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,950
It's only a matter of time before Kawashima is discovered.

443
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:41,030
You'd better be careful when you act.

444
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,030
Don't leave any more evidence behind.

445
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:46,350
Wen Yeming and Yun Hongshen have been getting close lately.

446
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,470
This isn't good for us.

447
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,950
This is not your concern.

448
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,070
Let me emphasize once again.

449
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,670
You must act under my orders.

450
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,240
The killer fired from here.

451
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,220
It was a close-range shot.

452
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,550
One shot, instant death.

453
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,740
And your agents didn't even put up a fight.

454
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,400
This suggests the killer was someone they knew.

455
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,350
It was an inside job.

456
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,550
Are you trying to lecture me?

457
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,830
Who sent you here?

458
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,270
Madam.

459
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,910
That person was shot in the left leg.

460
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,020
It's all messed up,

461
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,110
and there's even blood.

462
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,050
It's really unlucky.

463
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,100
Watch what you say.

464
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,630
Who did they die for?

465
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,310
Don't misunderstand.

466
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,110
My brother didn't mean it that way.

467
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,750
After all, there's an elderly person at home.

468
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,410
Regarding this kind of thing,

469
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,950
there's more or less some taboo.

470
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,870
All the people in your family are the same.

471
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,790
You have no qualms about using others,

472
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,470
and after you're done using them,

473
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,330
you kick them away without mercy.

474
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,520
Is that how the Yun family does things?

475
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,400
I understand you're upset,

476
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,560
but what does this have to do with our Yun family?

477
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,830
How have I used you?

478
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,610
I hope you always remember

479
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,350
the special agents who sacrificed

480
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,810
themselves for you today.

481
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:05,010
I'm also very sorry about your colleagues' sacrifice.

482
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,030
Of course,

483
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,490
I will always remember their names, too.

484
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,200
But this wasn't caused by me.

485
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,940
The killers are Japanese.

486
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,830
They came to steal the codebook.

487
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,540
We need to work together against the common enemy.

488
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,620
Work together?

489
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,910
Are you sure you can do that?

490
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,630
Isn't that what I'm doing right now?

491
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,230
I've already provided clues

492
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,010
about the killer who murdered Myna.

493
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,070
That's not enough.

494
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,720
I need you to share

495
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,780
all the information you know with me.

496
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,870
The timing isn't right yet.

497
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,500
There's a mole inside your organization.

498
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,960
I won't feel at ease until this mole is found.

499
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,440
To put it bluntly,

500
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,110
you still don't trust me.

501
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,840
It's not that I don't trust you.

502
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,990
I don't trust that mole.

503
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,110
He's in the shadows while you're in the open.

504
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,310
If you accidentally fall into his trap,

505
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,320
forget about the information,

506
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,370
even you could be in danger.

507
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,830
I've said before,

508
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,070
cooperation requires sincerity.

509
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,240
If I find out

510
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,070
that at a crucial moment,

511
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,750
you've concealed important evidence from me,

512
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,750
I will reconsider

513
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,550
our cooperative relationship.

514
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,590
As you wish.

515
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,710
Anyway, even if we're fighting our own battles,

516
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,910
I won't lose, either.

517
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:18,430
This money is for the families of these people.

518
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,510
I know.

519
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,270
People like you—

520
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,150
if you die at the hands of the enemy,

521
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,550
it might be considered a great honor, right?

522
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,280
But what about their families?

523
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,790
It means losing the breadwinner of the household.

524
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,790
That's the beginning of a hard life.

525
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,700
Having some extra money to survive

526
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,550
wouldn't hurt.

527
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:42,960
Don't you agree?

528
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:46,750
Thank you.

529
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,040
You're welcome.

530
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:58,630
Have the surveillance measures for Mi Lan's family been implemented?

531
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,490
Yes, they have.

532
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,550
Madam,

533
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:03,030
Mi Lan seems so delicate and fragile.

534
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:04,190
She's also very timid.

535
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,350
Even when she was so frightened, we couldn't get much out of her.

536
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,810
She should be okay, right?

537
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,640
If she's not that simple,

538
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,700
she must be a really tough character.

539
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,960
We can't let our guard down.

540
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:15,720
Understood.

541
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,670
I heard that the two young masters from the Yun family

542
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,110
stole the show today.

543
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,070
Miss Mi Lan

544
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,550
might have actually fallen for one of them.

545
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,810
That's why she's keeping her mouth shut.

546
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,350
But to be honest,

547
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,150
these two young masters from the Yun family,

548
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,280
no matter which one,

549
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,960
are both worth falling for.

550
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:35,670
Someone's here!

551
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:36,730
What're you doing?

552
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,350
I prefer Second Young Master Yun.

553
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:47,160
He has a mysterious aura about him,

554
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,590
And he's such a gentleman.

555
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,750
He's very graceful,

556
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:51,910
like a nobleman.

557
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,780
What is all this nonsense?

558
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,370
Just focus on driving.

559
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,200
It seems this killer is very vigilant.

560
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:10,560
You'll need to find another breakthrough in the future.

561
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,550
I've already asked my brother to check with the major foreign firms

562
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,750
to investigate the supply channels for Punch cigars.

563
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,750
So many people were smoking them last night.

564
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,610
They must have received a large shipment recently.

565
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,590
Remember,

566
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,390
you must investigate secretly.

567
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:26,320
The killer must not become aware of your intentions.

568
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:27,270
I understand.

569
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,990
Once my brother has some news,

570
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,710
we'll discuss our next move.

571
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:35,190
Shen,

572
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,570
open it and take a look.

573
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,990
This was what you asked your father

574
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,430
two months ago.

575
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,620
I happened to be in Hong Kong at that time.

576
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,790
Your father asked me

577
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,640
to have a pair custom-made for him.

578
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,770
They just arrived a couple of days ago.

579
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:05,870
Dad.

580
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,810
Do these cufflinks look good?

581
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,080
They're alright.

582
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,860
So cool.

583
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:12,960
Dad,

584
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:14,310
can you buy me a pair?

585
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,830
It's not impossible,

586
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,310
but you'll have to wait until you can

587
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:19,330
complete missions independently.

588
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:20,929
After you become a Lone Hero,

589
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:22,730
they will be your reward from me.

590
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:25,330
I hope you can become a Lone Hero.

591
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:32,750
However,

592
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,630
I can't give them to you yet.

593
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,830
Auntie has come down.

594
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,880
Why are you here so early?

595
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:43,110
Shen.

596
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,070
Grandma.

597
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,150
I woke up early today.

598
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,630
Did you sleep well last night?

599
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,790
Very well.

600
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:52,409
What happened to your ear?

601
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,810
It's just a small scratch.

602
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,150
There was a thief in the house last night.

603
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,990
Did you fight with the thief?

604
00:34:59,190 --> 00:34:59,990
No.

605
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:00,830
Rest assured.

606
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,710
It was just a false alarm.

607
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,750
At my age,

608
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,750
what I hope for most

609
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:09,390
is for their generation to be safe and sound.

610
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:11,190
Your safety is all that matters.

611
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,030
Grandma,

612
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,350
let's go home then.

613
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,330
We can go home now?

614
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,130
It's fine now?

615
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:19,250
We'll take our leave, then.

616
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,310
-Okay.
-Thank you.

617
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,310
Let me see you out.

618
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:22,650
No need.

619
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,890
You're up so early.

620
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:38,710
Why?

621
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:41,030
Don't you want to sleep a bit longer?

622
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:47,110
Being with you

623
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:50,840
makes me realize how fleeting a night can be.

624
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:54,550
Commander Jin, you've met many charming people,

625
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,480
and I'm certainly not the only one.

626
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,870
You men,

627
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:00,670
you're all sweet talk when you're just playing around,

628
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,990
spewing flattery as if it costs nothing.

629
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,360
Once the passion fades,

630
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,950
you forget us in an instant.

631
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,510
It's tragic for us women.

632
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,870
Once we misplace our affection,

633
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:14,110
our lives are ruined.

634
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,510
Miss Miaohan,

635
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,310
rest assured.

636
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:21,190
I, Jin Guoqiang, am absolutely not that kind of person.

637
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,120
My feelings for you, Miss Miaohan,

638
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,200
are clear to heaven and earth.

639
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,030
I hope so.

640
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:30,470
It's getting late.

641
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,280
I have to go.

642
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,310
What's wrong?

643
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,040
I'll come see you again tonight.

644
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,010
Let me accompany you to work.

645
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,030
Well...

646
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,920
I'm afraid that's not possible.

647
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:55,790
So much for "clear to heaven and earth,"

648
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:58,050
you won't even do this small thing for me.

649
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,230
Where I work

650
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,070
is all about guns and cannons.

651
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,160
Why are you coming with me?

652
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,350
I'm just curious.

653
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,710
I just want to see

654
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,580
how our Changsha City Defense Command

655
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,940
looks like?

656
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:26,000
Miss Miaohan, you're truly one of a kind.

657
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,110
Other young ladies just like to go shopping for clothes,

658
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,050
have coffee,

659
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,590
or watch movies.

660
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,700
But you

661
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:39,040
want to see the Changsha City Defense Command.

662
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:42,870
To be honest with you,

663
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:43,990
our film studio

664
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:44,910
is preparing to make

665
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,270
a movie about defending Changsha.

666
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:46,990
I'm just

667
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:49,050
trying to experience life, you know.

668
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,640
Making a movie?

669
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,890
What are you thinking?

670
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:55,280
This is war. It's the resistance against the Japanese invasion.

671
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,590
It's not a show!

672
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,420
Commander.

673
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:03,970
The acting and filmmaking

674
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,910
are also to inspire the resistance.

675
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:09,390
Can't you be a little more flexible?

676
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,710
I see.

677
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,360
You seduced me into bed

678
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:22,110
just for this?

679
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,860
To be honest, it's absolutely impossible.

680
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,350
Who knows if, among your people,

681
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,870
there are Japanese spies?

682
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,340
If the city's defense secrets are leaked,

683
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,590
you'll lose your head. Do you want that?

684
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:35,390
How can there be Japanese spies?

685
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,540
You think too much.

686
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,310
We're just acting for a movie.

687
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,550
My boss told me

688
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,470
if I can pull this off,

689
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,960
I'll be the female lead.

690
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:48,910
But if I can't…

691
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:51,720
What do you mean?

692
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:55,530
You think you can threaten me with that?

693
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,230
Let me tell you something,

694
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:03,020
I've seen this kind of thing many times before.

695
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,950
I, Jin Guoqiang, have slept with women before, and I don't care.

696
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,750
I've had my fun, and that's that.

697
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,750
Don't think that just because you're a celebrity,

698
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,150
you can do anything to me.

699
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:14,510
Be careful, or I might charge you as a Japanese spy.

700
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,320
Don't be afraid.

701
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,200
As long as you behave,

702
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,290
nothing will happen to you.

703
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:29,710
Go to sleep.

704
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:57,740
It's me.

705
00:39:58,330 --> 00:39:59,590
He didn't take me home.

706
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,870
I tentatively brought up

707
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,280
the idea that I'd accompany him to work,

708
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,140
but he immediately became alert.

709
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,830
Forget about the city defense map;

710
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,630
he didn't even tell me

711
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,630
which way his office door opens.

712
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,960
It seems this person is not easy to crack.

713
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,290
That's not even the most important thing.

714
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,550
I think

715
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,310
he's starting to suspect me.

716
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:20,870
I understand.

717
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,030
You can go back.

718
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:22,990
Okay.

719
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,680
[Military Hospital]

720
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:43,630
Mr. Li,

721
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:46,110
I'm here to pick up the mail for our department.

722
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:46,670
Yes, there are some.

723
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,400
I've kept them all safe for you.

724
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,340
Mi Lan,

725
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,590
you must take good care of yourself.

726
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:55,060
Don't let your departed loved ones worry about you.

727
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,060
Thank you, Mr. Li.

728
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,550
Then, you'd better get going.

729
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,390
I'll get back to work then.

730
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:58,870
Okay.

731
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:45,980
[Station Chief's Office]

732
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,630
You let someone escape right under your nose.

733
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,110
If Yun Hongshen didn't save you yesterday,

734
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,640
you wouldn't even be alive.

735
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:57,830
I'm sorry, Sir.

736
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,080
It was my negligence.

737
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:02,790
People were sent to ambush Yun Hongshen's house,

738
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:04,390
but we didn't catch the thief.

739
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,450
Instead, I lost several of my agents.

740
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:09,960
Yesterday's operation was a complete disaster.

741
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:11,910
It's because of my incompetence.

742
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:12,750
Please punish me, Sir.

743
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,010
I do want to punish you,

744
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,630
but who's going to work for me if I do?

745
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,510
However, Yun Hongshen

746
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,060
has indeed impressed me.

747
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,390
He even anticipated that the Japanese would

748
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:26,840
conduct a surprise raid on his house.

749
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,040
He's indeed a talent.

750
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:31,610
If such a talent falls into the enemy's hands,

751
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,360
it would be terrifying.

752
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,800
Let me tell you,

753
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:42,110
my focus on Yun Hongshen

754
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:44,510
is entirely because of your incompetence.

755
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,680
Learn from your mistakes and be brave.

756
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,360
Don't let me down again.

757
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:49,790
Understood.

758
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,230
Young Master,

759
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,870
you asked me to inquire about those cigars.

760
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:53,670
I've got some leads.

761
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:54,310
Go on.

762
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:56,920
Those high-end cigars are hard to come by.

763
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,150
There's only one supplier in the entire city.

764
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:01,630
It's the Lifeng Boutique Gallery at the Changsha Hotel.
