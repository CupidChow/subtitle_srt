[Episode 22]

3
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:39,820
Look.

4
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,030
This is it.

5
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,910
Do you still remember which company

6
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,950
the rickshaw belonged to

7
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:51,979
when you came back?

8
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:56,789
No.

[Military Hospital]

10
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,310
Go and find

11
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,070
Mi Lan's former classmates

12
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,910
and teachers from nursing school.

13
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,190
Use her current photo to confirm

14
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,289
if she's the same person.

15
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,340
If she is,

16
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,240
dig deeper.

17
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,370
Look into her past—

18
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,510
find out if she had any unusual experiences

19
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,350
or connections with specific individuals.

20
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,270
The more detailed, the better.

21
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,710
You suspect she's the killer?

22
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,510
This woman has always made me uneasy.

23
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,720
After what happened this time,

24
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,660
it has only strengthened my suspicions.

25
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:25,840
This woman

26
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,680
is definitely not just a nurse.

27
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:31,829
I understand.

28
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,230
That's why you tapped her phone

29
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,280
and placed surveillance near her home.

30
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,430
Track down the rickshaw driver

31
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,270
who took Mi Lan back to the Military Hospital.

32
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,510
Bring him to me.

33
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,230
Until I see him,

34
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,790
make sure no one else contacts him.

35
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,750
Yes.

36
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,380
Niu Erhong's entire family moved out overnight.

37
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,050
They didn't even pack properly

38
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,160
and didn't inform anyone.

39
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,150
Definitely suspicious.

40
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,150
Take a look at this, sir.

41
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,830
I did instruct Li Liang

42
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,400
to routinely track and monitor

43
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,980
officers at the division level—

44
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,540
that's part of our standard procedures.

45
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,590
I didn't report it to you

46
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,070
but look at these photos.

47
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,510
I didn't authorize Li Liang to take these,

48
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,350
and they definitely weren't taken by him.

49
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,680
Chinese calligraphy follows rules of horizontal and vertical alignment,

50
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,750
and each character has a set form.

51
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,200
But individual handwriting styles vary,

52
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,430
which is the basis for handwriting analysis.

53
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,579
It's the same with photography.

54
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,360
Different photographers

55
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,550
have distinct styles and perspectives.

56
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,030
Look at this photo—

57
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,829
it's one Li Liang took.

58
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,550
Now compare it to this one.

59
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,790
If you examine closely, you'll see

60
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,760
these were

61
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,590
clearly taken by two different people.

62
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:50,950
Indeed.

63
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,760
Photos taken by a trained agent are distinct

64
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,520
from those taken by an ordinary person.

65
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,230
It seems you and Yun Hongshen are on the same page.

66
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,440
If the photo he found

67
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,230
hadn't been destroyed,

68
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,310
we might've uncovered more clues.

69
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,300
We still don't know who the photographer is,

70
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,200
but I believe

71
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,510
if we investigate further,

72
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,260
they're bound to slip up.

73
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,280
Who else had access

74
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,400
to Yun Hongshen's last photo?

75
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,510
You, me,

76
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,510
and a few division chiefs.

77
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,579
It seems the mole

78
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,370
is among us.

79
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,150
That's right.

80
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,710
Each of them is capable.

81
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,280
Qu Wenzhi's defection,

82
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,950
along with the subsequent events,

83
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,110
ties back to them in varying degrees.

84
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,310
Who do you suspect more?

85
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,510
Does Ling Han seem likely?

86
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,750
Chief,

87
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,670
I don't have a particular inclination right now.

88
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,350
Honestly,

89
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,030
it doesn't matter who seems likely.

90
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,909
What's critical is solid evidence.

91
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,310
Ling Han has been particularly aggressive in his recent work.

92
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,510
I have my reservations about him,

93
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,150
but that doesn't necessarily make him the mole.

94
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,630
Also, I believe the tension between us

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,710
is likely part of the mole's strategy.

96
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,030
Zhu,

97
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,470
as always, your thinking is sharp.

98
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,670
Ling Han may be clever,

99
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,310
but he's not steady enough in his actions.

100
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,830
Zhu,

101
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,470
I'm sorry this situation has caused you trouble.

102
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,290
Chief, it's nothing.

103
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,030
We all encounter unpleasant situations.

104
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,440
If we took everything to heart,

105
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,150
we couldn't do this job.

106
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,350
That's the mindset of a true Deputy Chief—

107
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:22,950
admirable.

108
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,310
What's the matter?

109
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,310
Chief,

110
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,430
what do you think of leveraging

111
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,750
Yun Hongshen's informant in Shanghai?

112
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,130
Stirring up the situation

113
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,350
might actually be part of the mole's plan.

114
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,950
The more confusing things appear,

115
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,530
the harder it will be for you to pinpoint the mole.

116
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,950
There's another way

117
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,720
to identify the mole:

118
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,550
they'll definitely

119
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,710
be interested in

120
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,870
Yun Hongshen's mysterious informant.

121
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,020
That's a good point.

122
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,270
You see?

123
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,640
That guy's definitely hiding something.

124
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,630
I think we should interrogate him again.

125
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,150
Let's go.

126
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,070
Whether or not this was orchestrated by Gui,

127
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,270
this time Happy House is finished.

128
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,310
Think about it—

129
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,470
the victim was Old Master Yun's widow,

130
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,100
and she died so gruesomely.

131
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,750
Do you think Old Master Yun's

132
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,680
prominent students will let this slide?

133
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,070
I think even if

134
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,680
Happy House doesn't go under completely, it'll take a huge hit.

135
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,350
There has to be a scapegoat to satisfy the authorities' anger.

136
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:33,710
Indeed.

137
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,409
Until this case is resolved,

138
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,120
there's no way Happy House can reopen.

139
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,350
And those who were

140
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,570
in business with Bai Qingkui?

141
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,380
They'll likely suffer too.

142
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,100
I think the Bai Clan and Happy House

143
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:47,120
are about to become history.

144
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,750
True.

145
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:51,950
Captain Tang.

146
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,070
I have some business to attend to.

147
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,870
You go ahead with your work.

148
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:02,690
Captain Tang.

149
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,190
Brother-in-law,

150
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,670
I swear it wasn't me.

151
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,870
I swear to the heavens!

152
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,550
I really want to help you,

153
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,870
but this case isn't under my jurisdiction.

154
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,120
I can't intervene.

155
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,560
If you truly wanted to help,

156
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,750
you could always find a way.

157
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,550
Brother-in-law.

158
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:15,870
brother-in-law.

159
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,830
We're in the same boat now.

160
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,510
If I go down,

161
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,830
it won't look good for you either.

162
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,780
What are you implying?

163
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,550
Who's in the same boat as you?

164
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,710
I mean...

165
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,550
Captain,

166
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:29,920
the Director needs to see you.

167
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,950
Seems urgent.

168
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,830
You should go over there.

169
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:32,590
Alright.

170
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,800
I have something to attend to.

171
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,670
We'll discuss this matter later.

172
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,240
Brother-in-law!

173
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,080
I think even if

174
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,350
Happy House doesn't go under completely, it'll take a huge hit.

175
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:40,909
True.

176
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,990
至少在这件事情调查清楚之前

177
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,670
there's no way Happy House can reopen.

178
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,760
And those who were

179
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,909
in business with Bai Qingkui?

180
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,710
They'll likely suffer too.

181
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,070
Mengying.

182
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,150
Why are you here at this hour?

183
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,270
Is it because you feel uneasy being alone?

184
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,710
Come in, quickly.

185
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,750
Have a seat.

186
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:27,860
Why are you just standing there?

187
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,450
Isn't it time for the old lady's medicine?

188
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:33,539
No rush.

189
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,070
It still needs to cool for another half hour.

190
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,870
Here, have some water.

191
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,270
You look so pale. What's wrong?

192
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,630
Madam Yun has been poisoned to death.

193
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,300
The NBIS suspects it was me.

194
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,620
They want to shut down Happy House.

195
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,630
Master's lifetime of effort will be wasted.

196
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,790
Mengying,

197
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,930
I swear on my life.

198
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,390
It wasn't me!

199
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,030
Who would be so vile?

200
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,150
Old Madam Yun was such a kind person.

201
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,510
Whoever poisoned her

202
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,830
is sure to get their comeuppance!

203
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,150
Jin Gui,

204
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,030
don't worry.

205
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,340
When Tang comes back,

206
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,950
I'll ask him to figure something out for you.

207
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,110
Rest assured.

208
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,750
You didn't do it,

209
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,070
so there's nothing to fear.

210
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,270
Mengying.

211
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,830
Captain Tang

212
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,350
has to shoulder it with me.

213
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,150
Listen to yourself.

214
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,270
When you run into trouble,

215
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,350
Tang helps out—

216
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,440
that's for the sake of

217
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,670
the bond we've built over the years.

218
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,550
But asking him to bear the blame with you?

219
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,550
That's going too far.

220
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,950
I'm the real owner of Zhang's pharmacy.

221
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,390
What?

222
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,850
Are you two acting together to fool me?

223
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,990
Was that incident before

224
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,710
all part of a trap you set to trick me?

225
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,020
Yes.

226
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,390
Jin Gui, are you even human?

227
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,830
You even set me up?

228
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,390
Let me tell you the truth.

229
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,790
I tampered with

230
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,150
the documents you signed.

231
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,470
What you invested in wasn't Zhang's pharmacy—

232
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,820
it was Happy House.

233
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,910
Why would you do this?

234
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,060
To have leverage over Captain Tang.

235
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,210
Something to save myself when it counts.

236
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:21,870
And look—

237
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,660
it's coming in handy now.

238
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,910
You lunatic!

239
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,350
Tang hasn't wronged you.

240
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,110
Are you trying to destroy him?

241
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,670
Mengying,

242
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,550
what's wrong?

243
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,790
Mom, it's nothing.

244
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:48,240
[Changsha Police Station]

245
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,350
Mrs. Tang.

246
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,150
You were looking for me?

247
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,990
What's the matter?

248
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,150
Huang,

249
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,390
let me ask you something.

250
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,690
Is Happy House doomed?

251
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,960
Is there no hope for recovery?

252
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,030
Mrs. Tang,

253
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,520
I know about your connection with Mrs. Jin.

254
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,150
But let me warn you—

255
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,670
stay out of this.

256
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,230
Anyone who gets involved will suffer for it.

257
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,870
Did a high-ranking official of Changsha

258
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,920
flee to Shanghai to become a traitor?

259
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,780
Don't even mention that.

260
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,110
The NBIS is investigating it.

261
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,190
And that incident

262
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,550
is linked to Happy House.

263
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,190
All those who had dealings with Happy House

264
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,460
are avoiding it like the plague,

265
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,110
afraid of being implicated.

266
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:29,860
Jin Gui...

267
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,870
If Jin Gui turns herself in,

268
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,940
can she save Happy House?

269
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,610
That depends on what she's willing to reveal.

270
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,060
If she spills something big enough,

271
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,900
not only could Happy House survive,

272
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,990
it might even

273
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,470
thrive in the future—

274
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,350
make a fortune.

275
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,510
What counts as something big?

276
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,830
For example,

277
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,180
who helped that official escape?

278
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,470
Mrs. Tang.

279
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,310
Mrs. Tang.

280
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,470
Are you alright, Mrs. Tang?

281
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,350
Why don't you come in and have some water?

282
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:06,670
I'm fine.

283
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:08,990
I'm fine.

284
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,190
Oh, and listen—

285
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:11,910
don't tell Tang

286
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,110
anything about me

287
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,070
coming to see you.

288
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,470
Promise me, you won't tell him.

289
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,190
Alright.

290
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,350
Okay.

291
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,960
Okay.

292
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:31,340
[Yun Residence]

293
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,870
Kudo Hishiko,

294
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,150
Yun Hongqi's emotions

295
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,720
are not your concern.

296
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,350
What you need to focus on now

297
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,630
is playing the role of Mi Lan well.

298
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,910
He can feel sad and distressed,

299
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,310
but you can't.

300
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:07,680
Young Masters,

301
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,790
Miss Mi Lan is here.

302
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,310
Yun Hongshen's gaze carries a hint of hostility.

303
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,750
Has he started to suspect something?

304
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,150
Remember,

305
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,550
you are Mi Lan.

306
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,230
Today's performance

307
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,310
must go on.

308
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:05,390
Hongshen,

309
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:06,890
what happened just now?

310
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,090
It was Mi Lan.

311
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,480
Mi Lan did it?

312
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,420
Grandma must have accidentally

313
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,380
discovered some flaws in Mi Lan,

314
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,070
so Mi Lan silenced her.

315
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,030
I never would have thought

316
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,650
Mi Lan was a Japanese spy.

317
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:25,620
Uncle Yang,

318
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,340
you don't know

319
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,040
how much I doubted myself

320
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,350
when I came home

321
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,690
and saw Grandma.

322
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,120
I felt deeply unsure—

323
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,270
unsure whether I had

324
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,800
what it takes to stand

325
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:48,950
against Kunwu,

326
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,390
unsure whether

327
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,900
I could fulfill my father's

328
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,290
unfinished mission.

329
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,150
I felt like everything I had done was a complete mess.

330
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,350
Today's situation

331
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,880
is entirely my fault.

332
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,110
Hongshen.

333
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,730
Don't doubt yourself.

334
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,390
You've already become

335
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,620
an exceptionally outstanding fighter.

336
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,830
The calmness and patience you used to lack—

337
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,380
you now possess.

338
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,920
More importantly,

339
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,490
you've developed a broader perspective.

340
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,900
In the context of the national struggle against Japan,

341
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,140
you've learned to set aside personal grievances.

342
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,720
That's why I firmly believe

343
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,430
you will successfully complete the mission

344
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,900
Muzhi left behind.

345
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,650
If Muzhi were still here

346
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,260
and saw the progress you've made,

347
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,200
he'd be incredibly proud.

348
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,119
If I'd discovered Mi Lan's issue earlier,

349
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,990
Grandma wouldn't have been harmed.

350
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,300
This is all my fault.

351
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,680
Hongshen,

352
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:26,359
I understand the pain

353
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,830
and the guilt you're feeling

354
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,480
because

355
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,760
I feel the same.

356
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,070
Aunt Yun

357
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,550
was such

358
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,240
a respectable elder.

359
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,090
She gave me so much

360
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,270
warmth and support as I grew up.

361
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,400
When Muzhi was dying,

362
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,810
he entrusted her care to me,

363
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,700
but I failed.

364
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,390
I let both Muzhi

365
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,850
and Aunt Yun down.

366
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,200
Uncle Yang,

367
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,420
don't blame yourself.

368
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,400
I know you did your best.

369
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,330
Let's take those words

370
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,800
to encourage each other—

371
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,800
this is no time for self-reproach.

372
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,660
Based on what we know so far,

373
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:46,620
Mi Lan

374
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,380
being Onitetsu seems highly likely.

375
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,520
So, your decision not to act against her for now was right.

376
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,440
She might be our

377
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,470
best chance to find Kunwu.

378
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,590
However, one thing

379
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,880
deeply unsettles me—

380
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,380
Myna stole intelligence from the Japanese,

381
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,270
yet his daughter turned out to be a Japanese spy.

382
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,030
This is too strange.

383
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:08,860
Uncle Yang,

384
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,870
there's something I've been thinking about.

385
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,470
Why would my father risk his life

386
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,440
to get that message out?

387
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,230
What exactly was the message?

388
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,360
What was he suspicious of?

389
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,500
Hongshen,

390
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,590
you truly are smart.

391
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,870
Muzhi would be proud of you.

392
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,470
But we've

393
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,840
already started investigating that matter.

394
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,550
You should shift your focus elsewhere—

395
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,210
Mi Lan should be your top priority moving forward.

396
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:44,960
Understood.

397
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,430
Uncle Yang,

398
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,420
I'd like to

399
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,880
formally join the Party.

400
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,030
You've figured it out?

401
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,450
I've had that suspicion for a while.

402
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,780
Your father has always been my greatest role model.

403
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,470
I trust that

404
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,010
the faith he chose to follow

405
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:10,240
with such conviction

406
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,230
must be the right one.

407
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,280
Uncle Yang,

408
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:17,980
do you think I'm qualified to join the Party?

409
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:19,910
Of course.

410
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,870
As I said earlier,

411
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,770
you've already become

412
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,860
an exceptionally outstanding fighter.

413
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,470
Let me

414
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,570
be your introducer to the Party.

415
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,390
We'll formally submit

416
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,620
our application to the Party.

417
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,370
But, Hongshen, you must understand

418
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,140
that the Party has very strict discipline.

419
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,670
From now on,

420
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,350
you need to hold yourself

421
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,790
to an even higher standard.

422
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,810
You must follow the Party's commands in everything

423
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,510
and never act without organization or discipline.

424
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:48,240
Do you understand?

425
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,190
I understand.

426
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,720
But there's still a problem.

427
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,110
What problem?

428
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,340
Mi Lan's situation

429
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,340
can't be hidden from my brother.

430
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,290
[Yun Residence]

431
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,880
It's getting late.

432
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,410
I'll head back now.

433
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,380
Take care of yourself,

434
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,200
Don't let yourself fall apart—

435
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:40,080
Granny would want you to stay strong.

436
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,110
Dao,

437
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,820
see Mi Lan out.

438
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,710
Miss Mi Lan.

439
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:01,780
Jingyu,

440
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,260
go prepare the meal.

441
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:03,870
Alright.

442
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:14,400
Qi,

443
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:15,680
get up.

444
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,980
I have something important to tell you.

445
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,250
Hongqi,

446
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,160
get up.

447
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,510
Uncle Yang,

448
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:29,630
what's the matter?

449
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,390
Qi,

450
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,830
Mi Lan's identity

451
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,070
is not that simple.

452
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,580
Uncle Yang, what do you mean?

453
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,000
She's highly likely

454
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,630
to be the one who killed your grandmother.

455
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,630
Uncle Yang, you must be mistaken.

456
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:05,110
Mi Lan is so simple and pure.

457
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,330
There's no way it's her.

458
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:07,990
She's timid.

459
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,450
She wouldn't dare do something like this.

460
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,700
It's the Bai family.

461
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,150
Jingyu already told me.

462
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,750
Gui wanted to pull me into their business,

463
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,910
but Grandma refused.

464
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,310
She held a grudge because of it.

465
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,600
She's also bitter about the closure of Happy House.

466
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,230
That's why she resorted to desperate measures.

467
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:20,870
That's why she...

468
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,310
Unless Mrs. Jin wants to risk everything,

469
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,140
there's no way she'd harm Grandma.

470
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:28,990
Shen,

471
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,840
Gui...

472
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,040
She...

473
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,170
She panicked.

474
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,110
She took a reckless gamble.

475
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,780
It's entirely possible she did this.

476
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,290
Mrs. Jin's bodyguard

477
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:41,890
has already been silenced.

478
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,340
Impossible.

479
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,330
-It's impossible.
-Hongqi.

480
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,480
I know it's hard to accept,

481
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,960
but why would Uncle Yang and I lie to you?

482
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,310
You're mistaken.

483
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,230
You've got it wrong.

484
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,220
It must be a mistake.

485
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,260
You're mistaken.

486
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:11,190
Hongqi,

487
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,590
you're my only family.

488
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,170
You're the last person I'd want to see hurt.

489
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,410
I would never lie to you.

490
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,240
I wish none of this were true as well.

491
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,700
Do you have any evidence?

492
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,820
This was embroidered by Grandma herself before she was killed.

493
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,900
The focus should be on Mi Lan's past social connections,

494
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,710
the suspicious individuals she interacted with,

495
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,590
and when she was turned.

496
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,390
The details you provide must be as thorough as possible.

497
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:52,500
And remember,

498
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,950
if you can include specific evidence

499
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,010
to back it up,

500
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,270
that would be ideal.

501
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,630
Understood.

502
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,150
I brought this on Grandma.

503
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:34,320
I let the wolf into the house.

504
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,310
Hongqi!

505
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,350
[Yun Residence]

506
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,860
Get me Director Dai.

507
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,470
Director,

508
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,580
this is Ling Han.

509
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,690
I have important information to report.

510
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,590
Yun Muzhi and his son are Communists.

511
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:18,900
[Please investigate Ling Han as soon as possible]

512
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,380
Director,

513
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,560
this radio station has only recently been activated.

514
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,670
Transmission times are brief,

515
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,220
and the operator is skilled.

516
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,670
I haven't yet fully identified

517
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,060
their transmission patterns.

518
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,080
Keep a close watch.

519
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,270
Monitor it closely.

520
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,840
The emergence of

521
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:45,680
a new radio station at a time like this

522
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,530
is no small matter.

523
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,350
Yes, sir.

524
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:37,170
Mengying,

525
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,470
how many clothes did you wash?

526
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,450
You've filled the whole yard with laundry.

527
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,670
Better to wash early than late.

528
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,500
The work has to be done anyway.

529
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,570
Mengying,

530
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,180
you're unusually diligent today.

531
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:47,730
Did something good happen?

532
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,560
I found some money.

533
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:52,680
Really?

534
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,840
How much?

535
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,310
I can't tell you that.

536
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,310
If I did,

537
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,130
you'd definitely tell me to return it.

538
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,310
Mengying,

539
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,050
times are tough now.

540
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,160
Whoever lost that money must be worried sick.

541
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,480
I'm kidding.

542
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,470
What luck would I have

543
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,190
to find money?

544
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,550
I'm lucky enough if I don't lose my own money.

545
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,070
Tang, are you hungry?

546
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,220
I can cook you something.

547
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,950
I'm not hungry.

548
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,030
I already ate outside.

549
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,350
Sit down.

550
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,750
Um,

551
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:25,500
I'm really tired.

552
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:26,360
I'm going to bed first.

553
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:30,880
Wait, sit down for a bit.

554
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:32,750
Tang,

555
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,520
let's chat.

556
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,910
Let's talk tomorrow.

557
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:40,370
I'm really exhausted today.

558
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:41,990
You should stop working too.

559
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:42,910
Go to sleep soon.

560
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:48,940
Oh, by the way,

561
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,910
Gui came to the bureau today to see me.

562
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,780
She said something strange.

563
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:57,420
She said she and I are in the same boat.

564
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,660
I don't even know what that means.

565
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:00,550
Mengying,

566
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,110
you're not

567
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,400
secretly doing anything

568
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,350
shady with her, are you?

569
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,480
Why do you have to say it like that?

570
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,210
I'm your wife.

571
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,670
Don't treat me

572
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,440
like one of your suspects.

573
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:17,700
Look,

574
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,750
here's the thing—

575
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,210
Gui's in real trouble

576
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,990
this time.

577
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,810
Don't get involved.

578
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:24,990
I can't

579
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,340
help her with this.

580
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,810
If I try to help,

581
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,390
I'll get dragged down too.

582
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,310
Don't worry,

583
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,140
No matter what,

584
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,590
I won't let her drag you down with her.

585
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:42,890
Go to bed early.

586
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:44,900
I'm going to sleep now.

587
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,610
-Don't touch Grandma!
-Young Master!

588
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,060
-Don't touch Grandma!
-Young Master!

589
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:17,950
-Don't touch Grandma!
-Young Master!

590
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,230
-Don't touch Grandma!
-Young Master! Wake up!

591
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,640
It's me, Dao.

592
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,310
Young Master!

593
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,190
Young Master.

594
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:30,670
I'm Dao.

595
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,390
You've been asleep for a while.

596
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,480
How do you feel now?

597
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,680
Mi Lan's identity

598
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,910
is not that simple.

599
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,380
She's highly likely

600
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,110
to be the one who killed your grandmother.

601
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,960
I wish none of this were true as well.

602
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,520
I have no reason

603
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,700
to falsely accuse Mi Lan.

604
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:52,810
Young Master,

605
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,700
where are you going?

606
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,420
I'm going to kill her.

607
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,840
Young Master, you can't go.

608
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,350
Second Young Master!

609
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,670
Hongqi.

610
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:02,790
Get out of my way.

611
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,580
I'm going to kill her to avenge Grandma.

612
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:04,990
Move aside!

613
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:05,610
Young Master, Young Master!

614
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,350
Hongqi. Hongqi!

615
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:06,930
Hongqi!

616
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,700
You think I don't want to kill her right now?

617
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,020
But it's not the time yet.

618
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,090
When will it be time?

619
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,370
When will it ever be time?

620
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,230
When Father died, you told me to wait.

621
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:23,240
Now Grandma is dead, and you're still telling me to wait.

622
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,500
You can wait.

623
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,320
But I can't.

624
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,490
I have to kill her and avenge Grandma.

625
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:29,430
Move aside!

626
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,270
Move aside!

627
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:31,830
Hongqi!

628
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:57,190
Hongqi.

629
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,000
-Don't touch me!
-Hongqi.

630
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,100
Don't touch me!

631
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,390
Don't touch me!

632
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:02,250
The way you are now, Grandma and our parents

633
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,360
wouldn't forgive you!

634
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:12,590
Hongqi.

635
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,480
Hongqi.

636
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,510
Get up.

637
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,510
A real man stands up.

638
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,720
If Father, Mother, and Grandma resent me,

639
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,610
I'll beg them.

640
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,980
I'll keep begging until they forgive me.

641
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,030
But I will avenge Grandma.

642
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,070
I must.

643
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:46,880
Hongqi.

644
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,430
It was Grandma who decided

645
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,810
to let me join the NBIS

646
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,230
to track down the hidden Kunwu.

647
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,340
Grandma?

648
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,490
Grandma decided it?

649
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,450
At the time, she had just lost her son.

650
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,880
She knew it was dangerous,

651
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,280
but she still agreed to let me go.

652
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,150
Because she knew

653
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,880
what mattered more.

654
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:30,530
I don't care.

655
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,409
I don't care.

656
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,350
I just want to avenge Grandma.

657
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,540
All I want is revenge!

658
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,150
Hongqi.

659
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,949
But what was Grandma's real wish?

660
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,910
You were raised by Grandma.

661
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,980
Don't you know what she wanted?

662
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,950
You think I don't want revenge?

663
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,430
I want to tear her apart a thousand times over!

664
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,960
But if we recklessly get our revenge,

665
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:19,510
then what?

666
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,620
Will Grandma forgive us for that?

667
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,460
I know you can't forgive yourself.

668
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,640
You feel like it's your fault that Grandma died.

669
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,110
But because we both have guilt,

670
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,400
we need to find a way to make it right.

671
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,510
If you kill Mi Lan,

672
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,890
Kunwu will go completely silent.

673
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,030
The Japanese will

674
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,090
definitely revise their plans.

675
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:01,860
And when that happens,

676
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,780
our chances of defending Changsha

677
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,920
will be slim to none.

678
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:07,760
If we can't hold Changsha

679
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,710
and still have an enemy within,

680
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,370
can you bear the consequences of that?

681
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,700
I miss Grandma.

682
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,910
I miss Grandma.

683
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,950
I miss Grandma.

684
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:51,710
Second Young Master,

685
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,220
how is the Young Master doing?

686
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,330
Much better.

687
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,060
You must stay by his side at all times.

688
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,480
Do not let him out of your sight.

689
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:02,940
Understood.

690
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,390
I'll go in first then.

691
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,670
I'm not just after two lives.

692
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:22,350
I want everyone to know

693
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:24,630
that Old Madam Yun died at the hands of the Bai Clan.

694
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:26,460
And I don't see that outcome yet.

695
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:27,910
Explain.

696
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,870
Miss Kudo,

697
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,470
the timing was too tight.

698
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:36,140
Both the NBIS and the police reacted quickly.

699
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,920
I couldn't arrange all the details

700
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,470
under their watchful eyes.

701
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,840
I suggest

702
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:45,990
we stop here.

703
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,640
Let's not complicate things further.

704
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:53,870
Old Madam Yun was a well-known figure in Changsha.

705
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,760
There are too many eyes on this case.

706
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,550
Now that the NBIS is involved,

707
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,680
they won't leave us

708
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,390
any room to manipulate the situation.

709
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,550
Even if

710
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,030
there are gaps to exploit,

711
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:06,840
what about Yun Hongshen and Yun Hongqi?

712
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:10,400
Those brothers won't let it go.

713
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,440
I can even foresee

714
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,150
a very unfavorable outcome.

715
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:19,190
You, me, and the Bai Clan

716
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,470
will all be thoroughly investigated.

717
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,150
When that happens, our connections will be exposed.

718
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,090
You and I will both be revealed.

719
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:28,710
So,

720
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:32,210
doing nothing is the only way not to leave any evidence behind.

721
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,820
That's the safest

722
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,630
course of action.

723
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,430
What do you plan to do with Gui?

724
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,790
Let her live.

725
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,310
She might know some things about me,

726
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,990
but she should also know very well

727
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,190
what the consequences would be if she betrayed me.

728
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,270
So,

729
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,180
she won't say anything.

730
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,690
Honestly, this is already the best outcome.

731
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,160
The NBIS hasn't suspected you.

732
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,770
If we're lucky,

733
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:06,260
and the tension eases after a while,

734
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,190
we can think of another plan.

735
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,310
We might even

736
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,710
be able to

737
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,000
smooth the whole thing over.

738
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,870
And the rickshaw?

739
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,340
It's already been dealt with.

740
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,160
If she's just an ordinary nurse,

741
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,680
how could she have a handgun?

742
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:15,190
This gun and its hidden compartment alone

743
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,730
prove one thing—

744
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,540
Mi Lan's identity is anything but simple.

745
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:57,470
♫When the shining light burns down the wilderness♫

746
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:04,800
♫The endless dream is swallowing loneliness♫
