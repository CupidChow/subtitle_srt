But we can't rule out other possibilities.

Continue investigating along this line of inquiry.

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,539

Li Xuemin is dead.

00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,250
How could this happen?

10
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,150
Didn't we call an ambulance?

11
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,190
The ambulance arrived two minutes late.

12
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,650
Those crucial two minutes

13
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,950
cost Li Xueming her life.

14
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,750
Then why was the ambulance late?

15
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,150
The nurse accompanying the ambulance said

16
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,350
they heard gunshots as they were getting close

17
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,910
and thought the incident happened over there, so they went in that direction,

18
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,240
which caused the delay.

19
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,329
Have you interrogated the nurse?

20
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,030
No.

21
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,300
Not bad.

22
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:40,630
Have you called Grandma?

23
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,600
Yes, I have.

24
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,350
I told her as you instructed.

25
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:48,180
I said we would be staying at my friend's house for the next few days
and wouldn't be going home.

around Boya Tea House?

40
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,230
I was on the street west of the tea house.

41
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,670
At that time, did you see two young men

42
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,250
who were well-dressed

43
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,710

Were there many people on the street?

46

Quite a few.

00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,360
With so many people on the street,

48
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,910
you said "no" without knowing which young men

You think she wasn't telling the truth?

75

She gave me a strange impression.

76
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,590
She looked so delicate,

77
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,790
like a little bunny.

78
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,390
But her gaze was too steady.

79
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,910
She didn't seem like a weak person.

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,120
In today's world,

Besides,

83
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,110
she works at the hospital.

84
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,350
She's seen plenty of injured soldiers from the front lines—

85
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,790
those missing arms or legs,

86
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,150

and half their brains gone.

88
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,950

00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,950

00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,030
It's a psychological issue.

97
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,180
There's nothing wrong with his body.

98
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,500
Nothing wrong with his body?

99
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,370
But he fainted

100
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,470
and... threw up.

101
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,670
What psychological issue?

102
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,590
He must have experienced a great shock recently,

103
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,390
which caused him overwhelming sadness.

104
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,550
And with too much psychological pressure,

105
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,510
it led to some adverse physiological reactions

106
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,270
in certain situations,

107
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,150
like dizziness, vomiting,

108
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,150
and even hallucinations.

109
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,360
So how do we treat it?

110
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,460
You need to guide him

111
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,670
and talk to him more often.

112
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,870
You should also learn to let go.

113
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,390
Don't carry so many worries in your heart.

114
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,190

119
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,000
He hasn't fully recovered.

120
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,270
Our hospital beds are currently in very short supply.

122
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,550
Didn't you see that just now?

123
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,350

for a few more days for observation?

145
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,870
Given his condition,

146
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,530
he can't go to the frontlines.

147
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,670
If he has an episode during battle,

148
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,390
it could cost a life.

149
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:11,940
We need to at least determine

150
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,840
under what conditions he might have an episode,

151
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,150

If he has another episode,

159
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,070

Do you feel any discomfort anywhere?

166

I'm alright.

167
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,909

171

Don't overthink things

173
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,530

As long as you cooperate with the treatment,

176
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,350
you'll be able to leave the hospital soon.

177
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,030
Thank you.

Just let me know if you need anything.

184
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,310
I'll get back to work now.

185
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,370
Bye.

Wait.

Your cuff button has come off.

188
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,909
Isn't it inconvenient to work like this?

00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,680
I'll leave you to your work now.

194
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,470
I'll get back to work then.

195
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,090
Bye.

196
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,030
Bye.

197
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,800
Nighthawk learned indirectly

198
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,820
that Wen Yeming chased the Yun brothers

199
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,820
to the street west of Boya Tea House,

200
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,510
where she lost track of them.

201
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:04,990
Before that,

202
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,810
an ambulance from the Military Hospital

203
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,070
passed through the area.

204
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:08,870
Moreover,

205
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,710
someone saw with their own eyes

206
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,110
that the ambulance took two young men away.

207
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:18,090
Nighthawk said he would find time to go to the Military Hospital to check.

208
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,950
We need to find a way to break the deadlock.

209
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,190
In the face of the overall situation of the War of Resistance,

210
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,580
we can't confront the NBIS directly.

211
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:28,840
Yes.

212
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,820
By the way,

213
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,130
continue following up

214
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,600
on Myna's information.

215
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,710
The intelligence he has

216
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:36,790
is very likely

217
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,590
the Japanese battle plan for attacking Changsha.

218
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:41,870
Yang,

219
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,390
I've always had a question.

220
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,070
Since the Japanese turned Qu Wenzhi,

221
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,870
it means they already know that Chiang Kai-shek

222
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,670
is planning to give up Changsha.

223
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,350
So, how valuable

224
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,880
is this battle plan really?

225
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,020
Why does the Organization insist

226
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,950
that we obtain this intelligence?

227
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,720
The tactic that the Japanese commonly use

228
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,470
is to launch a direct assault from the front

229
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,910
and then carry out surprise attacks from the flank.

230
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,630
These flanking attacks are often capable of

231
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,590
breaking through our defenses.

232
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,840
The situation in Hunan is quite unique,

233
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,980
with complex terrain,

234
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,740
so,

235
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,550
the enemy has two possible routes for their flanking attacks—

236
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,590
either from the east or from the west.

237
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,920
Our forces are limited,

238
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,050
not enough to defend everywhere.

239
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,390
Therefore, we must know

240
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,900
whether the enemy will carry out the flanking attack

241
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,990
from the west, around Yueyang Lake,

242
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,830
or from the east, the direction of Jiangxi.

243
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,470
This is crucial to holding on to Changsha.

244
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,130
It's not necessarily a good thing

245
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,200
to trust your feelings too easily.

246
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,470
I was like that back then.

247
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,990
You don't know her yet.

248
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,640
Don't fall for her too easily.

249
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,630
Hello?

250
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,530
I'd like to speak with Officer Huang.

251
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,030
Hey, Huang,

252
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,740
it's me.

253
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,450
Help me look into someone.

254
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,690
You're such a busy person.

255
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,780
What brings you to my place?

256
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,220
I haven't seen you for a long time.

257
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,610
I've missed you, Ying.

258
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,920
[Zeng Mengying, wife of Captain Tang of the Police Department]

259
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:54,830
Oh, come on.

260
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,190
Just get to the point.

261
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,360
We've been friends since childhood.

262
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,760
It has been so many years.

263
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,390
There's no need for pleasantries.

264
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,190
Well then, I'll get to the point.

265
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,880
Ying,

266
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,620
I have something I want to ask your husband about.

267
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,900
Is this urgent?

268
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,950
If it's urgent,

269
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,440
just wait for him to come back.

270
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,890
He's hardly ever home,

271
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,390
doesn't make much money,

272
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,730
and always accuses me of making money through shady means.

273
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,270
Well, speak of the devil.

274
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,470
Look who's here.

275
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,080
Mrs. Jin?

276
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:25,700
Brother,

277
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,820
you're off work.

278
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:27,990
What a rare guest.

279
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,190
Jin Gui, wait a moment.

280
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,530
Please sit down.

281
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,960
She has something to ask you.

282
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,890
Get it done fast.

283
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,660
You two chat,

284
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,910
and I'll see if the baby's asleep.

285
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,380
Okay.

286
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,450
Go ahead.

287
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,350
What's the matter?

288
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,150
Brother,

289
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,730
Our Boss Bai has a brother named Ding Xing.

290
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,970
He disappeared mysteriously.

291
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,420
We don't know if he's alive or dead.

292
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,300
It's really worrying.

293
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,270
You have broad connections.

294
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,440
Could you help us inquire about it?

295
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:10,600
Well...

296
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,840
there's something I need to say,

297
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,160
and I hope you don't take offense.

298
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,590
Don't people from your Bai Clan

299
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,660
often disappear mysteriously?

300
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,120
I'm not afraid to be honest with you.

301
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,230
When some people go missing, we know what's going on.

302
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,030
But with Ding Xing,

303
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,420
we really have no clue.

304
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,930
Really?

305
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,540
Why else would I come to you?

306
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,960
Well...

307
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,420
to make someone disappear without a trace,

308
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,620
our Police Department doesn't have that kind of ability.

309
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,100
Are you saying...

310
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,220
it was the NBIS?

311
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,490
I didn't say that.

312
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:50,850
Well...

313
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,330
we didn't offend the NBIS recently.

314
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,070
Brother,

315
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,530
you have a good relationship with the NBIS.

316
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,460
Could you help us inquire about it?

317
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,310
Let me put it this way:

318
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,170
to make someone disappear without a trace,

319
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,940
with no evidence left behind...

320
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,750
if—

321
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,990
I'm just saying if—

322
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,990
this was really done by the NBIS,

323
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,100
then think about it:

324
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,240
how much trouble has your brother gotten into?

325
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,700
Who am I to look into something this big?

326
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,860
You should just have some water.

327
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:25,440
Here.

328
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,270
[Military Hospital]

329
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,380
Shen,

330
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,290
I don't know what you're looking for,

331
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,440
but I've searched the entire Military Hospital.

332
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,500
I've checked all the wards and tents,

333
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,980
and there's no one who looks like Myna.

334
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,000
I don't know what I'm looking for either.

335
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,880
It's alright, Shen.

336
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,750
I have a theory.

337
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,110
And,

338
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,980
my theory should be correct.

339
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,280
This Myna

340
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,310
is just a smokescreen.

341
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,540
He's not even in the Military Hospital.

342
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,070
Don't overthink it.

343
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,270
And stop being so paranoid all the time.

344
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,670
Yeah, let's forget about it.

345
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,390
Let's go back, Hongqi.

346
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:03,840
Okay.

347
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:16,760
Who's there?

348
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,310
What happened?

349
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,110
I've confirmed

350
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,630
that Qu Wenzhi left via the waterway.

351
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,290
He took a labor trafficking ship of Happy House.

352
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,480
As for who sent him onto the ship

353
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,690
and how much Happy House

354
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,410
knows about it,

355
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,940
I'm still investigating.

356
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,600
But with the death of Niu Erhong this afternoon,

357
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,480
I'm one step closer to finding that mole.

358
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,750
Didn't Niu Erhong die

359
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,030
without leaving any clues behind?

360
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,390
I've figured out how the mole

361
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,190
passes information.

362
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:05,230
I asked the people who smoked in the bathroom this morning

363
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,350
how many times they went

364
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,470
and how many cigarettes they smoked.

365
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,830
They could all corroborate each other,

366
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,150
and their testimonies matched.

367
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,290
There should have been 33 cigarette butts

368
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,690
found in the bathroom.

369
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,870
But in Niu Erhong's trash cart,

370
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,870
there were only 32 cigarette butts,

371
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:18,950
with one missing—

372
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,150
a Golden cigarette butt.

373
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,370
You mean

374
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,520
the mole hid the information in the cigarette butt

375
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,840
and passed it on to Niu Erhong?

376
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,490
But...

377
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,340
without knowing the specific content and details,

378
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,950
how did he pass it on?

379
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,950
He just needed to have his accomplices

380
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,410
watch the people in charge of the operation.

381
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,440
Me?

382
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,340
I have a feeling

383
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,070
that this mole

384
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,590
is someone we least expect.

385
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,910
Do you have a specific target in mind?

386
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,190
I know the smoking habits of everyone

387
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,100
who was in the meeting room this morning.

388
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,090
Through that missing cigarette butt,

389
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,550
I've narrowed it down to three people.

390
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,840
[Li Liang, Wang Rui, Zhang Chao]

391
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:17,800
Li Liang?

392
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:22,950
As expected.

393
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,310
As expected?

394
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,430
What else do you know?

395
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,240
On the night Qu Wenzhi died,

396
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,700
when I got to the top floor,

397
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,470
Qu Wenzhi's bodyguards were already blocking the elevator,

398
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,310
as if they had received the news in advance.

399
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,430
You went up there alone?

400
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,190
Yes.

401
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,680
I had Li Liang waiting outside as support.

402
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,540
A pack of cigarettes.

403
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,670
He parked diagonally across

404
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,450
from a phone booth.

405
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,470
Also,

406
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,550
after I returned to the hotel,

407
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,710
he went out alone

408
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,950
and got into a fight.

409
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,650
According to him,

410
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,180
he went out to find a woman,

411
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:15,950
and on the way back, he ran into a drunkard

412
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,210
and got into a scuffle.

413
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,350
The wound on his arm

414
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,260
was clearly caused

415
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,480
by a thin, sharp, specially made blade.

416
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,160
Ordinary drunkards

417
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,210
wouldn't have that kind of blade.

418
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,940
It seems this Li Liang

419
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,430
needs to be thoroughly investigated.

420
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,750
Is there anything you need me to do?

421
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,750
Not for now.

422
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,610
If there's anything,

423
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,750
I'll let you know.

424
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,580
It's getting late.

425
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,070
Rest early.

426
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,020
You're keeping this even though it's broken?

427
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,470
Is it very important to you?

428
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,930
It was given to me by my mother.

429
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,790
When I left my hometown,

430
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,200
it was the only thing I took with me.

431
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,580
Go ahead, what's the matter?

432
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,670
Young Master Yun asked me to find someone

433
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,590
with the same traits as the person you asked me to find.

434
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,390
You know what to do, right?

435
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,910
I've found the person.

436
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,440
I'm reporting to you first.

437
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,270
You know, your greatest strength

438
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,870
is understanding the times.

439
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,320
You flatter me.

440
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,480
Myna,

441
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,160
male,

442
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,890
between 45 and 50 years old.

443
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,700
His public identity is a Japanese expatriate

444
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,060
named Miura Hikokazu.

445
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,680
He's said to be the most mysterious intelligence trafficker in Shanghai.

446
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,440
Around 8:05 AM yesterday,

447
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:11,410
Chief received a call from Myna.

448
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,710
He suggested meeting at Boya Tea House

449
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,370
at 10:30 AM for a transaction.

450
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,240
At 10:25 AM yesterday,

451
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,650
these two people

452
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,050
appeared at Boya Tea House

453
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,680
and were suspected of having had contact with Myna.

454
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,410
Afterward, Myna disappeared.

455
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:26,570
Yun Hongshen,

456
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,120
male,

457
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,050
25 years old,

458
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,490
a well-known philanthropist and educator in the city,

459
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:33,320
grandson of Yun Shiyan, the founder of Xiangjiang Girls' School.

460
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,160
Yun Hongqi,

461
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:34,620
male,

462
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,570
29 years old,

463
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,710
the eldest grandson of Yun Shiyan.

464
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:38,990
This person

465
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,070
took down our colleagues left in the car

466
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,400
and then hid in the car.

467
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,270
When we were escorting Yun Hongshen

468
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,110
and Yun Hongqi back,

469
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,240
he opened fire on us.

470
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,060
Li Xueming from Action Team 1 was killed in the incident,

471
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,620
and two other colleagues were severely injured.

472
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,200
Yun Hongshen and Yun Hongqi seized the opportunity and escaped.

473
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,930
After the incident yesterday,

474
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,060
Myna completely disappeared.

475
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,760
The rickshaw puller of the rickshaw he was riding in

476
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,760
has also been murdered.

477
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,550
Myna is highly suspected of killing to silence him.

478
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,610
Report completed.

479
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,180
Is there any other information

480
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,380
to add about Myna?

481
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,290
Then I'll assign the tasks.

482
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,130
Deputy Chief Zhu,

483
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,880
deploy all your men

484
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:26,040
to find these four people's resumes as soon as possible.

485
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,710
Deputy Director Huang,

486
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,840
go and tell Director Gong

487
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,130
to get me the resumes of these four people

488
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,440
and their social networks

489
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,640
as soon as possible.

490
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,460
Yes.

491
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,180
Director Xu,

492
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,380
closely monitor enemy stations, friendly stations, and even commercial stations.

493
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,370
Don't let any suspicious leads slip by.

494
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,100
Understood.

495
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,510
Move out!

496
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:42,710
Yes!

497
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:57,560
You can go.

498
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,560
You.

499
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:00,630
Go.

500
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,280
Alright, go.

501
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,210
Have all the people who checked in these days registered?

502
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:12,810
Yes.

503
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,060
It's windy.

504
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,290
Try not to go out much.

505
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,450
Come out with me.

506
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,360
Young Master,

507
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,590
Second Young Master.

508
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,050
How did Dao know we're here?

509
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,240
Hongqi,

510
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,080
you called home?

511
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,010
It won't be long

512
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,870
before the NBIS finds this place.

513
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,860
We should leave quickly.

514
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,030
You've been repeating this like a chant in front of me every day.

515
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,430
Do you think I don't know?

516
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,510
I

517
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,000
called Huang,

518
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,690
and asked him to look into Mi Lan.

519
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,490
After confirming, he went to the porridge shop to find Dao,

520
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,010
and then Dao came to me.

521
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,770
Even if the NBIS is eavesdropping,

522
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:35,160
do you think they can tap into the police station's phone lines?

523
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,960
That's good.

524
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,780
You had someone look into Mi Lan?

525
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,440
Aren't you suspicious of her?

526
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,250
It's good that I confirmed.

527
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,650
So you won't be paranoid all the time.

528
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,220
Go ahead.

529
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:48,930
Mi Lan,

530
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,290
26 years old this year.

531
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:53,220
After graduating from a girls' high school, she went to nursing school.

532
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,090
After graduating,

533
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,730
she first worked at Ren'ai Hospital.

534
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,380
Last year, when the Wenxi fire broke out,

535
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,050
Ren'ai Hospital was burned down, right?

536
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,160
So she was transferred here.

537
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:00,920
I heard

538
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:03,320
her father has been doing business in Shanghai for years.

539
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,290
That's basically all the information.

540
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:07,330
This is all publicly available information,

541
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,990
so it doesn't hold much value.

542
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,580
Sometimes, the more suspicious someone is,

543
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,870
the less likely their public identity is to be questioned.

544
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,210
So, you're convinced

545
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,090
that Mi Lan is suspicious, right?

546
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,430
I didn't say that.

547
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,630
Then what do you mean?

548
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,210
Hasn't the investigation been thorough?

549
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:23,320
I just don't believe in coincidences.

550
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:23,860
Hongqi,

551
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,440
it was too coincidental every time

552
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,300
she appeared around us.

553
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,350
Young Master,

554
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,480
Second Young Master means well.

555
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,360
Think about it.

556
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,670
There are plenty of people who want to be

557
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,230
the young madam of our Yun family.

558
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,560
Being a little cautious isn't a bad thing.

559
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,240
Alright.

560
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,070
Hurry up and head back.

561
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,530
Take good care of Grandma.

562
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,180
If anything comes up, I'll have Huang find you.

563
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:51,580
Okay.

564
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:52,590
I'll be going then.

565
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,390
Dao,

566
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,980
if there's nothing urgent these days,

567
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,060
try not to go out.

568
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:56,690
Also,

569
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,870
be careful when making phone calls.

570
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:00,550
Don't talk to others carelessly.

571
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,910
When you contact Huang,

572
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,630
be mindful of what you say.

573
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,180
He has personal ties with Young Master.

574
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,840
This is probably not a secret.

575
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,960
I'm just afraid that when someone is keeping an eye on them,

576
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,800
they might notice you.

577
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,750
And that would be troublesome.

578
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,620
Understood, Second Young Master.

579
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,540
I got it.

580
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,430
Be careful.

581
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,040
I'm off then.

582
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:16,460
Wait.

583
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,490
Did those people

584
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,090
go to our doorstep to monitor us?

585
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,850
Of course they did.

586
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:23,890
It's so annoying.

587
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:24,910
Hongqi,

588
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,190
don't do anything rash.

589
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,140
Don't worry about it.

590
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,990
The more I think about it, the angrier I get.

591
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,950
If we don't show them some consequences,

592
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,790
they'll think the Yun family is weak

593
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,710
and easy to bully.

594
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,110
What do you suggest we do?

595
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:39,830
I got it.

596
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:45,530
Go back now.

597
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,740
Hello.

598
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,030
May I know which ward Commander Li Guodong

599
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:51,830
from the 534th Regiment is in?

600
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:52,810
Let me check it for you.

601
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:53,610
Thank you.

602
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,550
You said you saw that ambulance?

603
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:00,690
Well,

604
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,180
those two young men looked pretty good.

605
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:03,980
Are you sure?

606
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:08,030
It's the first room on the left on the second floor.

607
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,220
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

608
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,080
Over there.

609
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,270
Easy.

610
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,690
Be careful.

611
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,350
Here.

612
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,240
Easy, easy.

613
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:30,990
Thank you.

614
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,800
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

615
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,930
I'm terribly sorry.

616
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,950
I broke your lens.

617
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,660
Let me get you a new pair of glasses.

618
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:05,980
Easy there.

619
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,120
[Silence]

620
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,910
Mi Lan.

621
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:18,830
What's wrong?

622
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,160
We've been hiding here

623
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,960
and almost got you into trouble.

624
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,560
I feel really bad about that.

625
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,980
The glasses you broke,

626
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,180
we'll get a new pair for you.

627
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,050
Consider it a token of our appreciation.

628
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:30,850
No need.

629
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,330
If you refuse,

630
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,580
we'll feel uneasy.

631
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,090
I couldn't accept that.

632
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:38,940
Mi Lan,

633
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,450
it's no big deal.

634
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:46,250
Keep an eye on the three people in the sketches.

635
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,310
Let me know immediately if you find anything.

636
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,790
This is my phone number.

637
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,040
My brother has a psychological issue right now.

638
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,140
He's the type of person

639
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,410
who hates owing favors.

640
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,720
If you don't let him repay it,

641
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,110
he'll feel bad about it.

642
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,040
Alright then.

643
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,560
Thank you.

644
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,730
By the way, Miss Mi Lan,

645
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:14,910
if...

646
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,600
the doctor asks…

647
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,690
If the doctor asks,

648
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,520
I'll say

649
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,600
you two are taking a walk nearby.

650
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,790
But you should wait until the doctor finishes the rounds before going.

651
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,590
Of course.

652
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,230
You two

653
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:31,050
aren't planning to sneak out and have fun, are you?

654
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:34,220
It's really not like that.

655
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,390
We just want to go get a new pair of glasses,

656
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:39,050
but we want to do it in secret.

657
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,110
Alright then.

658
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,020
Make sure you come back on time.

659
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,350
Otherwise, I'll get scolded by the doctor.

660
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,080
Don't worry.

661
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,160
Be careful.

662
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,600
I'll get back to work now.

663
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,170
Hello,

664
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:09,810
Ping.

665
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,160
I saw that person.

666
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,920
He's in the Military Hospital.

667
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,150
Okay.

668
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,310
Just from a pair of glasses,

669
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,130
you can determine where Myna is?

670
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,100
How did you figure that out?

671
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,700
Based on Myna's appearance,

672
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,780
he must have pretty bad eyesight.

673
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,390
If he takes off his glasses,

674
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:51,390
he wouldn't be able to function normally.

675
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,190
So,

676
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,860
he had to look for a new pair.

677
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,090
Hongqi,

678
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,210
I'm 90% certain.

679
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,820
I must go and confirm it.

680
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,520
Alright.

681
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:00,570
Don't rush.

682
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:03,250
I've already contacted Xu Nian.

683
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:03,990
He said he'd call me

684
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:06,070
at 11 o'clock this morning.

685
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,400
Maybe he found Myna.

686
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,750
Why is she here again?

687
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,430
She must be up to no good this time.

688
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,050
Let's go.

689
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,580
[Morgue]

690
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:51,720
You guys go that way,

691
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,720
we'll go this way.

692
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,790
Why is there no one here?

693
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,090
He must have noticed us

694
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:00,820
and ran away.

695
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,430
The hospital has been locked down.

696
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,270
He can't run away.

697
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:03,820
Search!

698
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,430
If only I had a pair of wings.

699
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,240
Your ID.

700
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:40,270
You can go.

701
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,480
Move!

702
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,120
What are you doing?

703
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:37,630
Madam,

704
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:40,810
isn't it a bit inappropriate for us to just go in and search?

705
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,810
They're trying to catch us in a trap.

706
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,040
Hongqi,

707
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:46,710
jump down.

708
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:47,790
-Hurry!
-What?

709
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,690
If I jump down,

710
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,070
it won't be better than getting caught.

711
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:51,800
At least being caught...

712
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,810
It's too late!

713
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,700
Search.

714
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,600
Let's go.

715
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,640
Chase that truck.

716
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,760
What was that truck that just left?

717
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,830
It's the truck that delivers dirty bed linens to the laundry.

718
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,430
Should we check the laundry?

719
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,400
What's the point?

720
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,960
They must have gotten out of the truck and run away as soon as they left the hospital.

721
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,150
Which direction did it go?

722
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,230
It went west.

723
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:36,520
Retreat.

724
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:37,560
Prepare a team.

725
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,510
Shen,

726
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,620
leave the task of finding him to me.

727
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,580
There's no one in Changsha I can't find.

728
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,150
Just follow my arrangement and stop messing around, alright?

729
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,210
It's too dangerous

730
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,350
with all the guns and running away.

731
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,190
Alright.

732
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:20,780
As you said,

733
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:23,590
this Myna is cunning and alert.

734
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,470
If he doesn't leave his house

735
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,630
and doesn't go to get glasses, how are you going to find him?

736
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,230
Hongqi,

737
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,500
he wouldn't choose those high-end optical stores.

738
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,110
Small storefronts in less crowded areas are his preferred choice,

739
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,980
especially ones that offer home delivery.

740
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,830
The people around this optical shop

741
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,260
are likely to be quite diverse.

742
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:37,870
Alright.

743
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,260
Your analysis is correct.

744
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,640
But with so many optical shops in Changsha,

745
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,930
how long will it take for you to find him

746
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:45,260
if you search one by one?

747
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,710
Then can you guarantee that Xu Nian

748
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,700
will definitely find Myna?

749
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,110
I...

750
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,670
He's neither a god nor has eyes that can see thousands of miles away.

751
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,000
From the time you asked him for help until now,

752
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,260
it's not even 24 hours.

753
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:54,950
And the person he's looking for

754
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:57,280
is someone very clever and good at hiding.

755
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,900
I don't believe he can find him

756
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,030
in such a short time.

757
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,200
If we can't find him,

758
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,830
are we just going to sit here and wait?

759
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:03,550
Alright, alright.

760
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,290
Stop it.

761
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,500
You just don't trust anyone.

762
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:07,410
Shen,

763
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,280
can't you stop

764
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,280
being so paranoid all the time?

765
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:11,840
Fine.

766
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,230
Even if you don't trust Xu Nian,

767
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,510
can't you trust me?

768
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,690
In this matter, I don't trust anyone.

769
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,000
What did you say?

770
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:19,830
Say that again.

771
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,080
Bastard!

772
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:23,650
I'm warning you, Shen.

773
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:25,500
Don't keep being so stubborn

774
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,200
just because you think you're a little clever.

775
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,130
Dad is already dead because of you.

776
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:35,590
Hongqi,

777
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,230
let's split up.

778
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,960
Later, you call Xu Nian,

779
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,510
and I'll keep checking the optical shops.

780
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,270
An hour from now,

781
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:42,990
I'll call

782
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,720
the phone booth at Pozi Street.

783
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,560
If Xu Nian finds Myna,

784
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,560
you wait for me there.

785
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,690
We'll meet up there.

786
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:50,930
Shen...

787
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:10,960
Okay, stop.

788
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,500
Thanks.

789
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,110
You're welcome.

790
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:17,210
[Bright Optical Shop]

791
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:23,470
Sir.

792
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,870
Are you getting glasses?

793
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:25,390
Sir,

794
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,940
do you offer delivery service?

795
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:27,700
Sorry,

796
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:28,790
it's a small shop.

797
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,350
I'm the owner and the only employee,

798
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,150
so we can't offer home delivery.

799
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:33,720
Thank you.

800
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,030
Why's your mouth so nasty?

801
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,040
He's already feeling bad, and you said things like that.

802
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,100
He's an adult now

803
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,520
and you're still treating him like a child.

804
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,950
Why's your mouth so nasty?

805
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,470
Changsha's Little Mengchang?

806
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,810
You're nothing!

807
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,160
You stupid brother.

808
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,070
Hello?

809
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,030
Hello, Xu Nian.

810
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,240
It's me, Yun Hongqi.

811
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,590
That person is an expert,

812
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:06,910
very alert.

813
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,440
So far, I've only found out

814
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,700
that he once stayed at Xiangjiang Hotel.

815
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,410
He checked out the next day and left.

816
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:14,930
I still don't know where he's staying now.

817
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:20,340
Okay.

818
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,220
I see.

819
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:35,990
Hello?

820
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,380
Is this Shen?

821
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,890
I'm your brother.

822
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,830
Where are you now?

823
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:42,380
Tell me,

824
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:44,020
and I'll come to you right away.

825
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,950
I remember there are a few optical shops in Shuidao Alley.

826
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,080
Let's meet up there.

827
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,500
Madam, are we going back to the station?

828
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,610
Let's go to Yun's Residence.

829
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,420
Yes.

830
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,310
-Hongqi.
-Shen.

831
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,670
You've been here for a while, right?

832
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:18,700
You've been waiting for a long time, haven't you?

833
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,090
I rushed over here as soon as I hung up the phone,

834
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:23,020
but I still got here later than you.

835
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,890
Hongqi, I know you didn't mean it.

836
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,820
Let's discuss things together in the future.

837
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,820
I was too impatient. It was my fault.

838
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,280
Alright then.

839
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:39,340
A good kid is someone who admits when they're wrong and changes their ways.

840
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,870
I'm magnanimous, I won't hold it against you.

841
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:42,930
Besides,

842
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,320
I had my faults too.

843
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:46,090
From now on,

844
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,540
let's discuss everything together.

845
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:49,950
Okay.

846
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:50,520
Let's go.

847
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,760
[Optical Shop]

848
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:16,850
Who is it?

849
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,480
I'm here to deliver glasses.

850
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:24,820
Sir,

851
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,330
your glasses are ready.

852
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,310
Thank you.

853
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:46,350
The Yun brothers were indeed hiding in the Military Hospital.

854
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:48,260
But it seems the NBIS caught wind of it

855
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,890
and went to the hospital to arrest them.

856
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,230
Under the cover of Nighthawk,

857
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:53,230
the two brothers managed to escape.

858
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:53,920
Wu,

859
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,640
later, go to a few famous temples

860
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:59,330
on the outskirts of Changsha and offer incense.

861
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:04,170
Hongshen didn't bring Muzhi's body back.

862
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:07,850
What he brought back is most likely ashes.

863
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,640
Go and check

864
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,000
which temple

865
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,090
has been storing unclaimed ashes these past few days.

866
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:14,970
With the NBIS's action today,

867
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,610
Hongshen and Hongqi

868
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,520
must have gone into hiding and won't show up again.

869
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,250
However,

870
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,270
tomorrow is Muzhi's first seven-day memorial.

871
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:23,840
They will definitely go to pay their respects.

872
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,430
Okay.

873
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,400
Prepare the car.

874
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,220
I'm going to Yun's Residence.

875
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:29,990
Yes.

876
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:35,680
Alright, Jingyu.

877
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,120
Get back to your work now.

878
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:37,950
Old Madam...

879
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:40,190
I'm fine. You may go.

880
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,260
Madam Yun,

881
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:48,310
do you know where Yun Hongshen has gone?

882
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:50,270
Young lady,

883
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,970
I know who you are.

884
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,150
You're asking me, an old woman,

885
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:56,350
about something even you don't know?

886
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,140
What could I possibly know?

887
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,820
Please don't misunderstand.

888
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,230
I have great respect for you and Old Mraster Yun.

889
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:03,470
But this is my duty.

890
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,470
Stop talking.
