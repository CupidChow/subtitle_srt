If this traces back to you,

223
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,850

00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:00,480
This is...

374
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,200
Mr. Noda,

375
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:02,880
I'm sorry.

376
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,140
This is my son.

377
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,020
He's impolite.

378
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,590
I will definitely discipline him properly when I get back.

379
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,430
Mr. Noda,

380
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,730
please carry on with your business.

381
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:09,970
The situation is special today,

382
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,170
so I won't see you off.

383
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,790
No need, no need.

384
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,070
Thank you again.

385
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:22,710
You deliberately sent me away

386
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,630
just to do this?

387
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,850
Who are you to interfere

388
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,680
with the decision I made?

389
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,680
Your father is simply carrying out my orders.

390
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,760
Do you understand?

391
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,610
Mr. Frank,

392
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,450
you don't think the Japanese truly want

393
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,910
to be friends with you French people, do you?

394
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,410
They have greedy ambitions,

395
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,290
never satisfied with what they have.

396
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:41,280
Sooner or later,

397
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,240
they'll set their sights on you.

398
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,210
It's...

399
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:45,950
Muzhi,

400
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,960
it seems there are some things he should know now.

401
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,290
I'm not afraid to tell you the truth.

402
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,530
I don't want those useless pieces of paper

403
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,740
from Japan either.

404
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,440
But if the cost is losing

405
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:14,270
France's concession rights in Shanghai,

406
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,610
I'd rather be extorted.

407
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,240
It's easy for you to say.

408
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,560
But in the end,

409
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,950
we Chinese are the ones being extorted.

410
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,240
We have an old saying in China:

411
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,570
"Being generous with other people's money."

412
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,400
Mr. Frank,

413
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,050
I'm sure you understand what that means, don't you?

414
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:28,820
Hongsheng,

415
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:29,970
let me remind you.

416
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,990
You are working for the French Republic,

417
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:34,810
and like your father,

418
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,610
you must

419
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,700
always prioritize its highest interests

420
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,860
in everything.

421
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:41,770
Mr. Frank,

422
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,300
with all due respect,

423
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,730
I am Chinese.

424
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,380
My first priority

425
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,740
will always be the interests of the Chinese people.

426
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,020
Mr. Yun, you're back.

427
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,980
You two, come to my study.

428
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:12,890
Shen,

429
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,270
wait here.

430
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:35,540
Dad,

431
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,290
I just want to ask you one question.

432
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,960
Are you still Chinese?

433
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,980
Do you remember what you told me

434
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,820
when you decided to go to France to study finance?

435
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,340
Mr. Zhang Si once said,

436
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,970
"Among the best ways to save the country,

437
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,700
education is like flowers, while the army and navy are like fruits.

438
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,400
But the foundation lies in industry."

439
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,510
So, I've made up my mind

440
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,500
to study finance

441
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:57,360
and pursue the path of saving the country through industry in the future.

442
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:57,970
But later,

443
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,920
you dropped out and came to Shanghai to find me.

444
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:01,780
Why?

445
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,190
Dad,

446
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:04,860
given the current situation,

447
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,700
industry alone can no longer save China.

448
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,070
Winning this war is the urgent priority.

449
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,790
Please stop telling me about that

450
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,650
"more friends means more paths."

451
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,860
The French

452
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,460
will never truly be our friends.

453
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,860
I just want an honest answer from you today.

454
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,970
If we're on different paths...

455
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:20,770
What then?

456
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,270
Then we can only part ways.

457
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,240
Alright, I see you're determined.

458
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,020
Before I answer your question,

459
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,350
could you explain

460
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,690
your series of

461
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,770
foolish and reckless actions today?

462
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:35,500
The reason I got involved with the NBIS's business

463
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,020
is simply because Chinese people should help fellow Chinese,

464
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,510
even if there are many things they've done that I disapprove of.

465
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,010
As for preventing Viscount

466
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,860
from meeting the person hiding in the wine house,

467
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,560
it was because I thought he was very important.

468
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,440
If we can keep him under control,

469
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,330
then, to us...

470
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,960
Do you think Viscount is a pushover?

471
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,720
Let me tell you.

472
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,200
You've already been exposed,

473
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,350
including me.

474
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,450
I don't know

475
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,490
when he started investigating me,

476
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,710
nor do I know how far he's gone with it.

477
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,760
This is too passive.

478
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,210
I don't like this feeling at all.

479
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,310
I've actually

480
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,050
let such a formidable enemy

481
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,550
spy on me unchecked for so long.

482
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,870
This is the biggest disgrace of my career as an agent.

483
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,310
Sorry, Mr. Tanaka.

484
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,820
It was my fault for being negligent.

485
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:25,970
I'll take responsibility for this.

486
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,370
After all,

487
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,630
it was my carelessness.

488
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,610
But you must remember

489
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,490
that mistakes like this

490
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:36,090
are something you only make once in a lifetime.

491
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:36,900
I understand.

492
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,700
Thank you, Mr. Tanaka.

493
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:44,500
Yun Muzhi,

494
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,760
what a pity.

495
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,320
Such beautiful sunlight,

496
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,220
yet you'll never see it again.

497
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,290
Impossible.

498
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,390
I'm quite certain that they didn't discover me.

499
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,150
Viscount

500
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,070
will probably pin this on the NBIS.

501
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,300
You've underestimated the people in the wine house.

502
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,510
What about Takahashi?

503
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,630
Why did he

504
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,090
rush over there so quickly?

505
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,690
Don't you find that strange?

506
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,570
If you had only helped the NBIS

507
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,680
at the train station

508
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,480
without preventing Viscount from meeting them,

509
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,180
then it would have been fine,

510
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,530
and this case today would have been a dead end—

511
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:20,690
no one would trace it back to us anytime soon.

512
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:21,440
But you

513
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,490
handed them evidence on a silver platter, rushing to get caught.

514
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:25,430
You acted on your own,

515
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,890
being so self-righteous,

516
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:29,330
and tried to stop Viscount from meeting them.

517
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:31,080
Do you think you succeeded in this?

518
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,260
Well, let me tell you,

519
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,980
Viscount set a trap,

520
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:35,610
and you walked right into it.

521
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,010
Are you saying

522
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,620
that Viscount started suspecting at the train station

523
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,490
that the person who took down their sniper

524
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,000
wasn't from the NBIS?

525
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,900
He's been undercover in China for all these years

526
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,500
and hasn't been discovered.

527
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,830
Why?

528
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,900
Because he's smart,

529
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,290
he's sharp,

530
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,420
and he doesn't believe in coincidences.

531
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,170
Zhou took down the Japanese sniper

532
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,230
with just one shot.

533
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,380
This is a key point.

534
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,890
Based on this, Viscount could deduce

535
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,710
that there was a third party at the train station.

536
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,980
You've been following him for such a long time,

537
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,310
so you should know his style of operation.

538
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:14,030
After such an incident happened at the train station,

539
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,370
he should have returned to the Far East Communications Bureau right away

540
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:17,820
to continue his role as a shareholder,

541
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,820
rather than going on to meet others.

542
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,710
What does this indicate?

543
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,780
It indicates that this was a trap,

544
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,240
and you were the one who walked right into it!

545
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:34,420
Let me ask you,

546
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,680
do you still remember

547
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39,730
the first task I assigned to you?

548
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:46,380
Yes, I do.

549
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,710
You asked me to collect the body

550
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,310
of a colleague I didn't know.

551
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,550
He had infiltrated the Military Police Command

552
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:56,160
and was caught while transmitting intelligence.

553
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,620
The Japanese hung his body

554
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,680
at the entrance of the Military Police Command.

555
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,760
You asked me to find a way to steal it back

556
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,710
so he could be properly buried.

557
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:09,360
How many times have you carried out this task?

558
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,160
How many bodies have you buried?

559
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,250
37 times.

560
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:18,490
In the past six months,

561
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,030
I've handled 68 bodies in total.

562
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,330
I don't know their names.

563
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:29,610
When burying them, I couldn't even put up a tombstone.

564
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,250
Dad, I know

565
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:34,130
why you asked me to carry out such a task.

566
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,620
You wanted to show me

567
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,420
how brutal this war is.

568
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,980
But I'm not afraid.

569
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,790
I've long been prepared to sacrifice my life.

570
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,060
I take pride in fighting for the same cause as them.

571
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,080
I just hope

572
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,290
I can live as a Chinese with dignity.

573
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,580
Everything I've given

574
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:56,730
is to save our people

575
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,390
and to bring freedom to this country.

576
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,350
Do you understand?

577
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,520
I understand, of course I do.

578
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,720
I know you're prepared to sacrifice at any time.

579
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,960
But sacrifice is not the hardest part.

580
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,510
The hardest part

581
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:15,800
is watching your comrades

582
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,580
sacrifice right in front of you.

583
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,140
Son,

584
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,740
you've always wanted to know

585
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,870
what secret I've been hiding from you.

586
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,150
Today, let me ask you:

587
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,060
If I place the same secret

588
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,540
on your shoulders,

589
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,620
would you be able to bear it?

590
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:43,730
No, Cousin.

591
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:45,640
It's not convenient for you right now.

592
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,700
So many people in the family are depending on you alone.

593
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,490
All you need to do is keep an eye

594
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,490
on which organizations are hiring.

595
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,160
I don't need you to arrange a job for me directly.

596
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:56,670
Now tell me,

597
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:59,870
Why did Qu Wenzhi end up in the hands of the Japanese?

598
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,290
Where is he now?

599
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,600
Mr. Cheng.

600
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,920
Cut the crap!

601
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,530
What I want is a solution!

602
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,370
[Zheng He, an agent from the Kuomintang NBIS Shanghai Station]

603
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,740
I think Cousin's suggestion is good.

604
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,170
Qu Wenzhi is a hot potato right now.

605
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,480
Whoever recklessly takes him over will face endless problems.

606
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,240
An officer of Qu Wenzhi's rank,

607
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,250
whether in wartime or peacetime,

608
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,780
is always closely monitored by intelligence agencies.

609
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,820
In this situation,

610
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,660
he was quietly turned

611
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:26,940
and then orchestrated

612
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,740
a well-planned assassination.

613
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,410
The water here is too deep.

614
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:31,340
No one knows

615
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:34,230
what kind of secrets will eventually be uncovered.

616
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,100
Mr. Wen.

617
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,130
What do you need from me?

618
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:14,490
Hello?

619
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:15,930
This is Yun Muzhi.

620
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,250
Muzhi,

621
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,420
it's me,

622
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,050
Cheng Huize.

623
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,170
Please speak.

624
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:23,410
Muzhi,

625
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:26,540
thank you for what happened at the wine house.

626
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,130
If you hadn't notified me in time

627
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:30,330
that the person was transferred there,

628
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,740
I might have lost track of him.

629
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,700
I like people who speak plainly.

630
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,420
Also,

631
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,450
I have something important to tell you.

632
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:43,310
The person at the wine house has disappeared again.

633
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:44,700
Please

634
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,200
keep an eye out for him.

635
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:48,110
I'm someone who repays kindness.

636
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,570
As it happens, I have some intelligence on the Germans.

637
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,130
I think Mr. Frank

638
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:55,430
would be very interested in it.

639
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:56,030
I'm sorry,

640
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,650
but I'm not interested in this intelligence.

641
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:09,990
Dad.

642
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,420
Now that Viscount knows he's been exposed,

643
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,960
he'll speed up his actions.

644
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,410
The wine reception tonight won't be peaceful.

645
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:22,250
Be prepared.

646
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,580
You mean

647
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:24,800
we'll also be closing the net tonight?

648
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,290
Yes.

649
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,690
Since things are out in the open now,

650
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,490
there's no need to hide anymore.

651
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,550
I'll make the specific action plan,

652
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,500
but there's one task I'll assign to you.

653
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,210
What task?

654
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,350
The person at the wine house has disappeared.

655
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,700
Go and find him.

656
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,340
It was Cheng Huize who asked you to help find him, wasn't it?

657
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,670
You've been exchanging intelligence with him all these years.

658
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:46,980
Are you the same as him?

659
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:47,740
Shen,

660
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,440
I've told you that,

661
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:50,830
before you're ready

662
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,750
to bear those secrets,

663
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,450
please don't pry into things.

664
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,140
Let me continue.

665
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,500
At 10:28 this morning,

666
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,380
Xu Meijia received a phone call.

667
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,990
This is what was said on the call:

668
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:04,890
Mei,

669
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,980
I've bought the British perfume

670
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,530
you mentioned last time.

671
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,460
Wrong number.

672
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:13,420
This call was made

673
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:15,730
from a phone booth

674
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,620
on Xiafei Road.

675
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,900
I wasn't convinced earlier,

676
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,790
but now, after hearing this,

677
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,460
I'm truly convinced.

678
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,500
You even have the exact time

679
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,889
and content of the call.

680
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:30,360
I guess you didn't just place one informant

681
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,489
around Viscount.

682
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,949
I arrived at the wine house at 9:50 AM.

683
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:38,880
I spent less than ten minutes entering and exiting.

684
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,139
The person hiding in the wine house

685
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:42,340
had already disappeared before 10:00.

686
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,500
During this time,

687
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:45,520
Viscount and Xu Meijia managed

688
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,350
to get rid of No. 76.

689
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:49,880
By the time I arrived at that place,

690
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,540
they had already returned to the Far East Communications Bureau.

691
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,300
10:28 AM, Xiafei Road,

692
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,900
these are two key pieces of information.

693
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,510
The person should have been escorted

694
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,640
[Xiafei Road]

695
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,130
to a safer location.

696
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:04,070
Someone promptly reported the situation to Xu Meijia.

697
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,440
That safe location is very close to Xiafei Road,

698
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,720
within walking distance of no more than three minutes.

699
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,200
Your analysis is spot on.

700
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,580
And then?

701
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,240
I thought of a place:

702
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:14,360
Shanghai Hotel.

703
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,850
So many things happened this morning.

704
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,650
Viscount certainly wouldn't specifically

705
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,190
take the time to meet that person.

706
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,120
But that person is very important.

707
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,890
So Viscount must meet him as soon as possible.

708
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:54,350
That safe location must be a place

709
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:57,370
that wouldn't raise any suspicion even if he goes there.

710
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:59,230
Shanghai Hotel has a mixed crowd.

711
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,780
Hiding someone there

712
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:02,970
won't easily expose them

713
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,070
and will allow Viscount

714
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,210
to meet that person without raising suspicion.

715
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,650
It's killing two birds with one stone.

716
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,090
If I remember correctly,

717
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:10,960
there is a phone booth

718
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:13,050
near the back door of Shanghai Hotel.

719
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:14,870
That's right.

720
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,570
There are only a few hours left before tonight's wine reception.

721
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,170
Confirm the details quickly

722
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,460
and notify me as soon as possible.

723
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,100
Okay.

724
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,480
[Xiafei Road]

725
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:45,330
Not bad.

726
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,290
Our bank is holding a wine reception here.

727
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,560
This might affect

728
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,660
the guests here.

729
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,260
How about this?

730
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:55,010
For guests who check in today and tomorrow,

731
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:57,210
send a bottle of red wine to their rooms.

732
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,230
Second Young Master, you handle things so generously.

733
00:36:59,230 --> 00:36:59,760
Alright.

734
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,250
Thank you, Second Young Master.

735
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:01,980
Look,

736
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,060
there are exactly twelve bottles of red wine here.

737
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,090
Do you think it's enough?

738
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,890
If not, I'll have them go buy more.

739
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:07,540
How about this?

740
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,990
Let me check the check-in list first.

741
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,190
Please wait a moment.

742
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,190
What a coincidence.

743
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:50,570
Exactly twelve bottles.

744
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,200
Great.

745
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:52,980
Miss Qi.

746
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,510
Then please arrange for people to deliver the wine.

747
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,840
Certainly, no problem.

748
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,110
Second Young Master said

749
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:58,870
this wine

750
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,630
can be considered a gift from you.

751
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,270
Is this...

752
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:02,340
appropriate?

753
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,300
Our Second Young Master doesn't know those guests.

754
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,830
He's just doing you a favor.

755
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,620
Besides, you know that

756
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:09,650
our Second Young Master

757
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,010
loves making friends.

758
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:11,850
I understand.

759
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,050
Thank you, Miss Qi.

760
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:16,450
Second Young Master,

761
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:18,650
I'll definitely see you as my friend.

762
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,450
Servants.

763
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:20,890
Yes.

764
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:21,930
Deliver the wine.

765
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:22,420
Okay.

766
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,850
Second Young Master,

767
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,380
please sit here for a while.

768
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,890
I've confirmed with Cheng Huize.

769
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:38,610
His friend, Zhou,

770
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,040
was a security guard during the Seven People's Meeting back then.

771
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:47,010
[Yang Ziming, a CPC agent, Minister of the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Kuomintang Changsha Government]

772
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:43,830
Great.

773
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:45,950
This information is crucial.

774
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,850
It will be very helpful

775
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,690
for our future investigations.

776
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,020
But this Kunwu...

777
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,860
I've been looking for him for five years

778
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,610
and haven't found any leads.

779
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:58,960
The Kuramoto incident five years ago

780
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,950
revealed Kunwu's whereabouts,

781
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:02,830
but since then,

782
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:04,990
he's been completely silent,

783
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:08,580
as if he never existed.

784
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,360
This Kunwu

785
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,530
has become a constant worry for us.

786
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:14,980
The Secret Strategic Agent Plan

787
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,910
that the Japanese are carrying out

788
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,710
was concocted by Okamura Ningji.

789
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:21,580
At every key point,

790
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:23,920
they placed the elite of the elite.

791
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:26,120
They are extremely dangerous

792
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,180
and deeply hidden,

793
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:29,470
especially this mysterious Kunwu.

794
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,310
Indeed.

795
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,490
The more mysterious it is,

796
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:35,540
the more dangerous it often is.

797
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,530
I've thought it through.

798
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:39,610
No matter what the cost,

799
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,830
I must uncover Kunwu this time.

800
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:51,010
What?

801
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,620
Our manager said that

802
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,620
there's a wine reception tonight,

803
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,790
which might disturb the guests.

804
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:57,310
So, he sent a bottle of red wine to apologize.

805
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:58,960
Room 502...

806
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,280
Unless someone from Room 502 calls you,

807
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,800
don't come up here,

808
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:04,280
and don't send anything.

809
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:04,920
Got it?

810
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,190
Got it, got it.

811
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:06,800
Let's go.

812
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:10,620
Now that the Japanese troops are at the gates of Changsha,

813
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,580
a tough battle is inevitable.

814
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,480
The Organization wants me to return to Changsha

815
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,350
to personally carry out some of the key points

816
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:19,000
from the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth CPC Central Committee.

817
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,680
Among them, two points are the most important:

818
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:22,660
First,

819
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,220
to develop and strengthen the guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines.

820
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:26,820
Second,

821
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:30,120
to continue the cooperation with the Kuomintang in resistance against Japan

822
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,550
and do our utmost to support

823
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:35,030
the National Revolutionary Army in achieving victory on the front lines.

824
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:35,990
I've got you covered.

825
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:37,110
Are you gonna top that?

826
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:37,700
-No.
-Second Young Master.

827
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,650
Four fives.

828
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:40,470
What's the matter?

829
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:41,600
Second Young Master, I'm sorry.

830
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,800
There's a guest here

831
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,150
who said he doesn't need it.

832
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:44,710
Here.

833
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:46,070
There's a bottle of red wine left.

834
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:46,730
It's yours.

835
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:47,560
This...

836
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,800
I really can't accept it.

837
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:50,850
We're friends.

838
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:51,980
No need to be polite.

839
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,810
More friends means more paths.

840
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:54,490
Are you gonna top that?

841
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:55,550
It's truly my honor

842
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,150
to be friends with you.

843
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,040
Well then, I'll graciously accept it.

844
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,920
Which room is this guest in?

845
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,290
He doesn't know what's good.

846
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:04,950
This wine is quite expensive.

847
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,110
Indeed it is.

848
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:08,010
It's the guest in Room 502.

849
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:10,410
He just checked in this morning.

850
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,710
But I find this guy rather sneaky

851
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:14,110
and he doesn't seem like a good person.

852
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,770
If he knew what he was getting,

853
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,950
it would be strange.

854
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,360
It's probably for the best that he doesn't know.

855
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,440
You're in luck.

856
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:20,470
Thank you.

857
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,760
Well, please continue playing.

858
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:26,160
He checked in at 10:23 AM,

859
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,790
behaving suspiciously.

860
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:29,190
And he was even alert enough

861
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,300
to refuse a bottle of expensive red wine

862
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,300
offered for free.

863
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,710
The person Yun Hongshen is looking for

864
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:37,060
is in Room 502.

865
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:39,170
By the way, Muzhi,

866
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,910
after I leave Shanghai,

867
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:45,190
you'll need to temporarily cut contact with your family.

868
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,280
As you know,

869
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,730
for an undercover agent of your level,

870
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:50,750
the Organization won't easily let anyone

871
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,150
know your true identity.

872
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,180
Only under very special circumstances

873
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,150
will someone use a backup code

874
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,400
to contact you.

875
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:58,730
Half a photo?

876
00:41:59,390 --> 00:41:59,920
Yes.

877
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:01,520
I see.

878
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,980
I hope that when we meet again,

879
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,650
China will be our own China.

880
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:09,780
Yes.

881
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,050
I also hope this war ends soon.

882
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:15,830
Muzhi,

883
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,200
I'm very happy to be fighting side by side

884
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,800
with you.

885
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:21,860
So am I.

886
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,350
Hello?

887
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,010
Who is it?

888
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:33,540
Dad, it's me.

889
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:36,160
I've almost finished preparing on my side.

890
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,090
It should meet your expectations.

891
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:38,960
By the way, Dad,

892
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:40,900
I just checked

893
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:42,890
and found that five invitations were left to be sent out.

894
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:44,000
Some of these guests

895
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,310
are our acquaintances,

896
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:47,050
so a phone call from you to explain

897
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:48,050
would clear it up.

898
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,710
But there are two guests

899
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,500
who should receive the invitations formally.

900
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,140
Alright.

901
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:54,870
These are trivial matters

902
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:56,700
that can be handled.

903
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,670
You should watch your own behavior.

904
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:00,480
I hope all the guests tonight

905
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,540
will have an unforgettable evening.

906
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:04,850
Okay, Dad.
