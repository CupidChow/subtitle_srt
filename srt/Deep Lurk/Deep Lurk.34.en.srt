[Episode 34]

3
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,910
Looking at these dossiers,

4
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,920
Yun Hongshen became increasingly certain—

5
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,110
Kunwu wasn't Ling Han,

6
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,670
but someone else.

7
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,670
As more details

8
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,070
unfolded before his eyes,

9
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,060
the doubts and evidence

10
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,070
all pointed in one direction—

11
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,230
Ke Jingping.

12
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,710
The likelihood of him being Kunwu

13
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,860
was the highest.

14
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,950
Shengxingcai...

15
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,840
Shengxing...

16

19
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,950
You don't have to wait for me.

20
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,800
I'm fine now.

21
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,310
I just had a moment of reflection.

22
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,070
About Ling Han,

23
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,090
the Chief did his best.

24
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,630
He has his reasons. Don't blame him.

25
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,830
If you're feeling frustrated, just say it.

26
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,070
Don't bottle it all up.

27
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,580
Even if venting doesn't solve the problem,

28
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,910
it might lighten the weight

29
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,830
on your chest.

30
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,510
Right?

31
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,230
If she knew the truth,

32
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,070
how painful would it be for her?

33
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:22,630
Yun Hongshen?

34
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,230
It will all pass.

35
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,110
Head upstairs.

36
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,950
Sleep early.

37
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,320
Okay, let me ask you.

38
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,430
Have you ever suspected that Yun Hongshen might be a Communist?

39
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:16,750
What would you do

40
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,950
if it were me?

41
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,160
And what if I ultimately decide

42
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,390
to follow the Chief?

43
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,990
What would you do?

44
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,159
Did he say anything to you?

45
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,120
Nothing.

46
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,470
He's just a little disappointed.

47
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,670
You can't bear his disappointment,

48
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,550
can you?

49
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,870
Walk with me for a while.

50
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,950
He isn't someone who shows warmth easily.

51
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,870
But over the years,

52
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,110
he tried to be a brother to me—

53
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,390
even a father figure.

54
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,150
When I struggled with my studies,

55
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,230
he'd help, no matter how exhausted he was.

56
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,070
When I got hurt,

57
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,350
he'd buy medicine for me.

58
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,150
When my bluntness offended people,

59
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,910
he'd quietly smooth things over.

60
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,170
Last year, I suffered a serious gunshot wound

61
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,710
and was unconscious for over ten hours.

62
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,750
He waited outside the operating room the entire time.

63
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,110
I'm not just grateful to him.

64
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,390
I've spent ten years by his side.

65
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,230
I see him as my family.

66
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:51,710
I understand.

67
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,310
Ever since you lost your family,

68
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:56,480
he's been your emotional anchor.

69
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,370
But the way he looked at me earlier...

70
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,740
When he said, "I'm disappointed in you,"

71
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,710
I couldn't handle it.

72
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,110
You see.

73
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,980
I'm not as strong as you think I am.

74
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,470
I have my weaknesses too.

75
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,260
That's not a weakness.

76
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,950
That's loyalty to your feelings.

77
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,560
No matter which direction we choose,

78
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,700
as long as we reach the same destination in the end,

79
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,640
it's enough.

80
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,230
Does the path we take really matter?

81
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,630
If you take the wrong path,

82
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,150
you might never reach the destination.

83
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,110
Some choices,

84
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,110
if wrong from the start,

85
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,820
can't lead to the same ending.

86
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,670
But no matter what happens, I'll walk this path with you.

87
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,550
How can you be so sure

88
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,980
the path you've chosen is the right one?

89
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,070
You already know the answer,

90
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:27,620
don't you?

91
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,030
Alright.

92
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:32,970
It's getting late.

93
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:33,820
You should go home now.

94
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:37,110
Take your time with this decision.

95
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,510
Think it through

96
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,429
carefully.

97
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,710
This time,

98
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,580
I hope you can live for yourself

99
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:51,870
and walk a path

100
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,790
that's truly worth taking.

101
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,070
Second Young Master,

102
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,150
you're back.

103
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,270
Where is my brother?

104
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,070
In his room.

105
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,390
I'm back.

106
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,190
How did it go?

107
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,350
Did you catch him?

108
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,070
Ling Han is dead.

109
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,950
Mi Lan and Zong Fang have escaped.

110
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:36,910
Hongqi,

111
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,390
can you stay down?

112
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,070
You two talk.

113
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,640
I'll go replace Dao.

114
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,270
How are you feeling today?

115
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,200
Any better?

116
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,350
Much better.

117
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,230
You should rest more,

118
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,710
so you can recover quickly.

119
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:06,750
By the way,

120
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,340
after dinner, I dozed off for a bit.

121
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,710
But I couldn't sleep soundly.

122
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,820
I kept waking up.

123
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,830
I had this strange feeling like someone was walking outside.

124
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,040
Probably my brother and Dao

125
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,150
made some noise

126
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,000
while taking turns to keep watch.

127
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,230
Their footsteps are pretty distinct,

128
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,060
but it didn't quite feel like them.

129
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,950
Maybe I was just imagining things.

130
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,830
Anyway,

131
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,990
why couldn't you save Ling Han?

132
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,230
Ke Jingping was monitoring him personally.

133
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,950
There was no way to intervene.

134
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:36,870
Before Ling Han died,

135
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,190
I told him the truth about his origins.

136
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,390
You did your best.

137
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,350
You have no reason

138
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,620
to blame yourself.

139
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,670
Since the Organization has confirmed

140
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,910
that Kunwu is someone else,

141
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,470
then the person with the most control over this entire situation,

142
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,550
the one pulling all the strings is Ke Jingping.

143
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,870
Your suspicions

144
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,900
were right.

145
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,200
He's terrifying—

146
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,590
manipulating everything from the shadows,

147
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,430
toying with everyone in his grasp.

148
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,080
Even Ling Han, someone so skilled,

149
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,470
ended up being his scapegoat.

150
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,420
What's more terrifying

151
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,110
is how flawlessly he's hidden it all.

152
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,190
If the Organization hadn't uncovered

153
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,310
Ling Han's true identity,

154
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,870
we'd all still be fooled by him.

155
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,130
If Zong Fang hadn't forged that false background for Ling Han

156
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,240
and dragged him into this mess,

157
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,070
his life

158
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,670
could've been so different.

159
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:36,140
Ke Jingping is a formidable opponent.

160
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,120
Secretary Wu,

161
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:43,190
I suspect Ling Han may have left something for me

162
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,490
at Shengxing Hotel.

163
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,630
That would suggest he had something he wanted you to take care of.

164
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,870
I think so.

165
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,470
Though Ling Han wasn't Kunwu,

166
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,020
he certainly did his share of bad deeds.

167
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,070
If he left something behind,

168
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,470
it could be a trap.

169
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,030
When I saw him this afternoon,

170
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,750
I hinted that

171
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,390
I knew he wasn't Kunwu.

172
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,470
He seemed to understand.

173
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,350
The fewer mistakes you make,

174
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,710
the more options you have.

175
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,470
Sometimes, a slip of thought

176
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,270
can lead to an entirely different outcome.

177
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,700
Ling Han is meticulous in his actions.

178
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,270
After he fell out with Ke Jingping

179
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,520
and made such a bold move to seize the codebook,

180
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,240
he must have had a backup plan.

181
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,300
If he got the codebook,

182
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,950
he would have had more leverage

183
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,280
to go head-to-head with Ke Jingping.

184
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,310
But if he failed

185
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,900
or died at Ke Jingping's hands,

186
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:37,840
Ling Han

187
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,320
would have left behind

188
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,620
something to expose Ke Jingping.

189
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:49,870
If the thing he left

190
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,830
can prove Ke Jingping is Kunwu...

191
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,360
If Ling Han had anything left behind,

192
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,990
it would be a clue, not direct evidence.

193
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,070
But a clue is better than nothing.

194
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,550
He likely realized Ke Jingping was a threat

195
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,350
long before I did.

196
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,240
If we continue digging,

197
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,190
we should uncover something sooner or later.

198
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:13,700
Then everything falls into place.

199
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,470
For both personal and professional reasons,

200
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,840
you won't let Ke Jingping off the hook.

201
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,390
If you have it,

202
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,350
you can make the most use of it.

203
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,870
I didn't expect

204
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,840
you two, as rivals,

205
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,470
would join forces in this way.

206
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,350
But I haven't retrieved the item yet.

207
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,950
I suspect Ke Jingping

208
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,150
already knew

209
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,880
that I was starting to doubt him.

210
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,910
He's much more dangerous than Ling Han ever was.

211
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,230
Why do you think so?

212
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,670
He asked me a question this afternoon.

213
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,390
Also, when you went to rescue those children—

214
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,230
you knew it was a trap set by Ling Han,

215
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,830
but you still walked right into it.

216
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,950
Why didn't you take the key

217
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,080
back to the station first?

218
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,310
If you and Wen Yeming

219
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,670
had fallen into his hands,

220
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,160
the safety would have been compromised.

221
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,310
Weren't you worried that Ling Han would get this codebook?

222
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,350
I managed to

223
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,240
cover up his suspicion,

224
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,780
but I still worry.

225
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:14,910
Ke Jingping wouldn't ask me

226
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,510
such a question for no reason.

227
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,000
If he wants to take action against you,

228
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,110
he wouldn't wait—

229
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,470
he'd move immediately.

230
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,230
And Myna's codebook...

231
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,830
He has the cipher key already,

232
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,990
and now he has the codebook.

233
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,070
If he destroys these two things

234
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,350
or tampers with them,

235
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,750
we will never get

236
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,510
this precious information.

237
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:35,470
I know what the cipher key is.

238
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,820
Live to death...

239
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,140
Year Nine...

240
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,650
Flowers in the Mirror.

241
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,570
The Flowers in the Mirror of the Ninth Year in the Republic of China.

242
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:56,600
This is the cipher key.

243
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,640
Great!

244
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,170
Get you through right away.

245
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,560
Report!

246
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,010
Sir, urgent telegram.

247
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,430
Commander, the telegram.

248
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,350
Due to the unique terrain of Changsha,

249
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,290
the routes for the Japanese sneak attack are no more than two.

250
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,130
First,

251
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,670
westward via the Yueyang Lake direction.

252
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,550
Second, eastward via the Jiangxi direction.

253
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,470
The combat strength of the Ninth War Zone is limited;

254
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,550
there are only so many elite units.

255
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,500
They can't attack from both east and west.

256
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,750
With this precise intelligence,

257
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,320
our losses can be significantly reduced.

258
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:58,910
Secretary Wu,

259
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,310
something feels off.

260
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,550
Dad was still the same as before,

261
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,190
always hiding a new bill

262
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,110
inside a stack of old ones.

263
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,080
Movies are just for fun;

264
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,230
you don't need to take it so seriously.

265
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,560
But she acted so well.

266
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,960
It felt so real.

267
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:35,470
[Go south secretly]
[Evade the army defense]
[Sneak attack Changsha]

268
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:35,470
[6th, 13th, and 33rd Divisions to lead the frontal assault; the 3rd Division to cross Yueyang Lake from the west]

269
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,310
Off?

270
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,210
There's something wrong with this information.

271
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,790
Yun Hongshen might be suspicious of my identity.

272
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,670
Are you sure?

273
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,240
It's just a hunch.

274
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,490
This afternoon, he took the key to meet Ling Han.

275
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,690
That's highly suspicious.

276
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,510
Tonight's operation at the church—

277
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,970
he didn't want me on the scene.

278
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,520
Before he left the station,

279
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,540
he secretly went to the archive room.

280
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:13,500
I'm not sure what he found out,

281
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:15,290
but these small details

282
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:16,660
make me suspect

283
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,000
that he's growing suspicious of me.

284
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:21,579
I don't understand.

285
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,520
From the beginning of the Hunting Operation,

286
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,000
every step has been under your calculation,

287
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,570
without any flaws.

288
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,450
How did he start doubting you?

289
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,510
Ling Han.

290
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,630
Ling Han?

291
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,670
But he doesn't know much

292
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,590
and can't provide any valuable information.

293
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,510
You're wrong.

294
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,590
He can provide

295
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,060
one very valuable piece of information:

296
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,390
Ling Han is not Kunwu.

297
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,910
The letter I entrusted to the Viscount to send back to my family in Japan

298
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,220
was seen by Yun Hongshen.

299
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,080
He knows Kunwu has a family in Japan.

300
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,690
It must have been an instinctive reaction of a rival in love.

301
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,470
Yun Hongshen likely sensed

302
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,950
that Ling Han's feelings for Wen Yeming were genuine.

303
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,870
If those feelings are real,

304
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,150
then this letter creates a contradiction.

305
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,430
If he finds out Ling Han wasn't Kunwu,

306
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,710
he'll also realize

307
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,430
the information about Myna was falsified.

308
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,390
And you—

309
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,110
you are the person who can unravel all his doubts.

310
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,590
You'll also become the most vulnerable link

311
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,990
in this operation.

312
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,590
I see.

313
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,630
I am prepared to give my life for my country.

314
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,190
Once I'm dead,

315
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,060
Yun Hongshen will have no way to investigate further

316
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,680
I'll put myself in his line of fire

317
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,560
and completely dispel his suspicions.

318
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,510
Hishiko.

319
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:45,370
You...

320
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,590
You're excellent.

321
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,110
You're an outstanding spy.

322
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,350
I'm sorry that in the end,

323
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,460
we still have to sacrifice you.

324
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,790
It is my honor.

325
00:18:59,200 --> 00:18:59,990
I've been waiting

326
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,200
for this moment for a long time.

327
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,050
But considering the actual situation,

328
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,630
sneaking in from the west via Yueyang Lake

329
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:21,690
is precisely the most advantageous route

330
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,480
for the Japanese army.

331
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,310
Secretary Wu,

332
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,290
do you remember

333
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,510
how Han Xin defeated Wei Bao in The Biography of Marquis Huaiyin?

334
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,920
Wei Bao's main forces were stationed at Puban,

335
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,310
blocking the ferry at Linjin Pass.

336
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,830
Han Xin had Guan Ying feign a crossing at Linjin Pass,

337
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,670
while Wei's main forces crossed the river

338
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,630
to attack Anyi.

339
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,990
When Wei Bao adjusted his defense,

340
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,750
Guan Ying led his troops across the river to cut off Wei Bao's retreat.

341
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,590
They launched a pincer attack,

342
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,630
leading to a crushing defeat for the Wei army.

343
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:45,910
In that battle,

344
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,270
the weakest and most overlooked force

345
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,330
was Guan Ying's.

346
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:52,430
But it played a crucial role.

347
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,430
Now, among the Japanese forces

348
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,990
surrounding Changsha,

349
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,500
the 106th Division

350
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,880
is the one most likely to be ignored.

351
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,880
Last year, the 106th Division

352
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,770
was surrounded by the Nationalist forces at Wanjialing

353
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,240
and was nearly wiped out.

354
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,510
Would the Japanese really use a defeated division

355
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,850
to conduct a strategic maneuver?

356
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,990
Deception is the essence of war.

357
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,160
Okamura Yasuji likely calculated that everyone would think that way—

358
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,870
and then did the opposite.

359
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,600
Would Okamura Yasuji really take such a risk?"

360
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:20,820
The 106th Division

361
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,590
is a seasoned force.

362
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,470
The troops

363
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,840
who survived Wanjialing

364
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,710
are now battle-hardened veterans.

365
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,730
Their division commander, Matsura Junrokuro,

366
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,460
is one of Okamura Yasuji's fiercest generals.

367
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,010
This so-called "defeated division"

368
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,760
cannot be underestimated.

369
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,690
That makes sense,

370
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,640
but you need concrete evidence.

371
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,820
Without it, basing this on conjecture alone

372
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,130
to overturn intelligence

373
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,820
that cost countless comrades

374
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,990
their blood and lives isn't enough.

375
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,960
From Qu Wenzhi's defection

376
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,030
to Myna obtaining such critical intelligence,

377
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,590
this entire sequence of events

378
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,350
is part of a massive conspiracy.

379
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,030
Go ahead.

380
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,870
There's one pivotal figure in all of this—

381
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:10,790
Mi Lan.

382
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,820
I couldn't figure out

383
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,550
why she was lurking around me.

384
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,660
If her goal was to steal the codebook,

385
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,350
she never showed any real intent to pry.

386
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,870
If she was investigating me,

387
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,840
her actions didn't seem particularly effective either.

388
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,960
Until her identity was revealed,

389
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,970
it became clear—she was deliberately helping me.

390
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,900
When I was decrypting Myna's code,

391
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,820
she subtly guided me,

392
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,920
giving me critical clues.

393
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,870
Later, when I pursued Li Miaohan and Zong Fang,

394
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:37,950
it was with her help

395
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,180
that I found breakthroughs.

396
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:40,590
Without her,

397
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,450
things wouldn't have progressed so smoothly.

398
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,800
Why would she,

399
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,610
as a Japanese spy,

400
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,590
help you crack the code of Myna

401
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,000
and then lead you to capture her own accomplices?

402
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,950
There must be something much deeper going on here.

403
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,630
So, Mi Lan's purpose in staying close to me

404
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,880
was to guide me step by step

405
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,460
toward Myna's intelligence.

406
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,320
Also,

407
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,140
Ke Jingping's reaction throughout this entire event

408
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,410
is extremely suspicious.

409
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,490
Even though he's not in a hurry to obtain the codebook,

410
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,990
he still makes it seem

411
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,160
as though it's of critical importance.

412
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,940
He's using this intelligence as a tool.

413
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,290
This is just a strategic deception plan.

414
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,040
The Japanese first toss out
a high-value

415
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,110
piece of intelligence as bait,

416
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,870
luring everyone to fight for it.

417
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,410
The more people

418
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,470
scramble and die for it,

419
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,990
the more it proves this intelligence is undeniably real.

420
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,030
But their true objective

421
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,780
is to use this fake intelligence

422
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,310
to mislead frontline commanders,

423
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,450
forcing them to make wrong decisions.

How much longer will it take?

and a beautiful daughter.

When you secretly sold intelligence,

433
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,870
did you ever think about them?

I beg you,

436
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,190
please spare my family.

437
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,070
As long as you let them go,

438
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,550
I'll do anything.

439
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,550
Later,

440
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,520
I'll give you a piece of intelligence.

441
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,630
Remember,

442
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:45,390
you must sell it to your old customer,

443
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,540
Myna, for an extraordinarily high price.

444
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,590
After Myna gets the fake intelligence,

445
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,510
he'll spread the word in the intelligence circles.

446
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,920
He chose two targets.

447
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,630
One was my father, the other was Ke Jingping.

448
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,600
Why?

449
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,350
Because my father has always been willing to

450
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,430
pay top dollar for intelligence.

451
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,610
As for Ke Jingping,

452
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,570
this intelligence relates to Changsha,

453
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,560
and his subordinates were also operating in Shanghai.

454
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,880
Ke Jingping is truly insidious and cunning,

455
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,260
a master of devious tricks.

456
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:20,870
This is just the beginning.

457
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,430
They even exploited my overconfidence.

458
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,590
If I hadn't been blindly confident,

459
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,220
my father wouldn't have died.

460
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,910
Comrade Muzhi's sacrifice

461
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,420
is indeed a tremendous loss.

462
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:38,430
He knows

463
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,650
I'll keep investigating,

464
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,310
so he continuously throws out bait,

465
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,390
forcing me to press on.

466
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,470
Myna, the codebook,

467
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,910
Li Liang, Zong Fang, Zhang Hua,

468
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:49,830
even Ling Han—

469
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,680
every move was part of his plan.

470
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,550
We were all led by the nose.

471
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,860
He's so close to succeeding now,

472
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,510
but we have no evidence

473
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,470
to prove he's the mastermind.

474
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,550
Without evidence,

475
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:08,160
this is just an assumption.

476
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,490
His understanding of people

477
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,550
and his ability to plan things

478
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,390
is terrifying.

479
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,510
He's the most terrifying opponent I've ever seen.

480
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,310
Evidence...

481
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,790
Without evidence,

482
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,850
Changsha is in danger.

483
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,140
I certainly won't let him succeed.

484
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,370
We must find key, solid evidence

485
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,660
before he presents this

Don't worry.

and break through from her,

491
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,310
there will be countless gains to be had.

00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,230
He sent me a letter,

563
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,670
though I don't know how it was delivered.

564
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,990
In it, he told me to leave Changsha,

565
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:43,230
to take my family and live in hiding.

566
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:46,890
The letter included this.

567
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,510
He told me to keep it safe,

568
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:50,820
saying

569
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,590
it might come in handy someday.

570
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,550
Secretary Wu,

571
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,170
I must investigate

572
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,600
Ke Jingping's secret room.

573
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,590
If this is his biggest secret,

574
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:08,260
it won't be easy to infiltrate.

575
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,670
The danger will be immense.

576
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,950
I have to go no matter how dangerous it is.

577
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,990
It's the only way to confirm Ke Jingping's true identity

578
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,960
and verify whether my deductions are correct.

579
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,540
Because the intelligence Myna held

580
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,790
concerns the life and death of all of Changsha.

581
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:30,750
Ke Jingping.

582
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,860
Say it again!

583
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,080
What exactly do you mean by "soon"?

584
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:35,800
Three days.

585
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,590
Within three days,

586
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,210
I'll deliver the intelligence to you.

587
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,000
Good.

588
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,540
I hope you can keep your promise.

589
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,110
Commander,

590
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,440
the Japanese are advancing aggressively.

591
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,980
Let me send my troops into battle!

592
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,360
No.

593
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,320
Your unit is my final reserve.

594
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:58,890
Guys,

595
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:03,870
the Japanese have been launching frontal assaults on us,

596
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:07,160
but their real strength lies in flanking maneuvers.

597
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:10,020
They're likely to bypass our defenses

598
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,520
and attack us from behind.

599
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,810
They've done this in Shanghai,

600
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,800
Nanjing, Wuhan, and Taiyuan.

601
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:16,630
Which direction do you think

602
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,560
they'll come from this time?

603
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,280
The Japanese 3rd Division

604
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,660
has been stationed across from Yueyang Lake,

605
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,550
delaying their engagement in the frontal attack.

606
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:25,790
I suspect

607
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:28,240
they may cross Yueyang Lake

608
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,590
to flank us and head for Changsha.

609
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:32,410
Then I'll position my troops on the western front to wait for them.

610
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:37,470
But we mustn't ignore the Eastern side either,

611
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,160
where the Japanese 106th Division is positioned.

612
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,500
The 106th Division?

613
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,370
They've already been defeated by me once.

614
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,000
Last year, at Wanjialing,

615
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,780
I almost wiped them out.

616
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:50,620
Okamura Yasuji is a crafty old fox.

617
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,430
If I don't get reliable

618
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,830
intelligence soon,

619
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,410
I absolutely can't deploy your troops yet.

620
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,100
Commander,

621
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:09,310
the 6th Division's frontal assault has stalled.

622
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,650
The 13th Division reports

623
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,710
Chinese forces are counterattacking the front.

624
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,150
The 33rd Division reports

625
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,100
severe casualties in our ranks.

626
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,480
Commander.

627
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,510
If the frontal attack continues to fail,

628
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,550
our flanking forces

629
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:22,970
must act immediately.

630
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,950
The 106th Division is fully assembled

631
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,090
and requests to engage.

632
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:32,950
Send a telegram to Kunwu.

633
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,950
This Hunting Operation

634
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,500
must end

635
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,610
as quickly as possible.

636
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,480
Yes.

637
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:50,100
[By sunset tomorrow, the intelligence must reach the Ninth War Zone]

638
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,600
Have these been thoroughly reviewed?

639
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,590
There's no repeat, right?

640
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:19,090
Sir.

641
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,199
This is the last batch.

642
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:21,889
Okay.

643
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,280
Come on,

644
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:29,800
just answer what the officer asks.

645
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:30,659
Cut the crap.

646
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,190
You're wasting everyone's time.

647
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:33,980
Come on!

648
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,560
You're all bullying me!

649
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,480
Let me tell you,

650
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,750
I'm just a woman

651
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,870
who traveled all alone on a long boat ride.

652
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:42,030
I vomited the whole way, you know?

653
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:43,710
It's her!

654
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,010
You came at the right time.

655
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,840
I found the real Mister.

656
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,409
She's the daughter-in-law of the fabric shop in Chaye Alley,

657
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,969
named Xu Zhaodi.

658
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:58,010
Her situation aligns with your analysis.

659
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,040
She said her husband was dead

660
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,070
and she returned to live with her in-laws.

661
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,270
Stop. Stop.

662
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:10,950
Wait.

663
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,990
She's gone.

664
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,470
Alright, I got it.

665
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:26,880
Go ahead.

666
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,410
Yes.

667
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:36,910
Director Xu.

668
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,510
Tell me about what you've found so far.

669
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,260
Okay.

670
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,590
At 2:38 a.m. today,

671
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,380
a suspicious signal was detected,

672
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,230
identical to the one intercepted

673
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,380
on the night Yang Ziming was killed.

674
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,350
Based on the signal,

675
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,310
we've narrowed down the transmission area,

676
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,790
and Xu Zhaodi's fabric shop falls within it.

677
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:55,510
Chief.

678
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,270
Before reporting

679
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,320
to your office,

680
00:35:58,790 --> 00:35:59,590
I sent someone

681
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,150
to check on her shop.

682
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,090
They reported that she was no longer there.

683
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,280
Her father-in-law was watching the store today.

684
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,110
I think

685
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,790
it's necessary to search the place.

686
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,630
Given how long she's been active,

687
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,920
there's bound to be useful information."

688
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,540
Fine. Take your team there.

689
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,270
Don't disappoint me.

690
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:17,310
Yes.

691
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:20,950
It's just as I suspected.

692
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,820
He's deploying all capable

693
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,870
operatives from the station.

694
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,150
Hello?

695
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:45,740
Okay.

696
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,110
Ji Fang ran into Mi Lan on his way

697
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,520
to the police station.

698
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,470
What? That's bold of them.

699
00:36:59,190 --> 00:36:59,910
Chief.

700
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,140
That's near Ling Han's safehouse.

701
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,850
He must've arranged it beforehand,

702
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,750
knowing that once he was gone,

703
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:09,790
we'd avoid

704
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:11,360
his residences and safehouses.

705
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,320
Chief.

706
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,590
I'll go bring them back.

707
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,380
I'll go too.

708
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,230
Fine.

709
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,110
But remember,

710
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:24,480
I want them alive.

711
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,520
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

712
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,920
Don't you find this whole situation suspicious?

713
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,740
You mean how Mi Lan was conveniently spotted by Ji Fang?

714
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:45,750
Exactly.

715
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:47,790
What do you plan to do?

716
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,000
They've likely set something up over there,

717
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,690
but we can't rule out other moves.

718
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,460
We need to split up.

719
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,270
Most of our capable operatives

720
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,350
have been sent out.

721
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,430
The station is

722
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,620
practically defenseless.

723
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,590
They're sure to exploit the weakness.

724
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,410
I'll stay.

725
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:08,960
You handle the situation over there.

726
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,850
Maybe I should stay instead.

727
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,790
Dealing with someone like Mi Lan requires strategy.

728
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,480
A direct confrontation isn't the best approach.

729
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,330
If he really wanted to stay,

730
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,710
he wouldn't be explaining all this.

731
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,240
He'd be trying to trick me into leaving instead.

732
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,160
I'm exploiting my concern,

733
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,960
making you think the other side is more dangerous,

734
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,020
so you'll choose to go there.

735
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,130
Mi Lan's target today is here.

736
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,960
I can't let you stay and face that risk.

737
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,790
Then you stay.

738
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,730
I'll go handle the other side.

739
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,150
Or

740
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,930
you stay here.

741
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:45,940
I'll make it quick.

742
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,220
As soon as I'm done,

743
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,140
I'll return to help you.

744
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,630
Take a larger team with you.

745
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,380
And be careful.

746
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,190
Director Xu.

747
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,090
The provincial government has a meeting

748
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,860
