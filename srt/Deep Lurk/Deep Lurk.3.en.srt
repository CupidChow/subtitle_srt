00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,950
After I copied it,

4
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,140
I immediately sent it to the studio.

5
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:47,930
Then I came back to work.

6
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,740
I never told anyone about it.

7
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,130
I... I was working before you came in.

8
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,070
I just went to the bathroom during the break.

9
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,120
I really don't know about this advertisement.

10
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,280
I honestly have no idea what's going on.

11
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,680
All I know is the advertiser didn't show up.

12
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,000
I also heard that someone smashed the door of the duty room.

13
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,150
Where's that security guard?

14
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,340
He works the night shift,

15
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,550
and has gone home now.

16
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,070
I need his address.

17
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,680
I'll go find it right away.

Mr. Miura,

19
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:19,930
you mentioned earlier

20
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,370
when the security guard delivered the letter,

21
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,940
there was another person present.

22
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,740
Mr. Liu.

23
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,370
He went to take a call from his girlfriend.

24
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,150
He should be back soon.

25
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,079
This person

26
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,690
looks so much like Mr. Liu from the radio station.

27
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,870
Go report to Chief Takahashi.

28
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,400

Chief Takahashi,

32
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,180
we found a dead man at the back door.

33
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,760
According to the owner of the store,

34
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,720
that dead man

35
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,240
looked like an employee surnamed Liu here.

36
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,040
Dead?

37
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:13,490
Mr. Liu?

38
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:14,970
That's impossible.

39
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:15,760
Mr. Miura,

40
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,750
can you go downstairs and check with me?

41
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,500
Sure.

42
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,150
Please.

43
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,840
What's going on?

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,079
Mr. Miura.

48
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,620
Is that him?

49
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:36,590
Yes.

50
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,950
That's Mr. Liu.

51
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,310
Search this area thoroughly.

52
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,990
Check if there are any suspicious clues.

53
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,520
Yes.

You, come here.

55
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,940

-Yes.
-Mr. Miura.

57
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,430
When did his girlfriend call?

58
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:51,130
Sorry,

59
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,790
I didn't check the time then.

60
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,630
He answered the phone himself?

61
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,190
Yes.

62
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,610
Have you seen his girlfriend?

63
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,430
I've seen her once.

64
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,130
I think she works at a clothing store.

65
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,850
She's very beautiful.

66
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:04,460
What?

00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,280
Is there a problem with his girlfriend?

68

No.

do you have any friends in the Special Operations Division?

Also,

could you check for me the calls made to

00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,630
the advertising department of East Asia Broadcasting Station in the last half hour?

91

Do you know what's in that envelope?

When I was getting off work,

93

I happened to run into Mr. Liu leaving.

95
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,630
there was money in the envelope

96
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,790
and also a letter

What time was that?

100

between 8:00 and 8:20.

102
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,970
It should have been from

a pay phone booth near his workplace.

104
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,070
After he took the phone call,

105
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,190
he immediately went out.

106
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:20,640

00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,040
that the person he wanted to meet is nearby.

Please simplify your information.

132
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,200
Just focus on the key points.

133
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,410
You shouldn't have killed your colleague, you know.

134
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,530
No need to get so worked up.

135
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,310
I'm not really your enemy.

136
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,620
Not exactly my enemy,

137
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,960
but definitely not my friend either.

138
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,460
Because my friend

139
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,330
would never point a gun at me.

140
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,070
Of course,

141
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,340
making friends

142
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,380
certainly starts with good cooperation.

143
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,580
I like to make friends with generous people.

144
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,950
Money is not an issue.

145
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,330
But you shouldn't have come to find me personally.

146
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,730
You've broken the rules.

147
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:48,870
It makes me very uneasy.

148
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,420
Don't worry.

149
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,310
This is just a one-time deal between us.

150
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,090
We won't meet again in the future.

151
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,880
And I have no interest in gossip

152
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,909
or rumors.

153
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,220
You can rest assured.

154
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,970
Come with me!

155
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,550
Did you recruit that man?

156
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,320
Who told you to go find Myna?

157
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,550
Why did you go?

158
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,290
What... what are you doing here?

159
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,950
Can't you speak nicely?

160
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,790
What's the matter?

161
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,550
Someone just delivered a letter

162
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,080
and said it's for Second Young Master.

163
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,680
I questioned the messenger.

164
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,630
He said a gentleman wearing glasses

165
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,960
asked him to deliver it.

166
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,800
This is for me. It's none of your business.

167
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,360
What do you mean?

168
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,320
Okay.

169
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,340
You may leave now.

170
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,830
Now is not the time to be angry.

171
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,220
Think it over.

172
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,660
The current situation is,

173
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,690
the bank president Yun Muzhi is dead,

174
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,150
and you need to escort the body back home.

175
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,260
Someone delivered a letter to you at this time.

176
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,780
It might not be a good thing.

177
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,950
Good or bad, I'll bear the consequences myself.

178
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,070
Don't worry about it.

179
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,870
If I'm unlucky, it's my own fault

180
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,010
for having a father like that.

181
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,070
Alright,

182
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,750
show me the letter.

183
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,760
I'll tell you the truth.

184
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,050
Look, you've been to

185
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,080
this secret room many times, right?

186
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,780
Yet you haven't found anything.

187
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,060
Are you wondering

188
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,310
where I've hidden the real secret?

189
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,050
You show me the letter first,

190
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,580
and I'll tell you the truth.

191
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,670
That's fair.

192
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,690
I keep my word.

193
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,800
Why not tell the secret first?

194
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,850
Don't push your luck, okay?

195
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,230
Commander,

196
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,310
Chief Kagesa has sent an urgent telegram.

197
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,910
There's progress on the task you assigned him.

198
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,560
Yun Muzhi is actually alive.

199
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,370
So, Commander, you're saying

200
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,510
that Yun Muzhi faked his death?

201
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,260
Fortunately, Kunwu was meticulous.

202
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,860
If he hadn't reminded me,

203
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,650
that old fox Yun Muzhi would have succeeded.

204
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,670
Someone as dangerous as him being alive

205
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,620
would be very detrimental to our plan.

206
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:56,300
[Missing Person Notice
Lost contact with Liu
Meet me at Fusheng Tea House, Xiang Room at 8:00 PM]

207
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:02,990
It's him.

208
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,830
Who?

209
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,670
Myna.

210
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,360
How do you know it's him?

211
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,290
When I went to the East Asia Radio to find him,

212
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,960
I said I wanted to broadcast a missing person notice.

213
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,800
This Liu

214
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,110
represents a colleague of his surnamed Liu,

215
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,610
who has already been killed by him.

216
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,650
Currently, this matter

217
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,280
is only known to Myna and me.

218
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,850
Who else could have provided those two

219
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,750
vital information but him?

220
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,660
It seems he wants to sell this intelligence to me.

221
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:31,980
Alright,

222
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,290
you've finished reading the letter.

223
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,530
It's time for you to fulfill your promise.

224
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,050
If your secret doesn't satisfy me,

225
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,430
I'll handle this matter on my own.

226
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,420
You can't interfere either.

227
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,140
Otherwise,

228
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm capable of doing anything.

229
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,390
Fine.

230
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,370
I'll keep my promise.

231
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:50,980
Go find Xu

232
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,690
and tell him

233
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,820
I ask him to take you to see my secret.

234
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,430
Go ahead.

235
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,810
If I don't let you go,

236
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,580
you'll definitely rebel.

237
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,080
Don't you want to know Mr. Yun's secret?

238
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,450
All of Mr. Yun's secrets are in that box.

239
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,100
Go ahead and look.

240
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:48,980
It's hidden right here?

241
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,550
Yes.

242
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:50,880
Take a look.

243
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,100
Indeed, the older is wiser.

244
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,220
Second Young Master,

245
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:15,440
there are some things Mr. Yun doesn't want you to know.

246
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,850
It's for your own good.

247
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,390
Mr. Yun has his own difficulties.

248
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,510
You must never go against him in the future.

249
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,600
Do you understand?

250
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,160
I have to go against him.

251
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,990
I'll stick to it to the end.

252
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:42,130
Xu,

253
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,570
keep an eye on him.

254
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,150
Don't let him escape again.

255
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,180
I think this matter with Myna

256
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,850
isn't as simple as it seems.

257
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,270
You leaked Myna's information to the French

258
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,600
just to test the waters?

259
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,750
If my judgment is correct,

260
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,170
given Myna's cunning nature,

261
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,400
he wouldn't carry the intelligence on him.

262
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
So before the Japanese find the intelligence,

263
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,570
he should be safe.

264
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,120
Now,

265
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,180
inform Oriole.

266
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,990
I want to know Takahashi's reaction.

267
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,450
[Underground Communist Party member Zhang Xiancheng]

268
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:46,800
Oh no.

269
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,680
Your daughter is still alive.

270
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,880
She's in my hands now.

271
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,280
Please, don't harm her!

272
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,750
I'll do whatever you say!

273
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,340
Alright, alright.

274
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,110
I got it.

275
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,820
I'm heading to the train station right away.

276
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,740
I'll be in Changsha tomorrow morning.

277
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,000
Please, don't hurt her!

278
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,800
Let's meet—

279
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:11,660
Hello?

280
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,400
Who's this?

281
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:14,470
Thanks for your car earlier.

282
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,849
It's you.

283
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:16,750
8:00 PM,

284
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,760
Fusheng Tea House, Xiang Room.

285
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,040
Be there or be square.

286
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:35,730
Hello.

287
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,020
I'm your landlord.

288
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,370
Actually, this matter with Myna

289
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,630
had no flaws from beginning to end.

290
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,340
The reason Yun Muzhi was suspicious

291
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,490
is because of that mysterious Kunwu.

292
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,710
The painting Yun Hongshen found

293
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,460
should be painted by Kunwu.

294
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,540
Judging from the message conveyed in the painting,

295
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,210
Kunwu is confident about the Japanese army

296
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,650
occupying Changsha.

297
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,500
Someone like him would never be blindly optimistic.

298
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,330
He must have had some basis.

299
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,410
This matter

300
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,070
must have more to it.

301
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,840
He must verify it again.

302
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,680
Mr. Yun,

303
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,830
Oriole just sent a message.

304
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,580
Just half an hour ago,

305
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,350
Takahashi secretly dispatched an ace assassin.

306
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,260
So you're saying

307
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,720
he has already found Myna?

308
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,590
Second Young Master has run out.

309
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,910
He must have gone to Fusheng Tea House

310
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,100
to meet with Myna.

311
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,070
Takahashi has secretly sent out an assassin.

312
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,470
Isn't Second Young Master in great danger?

313
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,650
Mr. Yun,

314
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,190
we need to find a way to save him.

315
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,480
Do we have any available men?

316
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:50,100
To ensure the absolute confidentiality of your identity,

317
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,980
I've replaced all the men under my command.

318
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,690
The new recruits won't be in place until tomorrow.

319
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:55,860
We can only

320
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,980
use the Oriole team.

321
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:00,470
No.

322
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,650
Before the Gold Strike Operation is completed,

323
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,250
we can't use the Oriole team.

324
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:07,420
Xu,

325
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,330
go outside and check

326
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,130
if anyone is watching us.

327
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:11,820
Okay.

328
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:47,740
Mr. Yun,

329
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,130
there are suspicious people out there watching us.

330
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,230
Xu,

331
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,210
get this sent out.

332
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,120
Mr. Yun,

333
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,060
things aren't that bad, are they?

334
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:05,980
Maybe

335
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,400
this is our last time fighting side by side.

336
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,070
You don't need to show yourself.

337
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,460
I can act alone.

338
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,820
Second Young Master is very clever.

339
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,570
As long as I find a way to alert him,

340
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,520
he'll be able to get out safely.

341
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,020
When I go out later,

342
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,900
I'll make a bit more noise and

343
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,500
find a way to draw those people away.

344
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,700
Then you can escape.

345
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,630
Xu,

346
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,430
think about Kunwu's appearance this time.

347
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,270
There must be a lot of things happening behind this.

348
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,850
From Qu Wenzhi's assassination attempt

349
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:39,850
to the defection,

350
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,720
and Myna selling intelligence,

351
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,000
this is a series of traps.

352
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,650
We must let the Party organization know.

353
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,560
You're not going to save Second Young Master?

354
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,300
Since Comrade Ziming left,

355
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,790
I've lost contact with the organization.

356
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,390
Now I don't have any safe channels

357
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,950
to send out intelligence.

358
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,160
There are Japanese people watching outside.

359
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,360
To avoid arousing their suspicion

360
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,130
while sending out the intelligence,

361
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,530
there's only one way now.

362
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,510
That is to walk into their trap.

363
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,590
You mean

364
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,470
luring you back from the dead to save Second Young Master

365
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,500
is also part of their trap?

366
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,090
Yes.

367
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,270
You want to

368
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,380
use yourself as a carrier to transmit intelligence?

369
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:24,650
That's right.

370
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:26,650
Xu,

371
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,210
those who know my true identity should understand

372
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,920
that since I chose to fake my death,

373
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,790
I wouldn't easily come back to life.

374
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,500
But now, dying and coming back to life, then dying again

375
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,620
indicates that something significant must have happened.

376
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,510
The organization will understand.

377
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,460
Mr. Yun,

378
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,730
can't I do it for you?

379
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,840
As long as you're still alive,

380
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,650
anything is possible.

381
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:52,360
Xu,

382
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,100
since the Japanese won't allow me to live,

383
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,090
and since I've chosen death,

384
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,110
I might as well choose the most valuable way to die.

385
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,550
What about Second Young Master?

386
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,810
As his father,

387
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,130
of course I want him to live

388
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,620
and continue to live on.

389
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,780
But right now,

390
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,800
I have to give up

391
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,550
my identity as a father.

392
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:50,630
Remember,

393
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,910
kill the father and spare the son.

394
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:53,460
Yes.

395
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:06,830
Why is he here too?

396
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,950
It's time for the rendezvous.

397
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,930
Could he also be here to find Myna?

398
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:26,600
Oh no,

399
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,900
the person in the car is probably Myna.

400
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:36,900
Second Young Master,

401
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,160
get in the car quickly.

402
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,060
Shen, hurry!

403
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,580
Go!

Hang in there.

409
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,790
We'll be at the hospital soon, Dad.

410
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,420
Shen,

411
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:30,910
don't be sad.

♫The pace of silence makes everything hasty♫

413

have no time for sorrow.

I know I'm wrong.

419

I'll never do it again.

420
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:48,020
I swear I'll never do it again, Dad.

I'm sorry, Dad.

424
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,490

We're almost at the hospital.

is really...

497
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:09,860
I'm not sure if the sniper

498
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,100
saw my face clearly.

499
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:12,720
But if the Japanese

500
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,160
track Myna down,

501
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,110
they'll soon find out

502
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,250
that Myna made a call to this hotel.

503
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,060
It's not safe here anymore.

504
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,280
You need to prepare early.

505
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,950
I'll have them evacuated right away.

506
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,980
But if the Japanese can trace this place,

507
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,940
you won't be able to leave Shanghai by train

508
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,290
or ship anymore.

509
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:28,920
They'll have the train station and the dock

510
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,780
under control.

511
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,930
We have a very safe transportation route

512
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,490
that we use for business with the Japanese.

513
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:35,070
You and Li Liang will first take our cargo truck

514
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:35,730
to Nanjing,

515
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,350
and then return to Changsha from there.

516
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:37,870
Okay.

517
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:51,850
Search!

518
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,340
Damn it!

519
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,070
Let's go.

520
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:55,870
The morning after tomorrow,

521
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,600
we will leave Shanghai by ship.

522
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,430
Once things have quieted down,

523
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,360
we'll come back.

524
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,820
During this time,

525
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,860
your team must maintain absolute silence.

526
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,790
The morning after tomorrow,

527
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,590
you need to go to the breakfast stall on Beidang Road for breakfast.

528
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,310
If we successfully escape,

529
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:12,890
around seven o'clock,

530
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:13,830
someone will go

531
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,670
to buy flowers from the flower stand next to the breakfast stall.

532
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:17,790
Five lilies,

533
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,350
six roses,

534
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,100
and two carnations.

535
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,830
If the person to buy flowers doesn't show up,

536
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,370
go to the Bank of France

537
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,830
to retrieve a stored item

538
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,440
and mail it to the address written on it.

539
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,190
After the task at the reception is completed,

540
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,860
I'll hand over the key to you.

541
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,160
Understood.

542
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,420
Check please.

543
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,590
Alright, coming!

544
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,120
Okay, thank you.

545
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:48,750
Rickshaw.

546
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,500
Hello,

547
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,060
four buns, please.

548
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:51,590
Alright.

549
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,390
To the Bank of France.

550
00:31:59,350 --> 00:31:59,860
Yes.

551
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,220
I will definitely investigate thoroughly.

552
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:03,790
Yes.

553
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,870
What happened?

554
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:12,160
The gold bars entrusted to us by the Bank of France

555
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,370
have all turned into lead blocks after being transported back to Tokyo.

556
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,630
How could this happen?

557
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:19,370
From packing the gold bars to loading them onto the ship,

558
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,990
it was all supervised by Mr. Noda's military police.

559
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,060
Our people were also escorting

560
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,860
under armed guard along the way.

561
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,560
That couldn't have happened.

562
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:29,950
It's so weird.

563
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,450
There's a big mess in Tokyo right now.

564
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,760
Even Lord Doihara has been alerted.

565
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,980
He personally called to inquire about this matter.

566
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,220
Do you suspect

567
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:43,240
that this is related to Yun Muzhi and his son?

568
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,490
I don't suspect.

569
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,530
I'm certain of it.

570
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:50,100
From Viscount to the reserve funds, and then Myna,

571
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,100
all the events happened the past few days

572
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,690
have Yun Muzhi and his son behind them.

573
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,730
Where is Yun Hongshen?

574
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,210
He's gone.

575
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,420
Bring him back

576
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,750
as soon as possible.

577
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,880
He's very useful.

578
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:08,890
Yes.

579
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:36,550
Don't you want to know Mr. Yun's secret?

580
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:39,850
All of Mr. Yun's secrets are in that box.

581
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:41,580
Yes.

582
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,970
I don't have time for sorrow.

583
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:47,170
I will find out who's behind this and avenge you.

584
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,760
I can't let you go without peace of mind.

[Yun's Family Instructions]

586
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,130
Why is this photo only half complete?

587
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,239
Could Dad's real secret

588
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,830
be on that missing half of the photo?

589
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,500
There should be the other person in that half of the photo.

590
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:42,100
Who could that person be?

591
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,750
That's not right.

592
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,350
You did that on purpose.

593
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,429
You first brought up Qu Wenzhi

594
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:48,760
to divert my attention,

595
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,750
then shifted the topic to your true identity.

596
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,500
You don't want me to investigate the person in the painting.

597
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,560
That person is dangerous

598
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,000
and highly confidential.

599
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,860
You don't want me to get involved.

600
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:04,910
Regarding Kunwu,

601
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,120
Yun Muzhi's attitude was originally very firm.

602
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,660
He almost forcefully and rudely

603
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:13,750
forbade Yun Hongshen from interfering in this matter.

604
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,780
But his dying wish

605
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,590
was related to this painting.

606
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,420
In Yun Hongshen's mind,

607
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,300
a bold idea flashed.

608
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:23,930
Yesterday's incident wasn't an accident.

609
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,730
It's related to this person.

610
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,510
Search!

611
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,300
Yes, sir.

612
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,540
Yun Hongshen.

613
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,440
I'll catch you sooner or later!

614
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,400
There's been a problem with the Bank of France's reserves.

615
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,270
The Japanese start to suspect

616
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,780
Yun Muzhi and his son.

617
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:46,180
They're searching all over the city for Yun Hongshen.

618
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,580
Since he doesn't behave,

619
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,600
why don't we let others do our work?

620
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,180
If he calls later,

621
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,440
keep him calm first.

622
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:54,560
Then I'll immediately notify

623
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,910
our insider in the Special Operations Division.

624
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:56,970
Alright, alright.

625
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,140
Do you think this will work?

626
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,110
Then what should we do?

627
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,810
Notify our insider

628
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,500
to keep a close eye on Takahashi's movements,

629
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,300
and send people out immediately

630
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,190
to find Yun Hongshen

631
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:12,300
before the Japanese.

632
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,940
Are you planning to protect him?

633
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,450
No.

634
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,840
Who knows what his father had told him?

635
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,870
Someone like him is a menace alive.

636
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:20,960
However,

637
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,710
we must find him before

638
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:24,590
the Japanese do

639
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,940
and kill him!

640

It's worth it.

You came at the right time.

646
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:55,490
One more dead here

647
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,420
means we'll have one less to kill in the field.

648
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,220
Get ready!

649
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,320
Let's not waste time.

650
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:33,370
Tell me the truth about the reserve fund.

651
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:37,060
I promise I won't make you suffer too much.

652
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,590
Yun Muzhi was killed.

653
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,920
Besides deeply hating himself,

654
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,830
Yun Hongshen also hate the Japanese.

655
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,030
Because it's obvious

656
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,690
that the people behind this

657
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,910
must be Japanese.

658
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:51,130
But until the truth of the whole thing is clear,

659
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,930
he can't confront them directly.

660
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,130
He has to endure,

661
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:56,060
because only by staying alive

662
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,520
could he find the real culprit behind it all.

663
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,800
Don't think you're tougher than the others.

664
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,100
Once you're in the Special Operations Division,

665
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,940
I have many ways to make you talk.

666

I never get involved the whole time.

668

If you want to know anything,

669
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,700
go ask Mr. Frank.

670
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:18,110
The reserve fund was all handled by Yun Muzhi.

You're his son.

672
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:23,530

I'm sorry.

684
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,180
I shouldn't have said those things.

685
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,330
