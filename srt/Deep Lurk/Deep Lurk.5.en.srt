[Episode 5]

3
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:55,310
He was following Director Ling.

4
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,430
He's simply courting death.

5
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,430
I've inquired about it with my friends in Shanghai.

6
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,370
Although Yun Muzhi

7
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,310
is connected to that mysteriously disappeared reserve fund,

8
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,830
so many days have passed.

9
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,660
[Japanese Killer, Kawashima]

10
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,170
Even if Yun Hongshen knows the inside story,

11
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,900
the gold can't be recovered anymore.

12
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,710
So,

13
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,280
keeping him alive is meaningless.

14
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,050
Viscount was my most respected senior.

15
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,410
Personally, I should avenge him.

16
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:30,490
Officially,

17
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,980
a person whom even Viscount can't get rid of

18
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,579
will always be a menace if left alive.

19
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,020
Isn't Yun Hongshen from Changsha?

20
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,960
Then, let him die in Changsha.

21
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,180
It can be considered as returning to his roots.

22
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,060
Take the photo and go to Huang.

23
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,170
Ask him to keep an eye on Shen's movements.

24
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,829
He hasn't contacted me at all.

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,100
I'm very worried about Shen's current situation.

26
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,010
Yes, Young Master.

27
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,070
I'll go right away.

28
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,330
Search quietly.

29
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,390
Don't alert those who shouldn't be alerted.

30
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,200
Rest assured.

31
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,480
I'll make sure to pass on the instructions.

32
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,050
I'm off.

33
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,200
Shen,

34
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,890
where on earth have you gone?

35
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,080
Wild Fox just sent this over.

36
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,740
Take a look.

37
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,820
[Yun and his son are involved in the reserve fund case. Yun Hongshen may return to Changsha and act against Wen recently]

38
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,220
He's already come back.

39
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,600
I've seen him several times in Shanghai.

40
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,060
I've also had some encounters with him.

41
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,030
He gave me a strange feeling.

42
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,560
I think he is

43
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,909
hard to understand.

44
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,290
He's both cunning and naive at the same time.

45
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,620
I think he's dangerous.

46
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,310
Seems like he left quite an impression on you.

47
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,010
After he returned to Changsha, his behavior has been suspicious.

48
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,340
He clearly has other motives.

49
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,340
Based on what happened in Shanghai,

50
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,880
Yun Hongshen must have been hostile towards me.

51
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,880
So, last night,

52
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,790
his original target should have been me.

53
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,520
Director Ling was just an unexpected gain for him.

54
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,110
Sir.

55
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,080
Let's not talk about this anymore.

56
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,680
What do you think about the mole in our station?

57
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,010
Before we have sufficient evidence,

58
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,410
I have the same suspicion

59
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,890
towards every senior member of the station.

60
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,900
Okay, I understand.

61
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,540
Alright.

62
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,240
Deputy Chief Zhu

63
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,290
is very suitable to be a leader.

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,040
He's shrewd

65
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,280
and skilled at anticipating superiors' intentions.

66
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,010
He's also comfortable dealing with higher-ups.

67
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,550
I heard he has a good personal relationship with the Commander.

Director Gong is kind

71
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,120
and smooth in handling affairs,

72
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,250
but no one in the station

73
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,380
thinks he's genuinely easy to talk to.

74
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,350
Come, come.

75
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,780
Director Xu is a very studious person.

76
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,130
He is technically proficient

77
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,040
and not worldly-wise.

[Xu Bi, Director of the Telecommunications Division of the Hunan Station of Kuomintang's NBIS]

79
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,820
That's why he's well-liked.

80
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,590
But he likes to plant bugs everywhere.

81
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,590
And he's particularly interested in

82
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,390
gossip and rumors that can't be openly discussed.

83
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,850
As for Director Ling,

84
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,840
he is unarguably a capable person.

85
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,420
However, he can be rather cold-hearted,

86
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,640
and his relationships with colleagues are extremely poor.

87
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,950
With their abilities and authority,

88
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,680
they are all worthy of the Japanese effort to win over.

89
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,380
Although my rank is not high enough,

90
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,640
based on the fact that you are my teacher

91
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,840
and that you trust me,

92
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,640
I could find out something

93
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,400
if I have a mind to do it.

94
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,330
Therefore,

95
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,090
I am equally under suspicion.

96
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,040
Your analysis is very reasonable.

97
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,159
What about me?

98
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,360
How is that possible?

99
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,659
If you were a Japanese spy,

100
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:41,420

is emotionally difficult for you to accept,

111

I won't hesitate.

I understand.

118

You don't just need to understand,

119

but you also need to accept this harsh reality.

00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,200
Who's so bold?

189
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,690
The great young master of the Yun family

190
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,110
is stealing someone else's woman.

191
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,510
You have no shame, do you?

192
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,250
Forget it, forget it.

193
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,790
It's just a woman.

194
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,580
We won't stoop to his level.

195
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,380
Let's go.

196
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,160
Come back.

197
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,850
What were you doing at the train station yesterday?

198
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,380
None of your darn business.

199
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,510
Then, go back and give a message to your Bai Qingkui.

200
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,910
If he dares to touch my family,

201
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,400
I, Yun Hongqi, will make him wish he were dead.

202
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,200
Quite arrogant, aren't you?

203
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,490
Our Boss Bai

204
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,670
can do whatever he wants to whoever he wants.

205
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,130
If you offend our Boss Bai,

206
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,610
you might as well start digging your own grave.

207
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:38,410
That's right.

208
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:41,980
Hold this for me.

209
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,070
You want to fight?

210
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,830
Well,

211
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,070
it's been a while since I've been fighting.

212
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,230
I might be a bit rusty,

213
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,020
but

214
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,270
dealing with you two

215
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,720
shouldn't be a problem.

216
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,550
Listen,

217
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,180
that tough guy who's usually with you isn't here today.

218
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,070
If we two brothers beat you up today,

219
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,220
don't blame us.

220
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,180
That's right!

221
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,820
Which one of you two wants to go first?

222
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,310
When you go back, don't forget to tell Bai Qingkui

223
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,570
not to touch my family.

224
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,000
This is my bottom line.

225
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,230
Captain,

226
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,080
there's a fight outside.

227
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,610
They're blocking the road.

228
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,150
Let's go take a look.

229
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,090
Stop fighting! Break it up!

230
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,820
What are you doing?

231
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,020
Everyone, disperse!

232
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:09,870
Stop fighting!

233
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,740
The police are coming!

234
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,620
-Let's go.
-What are you doing?

235
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,680
What are you doing?

236
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,240
[Captain Tang of Changsha Police Department, Communist Underground Party Member]

237
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,140
Could it be

238
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,690
he discovered me last night?

239
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,500
Oh no!

240
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,150
Let's go!

241
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:40,220
That can't be the Second Young Master Yun, can it?

242
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,710
You two,

243
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,350
go check it out.

244
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:46,620
Yes, sir.

245
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,320
Huang, come with me.

246
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:47,960
Yes, sir.

247
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,190
Young Master!

248
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,440
Captain Tang, what you're busy…

249
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,720
Second Young Master.

250
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,120
Where are they?

251
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,190
Captain, over there.

252
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,280
Alright.

253
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,510
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

254
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,540
Excuse me.

255
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,170
Excuse me.

256
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,860
Why didn't you tell us you were back?

257
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,950
What's wrong?

258
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,480
Say something.

259
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,880
What happened?

260
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,860
Follow me.

261
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,100
Director Ling.

262
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,220
Director Ling.

263
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,060
Old Madam,

264
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,470
why don't you eat first?

265
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,560
It's getting late.

266
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,340
Young Master might not be coming back for dinner.

267
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,020
Yes,

268
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,390
please go ahead and eat.

269
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,670
He would call me if he wasn't coming back.

270
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,530
He hasn't called,

271
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,310
so he will definitely return.

272
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,830
Old Madam,

273
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,500
Young Master has returned.

274
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,810
You spent the whole morning buying buns.

275
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,900
Where are the steamed buns?

276
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,450
Grandma.

277
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:42,550
Grandma, look.

278
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,640
Look.

279
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,510
Look here!

280
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,280
Grandma!

281
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,670
Shen!

282
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,390
-Young Young Master!
-Young Young Master!

283
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,840
Why are you back?

284
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,150
Let Grandma take a good look at you.

285
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,180
Grandma.

286
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,330
Let me hug you first.

287
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:58,990
Come here.

288
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:00,940
Stop it, stop it.

289
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,060
Look at you.

290
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,030
You're so naughty!

291
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,750
Grandma.

292
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,960
You haven't lost any weight at all.

293
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,349
It seems you haven't missed me at all during this time.

294
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:09,109
I'm really heartbroken.

295
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,300
Of course I missed you.

296
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,470
How could I not miss you?

297
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,079
Let me have a good look at you.

298
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:16,900
What happened here?

299
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,140
You're hurt?

300
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:19,680
You're injured!

301
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,210
Grandma.

302
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,540
Don't worry.

303
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,710
You don't need to worry about him.

304
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,109
Don't you know him by now?

305
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,280
As soon as he left the train station,

306
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,800
he was targeted by a few

307
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:27,569
reckless, petty thieves.

308
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:28,530
They fought,

309
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,580
and now those petty thieves

310
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,060
are lying in the hospital.

311
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,440
Fighting at your age, what were you thinking?

312
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,500
Losing some money isn't a big deal.

313
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,520
Just don't let them hurt you.

314
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,480
That would be really troublesome.

315
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,170
It's alright, Grandma.

316
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,070
If you don't believe me,

317
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,130
you can check for yourself.

318
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,450
I'm absolutely fine.

319
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,510
Don't you know my kung fu?

320
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,300
Back in the day,

321
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,410
my brother and I,

322
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:53,390
we were unbeatable in Changsha, right?

323
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,480
Tell me,

324
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,950
how did a family like ours

325
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,230
end up having two such troublemakers?

326
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,380
Always up to no good.

327
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,050
Why are you back by yourself?

328
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,250
Where's your father?

329
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,600
Grandma,

330
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,930
my father went abroad for an inspection.

331
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:10,650
So,

332
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,020
I was bored staying alone in Shanghai,

333
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,950
so I came back.

334
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,140
Please, have a seat.

335
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,030
My father left in such a hurry

336
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,050
that he didn't have time to tell you.

337
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,490
What's wrong with you now?

338
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,280
Grandma,

339
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:25,490
I feel awful.

340
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:26,830
As soon as he came back,

341
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,050
you started talking to him only and ignoring me.

342
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:29,810
I'm hungry.

343
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,580
I'm now…

344
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,790
Why are there stars?

345
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,000
Since you were little,

346
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,810
you've been competing for attention with your brother.

347
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:39,870
Alright, alright.

348
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,100
Let's not talk about anything else.

349
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,310
Shen, let's eat.

350
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,480
-Now Shen's back, let's eat first.
-Let's eat.

351
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,000
-Time to eat!
-Time to eat!

352
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,950
Come on.

353
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:47,360
Grandma.

354
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:47,920
Second Young Master,

355
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,310
we didn't know you were coming back toady.

356
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,200
There are not many dishes.

357
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,000
Second Young Master,

358
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,460
is there anything else you'd like to eat?

359
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,460
I can go make it for you.

360
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:53,800
No need.

361
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,930
Everything is fine.

362
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,990
You should eat more quickly.

363
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:57,870
Look, your brother

364
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,750
has already moved your favorite dishes in front of you.

365
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,280
Don't be fooled by their constant bickering.

366
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,360
Deep down,

367
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,290
his older brother really cares for him.

368
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,290
He even puts me, his grandma, aside.

369
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,260
Grandma, what are you saying?

370
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,610
You've misunderstood.

371
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,010
I just knew he couldn't have hometown dishes while away,

372
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:14,820
so I'm just

373
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,250
feeling sorry for him.

374
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,310
Pitying you.

375
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,750
Hongqi,

376
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,990
if you really pity me,

377
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,740
how about ladling me some soup?

378
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,280
You're really taking advantage of my kindness, aren't you?

379
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,610
Are you trying to rebel?

380
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,830
Old Madam,

381
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:30,540
look,

382
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,590
as soon as Second Young Master returns,

383
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,770
the house becomes lively.

384
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,760
Young Master hasn't been this happy in a long time.

385
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,490
Indeed.

386
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,600
-Am I happy?
-Look.

387
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,180
These two brothers have been close since they were young.

388
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,110
Come on,

389
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:41,830
hurry up and eat.

390
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,460
Start using your chopsticks.

391
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,200
Eat some fish.

392
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,120
I'm starving.

393
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,600
Come here. Everyone, come here!

394
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,760
Come over here and line up.

395
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,730
Line up.

396
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,340
We're now catching Japanese spies.

397
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,680
We've received reliable intelligence.

398
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,870
Among you people here,

399
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:57,650
there are Japanese spies.

400
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:58,910
Open your belongings!

401
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,070
Our station's terrifying Director Ling

402
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,530
has made another big move.

403
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,870
You bet.

404
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,280
When he went out this morning,

405
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,720
he called back shortly after,

406
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,720
telling Wen Yeming to round up all the street vendors

407
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,850
within 100 meters of our station.

408
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,720
I wonder

409
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,500
if he was the head of the underworld in his past life.

410
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,900
He's become addicted to arresting people.

411
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,190
Do you dare install a bug in Ling Han's house?

412
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,410
If you can do it,

413
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,260
I'll respect you as a true hero from now on.

414
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,190
I'll even call you "Big Bro" in front of the Chairman.

415
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,200
To be honest,

416
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,920
I really dare to do it.

417
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,010
But I just can't pull it off.

418
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,750
Don't you know Ling Han?

419
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,420
If anyone so much as circles his house twice,

420
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,590
he'd investigate their entire family history,

421
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,230
not to mention planting bugs.

422
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,030
I certainly am not that capable.

423
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,440
If you could manage to plant one,

424
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,100
I'd respect you as a true hero.

425
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,880
Everyone has weaknesses.

426
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,400
I'm curious about Ling Han's weakness.

427
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,750
Really curious.

428
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,680
Hello.

429
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,830
Uncle Yang, it's me.

430
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,730
Yun Hongqi.

431
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,680
You seem quite free,

432
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,210
having time to call me.

433
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,520
Uncle Yang,

434
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:20,710
Shen is back.

435
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,330
I just wanted to let you know.

436
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,080
It's good that he's back.

437
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,410
Was the journey smooth?

438
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,550
No.

439
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,410
Someone shot at Shen in broad daylight.

440
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,470
Is Hongshen alright?

441
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,420
Yes,

442
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,120
he's okay.

443
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,130
Don't worry.

444
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,000
Do you need to meet with Yun Hongshen?

445
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,560
Let's wait a bit longer.

446
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,590
Nighthawk has been captured by the NBIS.

447
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,720
I think it must be related to Hongshen.

448
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,230
Go and verify it.

449
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,080
Yes, sir.

450
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,690
There are some things

451
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,980
Yang Ziming can't tell Secretary Wu.

452
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:58,480
In fact,

453
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,830
he and Yun Muzhi had an agreement.

454
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,970
No matter which of them dies by accident,

455
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,310
they would entrust their unfinished mission

456
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,480
to the other person.

457
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,640
This was not only an understanding between friends,

458
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,700
but also the trust between comrades.

459
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,850
Yang Ziming knew

460
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,860
that Yun Muzhi would definitely find a way

461
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,990
to tell him everything about the situation in Shanghai.

462
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,820
Before understanding the whole truth,

463
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,010
he couldn't meet Yun Hongshen yet.

464
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,470
I just returned to Changsha,

465
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,710
and someone ambushed me at the train station.

466
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,310
Someone even wanted me dead.

467
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,750
Is Kunwu the mastermind

468
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,380
behind everything?

469
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,070
Wen Yeming

470
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,740
and the person she met last night—

471
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,140
are they connected to Kunwu at all?

472
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,600
That's not right.

473
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,750
Why would that assassin

474
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,680
be lying in wait there beforehand?

475
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,450
Unless he and that person were on the same side,

476
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,250
and he knew I would pass by there.

477
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,990
The ones who want me dead must be the Japanese.

478
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,550
But exposing their mole

479
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,010
in the NBIS just to eliminate me—

480
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,010
it's not worth it.

481
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:07,770
This is a chain of events designed to kill two birds with one stone.

482
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,210
Not only could they eliminate Yun Hongshen,

483
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,550
but they could also shift the blame.

484
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,780
They've pinned the label of traitor on me.

485
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,820
If you believe their false accusations,

486
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,750
then the real traitor will be safe.

487
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,540
To our left, there used to be a residential area.

488
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,820
During the Wenxi fire,

489
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,400
it was almost burned to the ground.

490
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,530
The road to the left is blocked,

491
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,980
so we can only turn right when we go out.

492
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,360
[Station Headquarters]

493
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,090
In about 100 to 200 meters,

494
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,990
[Ruins]

495
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,250
both sides of the street are lined with shops.

496
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,090
There are no intersections,

497
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,450
[Fight]

498
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,640
so you can only go straight.

499
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:34,400
There won't be any turns until about 300 meters,

500
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,700
where you'll reach a T-junction to the right.

501
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,740
That's where

502
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,540
I saw people fighting ahead.

503
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,370
So I turned into the left fork.

504
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,110
The assassin was lying in wait in that residential area,

505
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,710
in a room on the second floor.

506
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,000
I've inspected the scene.

507
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,760
It wasn't carefully processed.

508
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,200
It's clear that this assassin was in a hurry, both coming and going.

509
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,140
He must have received orders in a hurry,

510
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,480
so he rushed to ambush there.

511
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,910
Yun Hongshen followed from near the station entrance.

512
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,100
Therefore, I conclude

513
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,670
that near the entrance of our station,

514
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:03,080
there must be a spy working for the Japanese.

515
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,940
By the way, Chief,

516
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,150
there's one more small matter.

517
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,860
I don't know if you've heard about it.

518
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,650
Go on.

519
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,880
The night before last,

520
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,090
Bai Qingkui's men

521
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,320
searched several old newspaper stalls

522
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:15,330
for a report on the 15th anniversary of the girls' school.

523
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,200
Early yesterday morning,

524
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,430
Bai Qingkui's men went to the train station to intercept someone.

525
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:21,090
I guess the person they were looking for was Yun Hongshen.

526
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:23,350
This afternoon, the spy near our station

527
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,900
must have received a notification.

528
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,460
After they saw Yun Hongshen,

529
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,790
they reported to their superiors.

530
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,470
That's why

531
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,370
there was an ambush this morning.

532
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,710
The things I've done

533
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,760
were all Father's wishes.

534
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,140
I kept it from you,

535
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,740
but it wasn't my intention.

536
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,930
When the time is right,

537
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,050
I will definitely tell you.

538
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,050
Alright.

539
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,440
Since it's Father's wishes, I will say no more.

540
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,650
But I have something to tell you.

541
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,020
Shen,

542
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,610
I'm not your biological brother,

543
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,060
but you and

544
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,000
everyone in this family

545
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,690
are my closest kin.

546
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,870
I would do anything for my family,

547
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,610
even if it costs my life.

548
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,670
It's only right.

549
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:20,620
If…

550
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,170
and I mean if,

551
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,230
between the two of us,

552
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,190
one of us had to risk our life,

553
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,510
it should be me,

554
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:31,600
because I am the eldest son in this family.

555
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:37,200
You'll personally interrogate the people Wen Yeming arrested.

556
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,000
However, I might have to pour some cold water on your expectations.

557
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,040
You may not be able to get much out of them.

558
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,960
Now that the Japanese have set up this trap,

559
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,760

He's always up to no good.

Now, he's even working for the Japanese.

566
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,510
He's utterly shameless.

567

Even if you arrest Bai Qingkui today,

You can't catch all of those people.

But keeping them around

571
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,030
isn't much of a problem either.

00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,720
Should we investigate him?

00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,970
he'd gone to help the NBIS solve some case.

He'll call me when he gets back.

586

He's definitely not gone to solve a case.

He's being investigated.

can't you sew the pajamas some other time?

598
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,160
It's so late at night.

599
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,500
It's bad for your eyes.

600

That's how it is when you get old.

601

Otherwise, you'd feel uneasy.

00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:21,020
Why did you suddenly think of doing this?

604
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,250
I was tidying up your father's room today.

605
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,280
Suddenly, I noticed that several buttons on the pajamas

606
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,590
were so loose that they were about to fall off.

607
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,590
I quickly sewed them back on for him.

608
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:34,330

Your father may seem mature and composed in public,

746
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,240
Alright.

747
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:18,830
Okay, okay.

748
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:26,100
In the mountains, people have no sense of time.

749
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,810
As the cold fades, the New Year passes unnoticed.

750
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,440
The blessed land of Flower Fruit Mountain;

751
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:37,140
the heavenly Water Curtain Cave.

752
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,070
A world unseen elsewhere,

753
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:46,920
each step reveals a new blossom.

754
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,370
The realm of eight hundred flowing sands;

755
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:53,970
the depth of three thousand weak waters.

756
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:57,460
Goose feathers cannot float on it,

757
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,990
and reed flowers will sink to the bottom.

758
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,480
Well done!

759
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,880
I only taught you twice,

760
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,600
and you've already memorized it.

761
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,560
We want a reward! We want a reward!

762
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,340
There is a reward.

763
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,590
Look what I've brought for you.

764
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,880
Picture books of "Journey to the West."

765
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,180
I want it, too.

766
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,310
Come, share them.

767
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,010
I bought these for you from Shanghai.

768
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:21,520
Here.

769
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,200
I like Sun Wukong.

770
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,240
It's better to be Zhu Bajie.

771
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:27,070
He gets to eat his fill every day.

772
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,610
One day,

773
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:32,120
each and every one of you

774
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,690
will be able to eat your fill.

775
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:34,750
Do you understand?

776
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:36,610
There will be no big fires,

777
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:37,560
Japanese,

778
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,760
or air raids.

779
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:39,900
Really?

780
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,970
Of course.

781
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:43,730
I,

782
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:45,010
and those uncles, aunts, brothers, and sisters

783
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:46,920
whom you haven't met yet,

784
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,770
are all working hard for that day.

785
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,090
When will that be?

786
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,510
Will it take a long time?

787
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,760
It won't be long.

788
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,720
By the time you grow a bit older,

789
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,850
we will have driven the Japanese away.

790
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,260
Do you believe me?

791
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,130
We believe you!

792
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,510
Come on,

793
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,030
let's sing "Farewell" once more

794
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:08,060
the song I taught you, OK?

795
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,590
Okay.

796
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:13,910
♫Outside the pavilion♫

797
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,970
♫Beside the ancient road♫

798
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:22,480
♫Green grass stretches to the horizon♫

799
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:29,030
♫Evening breeze caresses willows, and the flute notes linger♫

800
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:34,220
♫Sunset glows beyond distant mountains♫

801
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:37,040
♫Outside the pavilion♫

802
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:39,770
♫Beside the ancient road♫

803
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,560
♫Green grass stretches to the horizon♫

804
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:49,090
♫Evening breeze caresses willows, and the flute notes linger♫

805
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:54,590
♫Sunset glows beyond distant mountains♫

806
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,280
Ke Jingping saved Wen Yeming

807
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,480
and kept her by his side.

808
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,870
He was half mentor and half father to her.

809
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,180
He trained her to become an outstanding

810
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,640
NBIS secret agent.

811
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,330
Huang called me.

812
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,460
He cooperated with the NBIS in investigating some case yesterday.

813
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,680
He didn't come back until late at night.

814
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,270
He wasn't mistreated, though.

815
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:53,930
It was just an investigation.

816
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,720
The person who shot you—

817
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,250
the NBIS people are also looking for him.

818
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,050
They just haven't found him yet.

819
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,800
I've told you so much.

820
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,730
Don't you have anything to tell me?

821
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,410
Who was that person you were following yesterday?

822
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,160
Do you know?

823
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,760
His name is Ling Han.

824
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,680
He's the director of the Supervision Division of the NBIS.

825
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,210
Why were you following him?

826
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:20,010
He's now overseeing your case.

827
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:22,040
They arrested quite a few people last night,

828
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,600
all Japanese spies.

829
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,380
Why were you following him?

830
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,290
Hongqi,

831
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,020
did they catch any big shots?

832
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:27,950
No, they didn't.

833
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,230
I'm warning you,

834
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,570
this Ling Han is not a good guy.

835
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,060
Yesterday when you were being chased in Liren Alley,

836
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,840
he was at the other end of the alley.

837
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,750
He didn't go to help.

838
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,010
He's not a good person.

839
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,290
He wasn't sure if I was an enemy.

840
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,690
Of course, he wouldn't easily go over to help.

841
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,820
He only cares about the matter itself.

842
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:50,440
What are you talking about?

843
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:52,080
Never mind.

844
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,480
I don't care what you say,

845
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:54,770
but I'm telling you,

846
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,120
don't get involved with those who work as secret agents.

847
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,720
Their brains don't work like normal people's.

848
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,280
I heard from Huang

849
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,210
that you rode a motorcycle yesterday. Is that right?

850
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,430
Where did you get it?

851
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,370
I borrowed it from the Military Hospital.

852
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:12,650
My little brother has really learned some skills, huh?

853
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:13,960
You didn't come home after returning

854
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,420
but went to the Military Hospital instead.

855
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,950
And you borrowed a motorcycle. Is that right?

856
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:19,320
I had no choice, Hongqi.

857
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,340
The NBIS people took that motorcycle back.

858
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,150
Huang wanted to help you get it back,

859
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,550
but they didn't allow it.

860
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,780
There's nothing wrong with that motorcycle, is there?

861
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:33,330
When Yun Hongshen comes here later,

862
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:34,200
be nice to him.

863
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:37,150
Don't try to bite off more than you can chew.

864
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,420
Find out why he's come to Changsha.

865
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,360
Make sure he leaves within half an hour at most.

866
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:42,880
Yes.

867
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:44,750
Second Young Master,

868
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,570
someone called for you.

869
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:47,700
It's a woman.

870
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,120
A woman?

871
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,520
How old is she?

872
00:42:59,120 --> 00:42:59,750
Hello?

873
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:01,190
This is Wen Yeming.
