what do you mean by this?

191
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:48,920
You were the one who sent the person to assassinate Bai Qingkui?

192
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:49,590
Yes.

193
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,580
But please, let me explain.

194
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,830
Why did Xu Nian appear on Huangxing Road?

195
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,100
I sent him there.

196
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,930
-But the whole thing...
-Chief!

197
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,870
We found this in Deputy Chief's office.

[Reviewed in the Okamura Yasuji's Strategic Agent Dispatch Plan]

199
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,430
This scene looks familiar.

200
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,270
Last time it was Li Liang,

201
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,380
and this time it's Zhu He.

00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,700
The same irrefutable evidence

203
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:22,130
and the same inability to defend himself.

204
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,130
If this is again the work of Ling Han,

205
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,310
then this person is truly dangerous.

206
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,380
In this operation,

207
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,300
Yun Hongshen originally wanted to

208
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,220
use Zhu He to restrain Ling Han.

209
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,170
He never expected that

210
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:37,270
Zhu He would fall into Ling Han's trap.

211
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,290
[Key Investigation of the Changsha Japanese Spy Network]

212
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,190
Zhu He,

213
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,060
you have truly disappointed me.

214
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,950
Ling Han, lock him up.

215
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,830
Lock him up!

216
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,680
Let's go, Deputy Chief Zhu.

217
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,060
Don't interrogate him just yet

218
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,530
or make things difficult for him.

219
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,790
We need to think this through carefully.

220
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:38,750
Chief,

221
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,190
are you worried about what the Commander might think?

222
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,130
That can't be a reason to let him off the hook.

223
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,670
From the start of the operation to the end,

224
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,270
Zong Fang didn't seem to act unusually, right?

225
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:53,790
No.

226
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,530
No one suspicious has contacted him.

227
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,510
From my understanding of Deputy Chief Zhu,

228
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,550
if he were really this impatient,

229
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:05,590
he wouldn't have been able to stay undercover in the station for so long.

230
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,230
My suspicions of Zong Fang and Zhu He

231
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,290
are still the same.

232
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,070
The reason Zong Fang showed no unusual behavior

233
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,350
could be because he received a warning from the mole.

234
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,070
Zhu He chose to act at this time

235
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,930
possibly out of desperation.

236
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,950
I think that at this point,

237
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,830
we can't make any assumptions of innocence

238
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,030
about either of them.

239
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,390
Also, the bullet that killed Li Miaohan's lover

240
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,000
is now being analyzed by the technical investigation department.

241
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,980
Confirming the type of firearm the murderer used

242
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,310
can also serve as supporting evidence.

243
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,750
Firearm?

244
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,540
What is Ling Han planning to do with it?

245
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,270
Yun Hongshen,

246
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,020
share your thoughts.

247
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,350
I'm thinking about something.

248
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,410
If the Deputy Chief is the mole,

249
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,830
then Li Miaohan's lover

250
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,630
should not have appeared today.

251
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:52,500
Because the Deputy Chief knows that Li Miaohan is already dead.

252
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,960
This is not hard to explain.

253
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,760
He wanted to use our hands to kill him.

254
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,090
Because Li Miaohan's lover knew too much.

255
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,050
If your assumption is correct,

256
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,100
then I'm more inclined to suspect Zong Fang.

257
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,890
If the mole's plan is to sacrifice that assassin

258
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,550
to protect another more important accomplice,

259
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,630
then the person acting the most normal today

260
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:13,760
is the most suspect.

261
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,480
Your inference could also be the reverse.

262
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,590
He probably intentionally drew suspicion on himself

263
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,020
so that he'll get a chance to clear his name.

264
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,120
That way, his accomplice

265
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,320
would never appear on

266
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,930
our investigation list.

267
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,550
This deduction

268
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,740
cannot be completely ruled out.

269
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,520
However, before the investigation,

270
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,500
this mole must be safe.

271
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,620
Based on the current situation,

272
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,700
the Deputy Chief

273
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,180
has been fully controlled by us.

274
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,220
Zong Fang is now

275
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,440
the next key subject for investigation.

276
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,850
This essentially means a complete failure.

277
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,310
If he can't clear his name,

278
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,470
they'll never be able to turn things around.

279
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,090
That's why I don't think the Deputy Chief

280
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,250
is the mole.

281
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,950
I agree with Yun Hongshen's judgment.

282
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,800
Although Zhu He is highly suspicious now,

283
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,120
we don't have conclusive evidence

284
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,800
to say that he is the mole.

285
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,240
At this moment,

286
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,830
we must be extremely cautious.

287
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,390
One wrong move could lead to a total loss.

288
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,990
The killer who murdered Li Miaohan's lover

289
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,350
needs to be tracked down urgently.

290
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,910
This person is a key figure.

291
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:15,550
Chief,

292
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,950
there's another person we need to track down.

293
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:18,470
Who?

294
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,310
The person who kidnapped Li Miaohan's lover.

295
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,870
From the scene,

296
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:26,730
it appears the kidnapper and the killer are two different people.

297
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,980
I'm interested

298
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:30,930
in the kidnapper too.

299
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,030

300

You're back.

313
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,610
I wonder if Ziming is there.

Is that so?

Alright then.

You clearly had the information in advance.

00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,070
Stop this pointless speculation.

377
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:43,360
I don't want to hear any more thoughts like this from you.

378
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,130
This is my final warning to you.

379
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,350

380
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,550
it's so late.

382
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,750
I was wrong about the account book.

383
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:10,550
I'm sorry.

384
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,100
Next time, if something like this happens,

385
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,300
I'll definitely discuss it with you,

386
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:14,830
alright?

387
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,390
I want you to promise me.

389

Stay out of it.

390

From now on, neither Zong Fang nor Ling Han

391

Promise me.

00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,530
do you think that's possible?

395
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:33,870
Let me put it this way.

396
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,770
As long as you protect yourself and Grandma well,

397
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,300
you're already helping me.

00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,530
I know I'm not as capable as you.

400
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:46,110
But I'm not as useless

401
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,670
as you make it sound, am I?

402
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,910
I can still be of some help.

403
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,140
Who are you trying to impress by smashing that?

404
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,870
You think you're a big shot now?

405
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,690
Bai Qingkui has already been silenced.

406
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:11,090
If you make another foolish move like this,

407
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,890
you'll be the next to die.

408
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,670
Bai Qingkui is dead?

409
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,470
Who did it?

410
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,800
Today, the Deputy Chief sent people to kill Bai Qingkui.

411
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,960
He's already been locked up by Ling Han.

412
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,690
Before him, there was Li Liang.

413
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,040
Anyone who clashed with Ling Han

414
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,070
has met the same fate.

415
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,670
Do you still want to recklessly throw your life away?

416
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:34,550
So, in the end,

417
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,320
the problem lies with Ling Han.

418
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,230
I just don't get it.

419
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,750
Why can't we just cut the Gordian knot?

420
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:43,060
Wouldn't everything be solved if Ling Han were eliminated?

421
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:43,990
If he dies,

422
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,330
you and I will both have to be buried with him.

423
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,240
Why's that?

424
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:53,030
Because he's the director of the Supervision Division of Hunan Station.

425
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:55,980
Because he has made significant contributions to NBIS in the past.

426
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,670
Unless you have evidence proving he's a Japanese spy,

427
00:27:58,670 --> 00:27:59,790
once he dies,

428
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,360
we'll be enemies with the entire NBIS.

430
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,290
even if he dies,

431
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:08,480
he will die as a hero.

432
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,670
I didn't know that.

433
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,050
And you didn't tell me.

434
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,610
I just thought he was a very dangerous person,

435
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:18,670
and letting him stir up trouble

436
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,590
would cost many lives.

437
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:21,870
Besides,

438
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,060
are you sure you can deal with him?

Hongqi,

440
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,430

to test him.

442
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,230
As long as he slips up,

443
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,410
I'll have a reason to investigate him openly.

444
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,080
If you hadn't acted on your own,

445
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,740
Ling Han wouldn't have gotten the account book.

446
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,080
Why?

where did he go?

486
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:41,670
Yesterday, the NBIS had undercover agents all around this area.

487
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:42,770
They all had their eyes wide open,

488

keeping a close watch on every suspicious person.

489
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,790

and returned here,

491

he didn't raise any suspicion from these agents.

492
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,920
That means this area

00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,470
You came at the right time.

562
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,350
We were just about to eat.

563
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,600
Come. Sit here.

564
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,270
Sit in this chair.

565
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,470
Let's eat together.

566
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,850
Thank you, Granny.

567
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,230
Where's Yun Hongshen?

568
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:45,900
Isn't he here?

569
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,950
Oh, he left early this morning.

570
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:48,940
Let's not worry about him

571
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,270
and just enjoy our meal.

572
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,940
Here, have some

573
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,100
pickled mustard greens pancake made by Jingyu.

574
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,070
It's really delicious.

575
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,090
Bring those buns here.

576
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,020
We'll have a try.

577
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,750
Mi Lan,

578
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,730
have some porridge.

579
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:02,330
Thank you.

580
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:04,110
Zhu He's follow-up investigation

581
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,990
isn't Yun Hongshen's responsibility,

582
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:08,449
and he doesn't have any urgent tasks at hand.

583
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:10,480
So why did he go out so early in the morning?

584
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,190
Could it be

585
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,790
that Kawashima really confessed to him?

586
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:17,780
[Hunan Station]

587
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,130
Good morning, Sir.

588
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:46,360
Morning.

589
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:47,989
Why aren't you going in?

590
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:48,989
What are you doing here?

591
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:50,190
Just pretend you didn't see me,

592
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,030
and don't tell anyone that I came to the station.

593
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:52,830
Do you hear me?

594
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:54,429
I see.

595
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,030
I'll be leaving now, Sir.

596
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,510
He's quite carefree.

597
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,300
He didn't even say hello.

598
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,210
She walked away so fast,

599
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,470
as if escaping from the plague.

600
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,950
I didn't expect

601
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,070
that the first person to visit me would be you.

602
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:12,950
Deputy Chief,

603
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,570
is there anything I can do for you?

604
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,420
No need

605
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:20,820
You've done quite enough already.

606
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,590
How did that photo just happen

607
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:26,210
to be seen by Liu Chao?

608
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,190
I'm very sorry

609
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,550
about this.

610
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,940
I didn't expect it to implicate you.

611
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,870
You really should apologize to me.

612
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,250
If it weren't for that photo,

613
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:38,180
I wouldn't have been so impatient.

614
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,760
There's no use in just talking nonsense.

615
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:43,430
I did fall into someone's trap.

616
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,730
That's a fact.

617
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,020
I can't blame anyone.

618
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,530
So, are you not planning to fight back?

619
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:52,010
Getting a free meal is called taking advantage.

620
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,060
Taking a loss without resistance is called being a pushover.

621
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,190
Waiting for your demise

622
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,510
isn't your style.

623
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:59,110
You want to form an alliance with me?

624
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,950
It won't do you any harm.

625
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:03,470
In dealing with Ling Han,

626
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,390
our goals are aligned.

627
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,590
As long as our goals are the same,

628
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,390
we have a basis for cooperation.

629
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,360
Why should I cooperate with someone

630
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,270
who has plotted against me?

631
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,810
You don't need to trust me.

632
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,430
It's just a one-time deal.

633
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:19,190
As long as we can reach a consensus on this matter,

634
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,320
that will be enough.

635
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,480
You're quite frank.

636
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:28,100
What if I get back on my feet

637
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,890
and then deal with you?

638
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,830
Well, if that really happens,

639
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,800
I will have nothing to say.

640
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,100
But I believe our Deputy Chief

641
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,790
is a very smart person.

642
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:42,870
This time,

643
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,230
it was just a careless mistake.

644
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,360
Director.

645
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:59,830
Yun Hongshen went to see Deputy Chief early this morning.

646
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:00,870
They had a private talk for a long time.

647
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:01,550
A private talk?

648
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,030
Yes.

649
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,630
We eventually let that guy find a loophole.

650
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,190
Be more vigilant in the future.

651
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,180
If something like this happens again,

652
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,780
report it to me immediately.

653
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,270
Yes.

654
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:21,760
Sir.

655
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,490
Didn't I tell you to rest at home for a few more days?

656
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:26,690
Why did you come back?

657
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,950
It's not a serious injury.

658
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:31,390
A couple more days of rest or a couple less

659
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,740
doesn't make much of a difference.

660
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,430
Besides,

661
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,230
it's pretty boring staying at home.

662
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:39,390
Sir,

663
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,410
about Deputy Chief...

664
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:43,230
I heard something from Chen Dongping.

665
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,430
I don't think it's as simple as it seems.

666
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,130
I'm listening.

667
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,440
If Deputy Chief is the mole,

668
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,640
then many things don't make sense.

669
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,530
First of all,

670
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,580
after Li Liang's death, he would definitely feel a sense of crisis,

671
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,950
because Director Ling is the kind of person

672
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,960
who would investigate thoroughly if there's any suspicion.

673
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,790
Deputy Chief isn't in his position

674
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:04,510
just because of his connection to the Commander.

675
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,510
With his abilities,

676
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,310
he wouldn't have let things escalate to this point.

677
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,430
He would try to stop Director Ling's investigation

678
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,470
and, at the earliest opportunity,

679
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,600
eliminate Bai Qingkui to silence him.

680
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,020
Go on.

681
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,230
Deputy Chief isn't a risk-taker.

682
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:22,470
So,

683
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,860
that assassin shouldn't have appeared.

684
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:27,270
Because his appearance would mean uncertainty.

685
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:28,330
And the fact is that

686
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,480
someone did intervene.

687
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,150
Also…

688
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,140
Go on. What is it?

689
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,670
Don't you think this case

690
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,320
is somewhat similar to Li Liang's case?

691
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,630
You think so too?

692
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:47,470
Yes.

693
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,560
This similarity makes me very uneasy.

694
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:52,670
I have a bold theory.

695
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:54,990
If Li Liang's case

696
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:56,470
is actually a wrongful conviction,

697
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:59,430
then the person who created it must be incredibly dangerous.

698
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,710
He treats human lives as if they are nothing

699
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,790
and would do anything to achieve his goal.

700
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:05,450
This is too bold and too crazy.

701
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,840
[Archives Room]

702
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,510
Give me Wu Tong's files.

703
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:11,920
Yes.

704
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:15,880
Here, archive this.

705
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,200
The surveillance records of Mi Lan from the past few days.

706
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,410
Director Ling.

707
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:25,650
Has that person named Mi Lan

708
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:27,750
done anything unusual in the last few days?

709
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:28,220
No.

710
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,310
Have the photos for archiving been developed?

711
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:32,910
No.

712
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,480
You brought them to be archived without developing them?

713
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,350
Do you know

714
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,800
that many work-related mistakes

715
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,070
start with laziness?

716
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:41,100
The film was exposed,

717
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,430
but the photos weren't developed.

718
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:44,360
Everything you've done is wasted.

719
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,650
Can you guarantee that

720
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,610
there is no critical information on the exposed photos?

721
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:49,930
Go to the General Affairs Department for your punishment.

722
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:52,590
You won't be getting your salary for this month.

723
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:25,750
Granny.

724
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,080
I'm heading back now.

725
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:30,210
In such a hurry to leave?

726
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,070
I've just finished a night shift.

727
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:32,950
I'm a little tired.

728
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:33,550
Of course.

729
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,990
Get some rest when you get back.

730
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,390
You really have it tough.

731
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:38,800
Grandma,

732
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,040
I'll take her back now.

733
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:42,000
Alright.

734
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,830
Drive carefully.

735
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,710
Don't worry.

736
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:46,530
Goodbye, Granny.

737
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,190
Goodbye.

738
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:04,790
Sir.

739
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:06,840
Sir, I only run errands for him.

740
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,710
There are many things

741
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:08,830
I'm not aware of.

742
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,420
What a good girl.

743
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,600
When she first got together with you,

744
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,400
you were just a small-time thug,

745
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,470
a nobody in Bai Qingkui's clan.

746
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:29,970
She didn't mind you being poor

747
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:31,570
or being good-for-nothing.

748
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,590
She even tolerated you messing around outside

749
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,450
occasionally.

750
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:35,650
For all these years,

751
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:38,850
she has been with you, without any complaints or regrets.

752
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:40,800
Sir,

753
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,990
she's innocent.

754
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,310
She knows nothing

755
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,530
about my affairs.

756
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:46,780
I'm begging you.

757
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,780
Please let her go.

758
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:48,950
Please let her go.

759
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,220
As long as you cooperate,

760
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:56,940
I won't disturb her.

761
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:58,740
I will cooperate.

762
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:00,600
On July 2nd,

763
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:02,970
who entrusted Bai Qingkui with transporting the goods?
