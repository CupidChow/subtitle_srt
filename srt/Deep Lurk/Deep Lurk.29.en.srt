Why are you arresting someone from the Yun family?

7
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,260

This is public opinion.

33
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,240
I'm afraid they can't be brought back to Chongqing.

Why not?

35
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,120
Mrs. Jiang used to

36
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,940
owe Yun Muzhi a favor.

37
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,350
There's an official's wife

38
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,600
who used to be Yun Shiyan's student.

39
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,110
Besides, she has a say

went to Mrs. Jiang and caused a scene.

What she said hinted that

45
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,709
not only did Mrs. Jiang not return the favor,

46
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,260
but she also cast the Yuns aside now that their help is no longer needed

47
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,890

So, the Chairman is…

51
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,590
Actually, speaking of this,

52
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,710
The point is

53
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,800
considering the Yun family's influence,

54
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,140
the Director

55
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,770
planned to do it quietly

56
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,100
and make it public after we get the evidence.

57
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,640
But now,

58
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,710
we're caught between a rock and a hard place.

59
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,270
So, what is the Director thinking?

60
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,950
We can't keep them anymore.

61
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,320
But judging by the current situation,

62
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,310
if we try to do it the hard way,

63
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,740
everyone will look disgraceful.

64
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:05,960
Ultimately,

65
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,580
we lack evidence.

66
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,890
If there is evidence,

67
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,740
it'll be easy.

68
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,100
The Chairman still trusts Mr. Dai.

69
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,280
His view is

70
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,670
that we must get some solid evidence no matter what.

Have you seen Ling Han during your trip here to Changsha?

74
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,180
Now, you remind me.

75
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:45,260
Ling Han did express a desire to meet me.

76
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,060
Just tell me directly.

77

How is Ling Han?

78
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,860
Ling Han has changed a lot lately.

79
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,080
Even I can't figure him out.

80
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,130
And I found something strange.

81
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,070
I went to find Yang Ziming yesterday.

82
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,780
Yang Ziming's words revealed

83
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,820
that he seemed to be interested in Ling Han.

84
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,390
As far as I know, the two of them

85
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,340
haven't had much interaction before.

86
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,660
And Yang Ziming just came back to Changsha.

87
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,140
Why is he suddenly

88
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,000
so interested in Ling Han?

89
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,040
It's like when Ling Han suddenly became

90
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,720

Yun Hongqi also started to make a scene.

100
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,490
He asked someone to carry a coffin

101
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,300
and went to the station to collect Jingyu's body.

102
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,540
Besides, the refugees who have been helped

103
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,540
by Old Madam Yun also heard the news.

104
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,620
They went together.

113
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,540

114
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,330
in a case that cannot be made public.

115
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,460
What is the case that cannot be made public?

116
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,940
We don't understand.

We don't have your ability

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,400
to reverse right and wrong, either.

119

She's already dead.

121
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,700
You didn't go to find the murderer.

122
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,370
Instead, you are withholding her body from us.

123

125
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,860
Why don't you allow us to bury her so that she could rest in peace?

126

we're investigating.

128
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,740
Also, we didn't withhold her body.

129
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,780
We still have some procedures to go through.

130
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,580
What procedures?

131
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,860
How long will they take?

132

You caught the reporter, Ms. Zhu.

136
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,190
You didn't say you were going to take her life,

137

To be honest,

158

no matter what kind of disturbance those people outside create,

00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,230
I won't give you anything you want.

190
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,710
Even if it's for Wen Yeming?

191
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,140
If I were you,

192
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,090
I would admit it

193
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,300
so that I wouldn't get others into trouble.

194
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,550
In order to save your life,

195
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,690
Wen Yiming disclosed news about you to the public.

196
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,110
Now, reporters,

197
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,370
students from girls' school,

198
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,100
wives of many high-ranking officials,

199
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,000
and refugees

200
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,660
are all blocking the station entrance and making a scene.

201
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,920
If the investigation continues,

202
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,460
she'll definitely be implicated in it.

203
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,910
And you keep refusing to admit it.

204
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,450
Don't you feel sorry for her?

205
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,210
And Yun Hongqi.

206
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,460
You sent him away in the name of recuperating.

207
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,600
Didn't you just want to keep him away from danger?

208
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,340
But he's still involved.

209
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,260
Do you know what he's doing now?

210
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,510
He's making a scene outside, carrying a coffin.

211
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,510
You panicked.

212
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,160
It's not easy for you to say so much at once.

213
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,670
You're more suitable to pretend to be a cold-faced killer.

214
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,810
The moment you stood in front of me

215
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,120
and started to question me,

216
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,180
you already lost,

217
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,750
because you've exposed your weakness.

218
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,900
How could people like you

219
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,130
have weaknesses?

220
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,860
I have nothing left.

221
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,950
There's nothing for me to lose.

222
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,940
But you are different.

223
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,920
You have too many secrets to hide.

224
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,820
Also,

225
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,980
the desires that can't be announced

226
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,420
are your weakness.

227
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,380
If your opponent finds it out,

228
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,810
then you, Ling Han,

229
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,500
will no longer be Ling Han.

230
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,300
Use my spear to attack my shield.

231
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,050
You just tossed my questions back to me,

232
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,190
but you didn't deny my questions.

233
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,470
Isn't my weakness

234
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,740
exactly your weakness?

235
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,370
I might be lenient with Wen Yeming.

236
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:36,930
But Yun Hongqi…

237
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,810
Bring justice to the Yun family!

238
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,200
Let the deceased rest in peace!

239
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,600
Bring justice to the Yun family!

240
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,990
-Let the deceased rest in peace!
-Chief Ke!

241
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:55,630
Chief Ke.

242
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,480
Chief Ke is here.

243
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,030
Chief Ke.

244
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,180
It seems to be Ke Jingping.

245
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,070
Chief Ke, please say something.

246
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,140
Chief Ke, please tell us.

247
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:04,510
Chief Ke.

248
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,350
Please answer.

249
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,190
Chief Ke!

250
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,020
Chief Ke.

251
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,460
What case is Yun Hongshen involved in?

252
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,070
Is it so serious that you didn't even spare a little maid?

253
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:12,910
Is Zhu Qinghui's death

254
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,190
also related to this case?

255
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,020
There's news that

256
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,410
the truth behind this is

257
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,420
Yun Hongshen was deeply involved

258
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,830
in the infighting of the senior officials

259
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,420
and forced to become a victim of it.

260
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,010
-My question is…
-Everyone.

261
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,440
First of all,

262
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,300
Thank you for your concern for the NBIS's Hunan Station.

263
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,180
But I also want to remind you something.

264
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,820
As a journalist,

265
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,120
you need to have

266
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,750
the basic ability to distinguish authenticity.

267
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,220
Right?

268
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,400
For some false information,

269
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,000
you must block it as soon as possible.

270
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,450
Otherwise, it will cause unnecessary disturbance.

271
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,200
As for Yun Hongshen,

272
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,960
I can say a few words to you.

273
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,660
He was not involved in

274
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,810
the so-called infighting,

275
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,470
let alone becoming a victim of it.

276
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,120
Our work nature

277
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,250
is special.

278
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,270
Sometimes, we need to take some so-called

279
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,330
isolation protection measures

280
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,850
for some agents, myself included.

281
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,670
This is our work procedure.

282
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,490
I hope you can understand, okay?

283
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,200
You mean,

284
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,210
before the pressure of public opinion disappears,

285
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,530
Yun Hongshen is safe.

286
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,600
But in the end, you still want to use Yun Hongshen

287
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,620
to exclude dissidents?

288
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,780
Zhu Qinghui was killed.

289
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,160
Is it because she pried into

290
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,610
your secret business?

291
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,830
Please answer.

292
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,220
You're exaggerating.

293
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,570
What secret business?

294
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,110
I've said everything I need to say.

295
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,880
If you have more questions,

296
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,280
Yun Hongshen will come out soon.

297
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,200
You can ask him.

298
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,710
Okay?

299
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,860
Chief Ke, tell us what you think.

300
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,080
Say something, Chief Ke.

301
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,840
Don't leave in such a hurry.

302
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,880
You know what to say later, right?

303
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,320
Yes.

304
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,690
Don't you have anything to say to me?

305
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,500
No.

306
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,400
Where is the codebook?

307
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,830
It's safe.

308
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:10,550
[Bring justice to the Yun family!]

309
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,520
Shen.

310
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,840
Are you okay?

311
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,400
Mr. Shi will leave Changsha tomorrow night at the latest.

312
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,390
During this period, you have only one mission:

313
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,570
Find the evidence.

314
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,990
Is the key point "finding"

315
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,660
or that we have to prove that he's the one?

316
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,870
What do you think?

317
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,270
Mr. Shi came to Changsha

318
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,760
under the Director's order.

319
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,720
If he goes back empty-handed,

320
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,110
everyone will look disgraceful.

321
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,200
Everyone,

322
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,080
you only have one day.

323
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,760
It's up to you.

324
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,440
Deputy Chief…

325
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,540
Do your best.

326
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,100
Why don't I understand?

327
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,370
Do you?

328
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,270
About this,

329
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,770
I need to think about it.

330
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,710
I need to ruminate on it.

331
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,030
I'm worried that Yang Ziming

332
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,089
has already told Chen Lifu that Ling Han

333
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,400
is suspected of being a Japanese spy.

334
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:24,910
He will definitely hold on to this.

335
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,900
In the end, Yun Hongshen and Yang Ziming

336
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:27,650
will become

337
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,470
a hot potato to us.

338
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,130
Yes.

339
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,950
If we want to convict them,

340
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,790
Chen will definitely make a countercharge,

341
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,860
saying that we believed the slanders of the Japanese spy and wronged the loyal.

342
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,040
He might even label us as the accomplices.

343
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,460
But if we just let it go,

344
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,340
we'd be worried.

345
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,600
You scared me!

346
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,190
What shocking news did you hear?

347
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,400
I'm listening to Ling Han's interrogation record.

348
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,800
That brat

349
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,140
wants to make those two guys

350
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,770
say something against Yun Hongshen.

351
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,300
He hinted and lured them with a promise of gain.

352
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,940
Guess what those two did?

353
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,070
They didn't even understand!

354
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,160
He was so pissed.

355
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,300
What are you doing?

356
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:16,490
What's wrong?

357
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,390
It's not a secret.

358
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,430
I can't hear it?

359
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,840
No, why do you want to listen to it?

360
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,130
It has nothing to do with you.

361
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,050
Hey.

362
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,680
This is your fault.

363
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,240
You came in without knocking and tried to touch it without asking me first.

364
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,400
If you break my treasure,

365
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,140
what should I do?

366
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,110
Don't be mad.

367
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,850
Sit down. Sit down.

368
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,970
We've known each other for so many years.

369
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,970
I'll be honest with you.

370
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,200
I really can't read our superiors' minds.

371
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,920
I just want to know the exact order.

372
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,770
Yun Hongshen has made this thing

373
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,720
this big.

374
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,060
It's not just the higher-ups who are up a tree. Me too.

375
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,170
I just want to know the following procedures

376
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,000
so that I know what to do.

377
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,000
Do you

378
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,770
also suspect that Ling Han is the mole?

379
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,940
His expression is too obvious.

380
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,120
Chief said

381
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,170
Chen Lifu already knew about this.

382
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,080
Whether we investigate it or not,

383
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,740
our position will be awkward either way.

384
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,120
But Yang Ziming is suspicious.

385
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,710
That's irrefutable, right?

386
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,130
He went to Zhiya House before.

387
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,000
Those documents were found there, too.

388
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,780
And the secret drawer where the radio was hiding

389
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,520
and the people from Zhiya House went missing mysteriously.

390
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,490
With all of these things put together,

391
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,310
we can conclude that Yang Ziming

392
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,740
is not just the Minister of Economic Affairs.

393
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,120
He's not one of us.

394
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,370
What else could he be if not a Communist?

395
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,800
We are not the only ones who do intelligence work.

396
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,250
Don't you want to know

397
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,350
how Chen Lifu knew that Ling Han was the mole?

398
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,160
You mean

399
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,270
Yang Ziming…

400
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,310
The paper I found at Zhiya House—

401
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,270
have you interpreted it?

402
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,300
Not yet.

403
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,320
Hurry up!

404
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,130
I'm leaving.

405
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,480
Oh, right.

406
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,030
I asked you to dismantle the bug last time, but you didn't.

407
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,520
Take it down quickly.

408
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,520
If the Chief finds out,

409
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,560
you'll suffer!

410
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,100
I see!

411
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,220
Deputy Chief.

412
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,440
You two have a lot of free time.

413
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:54,640
No.

414
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,400
I have a question to confirm with Director Xu.

415
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,450
Why are you still standing here?

416
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:02,880
Are you waiting for me to invite you to dinner?

417
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,690
Deputy Chief.

418
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,390
Come on. Have a seat.

419
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:16,700
Let's begin.

420
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,660
The human brain catches a lot of

421
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,820
seemingly useless information every day.

422
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,460
Even if a leaf falls on the ground,

423
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,050
it doesn't fall for no reason.

424
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,740
As long as you pay more attention,

425
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,580
you can always find some clues.

426
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,130
What Zhang Xiancheng said before he died—

427
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:45,950
you may all have heard it,

428
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,400
or at least you heard

429
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,790
one of the keywords.

430
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,420
But because you didn't pay attention

431
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,530
or got distracted by other information,

432
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,450
you thought you didn't hear it.

433
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,050
Think about it more carefully.

434
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,680
Even a word

435
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,010
or a phrase, anything will do.

436
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,740
Alright.

437
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,690
He's obviously inducing them to make a confession!

438
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,510
Please connect me to Wang Mansion.

439
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,270
Is that Cousin?

440
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:45,890
What is it? Go ahead.

441
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,600
Investigate a person for me.

442
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,610
Shen,

443
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,570
I always feel a chill behind me.

444
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,760
It's like someone is watching us.

445
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,040
50 meters behind you,

446
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,200
someone is watching you.

447
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,680
Now, our heads,

448
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,440
chests, hands, and feet

449
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,740
are all targeted by different people.

450
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:37,520
Hongqi.

451
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,020
Go back first.

452
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,000
Protect yourself.

453
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,590
Don't act rashly.

454
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,320
They won't do anything to me for the time being.

455
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,520
They're just putting me and Uncle Yang

456
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,650
under house arrest.

457
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,000
Shen.

458
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,710
Last night, Secretary Wu told me

459
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,420
that Uncle Yang would find a way to save you.

460
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,470
But now, Uncle Yang

461
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,930
was also locked up by the NBIS.

462
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,130
What exactly is going on?

463
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,560
I don't understand.

464
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,640
Is this your plan?

465
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,100
Of course not.

466
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,340
He might have been tricked by Ling Han, too.

467
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,210
However,

468
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,420
I have to meet him first.

469
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,410
Hongqi.

470
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,740
Don't worry about this anymore.

471
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,030
I beg you.

472
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:27,800
Between the two of us,

473
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,370
someone has to live.

474
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,120
What did you say?

475
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,290
Yun Hongshen, look at me.

476
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,200
Look at me!

477
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,830
Do you think that's possible—

478
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,560
me leaving you alone

479
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,430
and living on my own.

480
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,330
Is that possible?

481
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,280
Give this to her.

482
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,920
You guys, take care.

483
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:12,770
Who?

484
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,590
Ms. Wen.

485
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,790
Shen asked me to give you this.

486
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,930
Are you investigating Ling Han?

487
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,200
Don't be nervous.

488
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,560
No one told me.

489
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,660
I guessed it myself.

490
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,280
Shen told me

491
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,170
that Ling Han was recommended

492
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,730
to your teacher by Dai Li, right?

493
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,840
But Ling Han is a traitor.

494
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,870
I'm 100% sure.

495
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,730
As long as I have evidence to prove it,

496
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,380
I'll stir up public opinion.

497
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,520
In comparison,

498
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,910
Shen's matter will not be a big deal.

499
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,770
Considering how much my father

500
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,780
donated military funds to the Nationalist Government,

501
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,200
Jiang will spare Shen's life.

502
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,420
Right?

503
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,620
That's pretty much the idea.

504
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,320
We have to work together.

505
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,350
I can see that

506
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,040
in this world,

507
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,530
we are the only ones who would save Shen

508
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:51,950
at all costs.

509
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,700
Don't worry.

510
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,910
I won't do anything

511
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,860
too confidential.

512
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,860
I should have a way to find Zong Fang.

513
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,750
As long as Zong Fang speaks,

514
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,260
then, his relationship with Ling Han

515
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,370
and the whereabouts of the cipher key

516
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,510
will be clear.

517
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,920
These two are good at concealing.

518
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,670
The NBIS didn't say they would arrest them in public.

519
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,910
They kept looking

520
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,440
but couldn't find them no matter what.

521
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,620
Could they have run away?

522
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,210
No.

523
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,350
They haven't finished their mission yet.

524
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,810
They definitely didn't leave.

525
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,240
Young Master, don't worry.

526
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,400
Playing hide-and-seek

527
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,120
is my specialty.

528
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,800
That's how I got my nickname.

529
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,300
I don't believe it!

530
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,300
They are just two rats

531
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:38,920
scurrying everywhere, chased by a cat.

532
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,120
Can they really dig any hole

533
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,610
that I couldn't even find?

534
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,920
We can't underestimate our enemy.

535
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,570
They are not ordinary people.

536
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,070
They know well about the NBIS.

537
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,010
Rat,

538
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,570
they must be clear

539
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,110
about your game, too.

540
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,840
Before Bai Qingkui died,

541
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,490
he was very close to Zong Fang.

542
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:03,930
Young Master.

543
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,990
Did you think of something?

544
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,450
Even a cunning rabbit has three holes.

545
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,360
Then, an old fox like Bai Qingkui

546
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,730
must have had more than three lairs.

547
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,030
Zong Fang bought off Bai Qingkui's henchman, Liu.

548
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:20,560
Then, Zong Fang must know

549
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,860
a lot of Bai Qingkui's secrets.

550
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,420
Then, he probably knows

551
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,090
where Bai Qingkui's lair is.

552
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:28,660
In other words,

553
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,630
Zong Fang

554
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,030
might be hiding in Bai Qingkui's house.

555
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,380
That's highly possible.

556
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,420
Huang.

557
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,550
Check Bai Qingkui's account for me,

558
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,720
especially the stale account and bad debts.

559
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,800
If he bought houses,

560
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,160
he'd definitely spend money.

561
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,670
As long as he spent money,

562
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,710
there would be corresponding receipts and transaction records.

563
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:48,690
Bai Qingkui didn't want anyone to know,

564
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,560
so he definitely tampered with the accounts.

565
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,460
Okay.

566
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:52,620
I'll check it the moment I get back.

567
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,360
Rat.

568
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,850
Go and activate your men.

569
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,760
See where there are empty houses.

570
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,370
Which houses would be cleaned regularly?

571
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:02,540
It's not hard, right?

572
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,090
Focus on the following key points:

573
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,030
Which empty house

574
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,050
suddenly had someone move in?

575
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,170
And once they moved in,

576
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,790
they didn't come out often.

577
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,630
It's not difficult.

578
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,870
But it takes a bit of time.

579
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,440
When I go back, I'll ask my brothers

580
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,310
to act quickly.

581
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,200
I'll reply to you as soon as possible.

582
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:16,900
Okay.

583
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,470
They don't go out casually.

584
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,940
Then, eating will be a problem.

585
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,650
They have enough money.

586
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,110
I'm sure they'll have the restaurant provide them with food on a long-term basis

587
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,260
and have the food delivered to the house.

588
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,980
Delivering on foot would be slow.

589
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,520
It's very likely for the food deliveryman to take a rickshaw.

590
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:38,920
I see.

591
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,190
I'll go back and tell my brothers.

592
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,160
Tell them to look for clues.

593
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,640
Brothers,

594
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,220
I'll count on you.

595
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,170
Search carefully.

596
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:03,780
Yes.

597
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:05,420
And you.

598
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:06,640
Search behind the cabinet.

599
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,290
Yes.

600
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:14,340
How did it go?

601
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,360
Everything is ready.

602
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,660
This wind chime is very delicate.

603
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,390
Did you make it yourself?

604
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,930
This is the first gift my daughter gave me.

605
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,470
She made it herself.

606
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,960
So when it was broken,

607
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,740
I found the same material to fix it.

608
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,420
It's been with me for over ten years.

609
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,680
As far as I know,

610
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,720
you have two sons who are studying abroad.

611
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,590
But I've never heard

612
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,100
you have a daughter.

613
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,800
My daughter died of a serious illness when she was ten.

614
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,060
I'm sorry.

615
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,200
It's okay.

616
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,710
Ke Jingping knows

617
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,150
since Yun Hongshen decided not to leave Changsha,

618
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,640
he wouldn't have taken the codebook with him.

619
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,900
Where would he hide it?

620
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,600
Who will he leave it to?

621
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,160
After thinking about it,

622
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,010
he believed that Yun Hongshen would definitely

623
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,450
hide the codebook

624
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,420
somewhere secret but easy to reach.

625
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,410
And the person who can get the codebook

626
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,800
must be Yang Ziming.

627
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,440
You have the codebook.

628
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,350
Chief.

629
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,050
Uncle Yang.

630
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,820
We haven't played Go for ten years, right?

631
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:57,790
Here.

632
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,360
Play a couple of rounds with me.

633
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:00,910
Okay.

634
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:04,900
Here.

635
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:05,950
Come and sit.

636
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,840
I remember when you just started

637
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,680
to learn Go when you were little,

638
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,550
you challenged me.

639
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,000
You said you would defeat me.

640
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,770
Do you remember?

641
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,300
Of course.

642
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:47,350
In my view,

643
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:48,140
they're playing Go

644
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:50,160
just to distract us.

645
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:52,450
It has nothing to do with playing Go.

646
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,250
It could be hidden

647
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,600
in some corner here.

648
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,700
Look for it.

649
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,190
Actually, there's really nothing secret about that book.

650
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,840
It's just Yang Ziming's

651
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,680
smoke bomb to divert

652
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,060
Ke Jingping's attention.

653
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:11,920
The real thing with the secret is the wind chime.

654
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,780
I've arranged everything

655
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,630
to help you escape.

656
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,930
I hope you can take care of yourself

657
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,580
and not let me and Muzhi down.

658
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:27,930
What about you?

659
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:07,880
You've cornered me.

660
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,170
You win.

661
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:26,360
I didn't sleep well last night.

662
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,450
I'll take a rest now.

663
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,470
I'll play with you later, Uncle Yang.

664
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,090
Go.

665
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,390
Sir.

666
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,710
Sir?

667
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,720
I can't let Uncle Yang die for me.

668
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,270
I have to find a way to clear his name.

669
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,400
Mi Lan hasn't come to work for days.

670
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,070
I've called her house,

671
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:57,990
but no one answered.

672
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,120
Did something happen to her?

673
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,500
Do you have

674
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,380
other doctors and nurses from Benevolence Hospital?

675
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:04,290
Yes.

676
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:04,960
But

677
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,200
they're all in different departments.

678
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,670
I don't know many of them.

679
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,380
I worked at Benevolence Hospital for many years,

680
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,390
but there are many nurses in every department.

681
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,040
I can't know them all.

682
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,060
Especially the youngest batch.

683
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:19,750
Those who were in charge of HR at Benevolence Hospital—

684
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,320
can you still contact them?

685
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:23,810
There's one.

686
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,490
He was badly burned during the big fire.

687
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,120
He hasn't fully recovered until now.

688
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,750
This is his current address.

689
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,170
Thank you.

690
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,700
The last batch of nurses who went to Benevolence Hospital—

691
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:54,100
I remember them all.

692
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,310
But my eyes were burned by the fire.

693
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,070
I can't see anything.

694
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,050
Do you have the personnel files of the nurses?

695
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,250
All burned.

696
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,750
Are you still in touch with those nurses?

697
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,660
No.

698
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,400
I don't want to see anyone in this state.

699
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,090
By the way,

700
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,570
well,

701
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,280
I've been in touch with Mr. Tong of the hospital.

702
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,140
Now, we are

703
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,970
kind of fellow sufferers.

704
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,710
He was also severely injured in the fire.

705
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:36,770
Can you give

706
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,830
Mr. Tong's address to me?

707
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:40,590
Sure.

708
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,290
I've never taught Mi Lan.

709
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,680
I don't know her well.

710
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:52,990
However,

711
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,440
I know something about her.

712
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,880
It's not good to say it out loud.

713
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:00,290
Only a few people in the school knew it.

714
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,640
No one dares to mention it.

715
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,190
Leader Wen.

716
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,380
The Chief is not here.

717
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,220
Sir,

718
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,320
you're awake.

719
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,470
Uncle Yang.

720
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,590
You still keep this photo?

721
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,330
The one in my house is gone.

722
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:03,480
Which one?

723
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,470
Look.

724
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,700
This one.

725
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,690
We took it when we were losing baby teeth.

726
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,490
Time flies.

727
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,680
In a blink of an eye,

728
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,550
you've all grown up.

729
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,270
Exactly.

730
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:19,560
Uncle Yang.

731
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,280
What is this place?

732
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:22,970
Looking at the houses around here,

733
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,080
they're like our Chinese-style buildings.

734
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,200
This...

735
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,630
Your dad and I took this photo

736
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,220
when we were studying abroad.

737
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:34,010
What's there to take pictures of here?

738
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,220
It's all bare, nothing interesting to look at.

739
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,580
Did you see the ice hole in the photo?

740
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,830
One day, I was drunk.

741
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,500
I insisted on skating on this river.

742
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:45,510
But suddenly,

743
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,330
I fell into the ice hole.

744
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:50,040
If your father hadn't risked his life to save me,

745
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,450
I'd die there.

746
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,300
So, this photo

747
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,540
is very meaningful to me.

748
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:56,540
Really?

749
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,520
My father saved your life before?

750
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,650
Why? You didn't know?

751
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,520
No.

752
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,870
No one told me that.

753
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:09,970
Your father always kept a low profile.

754
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,890
And he showed kindness without seeking a reward.

755
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,210
He was a real gentleman.

756
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,000
That's true.

757
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:22,010
My dad has always been my role model.

758
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,400
I really want to be someone like him.

759
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:30,900
Maybe your father

760
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:33,200
didn't want you to be like him.

761
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:35,010
Just be yourself.

762
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,920
But they are not contradictory.

763
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,120
No wonder you've always been so nice to me.

764
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:45,490
You treat me almost like I'm your own son.

765
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,200
It turns out that

766
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:49,040
you always remember that

767
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,070
my dad saved your life.

768
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,200
These are two different things.

769
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,060
Your father treated my two sons very well, too.

770
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:58,610
Some things are very sensitive.

771
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,360
Don't interpret it too much.

772
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,800
It seems that he has ulterior motives.

773
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:15,910
He wouldn't talk about the topic

774
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:17,750
of his father saving Yang.

775
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,570
I think Yun Hongshen wants to tell you

776
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,140
that Yang Ziming is willing to do a lot to protect him.

777
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,890
Yang Ziming cannot even protect himself now.

778
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:29,970
Who else can he protect?

779
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:31,770
What if Yang Ziming

780
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:33,200
wants to take all the responsibility?

781
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:34,980
He has been exposed.

782
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,420
Maybe he thinks saving Yun is still worth the shot.

783
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,010
He doesn't get to decide who to protect.

784
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:42,120
Unless Yun Hongshen is not a Communist.
