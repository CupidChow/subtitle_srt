I'm Wen Yeming.

00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,910
You should know me.

What's the matter?

7
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:47,620
I have the motorcycle you lost yesterday.

Got it.

Sir,

00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,170
you seem troubled.

And if Myna's intelligence is leaked,

16

I'm one of Boss Bai's men.

I heard your elderly mother lives alone in Liuyang.

39

You lost your father at a young age.

40
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,150
It wasn't easy for your mother to raise you alone.

41

Don't touch my mother.

I have a few questions for you.

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,160
My specialty isn't killing people,

46
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,950
but making them wish they were dead.

47
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,630
Okay, okay, okay.

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,630
I'll tell you.

Before my operation is completed,

58
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,130
don't let them out of your sight.

I won't tell anyone about the details of the operation.

62
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,329
With this two-pronged approach,

63
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:22,510
there shouldn't be any problems.

64
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,630
Your method is workable,

65
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,070
but it's too conventional.

66
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,710
However, since we don't have a better option right now,

67
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,740

the person Yun Hongshen was tracking

111
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,120
was called Ling Han.

112
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,350
He's a difficult person to deal with.

113
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,670
Why would Yun Hongshen

114
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,270
get involved with someone like that?

115
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,670
Hongshen is probably looking for someone,

116
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,790
and he might have found some clues,

117
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,650
so he's using this Ling Han as a breakthrough point.

118
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,670
No way.

What Hongshen needs to do

137
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,820
is also the task we need to accomplish next.

138
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:13,200

I don't understand.

Why do we need to follow her?

155
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,630
If you were Myna,

156

Wen Yeming is Ke Jingping's confidant.

161
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:36,960
At a time like this,

162
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,789
the NBIS has set up such a large defensive formation,

163
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:42,789
yet they send Wen Yeming to carry out a secret mission.

164
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,120
What could it be?

165
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,590
All traces of Qu Wenzhi's contact with me

166
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,310
have been thoroughly erased.

167
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,190
They can't trace it back to me.

168
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,110
Could it be related to Myna?

169
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,030
Is he planning to sell the intelligence to the NBIS?

170
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,550
Quickly notify our people.

00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,330
Be careful.

191
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,550
What is he doing here?

192
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,990
It's almost 10:30.

193
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,610
I cannot let him ruin this.

194
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,350
Catch him!

195
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,990
Who did they capture?

196
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,320
Could it be Myna?

197
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,550
"If it comes to the worst,

198
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,990
we'd rather kill Myna

199
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,310
than let Wen Yeming get the intelligence."

200
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,710
I'll stay here and wait for an opportunity.

201
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,390
It's already late.

202
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,940
Myna won't come.

203
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:09,960
Be careful.

204
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,290
-Catch him!
-Thank you.

205
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,250
That person just now was Myna?

206
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,480
Who?

207
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,190
Don't pretend to be confused when you know exactly what's going on.

208
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,070
Before we arrested you,

209
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,070
were you planning to meet with Myna?

210
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,060
Why should I tell you?

211
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,310
What do you want?

212
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:39,310
The NBIS is really lawless now.

213
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,710
You've started disregarding the law, haven't you?

214
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,920
You can be unreasonable and overbearing,

215
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,670
but what crime have we committed for you to arrest us?

216
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,070
You treat us with guns and handcuffs.

217
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,830
Do you really think the Yun family is easy

218
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,550
to bully?

219
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,270
Young Master Yun,

220
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,130
I suggest you don't talk too much.

221
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:56,630
Release my brother.

222
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,360
This has nothing to do with him.

223
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,930
Take both of them away.

224
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:32,800
Let's go!

225
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,040
You two go after him.

226
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,700
Yes, madam.

227
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,470
You come with me to chase the two who ran away.

228
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:40,790
Yes, madam.

229
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,470
Chen Dongping,

230
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,470
call an ambulance.

231
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,200
Understood.

232
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,980
Get out of the way!

233
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,150
Get out of the way!

234
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,780
How can you drive like this?

235
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:18,540
Drive fast.

236
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,290
Get out of the way!

237
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:17,670
Sir,

238
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,910
there are gunshots ahead.

239
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,910
Let's go check if anyone is injured.

240
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,050
-Come up.
-Come up.

241
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:35,770
Hurry up!

242
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,670
Quick!

243
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,240
Are you two hurt?

244
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,490
Shen, are you alright?

245
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,790
Thank you.

246
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,829
We meet again.

247
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,880
Why did you save us?

248
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,310
Young Master Yun saved me yesterday.

249
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,270
I saw you being chased.

250
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,270
So...

251
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,950
He's not in a good mood lately.

252
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,410
Don't take it personally.

253
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,920
Miss,

254
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,460
forgive me for asking,

255
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,350
but why are you here?

256
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,780
We received a call

257
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,240
saying someone was injured at Boya Tea House.

258
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,040
Pull over.

259
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,700
Pull over!

260
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,370
Please pull over.

261
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,350
Pull over.

262
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,230
Thank you.

263
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,350
Goodbye.

264
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,880
Goodbye.

265
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,330
Why can't we publicly issue a wanted notice for Yun Hongshen?

266
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,660
[Hunan Station]

267
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,590
Just based on the fact that he was there during that time period,

268
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,070
appeared at the Boya Tea House,

269
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,800
and had an encounter with Myna,

270
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,760
we have reason to question him.

271
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,270
If you don't have enough evidence

272
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,790
to prove he's involved,

273
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,950
you can't touch him.

274
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,350
Is it just because he's from the Yun family?

275
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,310
That's right.

276
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,030
Do you know the background of the Yun family?

277
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,510
Alright, I'll tell you now.

278
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,110
Yun Hongsheng's grandfather, Yun Shiyan,

279
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,390
after the abdication of the Qing emperor,

280
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,510
founded the Xiangjiang Girls' School at his own expense.

281
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,340
Although his students may not have spread across the entire country,

282
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,790
many wives of high-ranking officials

283
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,990
were his students.

284
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,950
Several of them were quite close to Madame Chiang.

285
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,110
Although the old gentleman is no longer alive,

286
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,350
many important figures

287
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,310
still hold the Yun family in high regard.

288
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,370
After the Wenxi fire,

289
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:57,190
the old madam of the Yun family has been distributed porridge outside every day.

290
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,390
The people of Changsha

291
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,190
are deeply grateful to the Yun family.

292
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,050
Now, let's talk about his father,

293
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,950
Yun Muzhi.

294
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,230
He was among the first group of students sent abroad with Boxer Indemnity funds.

295
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,350
After returning to China,

296
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,830
he developed finance and industry in Changsha and Shanghai.

297
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,510
He has also donated to our military expenses multiple times.

298
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,510
His friends are all wealthy and influential.

299
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,680
Alright, let's not talk about those faraway.

300
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,690
Do you know who

301
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:19,640
the new Minister of Economic Affairs in Changsha is?

302
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,070
Yang Ziming.

303
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,310
I'm sorry.

304
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,580
What happened?

305
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,710
I didn't see Myna.

306
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,410
And then?

307
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,210
Wen Yeming caught two people.

308
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,310
I was sitting in the car at the time.

309
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,710
I didn't see their faces.

310
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,510
I thought it was Myna,

311
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,690
then I fired.

312
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,630
As a result...

313
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,030
Go on.

314
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,720
That person was Yun Hongshen.

315
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,600
That's not even the worst part.

316
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,230
What other stupid things did you do?

317
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,550
Didn't you say to kill him?

318
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,710
I thought,

319
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,510
I might as well go all the way

320
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,440
and find a chance to finish him off.

321
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,310
You failed?

322
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,910
You've been exposed?

323
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,650
I was not completely exposed.

324
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,750
When I appeared the second time,

325
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,010
I wore a face covering.

326
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,670
How dare you say that?

327
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,470
As an agent,

328
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,630
having even one characteristic remembered

329
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,090
is equivalent to being completely exposed.

330
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:36,130
There's no point in discussing this now.

331
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,230
Don't go out for the next few days.

332
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,030
If you're discovered again,

333
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,630
take your own life.

334
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,150
Director Ling,

335
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,030
one person is absent.

336
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,160
A janitor named Niu Erhong is missing.

337
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:04,750
Find him.

338
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,270
As for the others,

339
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,510
take them to record their statements, one by one.

340
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,100
Record in detail

341
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,270
everything they've done

342
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,270
and seen

343
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,190
from this morning until now.

344
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:14,830
Yes, sir.

345
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,880
They kept us locked up all morning,

346
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,670
and in the end, Wen Yeming still didn't catch Myna.

347
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,870
Let's see how smug she can be after this.

348
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,930
Someone's going to be in trouble.

349
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,130
[Yun Residence]

350
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,240
Conduct 24-hour Level-1 monitoring on them.

351
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,310
Everyone entering or leaving the Yun family must be photographed.

352
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,310
Report any suspicious situations to me immediately.

353
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:41,950
Yes.

354
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,590
You.

355
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,910
Go and create some electrical problems at the Yun family's house.

356
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,590
Then disguise yourself as an electrician and go in.

357
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,680
Keep the Yun family members occupied.

358
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,070
I'll go in and search around.

359
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,270
Isn't that too risky?

360
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,340
What if we get caught?

361
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,780
So what?

362
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:56,830
If I dare to go in,

363
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,190
I'll definitely be able to get out.

364
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,990
But the Chief told us to investigate secretly.

365
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,950
Isn't it unwise to go in rashly?

366
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:02,590
Shouldn't we consult with the Chief...

367
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:05,070
If the Chief blames us, I'll take full responsibility.

368
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:05,870
Cut the crap.

369
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:06,470
Let's move.

370
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,130
Yes, madam.

371
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,230
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

372
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,270
-Young Masters...
-Dao.

373
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,160
There are secret agents watching outside.

374
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,690
The house is no longer safe.

375
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,550
Don't tell Grandma,

376
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,670
and make sure Jingyu doesn't find out either,

377
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:21,670
so they won't get frightened.

378
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,350
Also,

379
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,720
we can't come back for the next few days.

380
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,710
Take good care of this family.

381
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:26,350
Alright.

382
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,350
Hongqi,

383
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,510
I need to find a rickshaw.

384
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:34,510
Alright.

385
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,460
I have some friends at the rickshaw company.

386
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,540
They can help you find it.

387
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,080
The rickshaw puller was wearing a uniform from Guangyi Rickshaw Company.

388
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,610
Around 10:30 this morning,

389
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:40,990
at the intersection near Boya Tea House,

390
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,350
he picked up a hunchbacked old man.

391
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,550
I want to know where that old man got off.

392
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:46,790
Did you get all that?

393
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,510
Got it.

394
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,710
Old man, hunchback.

395
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:49,550
Dao,

396
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,390
climb over the wall to get out.

397
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,560
There are secret agents watching outside.

398
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,220
Also,

399
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,820
if Gangzi finds that rickshaw puller,

400
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,030
you must warn them

401
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,310
to keep this matter strictly to themselves.

402
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,110
Otherwise,

403
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,790
their lives could be in danger.

404
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,630
Don't worry, Second Young Master Yun.

405
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,430
I understand.

406
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,210
Go now.

407
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,170
You two be careful as well.

408
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:08,670
Shen,

409
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:10,630
come with me.

410
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,160
Shen,

411
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,510
today, in front of our ancestors,

412
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:23,910
tell me

413
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,600
what trouble you have gotten yourself into out there.

414
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,930
I want to hear the truth.

415
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,900
You saw it just now.

416
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,920
Once involved,

417
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,720
there's a constant risk to one's life.

418
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,390
Risk to one's life?

419
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,320
Has something happened to Dad?

420
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,370
Speak up.

421
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,120
Has something happened to Dad?

422
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:55,950
Talk to me.

423
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,510
Tell me,

424
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,880
has something happened to Dad?

425
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,510
Alright.

426
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,510
Ancestors of the Yun family,

427
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,750
I, Yun Hongqi, the eldest son of the Yun family,

428
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,940
as a son,

429
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,110
I am

430
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,870
unable to ease my father's worries,

431
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:17,670
nor

432
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,630
take responsibility for my brother.

433
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,160
I have failed our ancestors

434
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,880
and willingly accept punishment.

435
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,030
Hongqi!

436
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,510
Shen,

437
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,140
if something really happened to Dad,

438
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,070
and you don't tell me

439
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,360
and bear it all alone,

440
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,670
I'll be heartbroken for the rest of my life.

441
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:52,830
Hongqi!

442
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,590
Shen.

443
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,870
Did something really happen to Dad?

444
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,790
Did something really happen to him?

445
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,330
I'm sorry, Hongqi.

446
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,960
I couldn't protect Dad.

447
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,030
It's okay, Shen.

448
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,150
Tell me,

449
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,790
where did you place Dad?

450
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,950
Let's go bring Dad back,

451
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:43,190
okay?

452
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:45,930
I placed Dad's ashes

453
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,660
in Lushan Temple.

454
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:52,990
Ashes?

455
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,390
Dad is...

456
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,250
The situation in Shanghai was tense.

457
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,430
I couldn't bring Dad's body.

458
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,030
So...

459
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,890
Shen, it's alright.

460
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,310
It's okay, Shen.

461
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:36,750
I'm here.

462
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,150
Ancestors,

463
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:46,200
I, Yun Hongqi, apologizes for my unfilial behavior.

464
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,750
Unable to serve at my father's side,

465
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,470
attend to him in sickness,

466
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,430
carry his coffin, or keep vigil,

467
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,030
I feel deeply ashamed of failing my parents after all their years of nurturing

468
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,110
and education.

469
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,350
I, Yun Hongqi, swear,

470
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:08,200
if I do not avenge my father,

471
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,420
I am not a true person.

472
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:18,830
Secretary Wu.

473
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:19,670
Secretary Wu.

474
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:20,990
We'll go back and study it further.

475
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:21,750
Alright.

476
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:25,750
Minister,

477
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,090
urgent matter.

478
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,070
The two brothers are not at home. They've gone out.

479
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,110
Madam Yun said

480
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,750
they went to meet a friend of Yun Hongsheng.

481
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:38,110
Hongsheng has been away from Changsha for many years.

482
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,350
What friend could be so important to see?

483
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,270
Since he's already targeting the NBIS,

484
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,930
he must be investigating someone from the NBIS.

485
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,680
Notify Nighthawk immediately.

486
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,340
Tell him to keep an eye on the NBIS.

487
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,070
We must ensure Hongsheng's safety.

488
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,710
Yes.

489
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,270
How's it going?

490
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,890
How's that thing I asked you to look into?

491
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,440
That old man was quite strange.

492
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:01,070
He had me stop at the intersection in front of the Military Hospital

493
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:01,940
for a while,

494
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,430
then he turned back to a nearby bus stop,

495
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,670
and left by bus.

496
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,370
Don't you think it's strange?

497
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,210
Good job, man.

498
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:08,840
Thanks.

499
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,670
No problem.

500
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,270
Good work, bro.

501
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,350
Not at all.

502
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,590
Dao.

503
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,630
How's it going?

504
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,310
You've come at just the right time again.

505
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,550
We're changing shifts right now.

506
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:20,830
Is that so?

507
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,750
I got the answer as soon as I asked.

508
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,510
Come on.

509
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,380
Alright, thank you.

510
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,910
Tell me, how's everything?

511
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,800
After that, the person left by bus.

512
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,120
You can go out first.

513
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,030
Go and watch over Grandma in the front.

514
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:46,870
Protect her well.

515
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:47,670
Alright.

516
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,150
Young Masters,

517
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,750
call me if you need anything.

518
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:57,730
He stopped near the Military Hospital for a while,

519
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:59,210
then got on a bus.

520
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:00,670
Where is he?

521
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:14,410
Rickshaw.

522
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,310
Where to, sir?

523
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,930
To the west side of the city.

524
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:18,730
Alright!

525
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:22,240
[Xiangjiang Hotel]

526
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,950
Finding someone isn't that difficult.

527
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,910
I'll let my friends in the underworld know.

528
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,840
We should be able to find Myna soon.

529
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:32,710
Hongqi,

530
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:36,350
the fewer people know about this, the better.

531
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,610
The fewer, the better?

532
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:40,430
Then how are we going to find him?

533
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,330
Actually, many seemingly

534
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:44,630
unimportant details,

535
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:45,890
when pieced together,

536
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,440
could potentially be new leads.

537
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,160
There's no time.

538
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,590
We're running out of time.

539
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,790
By the time you piece it all together,

540
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,990
Myna will already be in someone else's hands.

541
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:53,830
Besides,

542
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:57,510
you're not the only one who can piece together details.

543
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,230
Wen Yeming and the person behind her

544
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,310
might be better at it than you.

545
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,330
Alright, alright.

546
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,030
Here's what we'll do.

547
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,030
I won't contact my underworld friends.

548
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,490
I'll only go to one person.

549
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,170
This person is called Xu Nian.

550
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,870
He's the go-to informant in Changsha.

551
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,270
There's nothing happening in Changsha

552
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,800
that he doesn't know about.

553
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,330
We'll search with him.

554
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,160
It's better than going at it alone.

555
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:20,490
Hongqi,

556
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,860
you might not know this,

557
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,220
but anyone involved in intelligence

558
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,240
likes to use people like Xu Nian.

559
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:29,090
What if he's a spy sent by someone else?

560
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,110
Then our search for Myna

561
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,600
won't be a secret anymore.

562
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,290
Even if you don't go to him,

563
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,770
this matter is no longer a secret.

564
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,310
I'm worried

565
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,990
that others might use him

566
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:42,670
to set a trap for us.

567
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,470
You can rest assured about this.

568
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,230
Xu Nian owes me a favor.

569
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,400
He'll definitely pay extra attention to my matters.

570
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,710
Moreover,

571
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:53,150
Xu Nian isn't new to this business.

572
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,830
He's not so easily manipulated.

573
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,550
Right?

574
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,410
Alright, stop overthinking.

575
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,750
If you keep thinking like this,

576
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,580
Myna might be found by the Japanese

577
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,140
or the NBIS.

578
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,510
They have more manpower and resources.

579
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,770
We're just two people.

580
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:07,990
One more helper

581
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,300
means one more chance of success.

582
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,690
Keeping people under control

583
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:13,390
doesn't completely stop information leaks.

584
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,870
There were so many of them. They needed to drink water,

585
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,060
eat, and go to the toilet.

586
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,720
This means there were many loopholes to exploit.

587
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,910
So after I came back,

588
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,070
I immediately investigated these three aspects.

589
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,950
I found that a janitor was missing.

590
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:24,750
I suspect

591
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:25,750
that this mole

592
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,790
used this janitor named Niu Erhong

593
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,210
to pass on the information,

594
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:31,140
and then killed him to silence him.

595
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,640
A total of five people went to the bathroom this morning

596
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,470
and sawn Niu Erhong.

597
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,880
I will investigate each of them one by one.

598
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,390
If only you had been here this morning.

599
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,550
There's one more thing.

600
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,480
Last week,

601
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,790
Happy House sent out a special batch of goods.

602
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:45,750
Last week?

603
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,080
Wasn't last week exactly

604
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,720
when Qu Wenzhi defected?

605
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:52,390
Is this matter also related to Bai Qingkui?

606
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:54,070
We can't draw conclusions yet.

607
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,230
Because this Bai Qingkui

608
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,270
often helps others transport some special goods,

609
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:59,590
loaded onto his labor trafficking ships and shipped out.

610
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,870
However, his rule is

611
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:01,750
not to know the owner of the goods

612
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:02,580
or the goods,

613
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:03,660
whether it's people

614
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,470
or things,

615
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,550
all packed in a large box

616
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,070
specially made by Happy House

617
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,870
and loaded onto the ship ten minutes before departure.

618
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,590
Not to know the owner of the goods

619
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,710
or the goods?

620
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,750
I suspect

621
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,140
the person who sent the goods

622
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,090
is the mole.

623
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,350
Even if he's not,

624
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,450
he must be connected to that mole.

625
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,680
Not to know the owner of the goods.

626
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,310
Ding Xing is missing?

627
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,350
Yes.

628
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,830
We've searched everywhere but can't find him.

629
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,430
Could he have fallen into the hands of the NBIS?

630
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,350
Even if he has fallen into the hands of the NBIS,

631
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,410
it's not a big deal.

632
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,830
He's just a worker.

633
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:39,230
What could he possibly know?

634
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,070
Besides,

635
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,270
don't you have the account book?

636
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,270
Don't worry,

637
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:45,110
I've hidden the account book very well.

638
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,030
Then what are you worried about?

639
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,030
What about Ding Xing?

640
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,630
If we don't look for him,

641
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,470
and our men find out,

642
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,070
won't they be disheartened?

643
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:56,880
If he really has fallen into the hands of the NBIS,

644
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,540
it won't be easy to get him out.

645
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,540
Moreover,

646
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,110
at this critical moment,

647
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,950
we need to be careful not to bring trouble upon ourselves.

648
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,130
How about this?

649
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:09,480
I'll find someone to discreetly inquire about the situation.

650
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,400
If it's not because of that shipment,

651
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,060
we'll figure out another way.

652
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,910
Who are you going to ask?

653
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,390
Zeng Mengying.

654
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:19,840
Isn't her husband Captain Tang from the police station?

655
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,440
Please, come in.

656
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:43,260
It was working fine just now.

657
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,270
Suddenly, the power went out.

658
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,830
Could you take a look and see what's wrong?

659
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,570
Does this happen often or is it just occasional?

660
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,240
It's the first time.

661
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,840
It's never happened before.

662
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,140
Then I'll need to do a thorough inspection

663
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,510
to see what's causing it.

664
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,180
Okay.

665
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,389
The birth of the new,

666
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:47,610
the demise of the old,

667
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:50,080
emerging amidst the waves of time.

668
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:51,429
Powerful nations become ancient graves

669
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:53,230
as seas turn to mulberry fields,

670
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:55,150
like waves that have faded away.

671
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,310
My love for you is my hatred for humanity,

672
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:01,770
for loving humanity means I cannot fully devote myself to you.

673
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,550
Are you busy?

674
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,550
Young Master Yun,

675
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,270
why did you come in person?

676
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:13,750
If there's something,

677
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,030
you could have just sent Dao to inform me.

678
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,190
I left in a hurry this time.

679
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,190
I didn't bring any money.

680
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,450
I'll leave this to you.

681
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:22,870
Fill in

682
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,070
the amount yourself.

683
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,470
Young Master Yun,

684
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:26,990
you're cutting my life short with this.

685
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,790
It's my duty to help you with anything.

686
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:29,870
This isn't necessary.

687
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:30,670
Really?

688
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:31,790
No, no, please.

689
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,100
Then I'll take it back.

690
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,480
Just kidding.

691
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,350
Business is business.

692
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:41,110
I'll pay what it's worth.

693
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,390
Alright, alright.

694
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,980
Then I'll accept it.

695
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,030
I need you to help me find someone.

696
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,220
A man aged

697
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,310
between 45 and 50 years old,

698
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,840
with a height between 180 and 185 centimeters,

699
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:58,350
who has traveled from Shanghai to Changsha recently,

700
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,150
no more than five days ago.

701
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:00,910
Okay.

702
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,550
I've got it.

703
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:03,880
I'll try my best.

704
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:04,710
You...

705
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,950
What do you mean by "try your best"?

706
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,030
In Changsha,

707
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,550
is there anything you, Xu Nian, can't find out

708
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,280
or any person you can't locate?

709
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:13,870
Young Master Yun.

710
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,000
You must get it done.

711
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:16,830
Rest assured.

712
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:17,590
Alright.

713
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,400
You can get to it then.

714
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,150
I'm leaving.

715
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,110
Take care on your way.

716
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:23,390
That's enough.

717
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,110
No need to see me out.

718
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:24,950
I'm off now.

719
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:27,670
Young Master Yun.

720
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,470
Take care.

721
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,510
The IOU.

722
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:42,910
Hongqi.

723
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:43,590
What?

724
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,970
You want to ask how things went, right?

725
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,130
Is there anything I can't handle?

726
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,700
There's nothing in Changsha that I can't accomplish.

727
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,310
Why did you have Dao tell the family

728
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:57,170
that we wouldn't be home tonight?

729
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,100
Hongqi,

730
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:00,890
about today's incident,

731
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:02,610
the NBIS won't let it go.

732
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,070
If we go back,

733
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,800
it will definitely cause trouble for our family.

734
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,760
Let's wait a bit longer.

735
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,880
Wait until I can

736
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,510
figure out this situation.

737
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:10,410
Alright.

738
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:13,060
Then let's just go to Uncle Yang's place.

739
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,630
The NBIS won't dare to mess with him easily.

740
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Let's not do that.

741
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,150
Uncle Yang knows I'm back,

742
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:20,680
but he hasn't contacted me.

743
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,480
He hasn't said he'd come to see me either.

744
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,880
He must know it's not convenient right now.

745
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,340
Let's find somewhere else.

746
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,550
Okay.

747
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,390
Don't worry.

748
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,470
I have many friends in Changsha.

749
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:34,030
We can stay at a different place each day.

750
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,190
We could even last a year or so like that.

751
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:38,390
Let's not involve your friends in this.

752
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,150
Then what?

753
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,590
Use the sky as our blanket,

754
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,480
the ground as our bed,

755
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,210
and be homeless on the streets?

756
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:45,790
We need somewhere to go.

757
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:49,400
Let's go to the Military Hospital.

758
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,230
There are people coming and going every day there,

759
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,890
and it's a military hospital.

760
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:54,770
It is indeed a good place to hide.

761
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,810
It's not just because of that.

762
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:57,640
I have a feeling

763
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,710
that Myna went to the Military Hospital

764
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,870
for a reason.

765
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,030
You

766
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,470
are just too young.

767
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:07,070
What purpose could he have?

768
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:09,230
He's just being mysterious.

769
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,390
He wants you to know he went to the Military Hospital,

770
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,790
and he wants you to go there and take a look.

771
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,420
His real purpose is only one thing,

772
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,520
to cover up his true...

773
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,050
Hongqi.

774
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,830
I just won't feel at ease if we don't go.

775
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,690
Alright, alright.

776
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,910
I'll go wherever you want to go.

777
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,270
We'll stop by the hospital

778
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,470
and check on your paranoia while we're at it.

779
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,270
Let's go.

780
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,150
Take a look.

781
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,390
Miss, please have a look.

782
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,140
Alright.

783
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:37,790
Huang.

784
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:38,830
Take someone to ask around here.

785
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:39,550
Sure thing.

786
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,690
Sir.

787
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:42,470
Officer.

788
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:44,230
Let me ask you something.

789
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,070
One is the eldest son of the Yun family.

790
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,430
The other is his younger brother.

791
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:49,750
Between 10:40 and 11:00 this morning,

792
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,870
did you see them pass by here?

793
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,050
The eldest son of the Yun family?

794
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:53,590
Yes.

795
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,520
Did you see them?

796
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,350
No.

797
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:57,790
Sir,

798
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:58,630
let me tell you something.

799
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,270
They're now wanted criminals.

800
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,070
If you're harboring criminals,

801
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:03,870
that's a crime.

802
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:04,670
Understand?

803
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:05,510
Officer,

804
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,510
I really didn't see them.

805
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,000
The Japanese are about to invade.

806
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,290
And you're not fighting them.

807
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,870
All you do is fight among yourselves.

808
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:11,790
You don't know anything.

809
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,250
We're catching traitors.

810
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,950
Catching traitors in my shop now, are you?

811
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:16,490
Fine.

812
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,630
Keep talking and I'll arrest you.

813
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,830
What's going on here?

814
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:20,750
Reporting, Captain.

815
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,680
She insulted us.

816
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:22,930
Who insulted you?

817
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:23,760
What did I say to insult you?

818
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,750
Tell me clearly.

819
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,480
What's all this arguing about?

820
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:27,710
Get back to work.

821
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,350
Yes, sir.

822
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,670
You should talk less.

823
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,390
You never know when to shut up.

824
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:32,870
Officer,

825
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,230
I'm really sorry.

826
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,830
My wife is just like this.

827
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,510
She doesn't know how to talk properly.

828
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:38,910
Who doesn't know how to talk properly?

829
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,360
You're the one who can't talk properly.

830
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,670
I haven't even complained about you being a silent gourd yet.

831
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,110
You're asking for a beating.

832
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:44,950
If you don't shut up,

833
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:45,990
I'll slap you.

834
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:46,670
Do you believe it?

835
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,990
Come on, do it.

836
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,230
Just slap me to death then.

837
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,110
If I had known it would be like this,

838
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,590
I might as well have let that ambulance this morning

839
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,550
take me away.

840
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,310
Would have saved you the trouble, right?

841
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:54,790
You...

842
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:56,790
Sir,

843
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:57,790
you go back first.

844
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,020
Ma'am.

845
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,050
Alright, alright.

846
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:04,850
You said you saw that ambulance?

847
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:07,510
An ambulance came this morning.

848
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,270
It just parked on the street.

849
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:08,580
Come up.

850
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,150
It picked up two men and left.

851
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:10,950
You know what?

852
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,430
Those two young men looked quite handsome.

853
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,350
Are you sure?

854
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,150
That makes things easier.

855
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,510
You'll have to come with us.

856
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,640
Once you're inside,

857
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,380
with your frail constitution,

858
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,750
you'll confess to everything.

859
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:25,550
No, no, no.

860
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,550
I misspoke.

861
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:28,070
I didn't see anything.

862
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:30,310
I was just arguing with my husband earlier.

863
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:31,390
I was talking nonsense.

864
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,630
-I was talking nonsense.
-Stop.

865
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,430
Come back.

866
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:39,590
You really didn't see anything?

867
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,710
Absolutely not.

868
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:45,320
If you really didn't see anything,

869
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,870
then you've just saved your own life.

870
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,920
Actually, this matter

871
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,230
is not under our police jurisdiction.

872
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,960
We police only handle arrests.

873
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:53,990
The people we arrest

874
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,550
are all sent to the NBIS.

875
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,310
Well...

876
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,960
You know about the NBIS, right?

877
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:03,110
I'm sure you've heard about their methods.

878
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:06,550
People go in there in one piece,

879
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,030
but when they come out,

880
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:11,230
at best, they have broken arms and legs;

881
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:12,950
at worst, they don't come out alive at all.

882
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:13,790
I swear,

883
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,360
I really didn't see anything.

884
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,960
I didn't see anything at all.

885
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:19,950
It's not

886
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,920
enough to just tell me.

887
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,550
No.

888
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,960
I'll say the same thing to whoever asks.

889
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,550
I didn't see anything.

890
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:28,990
Really, I didn't see anything at all.

891
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:29,690
Didn't see anything?

892
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:30,890
Didn't see anything.

893
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:33,030
Alright then.

894
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:33,790
Go on in.

895
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,570
Rest assured, Commander.

896
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,710
Since Myna has surfaced,

897
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,170
it's only a matter of time before we find him.

898
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,600
Yes, I understand.

899
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:53,150
I will find Myna and obtain the intelligence as soon as possible.

900
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:55,410
However, three days is indeed too tight.

901
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,550
Understood.

902
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:12,910
Have you verified everything at the tea house?

903
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,990
Based on the physical description you provided,

904
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,660
someone saw a person resembling Myna

905
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,400
get into a rickshaw and leave.

906
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:19,590
Did you find the rickshaw puller?

907
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,830
We found his body.

908
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:21,930
Body?

909
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:22,670
Yes.

910
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:24,890
Judging from the method of killing,

911
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:26,390
it was done by a professional.

912
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:28,750
With one strike, the liver was cut in half.

913
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:30,200
Due to the extreme pain,

914
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,390
he didn't even have the strength to call for help.

915
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:34,320
He died from excessive blood loss.

916
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:35,550
Madam.

917
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:36,590
Do you think

918
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:39,310
it's possible that Myna did it himself?

919
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,870
He didn't want anyone to know where he went.

920
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:43,870
That's highly possible.

921
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:47,350
But we can't rule out other possibilities.

922
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:49,610
Keep investigating along this lead.

923
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,480
Understood.

924
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,610
What's the matter?

925
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,350
Li Xuemin is dead.

926
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:02,050
How could this happen?

927
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,930
I called an ambulance.
