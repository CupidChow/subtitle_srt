[Episode 36]

3
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,820
Director, would you like some?

4
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,670
I'm not a fan of chocolate.

5
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,430
Thank you, though.

6
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,330
I haven't had lunch,

7
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,750
and I'm a bit hungry.

8
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,470
Just a quick snack.

9
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:40,820
Director,

10
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,040
my stomach hurts a bit.

11
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,100
I need to use the restroom.

12
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,760
Pull over.

13
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:47,910
Hurry up.

14
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,400
When the real work starts, the excuses multiply.

15
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,340
Sir,

16
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,200
the bill please.

17
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,220
I found this.

18
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,590
Go to Mi Lan's place and scare Zong Fang away.

19
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,370
Mi Lan's place.

20
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,220
Quick.

21
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,140
-Go to Mi Lan's place!
- Got it.

22
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,740
She's hiding at her own house?

23
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,070
Zong Fang is probably at their place.

24
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:10,770
Dao.

25
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,150
Move at top speed!

26
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,680
We have to get there before the NBIS does.

27
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,070
Don't worry.

28
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,760
I know the shortcuts in Changsha like the back of my hand.

29
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,690
We'll take a shortcut.

30
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,590
Director,

31
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,010
we can divide into three action groups.

32
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,230
Group A will handle the attack, and I'll lead it.

33
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,950
Groups B and C can be under your command.

34
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,830
What do you think?

35
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,120
Not bad. Very thorough.

36
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,900
Let's go with that.

37
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,350
We're almost there.

38
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,210
Get ready to move.

[Detailed map of the capital city of Hunan Province and surroundings]

40
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,130
Don't make a sound.

41
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,710
They're gone, Young Master.

42
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,220
Get in the car, quickly.

43
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,170
Why is this painting placed here?

44
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,430
Was something pinned to the wall before?

45
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,550
Lyu.

46
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,230
Present!

47
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,690
Find me a map,

48
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,170
80 by 50 centimeters.

49
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,700
And prepare a box of thumbtacks.

50
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,670
Yes, Sir.

51
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:24,910
Wait a second.

52
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,750
Take this away later, too.

53
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,410
Yes.

54
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,960
Don't touch anything here yet.

55
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,790
Keep it as it is.

56
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,520
The water is still warm.

57
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,830
And the tea was freshly brewed.

58
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,100
Why did he suddenly run off?

59
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,060
You.

60
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,150
Go find someone to ask around.

61
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,960
See if anyone saw Zong Fang leaving

62
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,470
and how he left.

63
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,300
Understood.

64
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:23,640
Leader Yun.

65
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,030
Here's what you asked for.

66
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,990
These thumbtack positions

67
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,440
should represent the sites they're targeting.

68
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,440
But I can't guarantee

69
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,580
my reconstruction is completely accurate.

70
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:16,860
There might be some discrepancies.

71
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,350
I have a question.

72
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,440
There are at least a dozen

73
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,260
thumbtacks on this map, maybe more.

74
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,070
And that's not even the exact count.

75
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,770
How could Zong Fang, on his own,

76
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,750
manage to bomb so many places?

77
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,450
That's way too incredible.

78
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,870
So I suspect

79
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,390
there's more to this.

80
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,260
When Ling Han planned this operation,

81
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,600
he must have realized

82
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,460
they didn't have many people.

83
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,250
How could they accomplish the task

84
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,090
with limited manpower?

85
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,600
Chief.

86
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,230
I've thought about this issue too.

87
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,930
But I can't figure it out.

88
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,110
Now that Zong Fang's the only one left,

89
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,790
how could he possibly

90
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,180
bomb so many places?

91
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,990
Do you think he's hiding

92
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,140
some secret we don't know about?

93
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,980
I'm not sure either.

94
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,800
But I'm thinking,

95
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,340
if Zong Fang is going to carry out so many bombings on his own,

96
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,130
he probably wouldn't choose daytime.

97
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,760
Nor would he do it during the curfew.

98
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,410
He'd most likely act around midnight.

99
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,150
Considering the time now,

100
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,120
it's 4:47 PM.

101
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,260
There are just over seven hours until midnight.

102
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,430
Yun Hongshen,

103
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,270
you need to figure out

104
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,550
the real plan within these seven hours.

105
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,850
So we'll stop looking for Zong Fang?

106
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,900
Not stop entirely,

107
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,080
but delay it for a bit.

108
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,910
If Ling Han can really have Zong Fang

109
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,390
carry out so many bombings,

110
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,790
the consequences would be unimaginable.

111
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,170
So the most urgent task now

112
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,270
is to figure out what Ling Han's

113
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,080
so-called "clear path" is.

114
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:02,910
Wait a minute.

115
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,950
Shouldn't he be forcing me

116
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,410
to immediately find Zong Fang?

117
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,150
The solution to the bombing

118
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,480
is like two sides of a coin.

119
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,150
If Zong Fang is found,

120
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,910
there will be no one to carry out the bombings.

121
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,960
Conversely,

122
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,610
if the method behind the bombings is deciphered,

123
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,000
it can also stop Zong Fang.

124
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,540
So no matter what order

125
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,620
Ke Jingping gives Yun Hongshen,

126
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,090
it wouldn't raise suspicion.

127
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,650
But Ke Jingping told him to delay finding Zong Fang.

128
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,000
That order shouldn't have come from Kunwu.

129
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,350
Kunwu only wants to quickly complete

130
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,690
the strategic deception plan

131
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,710
and wouldn't give Yun Hongshen time to introduce new variables.

132
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,190
To achieve this goal,

133
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,770
Kunwu wouldn't design an overly complicated plan.

134
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,460
So, is Ke Jingping really Kunwu?

135
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,860
Yun Hongshen is completely confused.

136
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,440
Has he fallen into Ling Han's trap,

137
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:57,030
or into a new conspiracy by Ke Jingping?

138
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,490
Zong Fang left in a hurry,

139
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,500
taking only the most important items.

140
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:03,690
And

141
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,110
his method of destroying evidence was particularly crude.

142
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,710
This suggests

143
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,590
that he must have faced some kind of emergency,

144
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,230
forcing him to evacuate.

145
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,810
But what was the emergency?

146
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,670
Was someone after his life?

147
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,030
And who would that person be?

148
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,070
How did he know

149
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,920
Zong Fang was hiding in Mi Lan's house?

150
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,350
If it wasn't about his life,

151
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,310
then it must have been a problem with his operation.

152
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,810
But his accomplices are all gone.

153
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:30,870
How did he find out?

154
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,700
All this talk,

155
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,230
but what exactly are you trying to say?

156
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,080
I think someone tipped him off.

157
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,640
Of course, it's also possible

158
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,670
he had some kind of pre-installed

159
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,790
early warning system we don't know about.

160
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,230
As soon as we got close,

161
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,270
he was alerted

162
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,110
and left ahead of time.

163
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,770
Go investigate.

164
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,120
Yes.

165
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,460
Director,

166
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,800
I think this is just an ordinary piece of wrapping paper.

167
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,310
I hope

168
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,100
so too.

169
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,240
Throw it away.

170
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,960
I had someone retrieve

171
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,310
this piece of paper immediately,

172
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,190
but Zong Fang still escaped.

173
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,840
It seems the paper had nothing to do with it.

174
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,420
Then what exactly went wrong?

175
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,420
Well, the chocolate was eaten,

176
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,920
so of course, the wrapping paper would have been thrown away.

177
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,350
Nothing strange about that.

178
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,190
That's you.

179
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,400
Yun Hongshen comes from a prestigious family.

180
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,670
How can his habits compare to yours?

181
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:02,560
Right.

182
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,150
But no matter how noble,

183
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,480
he has to throw out trash sometimes, right?

184
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,400
Leave.

185
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:08,840
Get lost!

186
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,390
Yes.

187
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,350
These pieces of information were too chaotic and fragmented.

188
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,360
Yun Hongshen couldn't

189
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,390
integrate them all at once,

190
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,340
nor could he figure out

191
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,160
which detail was truly important.

192
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,910
This task was too overwhelming

193
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,400
and cumbersome.

194
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,030
Come in.

195
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:35,970
Leader Yun,

196
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,270
it's all organized for you now.

197
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,620
So quickly?

198
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:39,350
Thank you.

199
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,130
You're welcome.

200
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,740
Well, I'll let you get back to work.

201
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,960
I have other tasks to attend to, so I'll be on my way.

202
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,240
Hello?

203
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,470
Is this the Archives?

204
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,400
This is Yun Hongshen from the Operations Division of the NBIS.

205
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,230
There's something

206
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,030
I need to check with you.

207
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,350
Did our Director Ling contact you

208
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,750
about half a month ago?

209
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,500
Yes.

210
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,520
How long did he stay?

211
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,300
What kind of materials did he review?

212
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,210
Got it.

213
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,630
Thank you.

214
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:31,290
Please call me back once you've figured it out.

215
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,860
My number is...

216
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,210
Deputy Chief,

217
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:41,830
are you busy?

218
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:42,440
No,

219
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,640
I'm also looking into

220
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,880
the "clear path" Ling Han pointed out to Zong Fang.

221
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:48,440
Have a seat.

222
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,340
What's up?

223
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,230
Need something from me?

224
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,310
Deputy Chief,

225
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,120
do you remember who provided the birth certificate

226
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,140
for Ling Han to Director Ji back then?

227
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,970
Can you still find that person?

228
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,310
I can.

229
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,140
Why?

230
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,630
I just had a sudden thought.

231
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,030
This person might be in danger.

232
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,349
You're worried that Ling Han holds a grudge against him

233
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:11,810
for revealing his origins

234
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,660
and might use the Japanese to get revenge?

235
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:17,270
Everything that's happened since Ling Han's death

236
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,150
proves he's a vindictive,

237
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,420
ruthless person.

238
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:22,940
For such a deep grudge,

239
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,180
if he can't act directly,

240
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,230
he'd use the Japanese to take it out on others.

241
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,150
You've got a kind heart,

242
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:31,760
truly.

243
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,380
But I don't think it's necessary.

244
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,200
Our useless compassion

245
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:38,990
could become a burden,

246
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,110
and it doesn't do us

247
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,050
any good.

248
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:44,960
I understand.

249
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,530
But sometimes,

250
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,600
if I don't speak up about something,

251
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,070
I feel uneasy.

252
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,820
Some lives

253
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,390
we can coldly disregard,

254
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,360
but for their families,

255
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,840
losing them

256
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,120
is like the sky falling.

257
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,350
Just now, while going through some records,

258
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,230
I accidentally

259
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,940
came across a record of compensation payments.

260
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,600
No idea which careless person

261
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:13,990
stuffed it

262
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,030
into Ling Han's office communication records.

263
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,150
When I saw it,

264
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,020
it brought back memories

265
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,410
and made me think of that person.

266
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,520
Forget it. No need to go on.

267
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,430
Anyway, Deputy Chief, I'll let you get back to work.

268
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,510
I'll take my leave now.

269
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,310
"Brought back memories" ?

270
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,710
He specifically came to me to just for this trivial matter.

271
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:11,920
No, that can't be it.

272
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,510
He wouldn't bring personal emotions like this

273
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:15,310
into work.

274
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,470
He'd never want anyone to notice that side of him.

275
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,890
He put a dried flower

276
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,460
inside a chemistry book.

277
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,600
That must hold some meaning.

278
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,030
Hello?

279
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:35,530
Hello,

280
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,760
this is the City Archives.

281
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,250
I've found the materials Director Ling reviewed that day.

282
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,240
Okay.

283
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,160
Just a moment.

284
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:45,800
Go ahead.

285
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,290
Ling Han only stayed at the Archives

286
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,590
for just over an hour.

287
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,940
There's no way he could have gone through all the documents.

288
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,050
Most of the documents he checked were likely to divert attention.

289
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,850
What he really wanted to see

290
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,670
must have been this

291
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,710
piece of Western research

292
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,670
on East Asian racial analysis.

293
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,230
At the time, he might have already

294
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,460
suspected something about Ke Jingping

295
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,270
and wanted to identify traits

296
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,510
that distinguished him from the Chinese.

297
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,210
That's why he sought out this kind of research material.

298
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,460
If Ke Jingping wanted to make something of the fact

299
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,940
that Ling Han visited the Archives,

300
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,400
the list of documents is definitely not what

301
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,620
he wants Yun Hongshen to see.

302
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,070
Hello?

303
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,950
This is Yun Hongshen.

304
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,630
I called earlier.

305
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:45,940
Sorry to trouble you again,

306
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,840
but I have another question for you.

307
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,800
Have you noticed any missing materials recently?

308
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,440
So that's how it is.

309
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,600
Ke Jingping really is vicious.

310
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,590
Yun Hongshen figured it out so quickly?

311
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,910
That's some sharp thinking.

312
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,810
Well, that's why he's an impressive figure.

313
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,790
He's only been here for a short while,

314
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,410
and now he's on equal footing with us.

315
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,420
Exactly.

316
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,470
In the past, whenever there was a major meeting at the station,

317
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,530
only we directors could attend.

318
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:34,960
Now,

319
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:35,960
it seems like we can't even

320
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,260
hold a meeting without Yun Hongshen.

321
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:44,900
Chief,

322
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,640
time is tight.

323
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:46,710
Let me get straight to the point.

324
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:47,330
Go ahead.

325
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,670
These locations are clustered together.

326
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,360
A bank, a hospital, a school, the City Government building,

327
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:59,510
[Map of Changsha]

328
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,710
and a department store.

329
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,100
If there's a chain of explosions

330
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,970
at these locations,

331
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,660
this entire area will be devastated.

332
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,850
A chain of explosions?

333
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,250
This isn't a relay race.

334
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,740
Zong Fang is the only one left.

335
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:04,610
How could he pull off a chain reaction?

336
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,230
By using the underground pipelines for detonation.

337
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:07,850
Half a month ago,

338
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,480
Ling Han visited the City Archives

339
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,190
and spent over an hour there.

340
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,510
Afterward, a set of

341
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,330
underground pipeline design plans for Changsha went missing.

342
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,150
I've gone through the details briefly,

343
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,440
and I think I understand his plan.

344
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,480
Zong Fang likely placed explosives

345
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:24,230
throughout these underground pipelines.

346
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,350
Near every spot where explosives are stored,

347
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,460
there are flammable and explosive solid materials.

348
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,200
Additionally, beneath every residential area and office building,

349
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,340
there's a septic tank.

350
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,360
As long as there's an open flame,

351
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,840
a gas explosion could easily occur.

352
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,150
The shockwave from the explosion

353
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:37,010
would ignite those flammable materials,

354
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,510
which would then detonate the nearby explosives,

355
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,840
triggering the next round of explosions.

356
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,640
This process would repeat,

357
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,650
creating a chain reaction.

358
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,790
And a single person

359
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:47,690
could orchestrate this entire chain reaction.

360
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,650
Zong Fang prepared everything half a month ago?

361
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,840
Do you know the starting point

362
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,980
of this gas explosion?

363
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,080
It's likely the Military Hospital.

364
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,980
That's where Mi Lan used to work.

365
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,890
She and Zong Fang are both familiar with the area,

366
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,290
making it easier for them to act.

367
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,550
If the underground pipelines in that area

368
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,630
contain so many explosives,

369
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,080
the entire zone

370
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,020
is essentially a giant powder keg.

371
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,800
A casually tossed cigarette butt,

372
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,830
a child setting off a firecracker...

373
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,030
Any open flame could trigger an explosion.

374
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,340
And Zong Fang will likely

375
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,800
act tonight.

376
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,750
His last safe location

377
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,750
has already been discovered by us.

378
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,520
So, Chief,

379
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,110
I suggest immediate action.

380
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,110
Notify the search team

381
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,000
to head there immediately.

382
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,040
Ensure all entrances and exits

383
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,800
of the underground pipelines are secured.

384
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,430
Also,

385
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,040
have the police head over

386
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,470
to maintain order at the scene.

387
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,230
Yun Hongshen,

388
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,880
you and Director Gong will oversee this operation.

389
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,230
All station resources are at your disposal.

390
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:37,870
Yes, Sir.

391
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,680
Go ahead.

392
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,120
Captain,

393
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,830
the team is here.

394
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,710
Block all the intersections

395
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,790
and conduct thorough inspections of passing vehicles.

396
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,500
Roger.

397
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,720
Disperse.

398
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,390
Put this in the back car.

399
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,870
And this one in the front car.

400
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:54,680
Move quickly!

401
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,390
Director,

402
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,510
I'll head straight to the hospital.

403
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,950
You go check the bank first.

404
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,630
Once the explosives there are cleared,

405
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,510
come meet me at the hospital.

406
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:02,950
Alright.

407
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:03,790
I'll head over now.

408
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:28,940
[DANGER]

409
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,790
Keep an eye on everything.

410
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,230
No unauthorized personnel are allowed near.

411
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,360
Yes, Madam.

412
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,880
We have a major operation near the hospital today.

413
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,520
I've heard Zong Fang is planning

414
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,670
a chain explosion in the area.

415
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,550
Go notify the doctors

416
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,910
to secure any items

417
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,110
that could cause an explosion.

418
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,590
Who's down there now?

419
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,600
Liu Chao from Team Two.

420
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,840
Tell him to keep a close watch on every nook and cranny

421
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,920
of the hospital.

422
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,430
Mi Lan worked here for a long time.

423
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,940
She was very familiar with this place,

424
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,790
which means Zong Fang is also very familiar with this place.

425
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,470
Don't let him exploit any gaps.

426
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,220
Understood.

427
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,790
There are so many trash bins on the road,

428
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,070
yet you had to throw it on the ground?

429
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,310
What if it caused a fire?

430
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:26,940
Yes.

431
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,530
We won't do it again.

432
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,130
You may leave.

433
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,210
Let's go.

434
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,850
Captain Tang,

435
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,870
from now until the operation is over,

436
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,130
no open flames are allowed on the streets.

437
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,290
Advise people to stay inside and not roam around.

438
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:38,990
Don't worry.

439
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:39,940
Leave it to me.

440
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,980
Open that box.

441
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,650
Pair up.

442
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:44,120
One person carries a flashlight,

443
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,230
the other a water bottle.

444
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,230
When you go down,

445
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,760
immediately wet the ground.

446
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,880
Once you find the explosives,

447
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,200
leave one person to handle the site.

448
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,150
Make sure there are no hazards left behind.

449
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:52,990
Go.

450
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,160
Huang,

451
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,800
arrange this task.

452
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,790
Don't worry, Captain.

453
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,230
Captain Tang,

454
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,230
come with me.

455
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,700
-Okay.
-Pair up in teams.

456
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:01,890
Here.

457
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,580
Captain Tang,

458
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,150
I remember you're a local of Changsha, right?

459
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,320
Yes,

460
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,200
I've never

461
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,550
left Changsha since I was born.

462
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,680
So you're familiar with every street and alley here?

463
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,320
I'm not looking for “kind of familiar”.

464
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,750
I need you to know it inside out.

465
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,560
Well,

466
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,870
I wouldn't say

467
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,070
I know every street

468
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,950
and every little corner,

469
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:26,720
but

470
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,840
I have a solid sense of the area.

471
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,270
Within this range,

472
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,580
are there any places that people usually ignore

473
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,390
or that don't have much practical use?

474
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,870
Let me think.

475
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,590
It's because people rarely pay attention to such places

476
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,470
that

477
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:49,730
I haven't memorized them.

478
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,520
Although I'm also from Changsha,

479
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,840
I've been away for too long.

480
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,590
I don't recognize many places anymore.

481
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,760
This is something I'll have to rely on you for.

482
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,720
Zong Fang's last safe location

483
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,430
has just been raided.

484
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,530
To complete his final task,

485
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,800
he's likely conducting a last-minute inspection...

486
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,510
-And may be hiding somewhere nearby.
-Please avoid going outside unnecessarily.

487
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,430
Residents, please stay safe.

488
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:17,250
Okay.

489
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,310
Let's work together on this.

490
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:21,620
Tonight,

491
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,330
Zong Fang will meet his end at our hands.

492
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,070
Could he have discovered my true identity?

493
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,050
Didn't Secretary Wu keep it from him?

494
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,520
Don't worry.

495
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:35,190
I'll stay by your side

496
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,630
to help you complete this mission.

497
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,050
Good.

498
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,150
Once you find him,

499
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,440
come to the Military Hospital to meet me.

500
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:32,990
Sir.

501
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,790
He must have slipped in through the back door.

502
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,110
From my experience,

503
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,350
on a dark and windy night like this,

504
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,620
one wouldn't use the main entrance to do something shady.

505
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,500
So

506
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,730
the back door is their top choice.

507
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:43,810
Don't you agree?

508
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,520
That's why you're not cut out to be a true villain.

509
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:48,880
All it takes is someone blocking the back door,

510
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,150
and you'd be caught instantly.

511
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:52,640
Leader Yun,

512
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:53,790
I've figured it out!

513
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:54,760
Where?

514
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,110
By coincidence,

515
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,200
it's not far from here.

516
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,590
Exit the hospital gates

517
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,560
and head north for 200 meters.

518
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,110
There's an east-west street.

519
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,340
The further west you go on that street, the more desolate it gets.

520
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,040
To the south is a residential area,

521
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,630
but between the back wall of the residential area

522
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,840
and the street, there's a grove of trees.

523
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,910
To the north is an industrial zone currently under redevelopment,

524
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,040
where construction hasn't started yet.

525
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,360
At night, it's pitch-black over there.

526
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,040
So,

527
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,120
that area always gives off an eerie vibe,

528
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,400
especially after dark.

529
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,350
On that street,

530
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,720
there's an abandoned power distribution room.

531
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,320
Last year, someone died

532
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,830
in that room

533
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,030
under gruesome circumstances.

534
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,680
Since then, the locals

535
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,920
find the place haunting.

536
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:34,300
They stay as far away as possible when passing by.

537
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:35,710
After the incident,

538
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,030
the power distribution room was decommissioned.

539
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,950
They said it would be repaired

540
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,150
once construction on the factory began.

541
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:44,960
So

542
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,150
it's pretty close to here.

543
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,600
Leader Yun,

544
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,270
are you suggesting

545
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,920
that Zong Fang is hiding there?

546
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,070
Leader Yun.

547
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,860
There's the power distribution room ahead.

548
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,360
That window has blinds.

549
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,430
Through the gaps,

550
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,730
he can easily see what we're doing.

551
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:27,890
If we approach directly,

552
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,080
we'll be exposed.

553
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,430
To the side, there's a small grove.

554
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,910
It's harder to be spotted there,

555
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,190
but the area is cluttered with debris.

556
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,660
If we accidentally make a noise,

557
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:35,640
we'll still be exposed.

558
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:36,510
Captain Tang,

559
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:37,810
take your men

560
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,920
and circle around to the back.

561
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,660
Got it.

562
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,790
Follow me.

563
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,150
Let's go.

564
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,410
Be careful.

565
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,520
Let Director Gong go.

566
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,350
Give me a car

567
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:48,970
to leave in.

568
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:49,510
Fine.

569
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,400
The car is right over there.

570
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,410
But you can't harm Director Gong.

571
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,960
We've already found all the explosives.

572
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,250
Even if you escape now,

573
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,450
you won't complete the mission Kunwu gave you.

574
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,980
I believe in an old saying,

575
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,480
"As long as the green hills remain,

576
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,800
there's no fear of running out of firewood."

577
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,430
-Director.
-Director.

578
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,270
-Director.
-Don't move!

579
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:14,710
Don't move!

580
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,510
Don't touch me!

581
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,110
The fake backstory you fabricated

582
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,370
ruined Ling Han completely.

583
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,900
Where's the cipher key?

584
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,280
You'll never find it.

585
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,740
Director, be careful.

586
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:47,810
Director, he's dead.

587
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:51,670
Then…

588
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:53,550
What about the cipher key?

589
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:54,490
He wouldn't say.

590
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,110
We need him alive! Alive!

591
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,020
What did I tell you?

592
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:59,470
Director,

593
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,700
I was aiming for his shoulder,

594
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,430
but he suddenly lunged forward.

595
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,580
I accidentally hit his chest.

596
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,420
It wasn't on purpose.

597
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,840
Thanks for earlier.

598
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,560
We're all on the same side.

599
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,219
No need to be polite.

600
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:17,150
Previously, I never noticed your marksmanship was so good.

601
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:22,989
Director,

602
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:24,560
it was just dumb luck.

603
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,110
It was dark,

604
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,030
and I fired randomly.

605
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:27,909
You two,

606
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:29,360
carry the body away.

607
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,150
Director,

608
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:30,810
your gun.

609
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,469
Chief.

610
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,179
We've located Zong Fang and all the explosives.

611
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,000
However, during the arrest,

612
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,860
Zong Fang was shot and killed.

613
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,480
And the cipher key?

614
00:34:59,150 --> 00:34:59,910
Director,

615
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:00,750
we've checked everything.

616
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,590
It's nearly identical to the scenario you reconstructed,

617
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,360
just a few minor omissions.

618
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:06,910
It's fine.

619
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,230
We'll have them take this map

620
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,480
and dismantle the explosives in those spots later.

621
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,270
You're impressive.

622
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,920
You guessed Ling Han's plan almost perfectly.

623
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,120
If someone didn't know better,

624
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,310
they'd think this despicable idea was yours.

625
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,660
I just got lucky.

626
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:22,870
You'd have figured it out too, Director.

627
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,260
I only put in more effort

628
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,300
because I have unresolved feelings about Ling Han.

629
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,550
Let's head back.

630
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,110
No rush.

631
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:31,940
Shouldn't we visit the hospital first?

632
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,780
A short delay won't matter.

633
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,540
Let's report back to the Chief first.

634
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,150
Even though we've found Zong Fang,

635
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,500
the cipher key's location

636
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,610
remains a mystery.

637
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,120
Who knows how to explain this to the Chief?

638
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,320
This isn't your fault.

639
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,660
It's mine for dragging you into this.

640
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:48,900
Don't worry.

641
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,290
I'll handle the explanations when we get back.

642
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,400
Captain Tang,

643
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:54,830
thanks for your help.

644
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:55,380
It's nothing.

645
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,760
Take care, Director.

646
00:35:59,170 --> 00:35:59,740
Let's move.

647
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,230
[Bureau of Investigation and Statistics]

648
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,340
At the time, we were so concerned about the cipher key's whereabouts

649
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,640
that we didn't dare aim for his vital areas.

650
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,620
Zong Fang took advantage of that,

651
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,010
charging at us like he didn't care for his life.

652
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,660
That's why this incident happened.

653
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:14,700
Chief,

654
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,180
this was entirely my failure.

655
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,870
I'm willing to accept full responsibility.

656
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:19,840
Chief...

657
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,120
No matter what,

658
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,070
this mission was

659
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,100
a life-threatening operation.

660
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,670
If anything had truly

661
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,950
gone wrong,

662
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,430
neither of you would've made it back.

663
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,800
Compared to your loyalty to the KMT,

664
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,740
this failure means little.

665
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:43,920
Thank you, Chief.

666
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,500
Have a seat.

667
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,910
That said,

668
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:53,270
we must prioritize the search for the cipher key.

669
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,190
Yun Hongshen, what are your thoughts?

670
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,640
Nothing definitive yet,

671
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,580
but I believe in human effort.

672
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,030
We've endured the hardest part.

673
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,440
There's no reason to falter just before reaching the summit.

674
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:08,960
Chief,

675
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:10,700
what if Zong Fang

676
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,860
destroyed the cipher key?

677
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,210
Think about it.

678
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,580
After leaving Mi Lan's place,

679
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,590
he was focused on triggering the chain explosion.

680
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,100
He must've been desperate.

681
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,030
In a fit of rage,

682
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:24,040
he might've destroyed the cipher key to ensure

683
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:24,950
that if he couldn't have it,

684
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,350
no one else could.

685
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,440
That's how they usually think, isn't it?

686
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,350
Unlikely.

687
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:33,110
From his attempt to take Director Gong hostage to save his life,

688
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,570
it's clear he kept the cipher key as leverage.

689
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,080
As for the cipher key itself,

690
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:39,550
though it's hard to find,

691
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,750
we're not entirely without clues.

692
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,970
I believe anything that has happened

693
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,880
leaves behind traces.

694
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,110
If we carefully review

695
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:50,090
the entire sequence of events,

696
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:53,310
we can piece together many answers.

697
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:57,650
Alright,

698
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,700
let's call it a day.

699
00:37:59,120 --> 00:37:59,760
Dismissed.

700
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,350
Even the biggest problems

701
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,030
can wait until tomorrow.

702
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,040
Yun Hongshen, hold on a second.

703
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,270
Are you heading to the hospital later?

704
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:15,830
I'll go with you.

705
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,520
Yeming

706
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,640
is a tough kid.

707
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,530
She's had a hard time all these years.

708
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,880
If she's found someone to rely on for life,

709
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,100
I can finally feel at ease.

710
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,070
But to be honest,

711
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,690
I really didn't want her to end up with someone in the same field.

712
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:34,450
Still, what's the use of saying so much?

713
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,930
Ultimately, it's her choice.

714
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:39,220
If she likes you, there's nothing I can do.

715
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,390
But let me tell you,

716
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,750
this girl is stubborn.

717
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:45,720
Don't let her down.

718
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,630
Why aren't you saying anything? Cat got your tongue?

719
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,710
I'm just a bit surprised.

720
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,060
Let's go, what are you waiting for?

721
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,360
I still have some documents to handle.

722
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,360
You go on ahead.

723
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,590
You know,

724
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,590
you two are quite similar.

725
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,950
Once you start working,

726
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:05,980
you forget everything else.

727
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,510
But remember,

728
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,590
it's not me she wants to see. It's you.

729
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,150
Hurry up.

730
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,600
Ke Jingping's series of reactions and actions

731
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,560
once again plunged Yun Hongshen into inner conflict.

732
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,510
He seemed to be handling the situation

733
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,550
with ease,

734
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,460
entirely unlike Kunwu, who was desperate to find the cipher key

735
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,990
even at the cost of orchestrating a chain explosion.

736
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,750
But Zong Fang's reaction before his death

737
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:43,020
regarding Ling Han's fabricated background

738
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,710
indirectly confirmed that

739
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:48,070
the information provided by the Organization was accurate.

740
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,170
"The fake backstory you fabricated

741
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,600
ruined Ling Han completely."

742
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,510
"Where's the cipher key?"

743
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:55,780
"You'll

744
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:59,120
never find it."

745
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,600
It seems the only way to prove

746
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,690
Ke Jingping is indeed Kunwu

747
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,640
is to locate the hidden chamber on the map.

748
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,450
So, it really is him!

749
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,280
This man is a devil,

750
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,550
treating everyone like pawns,
