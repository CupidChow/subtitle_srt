Sir,

00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:44,630
we've captured one alive.

00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,670
All other targets have been eliminated.

00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,670
One of our men was lightly injured,

three were seriously injured,

00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,190
and two were killed.

00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:48,630

13
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,680
Why are you here instead of catching him?

14
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,820
I'm worried about you.

I have something to tell you.

22
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,910
The Chief was right.

23
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,030
He did come here.

Looks like

34
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,090
he didn't get the codebook.

35
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,420
So should we keep following him?

36
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,329
No.

37
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,350
If the NBIS has hidden agents nearby,

38
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,660
continuing to stalk him could lead us into a trap.

39
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,550

Not seeing anyone at a time like this,

47
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,340

You've already guessed it?

As far as I know,

59
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,690
the CBIS isn't exactly known for self-sacrifice.

60
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:05,930
So,

00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,750
while Zhang Xiancheng saved you,

00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,350

Since there's no solid evidence,

72
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,460
we have to hold firm

73
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,830

instead of saying I was following a belief—

77
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,590
it's more accurate to say...

78
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,310
I was following the Chief.

79
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,590
I trusted him.

80
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,510
So I believed that the organization he served

00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,190
whether I

85
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,410

In the world, humans...

00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,050
are the most complex creatures.

To see through a person completely...

100
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,070
is there something else on your mind?

00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,910
Mr. Shi specifically instructed me before he left

102
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,270
that we had to handle Ling Han discreetly

103
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,480
without making a big fuss.

104
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,550
At this critical moment, both the people

105
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,800

106
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:23,950
It could impact the overall situation.

Don't worry.

108
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,380
I'll ensure everyone at the station keeps absolutely quiet about this

109
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,100
and let them understand the seriousness of the matter.

110
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,600
Ling Han being a Japanese spy

111
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,170
will make the Director lose face.

112
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,610
What's even scarier is

113
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,030
that if someone tries to make a big deal out of this,

114
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,270
it would be a fatal blow

115
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,940
to the entire NBIS.

116
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,360
No one would dare to joke about something like this.

00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,730

What do you think

120
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,560
we should officially say about this matter to the outside world?

121
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,990
Maybe...

122
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,230
we have to put some blame on Li Liang.

123
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,710
How about this?

124
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:06,470
We say that Zong Fang and that fake Mi Lan had turned Li Liang to their side.

125
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,060
Through him...

126
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,690
they obtained a lot of internal information.

127
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,550
They are exceptionally clever,

128
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,860
which is why such a huge upheaval happened.

129
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,450
As for Ling Han,

130
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,650
we could say

131
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,790
that he was killed by Japanese spies

132
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,050
during the investigation.

133
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,360
Do you think that works?

134
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,670
I think Li Liang isn't the one being wronged here.

135
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:28,970
The most wronged person is you.

136
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,669
Look, Li Liang was someone you personally promoted.

137
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:34,970
He was turned,

138
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,770
and you'll inevitably be blamed for the oversight.

139
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:41,090
But I'm bound to be held accountable for this matter from the start.

140
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,650
Because, as the Deputy Chief,

141
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:44,820
I didn't find anything wrong with Ling Han.

142
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,700
I should bear the primary responsibility.

143
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,670
Alright then, we'll do this as you suggested.

144
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,270
We must end this matter with Li Liang.

145
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,440
We can't say a word more about Ling Han.

146
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,680
I'll report to the Director truthfully

147
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,400
about the sacrifice you made this time.

148
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,350
He is a perceptive man.

149
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,830
He'll repay this favor.

150
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,630
This is just part of my duty.

151
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,430
I have no complaints.

152
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,080
Okay.

153
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,750
Notify everyone.

155
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,630
Okay.

156
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,230
After Xu Weihua called,

157
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,110
reporting the situation to the station,

158
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,450
the Chief immediately deduced Ling Han's plan.

159
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,470
His plan had two parts:

160
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,430
first,

161
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,310
he would create the illusion of escaping,

162
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,570
luring the Chief into dispatching most of our personnel to catch him.

163
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,060
If we fell for it,

164
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,880
Lushan Temple would be safe,

165
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,070
enabling him to secure the codebook.

166
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,350
The Chief, however, played along.

167
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,180
Ling Han believed we had taken the bait,

168
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:45,870
but in fact,

169
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,390
my team operated simultaneously

170
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,390
with the operation at the construction site.

171
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,170
But Ling Han is too cunning.

172
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,320
How did it go?

173
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,510
Have you gotten the codebook?

174
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,650
The codebook has been moved.

175
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,930
Ling Han rarely fails.

176
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,510
What went wrong this time?

177
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,990
It's too early to call it a failure.

178
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,430
I believe he'll get the codebook.

179
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,910
Seems like you trust him even more than I do.

180
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,290
I only trust capable people.

181
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,200
Alright then,

182
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,660
we don't need to do anything.

183
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,290
We can just wait for his good news.

184
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,470
No matter how capable, he's not a god.

185
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,690
In this situation, he'll need our help.

186
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,270
How?

187
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,590

00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,390
and see how they react,

191
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,470
so we can deduce

192
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,280
Yun Hongshen's next move.

193
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,010
Understood.

194
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,310
Chief,

195
00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,630
I have a question.

196
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,880
Go ahead.

197
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,400
How did you figure out

198
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,850
where I hid the codebook?

199
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,670
If Ling Han knows you well enough,

200
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,830
he could figure it out too.

201
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,990
When you went to get your car,

202
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,510
the codebook was on you, wasn't it?

203
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,830
In order to confuse Ling Han,

204
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,750
you played a trick, right?

205
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:17,110
Yes.

206
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,510
I timed it precisely,

207
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,950
took a detour around the area,

208
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,220
and then went to get the car.

209
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,950
The purpose was to mislead Ling Han

210
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,190
into ruling out the church.

211
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,750
I based my judgment

212
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,310
on your arrival time at home.

213
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,750
From the moment you got the car until the moment you returned home,

214
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,670
there was about a two-hour gap.

215
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,910
While I didn't see everything,

216
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,400
I was sure you went somewhere in between.

217
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,220
By using this critical information

218
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,470
as a reference,

219
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,660
I could calculate your activity radius

220
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,070
and narrow down the places

221
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,390
where you might hide something.

222
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,610
That's how I figured it out.

223
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,270
Got it.

224
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,030
Although we don't know

225
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,350
Ling Han's next move,

226
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,310
we can't let our guard down.

227
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,100
Remember,

228
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,030
your enemy always knows you better than you know yourself.

229
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,830
Got it?

230
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:02,570
Yes, sir.

231
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,390
Looks like Ke Jingping knew long ago that the codebook

232
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,740
was in Yang Ziming's hands.

233
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,270
In here...

234
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,190
He deliberately feigned ignorance

235
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,080
and waited for me to transfer it.

236
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,230
They're the keys to the safe that contains the codebook.

237
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,390
There are two keys in total.

238
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:15,790
Yun Hongshen.

239
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,340
Wen Yeming.

240
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,670
As for the location of the safe,

241
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,990
only I know it.

242
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,100
If Ling Han wants to get the codebook,

243
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,830
he has to break through all three of us at the same time.

244
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,350
Got it?

245
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,110
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

246
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,350
Everyone,

247
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,710
I'll say it again.

248
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,770
I don't need to say more about how dangerous Ling Han is.

249
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:37,740
And he knows

250
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,620
how each of us operates.

251
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,690
Before we catch him,

252
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,150
I want you to stay on high alert.

253
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,910
Yes, sir!

254
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,590
He personally carried a small safe out.

255
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,600
This kind of safe requires two keys to unlock.

256
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,090
He must have

257
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,960
Yun Hongshen and Wen Yeming to keep them.

258
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,210
Why did you leave the hospital instead of staying put?

259
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,920
Before Ling Han shot me,

260
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,660
he said something very strange.

261
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,190
He mentioned a big shot

262
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,520
that none of us can afford to offend.

263
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,990
A big shot that we can't afford to offend.

264
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:46,250
Could it be the Chief?

265
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,230
Let's do this.

266
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,640
Don't say it over the phone.

267
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,870
Meet me

268
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,110
where I took you for your first mission.

269
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,310
Okay? See you there.

270
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,150
I'll be there in about 20 minutes.

271
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,150
Director Ling,

272
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,590
I've done everything you asked.

273
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:13,630
Please.

274
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,390
Let my mother go.

275
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,750
When I see Deputy Chief Zhu later,

276
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,720
your mother will be fine.

277
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,490
Director,

278
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,760
it's a call from your office.

279
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,710
Forward it to me.

280
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,310
Director Xu.

281
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,310
Ling Han?

282
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,430
Does the Chief know that you've secretly planted a bug

283
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,830
in Yun Hongshen's office?

284
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,660
What exactly are you trying to do?

285
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,630
You're always poking your nose into things that don't concern you.

286
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,990
That's very dangerous.

287
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,150
You'd better think ahead

288
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,820
about how to explain yourself

289
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,510
when the Chief and Yun Hongshen find out about it.

290
00:14:58,950 --> 00:14:59,990
Being true to yourself

291
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,270
doesn't compromise your morality,

292
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,030
but it does harm

293
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,140
some people's interests.

294
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,350
What will Ling Han do next?

295
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,950
He must be able to guess that the whereabouts of the codebook

296
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,070
are still related to me.

297
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,470
So, he'll try to get me again.

298
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,150
Director Xu,

299
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,050
do you need something from me?

300
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,990
Ling Han knew about this.

301
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,260
He called just now.

302
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,680
You didn't mention anything sensitive in the office, right?

303
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,340
What did he say on the phone?

304
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,520
He bluffed a bit.

305
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,430
In the end,

306
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,620
he said something.

307
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,530
Now that I think about it, it's odd.

308
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:48,950
What is it?

309
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,060
"Being true to yourself

310
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,840
doesn't compromise your morality,

311
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,230
but it does harm some people's interests."

312
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,500
Being true to yourself

313
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,740
doesn't compromise your morality,

314
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,390
but it does harm

315
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,510
some people's interests.

316
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,190
I'm sorry.

317
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:10,870
I hope

318
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,070
you can also find your ideal partner.

319
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,670
May your descendants flourish

320
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,790
and enjoy a life of peace shaded by verdant boughs.

321
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,550
Is there something wrong with that?

322
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,390
Director Xu,

323
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,990
you'd better stop asking.

324
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,070
I have something urgent to attend to.

325
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:28,720
Excuse me.

326
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:29,990
Make yourself comfortable.

327
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,570
You even watched a movie with Mi Lan?

328
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,700
This is not the time to talk about this.

329
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,270
Ling Han's real purpose

330
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,150
is for Director Xu to relay those words to me.

331
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,860
The last bit.

332
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,310
Enjoy a life of peace shaded by verdant boughs?

333
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,000
Boughs Road.

334
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,670
They want to take those children.

335
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,860
This is just a trap.

336
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,360
Ling Han's real targets are us.

337
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,550
Can't you see that?

338
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:00,570
Don't stop me.

339
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,210
The children are in danger; I can't just stand by.

340
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,110
It's not that.

341
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:05,730
We need to think carefully about

342
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,579
what to do next.

343
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,120
[Changsha Theatre]

344
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,070
Deputy Chief Zhu.

345
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,150
If I don't leave within 15 minutes,

346
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,310
someone will come looking for me.

347
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,390
I know.

348
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,950
So we won't stay here for long.

349
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,120
We?

350
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,150
Four hundred and eighty temples have been reduced to ashes;

351
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,590
Mountains and rivers form fateful bonds;

352
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,580
The attire of the Eastern Jin remains;

353
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,820
Hidden traces of immortals worthy of legends.

354
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,890
Thirty-six thousand plays, all mere dramas;

355
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,570
The years abound with splendid days;

356
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,270
A fine stage for characters across dynasties;

357
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,590
Loyal and treacherous, wise and foolish, clear distinctions drawn.

358
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:48,940
What a beautifully written piece.

359
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,320
Four hundred and eighty temples have been reduced to ashes.

360
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,080
Thirty-six thousand plays, all mere dramas.

361
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,920
It's absolutely right.

362
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,150
Every day, we fight and kill,

363
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,270
capturing one person after another,

364
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,710
as if the entire world were our enemy.

365
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,710
But in the end,

366
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,250
don't we all just turn to ashes?

367
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,190
Likewise,

368
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,520
no matter how evil someone is,

369
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,750
they'll eventually meet the same fate—reduced to ashes.

370
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,550
So, who do you think will meet their end today?

371
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:16,950
You?

372
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,870
Or me?

373
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,140
What did you feel

374
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,460
when you personally shot Li Liang to death?

375
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,550
About the same as I feel now.

376
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,310
Even a dozen bullets wouldn't quench my anger.

377
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,740
I understand.

378
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,750
A mere dozen bullets

379
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,030
wouldn't suffice.

380
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,400
So, you're Japanese,

381
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:41,490
right?

382
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,840
I'm not Japanese.

383
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,110
I know why you

384
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,270
had to trick me here.

385
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,280
Because I found out your secret.

386
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,390
You've always been arrogant.

387
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,110
You think

388
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,400
that you can turn the current unfavorable situation around.

389
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,670
And your current plan

390
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,910
must be to pin all the blame on me

391
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:01,950
and then kill me.

392
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,150
That way, on one hand, there'll be no witnesses.

393
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,070
On the other hand,

394
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,750
no one will ever know your secret.

395
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,510
Am I right?

396
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,670
Stop dreaming.

397
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,330
Even if I die,

398
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,950
I'll make sure it gets to someone

399
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,920
who can expose this secret.

400
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,160
Guess who that is?

401
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:20,670
That's right.

402
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,020
It's Yun Hongshen.

403
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,030
Yes, I understand.

404
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,870
Please make the Director rest assured.

405
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,670
I'll handle this matter properly.

406
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:40,870
Okay.

407
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,100
Goodbye.

408
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,510
What's wrong?

409
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,830
The Deputy Chief has been kidnapped.

410
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:53,510
Where is Yun Hongshen?

411
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,290
I'm asking you, where is he?

412
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:56,880
I don't know.

413
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,230
How many times have I said this during meetings?

414
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,330
Be more vigilant,

415
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,500
and don't let Ling Han take advantage of you.

416
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,030
But what did you do?

417
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,170
You turned around and became his errand boy.

418
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,390
Are you an idiot?

419
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,390
Does Ling Han have clairvoyance?

420
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,870
How could he possibly know that you planted a bug

421
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,910
in Yun Hongshen's office behind my back?

422
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,440
He was just tricking you.

423
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,030
Who told you to admit it?

424
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:41,880
Fine.

425
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,470
Let's say, for argument's sake,

426
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,390
even if you admitted it,

427
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,350
who told you to come to Yun Hongshen?

428
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,310
Why didn't you come to me?

429
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:52,910
Do you have any idea

430
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,430
what consequences your actions have caused?

431
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,670
Let me tell you.

432
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,190
Yun Hongshen and Wen Yeming

433
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,560
have both been tricked and lured away.

434
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,830
The keys to the safe are with them.

435
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,150
If Ling Han gets hold of the two of them,

436
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,390
we won't be able to decipher Myna's codes.

437
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,160
When that happens,

438
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,870
our soldiers on the battlefield

439
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,090
will be fighting blind!

440
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,190
Wen Yeming,

441
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,840
Deputy Chief Zhu,

442
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,030
and Yun Hongshen.

443
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,750
If we lose these elite members to the enemy

444
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,910
and fail to secure the codebook,

445
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,410
our Hunan Station will become the biggest joke

446
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,520
in the history of the NBIS.

447
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,750
We can all wait to go to the military court together.

448
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,400
Why don't we... just move the safe?

449
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,750
Are you trying to help Ling Han

450
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,050
figure out where the safe is?

451
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,170
Get lost!

452
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,430
Once Ling Han's plan is set in motion,

453
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,150
there's no perfect way to save all of them.

454
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:22,310
Deputy Chief Zhu, Yun Hongshen, and Wen Yeming.

455
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,200
I hope they can find a way

456
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,580
to escape his schemes

457
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,010
or, at least delay long enough for us to locate them.

458
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,230
If not,

459
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,370
I'll have no choice but to sacrifice a few

460
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,410
for the greater good.

461
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:39,200
The codebook absolutely cannot fall into Ling Han's hands.

462
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,300
Director Gong?

463
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,520
You're quite close with Xu Weihua, aren't you?

464
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:46,470
We get along.

465
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,780
What can I do for you?

466
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,000
Did he ever mention

467
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,590
when he first came to the station,

468
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,470
where the Deputy Chief took him on his first assignment?

469
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,110
On his first day here,

470
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,070
the Deputy Chief took him to the Changsha Theatre

471
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,030
to capture a traitor.

472
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,960
Kidnapping Yanzi and the others isn't the hard part.

473
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,190
The hard part is how to smuggle them out.

474
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,030
We've set up road checks at all critical intersections.

475
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,450
Unless they make a bold move,

476
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,910
it's impossible

477
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,190
to smuggle out that many hostages.

478
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:16,730
They will definitely

479
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,420
transport the children in plain sight.

480
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,660
Come one, give the kid to me.

481
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:36,970
Hurry.

482
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:38,780
Hurry up.

483
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:42,910
Hurry, come on.

484
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,340
Show me your ID.

485
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:07,820
Wait a moment.

486
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,230
Captain Tang,

487
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,150
it's very likely that Ling Han

488
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,490
has kidnapped the children from the shelter.

489
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,670
So from now on, our targets for investigation

490
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,670
will be ambulances, large trucks, and van trucks.

491
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,110
Besides, our leader also ordered

492
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,550
that once you find the target,

493
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,510
fire a warning shot

494
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,030
and wait for backup before taking further action.

495
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,040
Okay, got it.

496
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,060
-Huang, bring the team over.
-Yes, sir.

497
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,080
Everyone, come with me.

498
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:42,850
Stop the car!

499
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:43,380
Move!

500
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,460
Hurry up.

501
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,080
Here.

502
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,440
They've been under intense surveillance.

503
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,590
They have very few people left to use.

504
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:34,870
Let's split up.

505
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,070
We'll definitely catch them.

506
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,460
The bad news is,

507
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,630
they have hostages.

508
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:39,860
And we're not sure

509
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,080
what they've done to the children.

510
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,350
We're in a very passive position,

511
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,710
and the odds are against us.

512
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:44,910
Also,

513
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,030
the two of us can't

514
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,110
both fall into Ling Han's hands.

515
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,670
If things really go south,

516
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,590
don't care about me.

517
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,910
You must ensure the safety of the children

518
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,030
and yourself.

519
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,270
Stop the car.

520
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:16,830
Don't shoot.

521
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,430
He has a bomb.

522
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,460
The vibration from a shot

523
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,860
may cause an explosion.

524
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,310
Officer.

525
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,320
Officer, my wife is going to give birth.

526
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,870
Please let us through.

527
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,000
Go, go, go.

528
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:42,820
Let's go.

529
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,110
Let's go!

530
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,190
Go to the source of the gunfire.

531
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:45,700
Let's go.

532
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:18,000
Let them go.

533
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,830
I'll go with you.

534
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,150
It's too dangerous to take you with us.

535
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,330
Exchanging hostages

536
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,360
can at least buy you

537
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,520
some time to escape.

538
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,670
If you're smart enough,

539
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,550
you may even make it out alive.

540
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,440
Quiet!

541
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:32,750
Second Young Master,

542
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,750
someone as clever as you should have known by now

543
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,710
that I never intended to make it out alive.

544
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,660
If these kids

545
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,510
can't get me what I want,

546
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,830
I'll be the first to pull the trigger.

547
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,470
Actually, you won't suffer any losses.

548
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:45,110
If we all die,

549
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,080
that person will lose a few more helpers.

550
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,230
If I were you,

551
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,270
I would've already pulled the trigger.

552
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,070
No matter how this ends,

553
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,230
I will make you pay for it.

554
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,290
I know you don't care about your own life.

555
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:00,940
But what about Kunwu?

556
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,270
He's still looking forward to

557
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,860
reuniting with his wife and child in Japan.

558
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,050
You're desperately hounding

559
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,910
Myna's intelligence like rabid dogs,

560
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,850
all because it's extremely important.

561
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,430
Don't worry.

562
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,190
I will never let it

563
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,470
fall into your hands.

564
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,830
Your army

565
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,270
will lose on this battlefield,

566
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,460
and that loss is just the beginning.

567
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,420
As long as I'm alive,

568
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:24,960
I'll go to any lengths

569
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,030
to cause trouble for your country.

570
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,270
That will be in the future.

571
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,190
I don't want to get involved, nor can I.

572
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,830
What I need to do now

573
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,450
is threaten you with these kids.

574
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:36,070
Either you give me what I want,

575
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,690
or

576
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,620
I'll take these children to their graves alongside me.

577
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,880
Someone said the same thing to me before

578
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,630
to threaten me.

579
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,010
But they all ended up dead.

580
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,230
Really?

581
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,870
Aren't you curious about

582
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,150
what your beloved is doing right now?

583
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,250
Isn't signaling with gunshots your code?

584
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,400
I bet she's already found our people.

585
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:58,750
But...

586
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,370
why hasn't she given the signal yet?

587
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:11,940
Evacuate the crowd

588
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,960
and block this intersection.

589
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,510
Go to a safe place and fire a warning shot.

590
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,500
Where is the codebook?

591
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:22,570
I don't know.

592
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:28,190
Looks like you don't care whether they live or die.

593
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,320
I don't have time to waste with you.

594
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:34,910
I'll count to three.

595
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,870
If you don't tell me,

596
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:38,500
it...

597
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,710
will explode.

598
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,660
One.

599
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,430
Two.

600
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:39,750
Don't cry.

601
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:40,550
Quiet.

602
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:42,720
Sir.

603
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,390
Hurry back and inform the Chief.

604
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:46,510
Go now!

605
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,300
Yes, sir.

606
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,010
Let's go.

607
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,140
The key to the safe is on me.

608
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,760
Second Young Master,

609
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,350
you didn't disappoint me after all.

610
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,830
Let these children go.

611
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,990
This doesn't follow the rules, does it?

612
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,450
I haven't gained anything,

613
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,950
yet you're asking me to let go of my leverage.

614
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,100
Is it appropriate?

615
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:04,760
Don't forget,

616
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,190
my men have this place surrounded.

617
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,550
The more people you bring, the more of a burden they may become.

618
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,710
You're inadvertently

619
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,060
creating more obstacles for yourself.

620
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,420
You've already achieved your goal

621
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:16,310
of using these children to threaten me.

622
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,630
So you might as well release most of them,

623
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:19,820
leaving only one.

624
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,540
I won't give you the key.

625
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,990
I want to personally hand it over to Ling Han.

626
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,180
This is not up for discussion.

627
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,930
If you don't agree to my terms,

628
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,910
I'll give up on rescuing them.

629
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,400
Let the children go.

630
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,500
Captain Tang,

631
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,390
in five minutes,

632
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,860
send someone along the road to search.

633
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,230
I'll drop off Yanzi

634
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,270
at a suitable spot.

635
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,210
Remember,

636
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,680
ensure the children's safety

637
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,390
until the operation is over.

638
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:51,670
I'm counting on you.

639
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:10,600
[Changsha Theatre]

640
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,230
You two go to the back door.

641
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,030
You two, come with me!

642
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:10,670
Yes, sir.

643
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,230
The car is here, but where are they?

644
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:21,890
How did they take the Deputy Chief away?

645
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,270
Leader Wen said

646
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,590
that he has a way to protect himself.

647
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,870
Besides, since he's with Ling Han now,

648
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,680
it'll allow us to track his movements at any time.

649
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,710
Once we take action,

650
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:49,950
he can work together with us from the inside.

651
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,270
In that case,

652
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,110
the odds are higher.

653
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,260
Come in.

654
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,350
Chief,

655
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,890
we haven't found any trace of Ling Han and Deputy Chief.

656
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:04,390
It's like they've disappeared into thin air.

657
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,230
A bunch of losers.

658
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:10,940
Hello?

659
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,550
Go back to the station right now.

660
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,590
No contact with anyone unless I give permission.

661
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,489
Notify everyone.

662
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,330
Meeting in the conference room in five minutes.

663
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:24,360
Yes.

664
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:44,550
I hope each of you

665
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,550
can execute your assigned tasks perfectly.

666
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,110
No mistakes are allowed.

667
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,150
If you find any problems,

668
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,620
report them to me immediately.

669
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:56,949
Everyone,

670
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,190
our current situation

671
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,640
is like a line of dominoes.

672
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,240
If one were to fall,

673
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,320
the consequences would be unimaginable.

674
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,950
I have only one requirement:

675
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,110
safeguarding the codebook.

676
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,990
If possible,

677
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:11,390
also try to keep all three of them alive.

678
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:12,200
Yes, sir.

679
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,070
All the elites of the Hunan Station are here.

680
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,760
If I killed all of you here,

681
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,350
would that mean I've destroyed the Hunan Station in one fell swoop?

682
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,150
Does this count as Ke Jingping

683
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,240
handing them over to me personally?

684
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,830
The codebook is in the safe.

685
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,530
Yun Hongshen has one key.

686
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,480
Wen Yeming has one too.

687
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,360
One is fake?

688
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,430
Both are real.

689
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:49,190
This kind of safe... requires two keys to unlock.

690
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:00,590
Tell us,

691
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,230
where is the safe?

692
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,630
Would I tell you?

693
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,190
If you shoot,

694
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,710
the Chief will never let you off.

695
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,220
If we don't shoot,

696
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,270
do you think we'll be spared?

697
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,030
And also, who's letting who off

698
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:25,770
is still up in the air.

699
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,630
The fewer mistakes you make,

700
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,030
the more room for maneuver you'll have.

701
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,230
Sometimes, a slip of thought

702
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:32,910
can lead to an entirely different outcome.

703
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,860
Yun Hongshen, stop wasting your breath on him.

704
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:43,510
Just remember

705
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,420
your duty as an agent.

706
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,470
I haven't forgotten.

707
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:48,990
As an agent,

708
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,610
I'm always ready to make the ultimate sacrifice,

709
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,550
giving out my life...

710
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,080
for my country.

711
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,190
But...

712
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,910
only by staying alive are there more possibilities.

713
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:09,080
If they keep refusing to talk,

714
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,470
they're just dead weight.

715
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,180
We don't have that much time.

716
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,750
We must find the codebook as soon as possible.

717
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,180
The three of them really don't know

718
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,190
where the safe is.

719
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:18,910
Only Ke Jingping knows

720
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,870
the location of the safe.

721
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,150
How long will it take for you to find it?

722
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,540
Give me a reason to spare your life.

723
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,280
I've got the key.

724
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,430
If you don't know where the safe is,

725
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,370
there's no reason for you to keep living.

726
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:49,210
Can you really figure out the exact location just by thinking about it?

727
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,220
No matter how hard it may be to guess,

728
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,840
I can find it.

729
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,270
Of course, I don't doubt that you have it in you.

730
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,870
But aren't you curious about

731
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,630
what I let Liu Chao go first

732
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,360
to do?

733
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,270
Given Liu Chao and his team's capabilities,

734
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:18,290
they can't watch us for long.

735
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:20,790
They won't provide any valuable leads.

736
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,270
You're trying to provoke me,

737
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,550
to get me to rush out and search for the safe.

738
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,270
Ke Jingping must have already sent people out.

739
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,230
If I go now,

740
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,670
I'll fall right into the trap he's set.

741
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,220
It's been a while

742
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,380
since they were caught here,

743
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,560
and the safe must have already been moved by Ke Jingping.

744
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:39,730
Stop wasting breath on them;

745
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:40,980
just do it.

746
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,130
Yeah.

747
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,470
So, where could the safe be?

748
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,030
If they haven't moved it,

749
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,910
then they'll just wait for you to walk into a trap.

750
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,600
Then, would you

751
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,080
risk being captured to steal the codebook?

752
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,710
Yeah.

753
00:38:59,150 --> 00:38:59,890
I forgot.

754
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,750
When Ke Jingping was younger,

755
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,030
he was also an adventurer.

756
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,770
He's gambling.

757
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,350
He's betting that I'll go for the codebook.

758
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,170
That's right.

759
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:11,130
Both of us have very little time left.

760
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,420
So, we can only be smart gamblers.

761
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,100
If we lose,

762
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,950
we'll lose the whole game and be doomed forever.

763
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,560
The Chief is betting that you'll come to seize the codebook,

764
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,670
while you're betting

765
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,580
that you'll find a way to get it,

766
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,200
right?

767
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,990
So you know where the safe is?

768
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,820
I've pretty much figured it out.

769
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,260
Yun Hongshen,

770
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:34,870
Wen Yeming.

771
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,670
Kunwu has been hiding in Changsha for a long time.

772
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:51,170
It's time...

773
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,420
for him to make an appearance.

774
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:14,810
Chief.

775
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:16,350
Make it short.

776
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:17,750
Chief.

777
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,520
I've found out the true identity of Ling Han.

778
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,160
[Surgery Consent Form]

779
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,920
[Birth Certificate]

780
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,190
Fujiwara Taro.

781
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:33,990
The Fujiwara Taro, who was the former Deputy Chief of Staff

782
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:34,870
for the Japanese Army's North China Area Army?

783
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:35,430
Yes.

784
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,280
He was Ling Han's biological father.

785
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,760
Ling Han's mother

786
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,910
used to be a senior maid in the Tianjin Concession.

787
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:41,730
Her employer was Zhang Biao,

788
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,510
the former Governor of the Huguang region during the late Qing dynasty,

789
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,190
who resided in the Tianjin concession.

790
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,960
30 years ago, Ling Han's mother gave birth to him out of wedlock,

791
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:49,150
and no one knew

792
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,510
who the father was.

793
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,950
There was speculation that Zhang Biao might have been the father,

794
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,270
but when she gave birth and bled heavily,

795
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,340
it wasn't Zhang Biao who showed up at the hospital,

796
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,800
but Fujiwara Taro.

797
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:02,790
Even Director Dai didn't find out

798
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,910
such important information.

799
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,140
How did you find it?

800
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:06,930
All of this

801
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,480
was covered up by Fujiwara Taro.

802
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,950
The doctors and nurses who participated in the delivery

803
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:12,230
and those who came into contact with the records

804
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:12,910
all died.

805
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,800
The timeline appeared to be without suspicion,

806
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,730
making it difficult for us to raise any doubts.

807
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,350
But he never expected

808
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:20,280
that the doctor

809
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,100
had taken photos of

810
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,640
the surgery consent form and the birth certificate

811
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:25,580
on the night of the birth

812
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,190
and gave these photos

813
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,630
to a distant relative.

814
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:31,030
This distant relative of the doctor

815
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,590
had been keeping this secret for 30 years.

816
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,170
Why would he tell you?

817
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:36,220
This man's son has a strange disease.

818
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,060
Treating it requires a lot of money.

819
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,320
I offered him a price

820
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,830
he couldn't refuse.

821
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,070
He didn't mean

822
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,090
to keep the secret all this time.

823
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,190
He just hadn't found someone

824
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,500
who could both keep the secret

825
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,850
and ensure his safety.

826
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,670
Pull over in front.

827
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,900
The car behind has pulled over.

828
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,380
It seems

829
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:33,080
he has figured out the location of the safe.

830
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,480
In that case...

831
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:50,620
We'll have to trouble you both

832
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:52,180
to draw their fire.

833
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,410
Glad to help,

834
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:56,870
but you only have ten minutes.

835
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:57,750
After that,

836
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:00,490
I'll have to fulfill the promise I once made.

837
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:01,390
When that happens,

838
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:02,960
it'll come down to whose luck holds out.
