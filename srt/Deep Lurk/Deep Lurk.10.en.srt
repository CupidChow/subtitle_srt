[Episode 10]

3
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,229
My dad will be fine.

4
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,710
He's fine in Shanghai.

5
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,430
Why would anything happen to him?

6
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,509
You are bad guys.

7
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,500
You're lying to me.

8
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,370
You must be lying to me.

9
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,200
My father...

10
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:58,910
My father is definitely okay.

11
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,590
It can't be true.

12
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,570
You're lying to me.

13
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:08,190
Mi Lan.

14
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:10,120
You have to stay strong.

15
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,730
If your father knew

16
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,560
you were like this, he wouldn't

17
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,770
be at peace even in the afterlife.

18
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,190
That mole works fast.

19
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,240
We just found out Myna's real identity

20
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,990
and Yun Hongshen's whereabouts,

21
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,320
and the Japanese already sent assassins.

22
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:51,490
Sometimes it's not that the mole is too skilled;

23
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,420
it's that our confidentiality measures are lacking.

24
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,370
I'm sorry, Sir.

25
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,290
That was my oversight.

26
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,270
But judging by how eager

27
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,730
the Japanese are to eliminate Yun Hongshen,

28
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,830
it seems he's not our enemy.

29
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,680
But why are the Japanese

30
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,280
so desperate to take him out?

31
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,430
Does he have something

32
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,030
that could threaten them?

33
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,000
He said he could

34
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,410
find the person who killed Myna.

35
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,810
He has some leads.

36
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,030
No wonder.

37
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,829
When will he contact you again?

38
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:19,510
Once we lift the pursuit orders against him

39
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,970
and stop the surveillance of the Yun family.

40
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,630
Right now, we're under

41
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,430
immense pressure from all sides.

42
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,030
In the end, we'll probably have to compromise.

43
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,590
But if we surrender

44
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,450
every time someone threatens us,

45
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,390
it'll ruin the reputation

46
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,270
of the NBIS.

47
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,520
Don't worry, Sir.

48
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,370
I'll figure out a way to force Yun Hongshen to reveal himself.

I'll be all alone.

Please wake up.

I'm sorry, Chief.

70
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,690
I failed my duties.

71
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,350
It's not that you failed;

72
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,950
you were just too impatient.

73
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,830
Ever since you started suspecting those three,

74
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,470
you've been pressuring them.

75
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,750
Of course, they noticed.

76
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,190
And once they noticed, you lost the upper hand.

77
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,520
Your criticism is fair.

78
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,030
I know I've been feeling guilty

but this can't all be pinned on me—

81
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,310
I bear some responsibility too.

82
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,190
The more critical the situation,

83
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,030
the calmer we need to remain.

84
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,590
It seems this mole

85
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,850
is far more cunning than we anticipated.

86
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,710
You sent her home?

87
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,070
Well, that's just great.

88
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,470
Now we've lost our hiding place.

00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,070
We can't go back home either.

Uncle Yang, did my father

111
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,900
ever mention someone called "the Viscount" to you?

112
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,330
I know of him.

113
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,450
The night the Viscount died,

114
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,210
I found something in a locker

115
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,850
at the train station.

116
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,760
A very strange family letter?

117
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,590
How did you know?

118
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,520
Your father and I made a pact:

119
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:05,930
if anything happened

120
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,530
to either of us,

121
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,250
we would entrust everything to the other.

122
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,130
Your father had everything planned,

123
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,210
so he told me everything in advance.

124
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,770
My father was always thorough.

125
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,330
If I hadn't been so arrogant back then,

126
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,400
thinking I could handle everything myself...

127
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,210
Hongshen,

128
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,620
you're still young.

129
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,970
Your father once

130
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,080
walked the same path you're on now.

131
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,330
But Uncle Yang,

132
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,250
there's one thing

133
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,450
I can't understand.

134
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,780
Why did my father reveal

135
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,530
Myna's situation to the French?

136
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,930
Your father had been tracking Kunwu

137
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,880
for five years, yet he had no leads.

138
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:51,990
Then suddenly,

139
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,150
Kunwu reappeared.

140
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,770
Your father suspected that

141
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,600
Kunwu was orchestrating

142
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,640
a massive conspiracy.

143
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,850
But everything happened so quickly,

144
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,720
and your father had very limited information.

145
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,570
He wasn't sure what this conspiracy was.

146
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,260
So he shared what he knew

147
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,600
to the French.

148
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,370
hoping to use them

149
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,670
to probe the Japanese reaction.

150
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,770
Based on the Japanese response,

151
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,670
my father could adjust his next move.

152
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,930
If I hadn't acted impulsively,

153
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,100
my father wouldn't have died.

154
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,330
Maybe that conspiracy would have already been thwarted by now.

155
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,040
Hongshen,

156
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,720
the real culprits behind Muzhi's death

157
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,770
were Japanese and Kunwu.

158
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,120
You shouldn't blame yourself anymore.

159
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,260
Uncle Yang, I understand.

160
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,380
Regret won't change anything.

161
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,370
What I need to do now

162
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,530
is finishing my father's mission

163
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,810
and walking the path he couldn't complete.

164
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,210
Earlier, you seemed hesitant to tell me something.

165
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,310
Is there something difficult

166
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,240
that you don't know how to bring up?

167
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,000
Could it be that

168
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,650
you've already deduced that

169
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,920
Kunwu might be hiding in the NBIS?

170
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:24,800
Uncle Yang,

171
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,830
the best course of action right now

172
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,410
is for me to infiltrate the NBIS

173
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,840
and find the real culprit.

174
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,570
Uncle Yang,

175
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,800
I know you're worried about my safety.

176
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,260
but the situation is dire,

177
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,020
and I am currently the most suitable candidate.

178
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,020
That's why you hesitated, isn't it?

179
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,240
You're already caught in this web,

180
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,850
and you've obtained the codebook,

181
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,490
which means that person has been watching you closely.

182
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,290
You're right.

183
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,370
You're indeed the best fit for this mission.

184
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,320
But you've just returned to Changsha,

185
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,650
and in such a short time,

186
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,670
there have already been two assassination attempts on your life.

187
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,510
I... I just

188
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,370
can't bear to put you in more danger.

189
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,370
But no matter how dangerous,

190
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,020
someone has to do it.

191
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,010
I've made up my mind.

192
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,130
Hongshen.

193
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,570
On behalf of the hundreds of thousands of people in Changsha,

194
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,410
thank you.

195
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,330
Uncle Yang,

196
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,950
I am Chinese.

197
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:33,370
Good boy.

198
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:35,810
Now, sit down.

199
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,020
This is what your father entrusted to me.

200
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,250
If you have time, take a look.

201
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,210
All the information your father

202
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,460
wanted to give me is in here.

203
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,290
By the way, have there been any breakthroughs

204
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:40,170
in cracking Myna's codebook?

205
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:41,930
Not yet.

206
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,170
But don't worry,

207
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,410
I'll try to speed up the process.

208
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,670
I know this is difficult for you,

209
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,560
but the situation is urgent.

210
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,250
you must give it your all.

211
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,730
Yes.

212
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,450
Dad,

213
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,640
I need to decipher Myna's intelligence.

214
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,530
Please help me.

215
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,780
It's just a maze he built.

216
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,880
Once you figure out the direction,

217
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,280
you'll find your way out.

218
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,440
But Dad,

219
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,050
I'm already lost.

220
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,830
I can't find the way.

221
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,610
Then think differently.

222
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,730
For example,

223
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,560
if you want to hide a leaf,

224
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,830
what's the best way to do it?

225
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,790
To hide a leaf?

226
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,960
The best way to hide a leaf

227
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,330
is to hide it in a forest.

228
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,820
The book you have in your hands is the forest.

229
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,180
The code is the hidden leaf.

230
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:40,900
You just have to find it.

231
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,700
You don't need to rush back to work.

232
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,170
Take a good rest at home.

233
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,340
Come back when you're feeling better.

234
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,570
I don't want to be alone at home.

235
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,940
When everything quiets down,

236
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:27,650
I just start thinking about Dad, Mom, Grandma,

237
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,370
and my little brother.

238
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,840
Alright, alright.

239
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,870
If you don't want to be alone,

240
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,310
come to the hospital.

241
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,940
There are so many people here to keep you company.

242
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,800
You'll be okay.

243
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,100
Thank you.

244
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,560
Miss Mi Lan,

245
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:46,820
we meet again.

246
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,290
Ms. Wen,

247
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,680
what can I do for you?

248
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,230
Please come with us.

249
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:53,770
Miss.

250
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,270
This is a military hospital.

251
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,790
If you want to take anyone,

252
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,380
you need the approval of our director.

253
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,000
We are investigating the cause of Mi Lan's father's death.

254
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,710
There are many things we need to clarify with her.

255
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,170
You can't just do as you...

256
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,770
It's okay.

257
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,329
I am willing to cooperate with the investigation.

258
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,369
Yun Hongqi said,

259
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,329
my father was murdered.

260
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,770
I want to find his killer

261
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,369
and avenge him.

262
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,109
Ms. Wen.

263
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,119
I'm willing to cooperate with the investigation.

264
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:30,320
As long as we can find my father's killer

265
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,560
and avenge him,

266
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,590
I'll do whatever it takes.

267
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,630
Take her away.

268
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,910
Wen Yeming's car?

269
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,780
Yun Hongshen knows that

270
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,160
investigating Mi Lan is just a normal procedure.

271
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,570
If it were him,

272
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,180
he would do the same.

273
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,340
Mi Lan seems perfectly innocent,

274
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,420
without any flaws.

275
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,130
But the biggest point of suspicion

276
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,490
is that she just happened to

277
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,450
be right by his side at the right time.

278
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,050
And, coincidentally, she's Myna's daughter.

279
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,050
For this,

280
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,490
Yun Hongshen had suspected Mi Lan before.

281
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,930
So, he decided to give Wen Yeming two hours.

282
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,740
Because he's sure that

283
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,800
if Mi Lan was innocent,

284
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,400
then the man who shed tears for orphans

285
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
Wen Yeming, who once cried for the orphans in the shelter,

286
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,800
would never make things difficult for her.

287
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,970
Call Yun Hongqi's lackey

288
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,650
and tell him

289
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,510
we've arrested Mi Lan.

290
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:07,940
Okay.

291
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,290
Dao.

292
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,450
You're here.

293
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,540
Gangzi,

294
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,740
How's that thing I asked you to take care of?

295
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,620
-It's done.
-Okay.

296
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,000
Don't worry.

297
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,460
Thanks for your hard work.

298
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,010
We're at Uncle Yang's place.

299
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,080
The NBIS doesn't dare to openly cause trouble here.

300
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,940
If you have any issues, you can speak to us directly.

301
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:54,890
What?

302
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,250
The NBIS took Mi Lan away?

303
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,800
Those bastards!

304
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,930
They're crazy!

305
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,860
Wen Yeming deliberately had Dao inform me.

306
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,330
She's pressuring me.

307
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,230
She wants to know who killed Myna.

308
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:07,960
Shen,

309
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,200
when did they take Mi Lan?

310
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,620
How long has it been?

311
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,040
She was taken away when we went to the hospital.

312
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,530
You...

313
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,490
Are you out of your mind?

314
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,200
Why are you looking at me?

315
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,900
Young Master, please don't be so anxious.

316
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:24,880
Shen,

317
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,640
did you just stand by and watch Wen Yeming

318
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,890
take Mi Lan away?

319
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,280
The NBIS

320
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,940
is a monstrous organization!

321
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,330
Dao,

322
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,500
go wait downstairs.

323
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:35,950
Young Masters,

324
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,480
if there's any issue,

325
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,540
you can negotiate.

326
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,920
Please don't argue.

327
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,230
Don't worry, we won't!

328
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,030
-Hongqi, let me explain.
-Stop.

329
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,110
If you're still going to

330
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,570
talk about your conspiracy theories,

331
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:51,450
just stop.

332
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,090
Mi Lan is such a kind girl.

333
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,200
What does she have to do

334
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,560
with your ridiculous schemes?

335
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,760
She helped us before.

336
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:02,210
She risked her life for us.

337
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,450
It's one thing for you to suspect her,

338
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,320
but now you're just watching her die without lifting a finger!

339
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,370
This is just a normal investigation procedure.

340
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,370
She won't be in any danger.

341
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,610
No danger?

342
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,000
What do you mean by no danger?

343
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,750
Is it no danger

344
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,030
as long as she's alive?

345
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,110
Hongqi, be rational.

346
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,310
I am being rational!

347
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,940
But you've really let me down.

348
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:21,620
Hongqi, where are you going?

349
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,640
I'm going to save her.

350
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,410
You can't go.

351
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,290
Why?

352
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,900
If you want to get me killed,

353
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,780
then go ahead.

354
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,060
Why did you hide Yun Hongshen and Yun Hongqi

355
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,980
at your place?

356
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,130
Why did you hide Yun Hongshen and Yun Hongqi

357
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,170
at your place?

358
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,220
I...

359
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,050
They had nowhere to go,

360
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,970
so I let them stay with me.

361
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,710
When did you find out your father had died?

362
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,500
Yesterday.

363
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,870
Someone tried to kill Yun Hongshen and Yun Hongqi.

364
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,700
We escaped together.

365
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,570
It was Yun Hongqi who told me.

366
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,420
After your father returned to Changsha,

367
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,490
did he contact you?

368
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,200
No.

369
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,400
When was the last time

370
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,560
you saw your father?

371
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,240
Last year.

372
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,320
Around March.

373
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,090
Explain yourself.

374
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,530
What do you mean by saving Mi Lan is killing you?

375
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,330
Hongqi, calm down.

376
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,060
Listen to me.

377
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,580
Wen Yeming has a reason to suspect Mi Lan.

378
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,090
If you don't let her clear things up,

379
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:54,080
and just rush to save her without thinking,

380
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,680
that's just a temporary fix.

381
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,080
As long as they're suspicious of Mi Lan,

382
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,000
they can keep investigating her.

383
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,400
If this time doesn't work, there'll be another time.

384
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,160
And if that doesn't work, there'll be the next time.

385
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,050
Unless you hide her somewhere

386
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,710
where they'll never find her.

387
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,240
Go on.

388
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,450
If Mi Lan is innocent,

389
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,380
this is just a routine inquiry.

390
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,010
She'll be out soon.

391
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,650
Wen Yeming is the one who took her.

392
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,840
I believe Wen Yeming won't use torture on her,

393
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,900
so you don't have to worry about that.

394
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,380
I noticed that

395
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,560
since you came back,

396
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,250
your attitude toward Wen Yeming

397
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,800
has changed.

398
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,170
What makes you so sure

399
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,930
that Wen Yeming won't do those things?

400
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,610
Even if you don't believe me,

401
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,340
you should believe Uncle Yang.

402
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,500
He's already looked into Wen Yeming.

403
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,900
Uncle Yang investigated Wen Yeming?

404
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,800
Actually, I didn't want you to get involved,

405
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,200
but I have my reasons too.

406
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,520
I don't want to

407
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,790
sour the relationship with the NBIS.

408
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,160
It would be very bad for my next steps.

409
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,360
The Japanese are determined to kill me,

410
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,450
and if I offend the NBIS

411
00:23:58,450 --> 00:23:59,780
at this crucial moment,

412
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,600
I'd be surrounded on all sides,

413
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,380
not knowing what to do.

414
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,640
I really can't understand it.

415
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,910
What has Mi Lan done to deserve this?

416
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,670
To me, Mi Lan's just a poor soul.

417
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,880
She's got an information trafficker for a father,

418
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,520
and on top of that, she helped you and me out of kindness.

419
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,450
So why is everyone suspecting her?

420
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,410
That day near the Boya Tea House,

421
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,920
you were late because you were saving

422
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,920
Yun Hongshen and Yun Hongqi, right?

423
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,690
I really didn't know someone would die.

424
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:37,090
I didn't do it on purpose.

425
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,530
I'm sorry.

426
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,770
Mi Lan's reactions and behavior

427
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,000
make perfect sense for who she is.

428
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,890
She suddenly lost her father,

429
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,650
and then for some reason, was brought into the NBIS.

430
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:55,610
She was sad,

431
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:56,450
angry,

432
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,090
scared,

433
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:57,730
desperate,

434
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,850
and on the verge of breaking down.

435
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:01,090
Yet, for some reason that she doesn't want to talk about,

436
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,550
she's trying to be strong.

437
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,690
Her expression, her tone,

438
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:05,770
and even her breathing

439
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,480
were all so spot on.

440
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:09,240
Just like how she appeared

441
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,520
right next to Yun Hongshen.

442
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,090
It's like she was perfect,

443
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,320
and yet something didn't add up.

444
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,680
Why did you save them?

445
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,300
Yun Hongqi saved me.

446
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,160
I don't think they're bad people.

447
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,490
When did he save you?

448
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,190
Just a few days ago.

449
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,640
You've known them for such a short time,

450
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,640
and yet you're calling them by name?

451
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,640
That means your relationship is more than just casual.

452
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,270
Tell me,

453
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,500
what's your relationship with them?

454
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,720
Answer my question!

455
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:46,950
I don't know.

456
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,180
I don't know anything.

457
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,530
Just kill me.

458
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,570
I don't want to live anymore.

459
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:05,890
Treat her wound.

460
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:06,950
Watch her closely.

461
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,550
Don't let her kill herself.

462
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,210
Yes, Madam.

463
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,420
Actually, Wen Yeming took Mi Lan

464
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,620
for another reason.

465
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,060
She's trying to force me to hand over the killer of Myna.

466
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:28,970
So,

467
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,210
Mi Lan is suffering

468
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:32,160
because of us.

469
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,330
So what do you plan to do?

470
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,200
I'll have to speak up eventually,

471
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,240
but not today.

472
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,480
Hongqi, don't worry.

473
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,600
I can handle this.

474
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,550
How is Mi Lan?

475
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:51,870
Don't worry.

476
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,580
I won't let her die.

477
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,680
You really don't need to do this.

478
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:58,080
I genuinely want to cooperate with you.

479
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,200
So, you've been following me and Director Ling

480
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,800
to lay the groundwork for future cooperation?

481
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,590
We don't need to keep obsessing over past matters.

482
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,360
What's important is the future.

483
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,360
I don't trust you.

484
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:11,650
How could you possibly know

485
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:13,200
who killed Myna?

486
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,190
You don't need to trick me.

487
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,940
I'll tell you eventually,

488
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,360
but not today.

489
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,560
To be honest,

490
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:22,930
I not only know who killed Myna,

491
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,960
I also have what once was his.

492
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:31,570
I have the codebook.

493
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,300
Hand it over.

494
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,030
That's impossible.

495
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,360
Then you're not leaving here today.

496
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,970
Even if I'm willing to hand it over, would you dare take it?

497
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,700
Your organization isn't safe.

498
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,330
I've already survived two assassination attempts

499
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:52,370
by the Japanese.

500
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,890
Those were orchestrated by the traitor in your ranks.

501
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,290
Don't think I don't know.

502
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:02,750
Chief.

503
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,560
Yun Hongshen.

504
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,400
This is Chief Ke.

505
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,880
Hello, Chief Ke.

506
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,530
I am Yun Hongshen.

507
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,330
I've heard about you from my father.

508
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,250
It's a pleasure to meet you.

509
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,270
Please, have a seat.

510
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,390
Your father

511
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:35,200
was once quite a famous figure.

512
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:36,530
What a pity.

513
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:37,640
Fate's cruel.

514
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,320
I overheard outside

515
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,870
that you were talking about Myna's codebook.

516
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,520
How can I believe you have it?

517
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,110
Before Myna died,

518
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,550
he was staying in Room 302 in Shengxing Inn.

519
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,380
You can take my portrait to the owner

520
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,780
and have them confirm it.

521
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,920
You say you have the codebook,

522
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,000
but what about the cipher key?

523
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,960
The Japanese took it.

524
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,440
Have you seen that person?

525
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:10,570
Chief Ke,

526
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,450
you should be well aware

527
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,480
cooperating with me will be a win-win situation.

528
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,050
You're hesitating to agree

529
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,060
because you think I'm a threat.

530
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,960
Both the NBIS and you

531
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,300
are concerned about losing face.

532
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,250
So,

533
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,190
I'm here today to show some humility.

534
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,850
Let's take a step back.

535
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,230
We don't necessarily have to cooperate with you.

536
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,230
Even without you,

537
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:36,770
I can still retrieve the intelligence.

538
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:37,850
Of course.

539
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,250
I strongly believe that.

540
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,210
But it will

541
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,290
waste more of your time.

542
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,870
So, what's your purpose for coming back to Changsha?

543
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,240
About that,

544
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,460
even if I tell you, you won't believe me.

545
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,370
Just investigate it yourself.

546
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,010
Once you get to the bottom of it,

547
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,490
you'll see my sincerity.

548
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,110
Don't get too arrogant.

549
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,530
Even if this ends up going to the Chairman,

550
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,200
you still have to hand over the codebook.

551
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,420
If you don't hand it over,

552
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,420
it proves you're hiding something.

553
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,500
How about this?

554
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:10,890
Here's my offer of sincerity.

555
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,450
Lift the surveillance on the Yun family

556
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,980
and cancel the warrants for the two brothers.

557
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:16,970
How's that?

558
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,620
That's very sincere.

559
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:20,880
However,

560
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,370
Mi Lan has to be released as well.

561
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,520

00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,300
Of course we should go.

751
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:28,320
The killer

752
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,350
might be invited too.

753
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:31,540
Uncle Yang,

754
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,660
I want to find him.

755
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:33,740
But

756
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:36,500
rumors about your father are flying everywhere now.

757
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,100
I'm afraid that if you two go,

758
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,380
you'll be mocked by many people.

759
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:42,560
Our Yun family

760
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,850
has never been afraid of rumors.

761
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,190
The more they spread,

762
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,820
the more we should go.

763
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,230
Good,

764
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,170
now that's the spirit of the Yun family.

765
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:55,610
I'll send someone with the invitation

766
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:57,140
over to you this afternoon.

767
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,310
Come in.

768
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,410
[Folder]

769
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,210
Sir,

770
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:15,340
Yun Hongshen contacted me.

771
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,010
He said

772
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,570
he found the killer of Myna.

773
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,800
He's someone from the upper class

774
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,200
who smokes Punch cigars.

775
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,080
He suggests

776
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,400
we attend tomorrow night's fundraiser

777
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,400
to take a chance.

778
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,300
You should go for me.

779
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,960
Me?

780
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:38,080
That doesn't seem appropriate.

781
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,210
If someone has to go,

782
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,810
it should be the deputy station chief going on your behalf.

783
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:42,960
You're going there on official business,

784
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,290
so there's nothing wrong with that.

785
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:45,600
Zhu won't mind.

786
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:47,890
Alright then.

787
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,200
I'll go.

788
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:56,500
There's something I need to talk to you about.

789
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,810
What is it?

790
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I want Yun Hongshen to join the NBIS.

791
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,250
But there are still many doubts about him.

792
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,370
How can people like us

793
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:08,960
be totally clean?

794
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,770
If you stay in the dark for too long,

795
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,770
you're bound to get some dust on you.

796
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,400
I know what you're thinking.

797
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,950
He always got ahead of you,

798
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,360
making you lose face.

799
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,280
But right now, during the Anti-Japanese War,

800
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,080
we really need someone like him.

801
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,290
He's not only smart

802
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,810
but also unconventional.

803
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:26,610
He's a perfect candidate for an undercover agent.

804
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,880
I understand.

805
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,090
Don't worry.

806
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,460
I'll get along with him.

807
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:33,890
Of course,

808
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,430
smart people like him are never going to stay put.

809
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,370
Keep an eye on him for me.

810
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:40,700
Yes, Sir.

811
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,650
Everyone's code

812
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,990
has traces of their past selves.

813
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,730
What are you doing,

814
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:25,190
up so late with a suitcase?

815
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:28,200
I'm having trouble cracking Myna's code.

816
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,040
I want to check out his things

817
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,100
and see if I can get some inspiration.

818
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,520
Those are someone else's things.

819
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,450
It's impolite to look through them

820
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:37,730
without permission.

821
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,670
Well,

822
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,210
desperate times call for desperate measures.

823
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:43,740
Just don't break anything.

824
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,280
Don't worry, I'll be careful.

825
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,000
How's Mi Lan?

826
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,260
Is she feeling better?

827
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:50,480
It's been so chaotic these past couple of days.

828
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,940
I almost forgot about her.

829
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,560
Here's what we'll do:

830
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:54,610
After you've looked through this tonight,

831
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:56,470
I'll return it to Mi Lan tomorrow.

832
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,130
After all, this is the last thing

833
00:42:58,130 --> 00:42:59,480
her father left for her.

834
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:01,970
Don't worry.
