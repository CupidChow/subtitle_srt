00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,900
[Episode 17]

3
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,009
If you weren't from the Yun family...

4
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,750
if you weren't the Young Master Yun…

5
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,090
Zhang Hua was my good friend.

6
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,360
His loyalty to His Majesty the Emperor

7
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,390
moved me deeply.

8
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,079
He deserved it.

9
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,380
That's what he got for being too clever.

10
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,260
He was just doing his duty.

11
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,910
A foolish agent

12
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,790
doesn't deserve to serve our country.

13
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,590
The NBIS just lost one person, didn't it?

14
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,790
Who told him to send you a message on his own?

15
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,920
Would he have been exposed if he hadn't sent the message?

16
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,660
He knew I had

17
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,410
a valuable insider in the NBIS.

18
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,420
After the insider was exposed, he was afraid it would implicate me.

19
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,540
He was trying to clean up after me.

20
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,490
The facts proved

21
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,880
he wasn't capable of it.

22
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,750
This morning,

23
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,880
you clearly sent him a warning signal,

24
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,270
but he didn't go silent.

25
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,600
Instead, he chose to continue operating.

26
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,710
If that's not stupidity, what is it?

27
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,320
He was pressured by Wen Yeming and Yun Hongshen,

28
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,840
so he wanted to destroy evidence.

29
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,530
Unexpectedly, he still fell into their trap.

30
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,430
I don't want to hear you speak well of a fool anymore.

31
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,400
Miss Kudo!

32
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:12,890
Even if he made mistakes,

33
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,750
it doesn't diminish his loyalty.

34
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,770
You have no right to use that tone

35
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,520
to disparage a friend

36
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,780
who was loyal to His Majesty the Emperor.

37
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,320
I'm also serving our country loyally.

38
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,120
If I weren't serving it loyally…

39
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,540
I wouldn't bother wasting words with you here.

40
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,990
Next, I plan to lure the snake out of its hole

41
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,790
and give that person a provocation.

42
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,100
You need to be careful with the timing.

43
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,470
Don't give too much at a time,

44
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,400
lest he turns around and bites you.

45
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,079
I understand.

46
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:03,790
Mengying,

47
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,680
why are you still up so late?

48
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,450
I want to steep this medicine first.

49
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,250
Zhang said

50
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,400
this medicine should be taken once in the morning and once in the evening.

51
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,320
If the timing is wrong,

52
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,250
it will affect the effectiveness.

53
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,160
Don't worry about me.

54
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,160
Go to bed quickly.

55
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:32,600
Mom,

56
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,900
let me taste it for you first.

57
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,470
Okay.

58
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,130
This medicine is too bitter.

59
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,510
Good medicine tastes bitter, you know.

60
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,680
Please bear with it.

61
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,340
Okay?

62
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,510
Good.

63
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,730
Once you finish taking this medicine,

64
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,790
you'll get better.

65
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,770
What's the matter?

66
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,900
You look like you've lost your soul.

67
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:16,330
Hongqi.

68
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,310
Grandma was talking to you.

69
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,970
Why do you look so dispirited?

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,500
Do I?

71
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,390
You were fine last night.

72
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,750
How come after just one night's sleep,

73
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,200
you've become like this?

74
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,510
You're not sick, are you?

75
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,070
Where are you feeling unwell?

76
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,490
Grandma,

77
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,020
I'm fine.

78
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,470
I'm fine, really, Grandma.

79
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,670
Maybe I just caught a draft before bed.

80
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:39,970
I'm fine.

81
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,690
Go on eating.

82
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,820
If you weren't from the Yun family…

83
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,540
if you weren't the Young Master Yun…

84
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,510
I wish

85
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,980
I wasn't the Young Master Yun.

86
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,720
You don't want to be the Young Master of the Yun family anymore?

87
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:13,970
Grandma,

88
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,440
I didn't mean it that way.

89
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,240
What exactly happened?

90
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,850
You don't want to be the Young Master of the Yun family,

91
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,630
then you don't want to stay in this family

92
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,580
or want this family anymore,

93
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,380
is that right?

94
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,280
No, Grandma,

95
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,990
I was confused and misspoke earlier.

96
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:27,910
I want this family.

97
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,510
I want it even in my next life!

98
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:30,960
It's just that…

99
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,450
What on earth is it?

100
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,870
Tell us already.

101
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,159
Grandma,

102
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,470
Mi Lan told me yesterday

103
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,180
that she doesn't want to be the wife of the Young Master of our Yun family.

104
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,380
We can't be together.

105
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,870
She said

106
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,530
if I wasn't a member of the Yun family,

107
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,580
if I wasn't the Young Master Yun,

108
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,060
it'd be great.

109
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,300
I really don't understand why she's…

110
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:57,909
Grandma,

111
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:58,650
please don't be angry.

112
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,090
Please don't be angry with her.

113
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,630
She's a sensitive person by nature,

114
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,410
and she's timid.

115
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,840
She just lost her father, too.

116
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,500
That's why she's a bit stuck in her own thoughts.

117
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:14,510
Hello?

118
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:15,850
It's me.

119
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,540
What is it?

120
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,190
I don't need to go for this kind of job, right?

121
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,910
Besides,

122
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,190
it's been several days already.

123
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,560
Even if I go, I won't be able to find out anything.

124
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,890
Have Chen Dongping send a few subordinates to investigate.

125
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,220
Why does it have to be me?

126
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,380
Hello?

127
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,590
Hello?

128
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,210
What's wrong with him?

129
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,909
Madam.

130
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,400
Why are you here?

131
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,310
Leader Yun called me last night,

132
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,550
asking me to take this from his drawer

133
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,090
and bring it to you first thing this morning.

134
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,460
What is he up to now?

135
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,630
If it was drawn long ago,

136
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,120
why bring it over only now?

137
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,390
Leader Yun always has his own ideas.

138
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:17,930
Maybe…

139
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,010
he thinks now is the best time.

140
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,350
You've been brainwashed by him too?

141
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:32,950
Get in the car.

142
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,000
Come with me.

143
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,660
The blood trail disappeared here.

144
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,700
After he came out,

145
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,430
someone must have been waiting for him.

146
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,070
But when we chased to the back door,

147
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,090
we didn't hear any car

148
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,690
or motorcycle driving away.

149
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:04,180
So he must have left by rickshaw.

150
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,640
From here, one can quickly enter the main street

151
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,020
and escape our pursuit.

152
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,180
What on earth is Yun Hongshen up to?

153
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,310
He made me come here

154
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,230
just to prove one thing.

155
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,290
What's that?

156
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,630
There were two people who sneaked into Yun's Residence

157
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,220
that night.

158
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:51,750
Boss,

159
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,760
two steamed buns, please.

160
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,960
Two for one yuan.

161
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:55,900
Alright.

162
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:56,920
Next, please.

163
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,010
Here, boss,

164
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:58,770
two vegetable buns, please.

165
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,190
Two vegetable buns for one yuan.

166
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:00,790
Boss.

167
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,270
Your leg injury hasn't healed yet.

168
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:02,930
Go rest. I'll take care of it.

169
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:03,990
Here's your money.

170
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:04,820
Alright.

171
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,300
How many do you want?

172
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:07,960
Two vegetable buns.

173
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,700
Two vegetable buns.

174
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,360
Sure thing.

175
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,430
No wonder.

176
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,650
That night,

177
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,230
our colleagues staking out at the entrance of Yun's Residence

178
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,960
were taken out by one of our own.

179
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,490
But during the inspection the next day,

180
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,480
no one had any leg injuries.

181
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,760
If there were two people involved,

182
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,890
it would make sense.

183
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,700
The mole in our station

184
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,480
was responsible for eliminating our peripheral colleagues,

185
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,390
while his accomplice sneaked into Yun's Residence to find the codebook.

186
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,790
The mole wasn't injured,

187
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,520
so he wasn't afraid of being inspected at all.

188
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,670
It's worth a shot.

189
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,630
There should have been people on the street at that time.

190
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,400
It's possible that someone

191
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,990
actually saw the injured person.

192
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,150
Go and investigate it.

193
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,670
Yes.

194
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,650
These two leads that Yun Hongshen is pursuing

195
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,110
are worth following up on.

196
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,530
Moreover, we now have

197
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,260
what amounts to two living people in our hands.

198
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,750
As long as we can make a breakthrough with them,

199
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,230
cracking the Japanese spy network in Changsha will be within reach.

200
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,270
You keep an eye on Li Miaohan personally.

201
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:04,870
Remember,

202
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,310
don't let her escape,

203
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,750
and definitely don't let her die.

204
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,480
Understood.

205
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,440
Sir,

206
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,120
how many people know about

207
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,790
Li Miaohan's situation?

208
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,380
Deputy Chief Zhu and a few division directors.

209
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,140
I see.

210
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,770
You two go through Zhang Hua's files.

211
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,810
Find out everything related to him:

212
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,000
how many times he had been in love,

213
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,010
what friends he had made,

214
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,640
the restaurants he frequented;

215
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,660
whether he regularly visited the hospital

216
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,940
for eye checkups,

217
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,270
who his attending physician was.

218
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,400
Go through all of it.

219
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,030
Yes, sir.

220
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,300
The person who called Zhang Hua

221
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,560
may have disappeared,

222
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,750
but the place where the call was made must still be there.

223
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,270
Liu Chao,

224
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,520
take some people to inspect it.

225
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,550
The more detailed, the better.

226
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,410
Also, look into the situation with Shunde Company.

227
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,280
Move out.

228
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,400
Yes, Sir.

229
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:47,300
Let's go.

230
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,630
Over there.

231
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,160
Director.

232
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,230
Have a seat.

233
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,160
Be seated.

234
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,160
Hello, Director.

235
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,660
Long time no see.

236
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,260
Indeed.

237
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,880
What have you been busy with lately?

238
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,940
I've been reading scripts recently.

239
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,700
[Bureau of Investigation and Statistics]

240
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,260
Li Miaohan seems to have a lot of free time lately.

241
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,460
She sleeps until almost noon every day.

242
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,590
After getting up,

243
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,430
she casually meets someone for a meal,

244
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,940
then goes shopping at department stores,

245
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,620
drinks coffee, watches movies,

246
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,450
and sometimes meets with directors.

247
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,890
At night, she meets with different suitors,

248
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,290
goes to bars, and dances.

249
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,830
Sometimes she spends the night with them.

250
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:43,870
On the surface,

251
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,170
her social life seems to have no pattern.

252
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,550
It appears everything is based on her mood.

253
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,520
But I believe

254
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,250
this lack of pattern is a pattern in itself.

255
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,070
She's deliberately maintaining a social life that's seemingly intimate

256
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,750
but actually distant.

257
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,440
Are you sure she hasn't noticed you following her?

258
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,450
Positive.

259
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,150
I maintained a principle of not being afraid.

260
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,950
She definitely hasn't noticed.

261
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,590
Break this situation as soon as possible.

262
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,340
I'm not interested in the private life

263
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,200
of a socialite.

264
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,190
Yes.

265
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,360
Yun Hongshen,

266
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,440
tell us about your work.

267
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,060
The person who called Zhang Hua

268
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,060
has disappeared.

269
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,770
This person's important social connections

270
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:33,700
and relatives

271
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,110
are all under surveillance now.

272
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,750
There's nothing unusual so far.

273
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,410
I've thoroughly checked Zhang Hua's files.

274
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,470
I have a deduction.

275
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,200
He's very likely not Chinese.

276
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,430
His file states:

277
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,750
Zhang Hua, male, 40 years old,

278
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,870
was born in Zhenjiang in the 25th year of Guangxu reign,

279
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,150
which is 1899.

280
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,350
He graduated from high school at 16

281
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,350
and enlisted at 17.

282
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,610
Before 30, he was a very ordinary person.

283
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,130
It was only after joining the Blue Shirts Society

284
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,270
that his performance began to stand out.

285
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,010
And he gained Director Dai's appreciation.

286
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,430
This is also the focus of my suspicion.

287
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,450
He changed so drastically.

288
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,300
If you say it's accumulated,

289
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,640
that's a little far-fetched.

290
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,390
What's even stranger is

291
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,670
that before he was 30,

292
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,000
there was not a single photo of him.

293
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,820
Someone covered up his true identity?

294
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,350
Yes.

295
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,150
You should all be familiar with the name

296
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,670
East Asia Common Culture College, right?

297
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,910
Since its establishment,

298
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,990
under the guise of studying Chinese culture,

299
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,390
it has trained numerous spies for Japan.

300
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,550
These graduates

301
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,880
mostly stayed in China,

302
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,490
infiltrating China's military, political, cultural,

303
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,790
and educational sectors.

304
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,430
This is also the focus of my suspicion.

305
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,510
Especially after Japan started

306
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,310
large-scale invasion of China,

307
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,750
East Asia Common Culture College

308
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,040
took off the veil of the academic institution

309
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,770
and blatantly cooperated with

310
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,550
the invading Japanese army's activities.

311
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,650
You suspect this Zhang Hua

312
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:47,800
is also a spy trained

313
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,390
by East Asia Common Culture College?

314
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:49,900
Yes.

315
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,210
And as far as I know,

316
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,550
Okamura Yasuji has sent

317
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,310
a group of strategic agents to major Chinese cities,

318
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,910
infiltrating key departments,

319
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,630
aiming to gain intelligence advantages

320
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,750
to serve various battlefields.

321
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,440
How do you know this?

322
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,589
I have my own information source, of course.

323
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,829
Can your information source

324
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,619
provide more clues?

325
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,900
For example,

326
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,119
the general infiltration directions

327
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,900
of these special agents in Changsha.

328
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,589
Or

329
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,790
what valuable intelligence

330
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,069
have they provided

331
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:22,690
that we can use to trace back?

332
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:23,810
Director Ling,

333
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,069
if you keep digging like this,

334
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,560
my informant

335
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,150
will be poached by you, won't he?

336
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,450
I can poach him even if you don't tell me.

337
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,190
Okay.

338
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,310
Are you done talking?

339
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,600
Is arguing all you people here can do,

340
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,030
besides keeping silent?

341
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,310
Send out people from each of your divisions

342
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,440
to investigate Zhang Hua's true identity.

343
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,120
Remember,

344
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,000
I only want results.

345
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,070
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

346
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,310
Mom!

347
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,350
Mom! Mom!

348
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,720
Why did you cough up so much blood?

349
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:13,390
Mom!

350
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,170
Wait for me a moment.

351
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,500
I'll go call a rickshaw.

352
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,910
Let's go to the hospital!

353
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,650
I told you there was something wrong with your medicine.

354
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:20,750
You still won't admit it?

355
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,390
My mother-in-law coughed up blood after taking your newly prescribed medicine.

356
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,070
You, Zhang,

357
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,390
you're playing with people's lives!

358
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:25,850
Come on,

359
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:26,750
let's go see the magistrate.

360
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,650
Mrs. Tang, Mrs. Tang!

361
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:28,530
Move! Get moving!

362
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,130
Mrs. Tang,

363
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,150
listen to me.

364
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:30,870
Mrs. Tang,

365
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,430
this really isn't my fault.

366
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,630
You asked me to add some good herbs last time,

367
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,550
and I did.

368
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,950
It's just that her body is too weak

369
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,350
to handle the tonic.

370
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,190
Don't give me that nonsense.

371
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,870
It's the first time I've heard that adding good herbs

372
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,390
could make someone cough up blood.

373
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,820
Do you think I'm a fool?

374
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,480
I'm telling you, Zhang,

375
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,260
if you don't give me an explanation today,

376
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,320
I won't let this go.

377
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:51,490
Captain.

378
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,460
These are the hotels where Li Miaohan has recently stayed

379
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,860
and her contact numbers.

380
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,420
See if they're of any help.

381
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:57,750
Alright.

382
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,280
Go ahead.

383
00:18:59,440 --> 00:18:59,920
Okay.

384
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,980
[Xiangjiang Girls' School]

385
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:08,810
Principal Wei,

386
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:12,560
I want to organize a donation ceremony of an appropriate scale.

387
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,980
It's like this.

388
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,370
Among these donors,

389
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,650
some genuinely want to support education,

390
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,040
while others just want to gain fame.

391
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,430
As for us,

392
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,280
we should proactively help those selfless donors

393
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,230
gain recognition.

394
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,030
As for those with ulterior motives,

395
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,550
we should cater to their preferences even more.

396
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,680
It's a win-win situation, as they say.

397
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:33,670
Alright then.

398
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,320
I'll notify the newspaper.

399
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,490
You arrange the specific procedures.

400
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:38,710
Okay,

401
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,990
I'll draft a procedure as soon as possible

402
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,940
and show it to you later.

403
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,390
Good.

404
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:44,580
Call for you.

405
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:46,880
Hello?

406
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:48,730
Hongqi.

407
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,730
It's for you.

408
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:50,630
Me?

409
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,380
It's for you.

410
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,190
Hello?

411
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,470
Young Master,

412
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,710
I finally found you.

413
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,110
I have something urgent to tell you.

414
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:04,880
Go ahead.

415
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,190
The morning after Li Miaohan

416
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,590
slept with Jin Guoqiang,

417
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,270
she made a phone call.

418
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,430
Master,

419
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,520
our bait has worked.

420
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,660
You must be very careful.

421
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,140
Don't let her notice anything.

422
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,410
You can rest assured.

423
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,710
-Let's go see the magistrate.
-Listen to me.

424
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,320
-I'll ask the official to judge the matter and give me justice.
-Listen to me.

425
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,400
-Mrs. Tang!
-Go!

426
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,800
-Listen to me.
-I don't want to hear it!

427
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,040
Mrs. Tang,

428
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,190
we're all neighbors here.

429
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,790
We see each other every day.

430
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,850
We should talk things out nicely.

431
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,740
You've already hit and scolded him.

432
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,150
We need to find a way to resolve this, right?

433
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,180
How about this?

434
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:45,910
You tell me

435
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:46,730
how you want to solve it.

436
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,130
I'll do whatever you say.

437
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,110
Alright.

438
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,470
The money for my mother-in-law's treatment—

439
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,870
you'll have to pay for it.

440
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:55,450
And also,

441
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,580
the medicine for her recovery in the future—

442
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,000
you have to cover all of that, too.

443
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,800
-What?
-Well…

444
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:00,810
Well...

445
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:02,820
Mrs. Tang,

446
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,510
your mother-in-law's illness

447
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,950
is really serious.

448
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,970
Let me be honest with you.

449
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,130
With her physical condition,

450
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,990
she can't handle a good tonic at all.

451
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,020
You can't blame it all on us.

452
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,300
So, you're saying

453
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,510
I'm slandering an innocent person?

454
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,440
I just got back from the hospital.

455
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,370
The doctor said

456
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,880
you used the wrong medicine,

457
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,320
which almost cost a life.

458
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,990
And you call yourselves a family of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners?

459
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,740
Bah!

460
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,050
You people,

461
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,580
in my opinion, are just quacks.

462
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,640
If this continues,

463
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,680
this shop will eventually close down.

464
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,370
You...

465
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,840
Mrs. Tang,

466
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,520
please mind your words.

467
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,340
You just want to extort money.

468
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,560
Not to mention your exorbitant demands,

469
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,910
you're also verbally abusive.

470
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,650
How can you be like this?

471
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,450
Say that again.

472
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:42,390
How am I extorting money?

473
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,190
If Mrs. Tang wanted to extort you,

474
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,570
she'd be doing you a favor.

475
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,810
Don't be ungrateful.

476
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,720
Why are you here?

477
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,450
I heard something happened to your family, so I came to check.

478
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,180
Don't worry.

479
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:55,290
I won't let your mother-in-law suffer in vain.

480
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,430
Come, come.

481
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:02,830
Actually,

482
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,210
I didn't mean to do anything else.

483
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,730
I just want him to compensate me

484
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,290
for the medical treatment.

485
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:11,730
In fact, they didn't deceive me.

486
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:15,320
The doctor also said my mother-in-law is too weak for tonic medicines.

487
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,120
She can't take strong medicine.

488
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,660
So, I was thinking...

489
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,630
as long as they can compensate for the cost of the medicine,

490
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,190
we can consider this matter settled.

491
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,990
Don't give him a hard time, okay?

492
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,250
Take those two out for some fresh air

493
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,450
to clear their heads.

494
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,280
My dear Mengying,

495
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:43,210
if you really think like that, you're being too naive.

496
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:43,960
Naive?

497
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,000
Think about it.

498
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,590
Do you want a basket of eggs

499
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,630
or a flock of hens that can lay eggs?

500
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,120
What do you mean?

501
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,420
I've asked around about your mother-in-law's illness.

502
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,150
It's quite difficult to treat.

503
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:57,230
If she falls ill again in the future,

504
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,820
where will the money for treatment come from?

505
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,450
But we can't ask them for

506
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,680
the money for the next treatment.

507
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,810
That's going too far, isn't it?

508
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,730
I'm not saying you should ask them for money.

509
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,190
I'm saying you need to have a long-term plan.

510
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,850
What kind of long-term plan?

511
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,540
Don't let them compensate for this time's expenses.

512
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,900
Convert it into capital and invest.

513
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,910
This way, you'll have dividends by the end of the year.

514
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:20,550
Not only will there be money for your mother-in-law's treatment,

515
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:23,550
but you can also supplement your household expenses.

516
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,510
Moreover, your husband works for the government.

517
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,720
You going out to collect protection money

518
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,680
isn't a good idea.

519
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,080
It could also affect his promotion, right?

520
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,950
Can we really do this?

521
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,830
Won't there be any trouble?

522
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,070
How could there be any trouble?

523
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,040
I'm here to help.

524
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,670
Jin Gui,

525
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,080
Tang often tells me,

526
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,360
"Don't accept benefits without merit."

527
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,600
You're so good to me.

528
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,750
I don't know how to thank you enough.

529
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,340
You don't need to thank me.

530
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,820
I just want to build a good relationship with your husband.

531
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,800
You're speaking as if we're strangers.

532
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,550
We two have been in close contact these past few years,

533
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,950
but Mr. Tang and I

534
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,560
are still distant.

535
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,390
That's just how he is.

536
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:08,270
Stubborn.

537
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,190
Don't take it personally, okay?

538
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,630
I'm not taking it personally.

539
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,550
I sincerely want to be friends with Mr. Tang.

540
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,230
I'm not afraid to speak frankly with you.

541
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:20,350
If our Bai ever runs into any trouble in the future,

542
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,420
if your husband could lend a hand,

543
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,760
it would help us get through it.

544
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,690
Don't you think?

545
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,240
Yes.

546
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,650
Alright.

547
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,160
Let's do it this way.

548
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,800
Deputy Chief,

549
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,190
come.

550
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:39,760
Sit down.

551
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,210
Go ahead.

552
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,240
The situation is like this.

553
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,950
The day before yesterday, around 1:19 PM,

554
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,860
Yun Hongshen made a call from a public phone booth on Xiangtan Road

555
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,480
to Shanghai.

556
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,790
The call lasted less than two minutes.

557
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,630
I used my connections to inquire about it.

558
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:03,400
The number in Shanghai is a pay phone.

559
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,800
As for who answered the call,

560
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,280
I couldn't find out.

561
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,150
You'll need to find another way.

562
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:11,800
Don't bother.

563
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,630
In matters like this, every second counts.

564
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,680
By the time you found out about Yun Hongshen making that call,

565
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,990
a lot of time had already passed.

566
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,590
If this person is also a professional,

567
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,320
this time gap

568
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,610
is enough for him to cover all his tracks.

569
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:25,550
Chief.

570
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,230
Deputy Chief.

571
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:29,990
Deputy Chief.

572
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,590
Yun Hongshen is too shrewd.

573
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,420
I don't dare to watch him too closely.

574
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,040
Besides,

575
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:38,680
I can't afford to offend his brother, either.

576
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,110
I still have to live in Changsha in the future.

577
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:41,380
Right?

578
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,630
Alright, stop complaining.

579
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:45,490
I didn't expect you to keep a close eye on him anyway.

580
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:21,050
It's all written down in black and white.

581
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:21,600
Mengying,

582
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,710
come and check it.

583
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:23,820
Okay.

584
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,880
You barely know any characters,

585
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,520
yet you're putting on quite an act.

586
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,070
Alright.

587
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,600
Let's just do it this way.

588
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,270
Then, let's sign and seal it.

589
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:40,760
Come on.

590
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:55,890
[Zeng Mengying]

591
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,390
You've checked it all just now, right?

592
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,920
There's no problem, right?

593
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,350
You know me,

594
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,350
I only know a few characters.

595
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,910
Even my own name

596
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,190
was forced upon me by Tang.

597
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,030
You can put your mind at ease.

598
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,830
There's definitely no problem.

599
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,430
Alright.

600
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,280
I'll have a good talk with Tang later.

601
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,040
Don't worry.

602
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,480
He'll definitely remember this favor.

603
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,950
That's great.

604
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,440
Second Young Master.

605
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,360
Please, have a seat.

606
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,870
My Young Master.

607
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,100
Please, sit down.

608
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,520
Your esteemed presence here

609
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,470
is truly my greatest honor.

610
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,680
I haven't seen you these past few days.

611
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,940
I've been missing you.

612
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,690
Let's get down to business.

613
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,200
How's the investigation on Li Miaohan going?

614
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:57,750
I know,

615
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,060
Uncle Yang has already told me,

616
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,630
there are some things you can't tell me.

617
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,440
I won't pry.

618
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,120
Just tell me what you can.

619
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,390
Maybe I can help.

620
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,870
We've been searching, but

621
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,330
it hasn't been going very smoothly.

622
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,260
We haven't found any new leads yet.

623
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:16,590
If there's no breakthrough with Li Miaohan,

624
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,060
are there no other directions to pursue?

625
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:20,770
Hongqi,

626
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:24,760
your words just reminded me of something.

627
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:26,780
We've been focusing all our energy

628
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,320
on Li Miaohan.

629
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,490
So, we've been neglecting other matters.

630
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,490
Anyone related to Li Miaohan,

631
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,620
dead or alive, we need to investigate.

632
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,270
Jin Guoqiang, Qu Wenzhi…

633
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,500
Oh, right.

634
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,440
Wen Yeming said

635
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:40,590
Qu Wenzhi left on

636
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:43,010
Bai Qingkui's labor trafficking ship.

637
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,430
And when I had just returned to Changsha,

638
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:48,560
this guy had sent people to catch me at the train station.

639
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,840
I had forgotten about him.

640
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,870
This Bai Qingkui, in the past couple of years,

641
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,630
has done plenty of dirty work.

642
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,100
Why is he still doing fine

643
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,810
without anyone causing him trouble?

644
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,210
Even the NBIS

645
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,430
turns a blind eye to him.

646
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,340
Do you know why?

647
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:08,320
Why?

648
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,160
He has two life-saving charms.

649
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,810
The first one

650
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:17,590
is that he has established an intricate network of interests.

651
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:20,000
Why can he transport goods, contraband, rather,

652
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,910
back and forth?

653
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,150
His ships are constantly moving,

654
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,050
and they're not for legitimate business.

655
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:25,110
Why hasn't anyone investigated him?

656
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,250
The officials have been bribed.

657
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,470
There are too many vested interests involved.

658
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,700
No one dares to cause trouble easily.

659
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,510
No wonder.

660
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,720
Qu Wenzhi took Bai Qingkui's ship.

661
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,790
And Ling Han discovered this.

662
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,650
He's a ruthless character,

663
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,990
but he handled this matter

664
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,660
very mildly.

665
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:48,110
But, Hongqi,

666
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,990
I feel there must be something fishy about this.

667
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,930
What about Bai Qingkui's second life-saving charm?

668
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,430
So, you think

669
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,320
as Bai Qingkui has helped so many people

670
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,660
and done so many bad things,

671
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,470
he must have secrets about all these people,

672
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:01,950
right?

673
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,880
That's right.

674
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,790
Isn't it obvious?

675
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:06,770
Whether it's murder, arson, kidnapping, or extortion,

676
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:08,820
there's always a buyer and a seller involved.

677
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,280
He's done so many bad things,

678
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,160
surely not all for himself?

679
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:15,330
In fact,

680
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:18,650
it's quite the opposite of what you think.

681
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,550
There are many things

682
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,990
that he genuinely doesn't know who's behind.

683
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:23,550
You see,

684
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:26,850
he places a mailbox at the entrance of the Happy House.

685
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,290
If you want him to do something for you,

686
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,230
just put a letter in that mailbox.

687
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,710
You need to draw a dice on the envelope.

688
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,310
Bai Qingkui has someone open the mailbox

689
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,680
punctually at midnight every day.

690
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,640
If he accepts it,

691
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,990
he'll open the small side door at the back.

692
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,910
You put the money in,

693
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,430
and the deal is done.

694
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,480
He is really cunning.

695
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,480
He doesn't know who's behind the job.

696
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,270
He just takes the money and does the work.

697
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,310
This way,

698
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,410
it is indeed safer for him.

699
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:01,340
So you can't do anything about him.

700
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,890
Even if you beat him to death

701
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,170
or crippled him,

702
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,810
he still wouldn't know who hired him.

703
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,100
Hongqi,

704
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:09,530
I don't think this matter

705
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,950
is as simple as we think.

706
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:15,040
And someone like him can't be completely in the dark.

707
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:18,270
I guess he must have another life-saving charm

708
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,200
to use at the most critical moment.

709
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,320
So you also think

710
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,100
he keeps a mental record,

711
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:23,590
right?

712
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,560
I guess he not only keeps it in his mind,

713
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,470
but has also written it all down.

714
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,800
Can I handle this matter?

715
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:33,830
Say no more.

716
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,510
The incident of him kidnapping Grandma—

717
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,670
I've always kept it in my heart.

718
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,050
I must teach him a lesson

719
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,440
to make him come to his senses.

720
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,350
Let's settle it like this.

721
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,560
Wait for my news, okay?

722
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,160
Oh, by the way,

723
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,490
there's one more thing.

724
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:45,910
Huang told me that

725
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,730
after Li Miaohan had spent the night at Jin Guoqiang's place,

726
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:49,440
the next morning,

727
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,320
she had made a phone call from that room.

728
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,110
Who did she call?

729
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,510
Zong Fang's office.

730
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,210
It's actually him?

731
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:57,910
Shen,

732
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,690
could Zong Fang

733
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,950
be the one behind Li Miaohan?

734
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,540
Didn't you mention before

735
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,020
that no one would

736
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,520
get involved in multiple incidents without reason?

737
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,630
I've been thinking,

738
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,290
Zong Fang has been involved in

739
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,510
all these recent events to some extent.

740
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:16,050
Well done, Hongqi.

741
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:19,490
Looks like you've made quite some progress lately.

742
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,550
I'm talking to you seriously.

743
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:27,190
Is Zong Fang the one behind Li Miaohan?

744
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,100
No.

745
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,720
How can you be so sure?

746
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:34,310
I felt calm when facing him.

747
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,390
I wasn't afraid.

748
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:37,670
But whenever I think of

749
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,140
the person I'm looking for,

750
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,040
my whole body turns cold.

751
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:42,440
Could it be that

752
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,740
when you dealt with him before,

753
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,430
you didn't know

754
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,410
he was the one behind Li Miaohan?

755
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:50,110
Even if I know now, I'm still not afraid.

756
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,240
In him,

757
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,900
I can't sense that aura.

758
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,150
What kind of aura?

759
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,030
Madness.

760
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,270
A rational yet cruel madness.

761
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,650
Is that person in the NBIS?

762
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,520
Why do you ask that?

763
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:08,710
You told me

764
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,270
you must join the NBIS to resolve this matter.

765
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:14,740
Uncle Yang also agreed with you joining the NBIS.

766
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,070
The answer is obvious, isn't it?

767
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,390
Hongqi,

768
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,020
don't ask more about this matter.

769
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:20,380
Come,

770
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,970
let's have some tea.

771
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:23,160
Alright,

772
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:24,160
let's drink.

773
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,580
[Hunan Station]

774
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,300
[Operation Team Leader's Office]

775
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,020
[File]

776
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,250
Although Zong Fang had gradually surfaced,

777
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,630
Yun Hongshen was in no hurry to make a move against him.

778
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,190
Because

779
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,100
he wasn't the key figure.

780
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:25,030
Keeping him around was more useful than capturing him.

781
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,440
The truly frightening one

782
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,870
was the mysterious and omnipresent Kunwu.

783
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:31,110
Who could he be?

784
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:34,190
-Hello, Sir.
-Hello, Sir.

785
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,040
Leader Yun,

786
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,900
the Deputy Chief has gone out.

787
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,989
Do you need him for something?

788
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:48,830
Do you want me to pass on a message?

789
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,830
There's just some new information.

790
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,320
If the Deputy Chief isn't here,

791
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,800
I'll just wait until he returns.

792
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,330
Alright.

793
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,910
Zhu He is not at the station again.

794
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:10,160
Looks like the bait I threw worked.

795
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,840
Ling Han is also investigating Zhu He.

796
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,240
Although this doesn't prove that Zhu He is problematic,

797
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,040
it at least indicates one thing:

798
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,400
There's something suspicious about Zhu He.

799
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,040
But is Ling Han reliable?

800
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,290
Everyone makes mistakes,

801
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,280
and Ling Han is no exception.

802
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,070
However,

803
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,930
from Li Liang to Zhang Hua,

804
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,190
although Ling Han's mistakes were small,

805
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,800
the consequences were all fatal.

806
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,720
Yun Hongshen didn't want to maliciously speculate about others,

807
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,610
but he couldn't believe that an outstanding agent

808
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,300
would make such basic mistakes repeatedly.

809
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,480
Why didn't you go out?

810
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,040
Welcome.

811
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:49,910
Please.

812
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,680
Aren't you also here?

813
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,060
You're not following that Li Miaohan anymore?

814
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,720
I sent Chen Dongping instead.

815
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:01,310
I have a thought.

816
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,970
I'd like you to help me analyze it.

817
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,610
Leader Wen, you're asking for my help?

818
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,960
But I've heard that Leader Wen

819
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,210
never listens to others' opinions,

820
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,830
and only respects the Chief.

821
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:21,150
Yet today you're asking me to help you analyze something.

822
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,600
Do you think that my analysis

823
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,560
is particularly accurate,

824
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,080
especially valuable for reference,

825
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,880
and that I look particularly handsome when I'm talking eloquently?

826
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,540
The Chief said

827
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,720
it's a virtue to humbly learn from those below oneself.

828
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,800
He asked me to occasionally listen to others' opinions.

829
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,030
Although they might not be useful,

830
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,690
they won't do any harm either.

831
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,030
Okay.

832
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:43,910
The fact that you're letting me be that "occasionally"

833
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,630
already made me feel extremely honored.

834
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,160
Go ahead.

835
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:47,490
What's your thought?

836
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,360
I want to use Li Miaohan to lure and capture that assassin.

837
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,080
Well, that…

838
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,510
might be a bit difficult.

839
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,190
Have you forgotten?

840
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:06,390
We have a mole inside our organization.

841
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,230
Your surveillance on Li Miaohan

842
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,410
must already be known to the Japanese.

843
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:12,050
Although Li Miaohan

844
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,790
seems normal for now,

845
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,600
But this could be

846
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,480
the mastermind's plan.

847
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:20,930
If they want to use Li Miaohan

848
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,510
to hold us back

849
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,450
and delay our investigation,

850
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,680
once you take action against Li Miaohan,

851
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,840
they'll sacrifice the pawn to protect the king.

852
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,290
No.

853
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,080
Li Liang just died,

854
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,030
and then Zhang Hua's incident happened.

855
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,030
That mole must be very cautious now.

856
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,070
I don't think he will

857
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,510
reveal anything about Li Miaohan,

858
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,550
because in his eyes,

859
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:40,880
Li Miaohan is just a small figure,

860
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,880
not of much value.

861
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,060
Now that the people on Li Miaohan's line

862
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,550
don't know anything about the situation,

863
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:48,240
there's still a good chance of luring and capturing that assassin.

864
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,700
Have you discussed this idea with the Chief?

865
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:53,790
Not yet.

866
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,800
Since Myna died,

867
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,070
our work

868
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,980
hasn't made any substantial progress.

869
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,560
Now that you've exposed the strategic agent issue,

870
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,130
he doesn't dare to take risks anymore.

871
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:05,090
He'd rather play it safe than make rash moves.

872
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,130
But I believe

873
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,990
this risk is necessary to take.

874
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,340
The value of that assassin

875
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,740
is clearly much greater than Li Miaohan's.

876
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,490
So,

877
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,880
you didn't ask me here to help you analyze.

878
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,970
You want to make me your accomplice.

879
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,570
If this operation succeeds,

880
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,870
then of course, all will be well.

881
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,300
But if it fails,

882
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,870
I'll be the one taking the blame.

883
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,560
Because the mastermind

884
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,400
sounds exactly like me,

885
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:37,090
while you'd  just be someone who was encouraged.

886
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,950
Wen Yeming,

887
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,980
you're setting me up, huh?

888
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,550
Are you in or not?

889
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:46,640
I'm not.

890
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,560
Wait a minute.

891
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,630
Are you hiding something from me?

892
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,430
Don't you have anything hiding from me?

893
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,120
For example,

894
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,890
that information source of yours,

895
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,980
don't you have anything to say about it?

896
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,750
That well-connected informant of yours

897
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,480
must be able to help you find out

898
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:13,560
information related to the spy network in Changsha.

899
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,780
To be honest with you,

900
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,640
this is not as simple as you think.

901
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,190
You'd better not get involved.

902
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,720
It seems that in your heart,

903
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:30,390
no one is qualified to be your true comrade-in-arms.

904
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,130
That's just ridiculous.

905
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:17,820
Upstairs.

906
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:40,840
Boss Bai,

907
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,470
the people Yun Hongqi invited today

908
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,360
are all sons of high-ranking officials.

909
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,230
Obviously.

910
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:49,110
What do you think he's up to?

911
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,520
We kidnapped his grandma,

912
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,070
and Dao made some serious threats back then,

913
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:53,260
saying that when Yun Hongqi comes out,

914
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,510
he'll settle scores with us.

915
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:56,470
But today he's here to support us,

916
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:58,770
bringing us business to make money.

917
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,990
He can't be trying to make peace with you, can he?

918
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,380
Do you have a pig's brain?

919
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,040
Didn't you see who he invited?

920
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,700
The mayor's son,

921
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,900
the police chief's son,

922
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:11,340
and the brother-in-law of a high-ranking military official.

923
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,680
This is clearly a setup for revenge.

924
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,960
Young Master Yun, don't worry.

925
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,760
Your business is our business.

926
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,720
We absolutely can't let this slide.

927
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,880
That's very loyal of you.

928
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,510
Exactly.

929
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:29,950
Even if you don't mind, I won't let this slide.

930
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:30,720
I'm counting on you.

931
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,710
-You're welcome.
-Just wait and see.

932
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:32,440
We're going.

933
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:33,850
We're off.

934
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,780
Mr. Yun, this way please.

935
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,500
Chairman Zong,

936
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,470
long time no see.

937
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,140
Second Young Master Yun!

938
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,380
What brings you here?

939
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:06,440
I'm sorry I didn't come out to greet you.

940
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:06,920
Come.

941
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,160
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

942
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,310
Would you like tea or coffee?

943
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:11,770
Coffee, please.

944
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:12,370
Thank you.

945
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:13,310
Coffee.

946
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,010
Come, sit down.

947
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,080
I'm sorry, Chairman Zong.

948
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,560
After meeting you last time,

949
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,240
I

950
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,100
have been looking for a chance

951
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:24,940
to visit you.

952
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,750
But there have been too many troublesome matters lately.

953
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:28,550
It's alright.

954
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,790
As long as it's meant to be,

955
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:30,750
we'll meet eventually.

956
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,610
See, we've met today, haven't we?

957
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,160
To be honest,

958
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:37,390
I came here today to ask you for a small favor.

959
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:39,740
Second Young Master, please feel free to ask.

960
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,220
I'd be happy to help.

961
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,240
You can just call me Hongshen.

962
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,150
In front of you,

963
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:45,360
I'm just a junior.

964
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:46,900
Alright.

965
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:48,260
Then, I won't stand on ceremony.

966
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:48,980
Hongshen.

967
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:51,370
I have a friend

968
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,030
who is a fan of Miss Li.

969
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:54,560
Miss Li?

970
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,680
You mean Li Miaohan, right?

971
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,610
That's correct.

972
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:58,850
So,

973
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:00,870
I was hoping you could do me a favor

974
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:02,460
to introduce us.
