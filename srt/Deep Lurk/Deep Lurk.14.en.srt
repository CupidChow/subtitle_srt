00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,330
Director Ling,

4
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,789
the fate of this mole must end today.

5
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:44,950
I promise.

6
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,770
When was this house rented?

7
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,260
This house was rented out at the end of last year.

8
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,990
I showed the photos to the landlord,

9
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,630
and he identified Niu Erhong as the person who rented the house.

10
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,490
What about the people in the room?

11
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,590
We didn't catch them.

12
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,510
Chief,

13
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,110
it's not a big deal that we lost track of them.

14
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,430
What's important is that mole.

15
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,670
He will act again.

16
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,079
When will the Commander's men arrive?

17
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,700
They should be here soon.

18
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,900
Since the mole failed this time,

19
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,870
he will certainly make their move during the next phase.

20
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,580
Everyone,

21
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,710
I hope to hear

22
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,470
a specific name from you,

23
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,230
okay?

24
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,900
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

25
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,829
Fire! There's a fire!

[Archives Room]

27
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,700
Director Ling,

28
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,350
you don't need to look at me like that.

29
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,210
It was the Deputy Chief who instructed me to do this.

30
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,990
Adjutant Chen, thanks for your cooperation

31
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,450
in helping us stage this act this time,

32
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,250
so we were able to catch the mole.

33
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,870
You're too kind.

34
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,570
I was merely doing my duty.

35
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,710
Deputy Chief Zhu, you flatter me.

36
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,800
True though.

37
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,170
If you hadn't come here

38
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,890
to create the impression of taking the codebook,

39
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,950
Li Liang might not have taken the bait.

40
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,750
That's exactly what the saying means:

41
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,930
"A play must be performed to its fullest."

42
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,810
Yes, yes.

43
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,690
Adjutant Chen,

44
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,250
how is the Commander doing lately?

45
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,180
He's doing well.

46
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,950
Please send my regards to him.

47
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:03,610
Certainly.

48
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,700
Rest assured, I'll definitely pass it on.

49
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,690
I still have some things to attend to.

50
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,290
-Chief Ke, please feel free to go.
-Okay. Okay.

51
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,010
Adjutant Chen,

52
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:17,470
please.

53
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:17,930
Okay.

54
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,080
Deputy Chief Zhu asked him to do it?

55
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,070
Objectively speaking,

56
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,870
Li Liang doesn't fit the image of the mole in my mind.

57
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,730
He's almost recklessly foolish.

58
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,040
Of course,

59
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,909
this could all be an act.

60
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,680
The purpose is to create a misleading impression of innocence.

61
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,270
But Deputy Chief Zhu,

62
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:41,870
both his personality and abilities

63
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,570
match the traits I associate with a mole.

64
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,830
However, just because he fits that description doesn't mean he's the one.

65
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,290
The most successful spies

66
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,380
are often the ones who appear the least like spies.

67
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,710
Why did you prevent

68
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,520
the General Affairs Department from reporting

69
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,640
such large funds to me?

70
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,659
You're the Deputy Chief.

71
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:59,260
Why did you keep this from me?

72
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,840
Let's not rush to conclusions about this.

73
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,680
Wen Yeming and Yun Hongshen have now gone to Li Liang's house.

74
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,230
Let's wait for them to come back

75
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,510
and then discuss it.

76
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,290
Yes.

77
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,080
Director Xu,

78
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,110
come to my office.

79
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,870
Send this to Wild Fox.

80
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:45,650
Yes, sir.

81
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,760
Send it personally.

82
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,470
Don't let anyone else know.

83
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:51,820
Go.

84
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:54,950
Why did your Chief

85
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,810
ask me to search Li Liang's house?

86
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,590
He's your Chief now too.

87
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:00,860
That's right.

88
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,840
I haven't gotten used to it yet.

89
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,330
Zhang Fei flew into a rage.

90
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,120
His round eyes widened.

91
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,310
He gritted his teeth,

92
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,200
dismounted from his horse,

93
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,309
and strode directly into the inn.

94
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:34,380
The doorkeeper couldn't stop him.

95
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,690
It seems he's quite fond of Zhang Fei.

96
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:42,039
This fierce Zhang Fei is more astute than he seems.

97
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,040
Looks like he considers himself the Zhang Fei of NBIS.

98
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,550
He bribed the Deputy Chief

99
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,640
and had the process photographed.

100
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,470
He just wants to have leverage over the Deputy Chief when the time comes.

101
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,480
How shameless.

102
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,660
With the nation in crisis,

103
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,910
the Deputy Chief can still accept bribes with a clear conscience.

104
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,430
What's the big deal?

105
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,790
This sort of thing happens all the time.

106
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,590
For all we know, our Chief might have taken

107
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,250
even more bribes than others.

108
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,030
My teacher is not that kind of person.

109
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,350
To serve the country without distractions,

110
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,350
he never married.

111
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,670
He doesn't even have a place to live,

112
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,190
so he sleeps in the office at night.

113
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,510
Work is the only thing in his life.

114
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,570
Although he now...

115
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,990
Anyway,

116
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,720
don't talk nonsense if you don't understand the situation.

117
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,540
He's your teacher?

118
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,110
Okay, okay, okay. I was wrong.

119
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,640
I truly didn't understand the situation

120
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,950
and spoke carelessly,

121
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,320
making the incorrect judgment.

122
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,920
I apologize to you, alright?

123
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,250
You really don't need to be this fired up all the time.

124
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,510
People who don't know you might think you have a short fuse.

125
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,270
You should hand these things over to the Chief privately.

126
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,000
They won't be used as evidence.

127
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,070
Why?

128
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,540
You wouldn't believe me, even if I told you.

129
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,860
You can ask your Chief.

130
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,430
Zhang Yide.

131
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,000
Guan Yunzhang.

132
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,660
These are all formidable figures.

133
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,680
There are so many cigarettes here.

134
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,830
Golden Yellow cigarettes.

135
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,080
There should be 33 cigarette butts

136
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,380
found in the bathroom.

137
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,910
But in Niu Erhong's trash cart,

138
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,230
there were only 32 cigarette butts.

139
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,230
One cigarette butt was missing.

140
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,100
A Golden Yellow cigarette butt.

141
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,150
The one who passed information to Niu Erhong

142
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,010
was using this brand of cigarettes.

143
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:40,810
It seems...

144
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,650
a lot of

145
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,480
unexpected things

146
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,910
in this.

147
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,950
We need to take a closer look.

[Bureau of Investigation and Statistics]

149
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,310
Move. Go inside.

150
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,990
Chief.

151
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:39,570
Let me explain.

152
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,230
It was the Deputy Chief who ordered me to do it.

153
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,430
Before your meeting,

154
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,690
he sent me a letter.

155
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,270
Come in.

156
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:17,030
Keep a close eye on the conference room.

157
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,910
After entering the conference room for the second time,

158
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,150
create confusion.

159
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,230
Burn the letter after reading.

160
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,510
The letter also instructed me

161
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,910
to burn it after reading.

162
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,390
But I didn't burn that letter.

163
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,720
I kept it in the second drawer of my office.

164
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,730
We've sent people to search your office.

165
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,070
No one found the letter.

166
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,210
That's impossible.

167
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,540
I clearly left it there.

168
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:44,910
Director Ling.

169
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,490
Yes.

170
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,030
You had Niu Erhong rent

171
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,250
the house next door to yours,

172
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,630
connect it, and turn it into a secret room.

173
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,360
And room 202 across from our station

174
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,890
was also rented by Niu Erhong at your request.

175
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,580
Here are the lease contracts.

176
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,350
Niu Erhong was your distant cousin.

177
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,710
You've had him do quite a few things for you over the years.

178
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,950
For each and every one of them,

179
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,350
he told his wife about it.

180
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,170
This is his wife's testimony.

181
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,990
He also left behind evidence.

182
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,270
You've passed information

183
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,510
through cigarettes several times.

184
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,350
In your home,

185
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,510
we also found several packs of Golden Yellow cigarettes.

186
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,310
It's clear

187
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,830
that this was a common method you used for external communication.

188
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,230
Niu Erhong was cautious.

189
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,550
He copied your method,

190
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,550
bought the same cigarettes,

191
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,230
and made the same marks on them

192
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,230
as insurance for his survival later on,

193
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,830
in case you tried to silence him.

194
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:34,960
But he didn't expect

195
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,350
that he would die in your hands anyway.

196
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:37,990
You...

197
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:39,950
Chief,

198
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,410
he's framing me.

199
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,230
Niu Erhong wasn't smart enough for this.

200
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,550
On the night of Qu Wenzhi's murder,

201
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,910
around 8:57 PM,

202
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,160
what were you doing?

203
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:48,800
I...

204
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,580
I was on guard in the car,

205
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,110
waiting to pick up Wen Yeming.

206
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:52,620
No,

207
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,000
you got out of the car at that time.

208
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,430
Get me a pack of cigarettes.

209
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,500
Yes.

210
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,450
I did get out of the car.

211
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,470
I just bought a pack of cigarettes.

212
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,670
You made a phone call.

213
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,150
You...

214
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,010
That's BS.

215
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:21,780
Wen Yeming.

216
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,880
On the day we arrived in Shanghai,

217
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,790
after the operation at the Red Wine House,

218
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,910
I went to your room to look for you,

219
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,510
but you weren't there at that time.

220
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,150
Later, you told me you went to buy cigarettes.

221
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,740
I asked the owner of the tobacco shop.

222
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:36,200
He said that you went to a phone booth after buying cigarettes.

223
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,710
I did make a phone call.

224
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,230
I called the Deputy Chief.

225
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,520
Including the fight that night,

226
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,380
it was also he who asked me to do it.

227
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:48,880
I assigned Li Liang... an extra task.

228
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,230
I have reported its specific details

229
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,620
to the Chief.

230
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,070
The matter with Qu Wenzhi can't possibly end well,

231
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,220
so we might as well

232
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,050
turn it into

233
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,820
an inexplicable mess.

234
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,010
Therefore, what I'm doing

235
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,540
is to make the situation even more complicated

236
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,930
to divert their attention

237
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,020
and stop them from constantly focusing on us.

238
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,150
And don't worry.

239
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,850
The people carrying out this mission

240
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,780
have all been covertly recruited and activated.

241
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,110
They're not in any official records.

242
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,530
After they complete the task,

243
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,560
they'll have safe places to go.

244
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,470
It'll leave absolutely no traces.

245
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,270
Wen Yeming.

246
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,790
That night,

247
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,210
when I reached the fifth floor of the Shanghai Hotel,

248
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,830
Qu Wenzhi's bodyguards were already blocking the elevator.

249
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:29,630
It's obvious

250
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,750
that someone had tipped him off.

251
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,030
What does that have to do with me?

252
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:34,830
Wen Yeming.

253
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:35,710
You suspect me?

254
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,750
I suspect you too!

255
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,190
Did you let Qu Wenzhi go?

256
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,790
And how did Jin Guoqiang die?

257
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,190
Chief,

258
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,890
I did have Niu Erhong rent me a place,

259
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,830
but I never asked him

260
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,430
to pass on any intelligence.

261
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,690
When I was in Shanghai,

262
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,650
I didn't tip off Qu Wenzhi either.

263
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,110
I didn't let him go as well.

264
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,430
As for this Jin Guoqiang,

265
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,300
I have no idea what's going on with him.

266
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,490
When did you put up

267
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,970
that small mirror outside the telegraph room?

268
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:00,560
What...

269
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,110
what small mirror?

270
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,910
I didn't do that.

271
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,280
I didn't do that!

272
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,480
Chief.

273
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:12,710
You like the Three Kingdoms?

274
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,510
Who do you like in it?

275
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,270
Zhang Fei.

276
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,990
Do you like his bravery and righteousness,

277
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,849
or his violence and ingratitude?

278
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,360
A roar at the head of the Dangyang Bridge;

279
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,760
the shout breaks the bridge, making the water flow backward.

280
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,880
I think you're more like Wei Yan,

281
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,170
born with a rebellious nature!

282
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,970
-Chief.
-Don’t call me "Chief."

283
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,170
How can you face the Party and country knowing what you've done?

284
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:43,390
How can you face the Principal knowing what you've done?

285
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,190
Chief,

286
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,640
I didn't do any of this!

287
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,450
It was the Deputy Chief!

288
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,330
He asked me to take these photos!

289
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,100
What evidence do you have?

290
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,270
What?

291
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,590
What evidence do you have to prove

292
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,450
that it was Deputy Chief Zhu who ordered you to do it?

293
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,080
I don't have any evidence either.

294
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,080
-But I have evidence of his  bribe-taking...
-Shut up!

295
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,980
Now that all the evidence is right in front of us,

296
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,380
you still dare to deny it?

297
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,640
Li Liang, I really don't think you should

298
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,710
be called by that name.

299
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,970
Deputy Chief Zhu has shown you great kindness by recognizing your talent and prompting you.

300
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,430
Yet you're still stubbornly framing him, aren't you?

301
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,070
Chief,

302
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:18,870
this wasn't me.

303
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:19,350
I swear,

304
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,190
I didn't do it.

305
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,050
Who's your superior?

306
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,530
I don't have a superior!

307
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,350
Yun Hongshen.

308
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,400
Yes, sir.

309
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,640
From now on,

310
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,940
you are the leader of Team Two of the Operations Division.

311
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,240
Thank you, sir.

312
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,990
Zhu He.

313
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,280
I'll leave this person to you.

314
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,210
I don't want to see this face again.

315
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,510
Yes.

316
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,270
Chief,

317
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,070
please believe me!

318
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:45,490
Chief,

319
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,480
I didn't do it,

320
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,230
Chief!

321
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,010
Zhu He!

322
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,920
How much have I given you?

323
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,340
Chief,

324
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,580
you wanted to see me?

325
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,940
Have a seat.

326
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,990
Yun Hongshen is quite special.

327
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,150
I'll let you handle this matter.

328
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,780
I don't want to see a second Li Liang.

329
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:37,800
Understood.

330
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,780
Also, regarding the mid-level and above personnel at the station,

331
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,990
we need to expedite the screening process.

332
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,430
However, we must be careful about our methods.

333
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,630
Don't affect morale.

334
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:46,830
Rest assured.

335
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,610
I've already started making arrangements.

336
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,170
Also, about the cipher key.

337
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,810
Time is running out.

338
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,560
Do you have a specific plan?

339
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,430
Zhu.

340
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,710
What's your opinion?

341
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:04,530
The cipher key.

342
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,120
I... I still need... need some time...

343
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,810
to figure out a specific plan.

344
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,840
If I can find Myna's killer

345
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,750
and the connection between him and Li Liang,

346
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,070
then the direction for tracking the key

347
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,470
will... will become clear.

348
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,780
Your analysis makes sense.

349
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,500
This will be the focus of our next steps.

350
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,110
Zhu.

351
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,110
We've known each other for quite some time, right?

352
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,770
Sit.

353
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,890
You should know very well

354
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,220
what kind of person I am.

355
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,390
When it comes to certain matters,

356
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,850
I only care about results.

357
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,830
And I don't care how we get there.

358
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:06,470
But

359
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,160
I'll only look the other way

360
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,870
if we're working toward the same goal.

361
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,870
Understood?

362
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:18,860
Understood, Chief.

363
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,000
Rest assured.

364
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,160
Chief, I...

365
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,390
I'm clear on it.

366
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,770
Thank you for your hard work.

367
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,470
Chief,

368
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:37,770
you're still here.

369
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,530
I knew you hadn't left yet.

370
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,170
How's it going?

371
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,120
Have you figured it out?

372
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,350
I can't figure it out.

373
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:51,830
Sit down.

374
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,960
Qu Wenzhi was shot three times before he died.

375
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,820
He was sniped by three people

376
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,020
from a long distance.

377
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,950
The Japanese didn't want him to stay alive.

378
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,990
Chief Cheng at Shanghai Station feared he'd cause more trouble if he lived,

379
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,260
so he wanted him dead too.

380
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,060
I guess

381
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,830
the third bullet

382
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,650
was from the assassin

383
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,710
sent by our Changsha Station, right?

384
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,630
I only found out afterward that Deputy Chief Zhu

385
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,950
had sent someone to Shanghai to eliminate the traitor.

386
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,280
I can't blame him for his good intentions.

387
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,430
And then?

388
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:25,070
This hero, who risked his life to eliminate the traitor,

389
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,730
was also silenced by Li Liang afterward, right?

390
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:31,710
You're here.

391
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,310
Does the Deputy Chief have any instructions?

392
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,310
No instructions.

393
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:58,370
Once, when I had some free time, I went to the dock to see the sights.

394
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,590
I happened to come across a group of students sketching.

395
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,790
I noticed something very interesting.

396
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,280
A person with a smile on their face,

397
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,320
even if dressed in rags,

398
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,710
the picture he draws has light in it.

399
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,910
A person with a worried face—

400
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,550
even if he's dressed in the finest clothes—

401
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,840
the picture he draws is still dark.

402
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,710
There are many people in this world

403
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,910
who can find colors that suit them.

404
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,230
But for people like us,

405
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,450
I really don't know which color suits us.

406
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,790
Our work is dark and gloomy.

407
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,720
It's not righteous,

408
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,810
and being unrighteous means it's ugly and evil.

409
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,420
To save lives,

410
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,520
we can wield the butcher's knife countless times.

411
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,360
For a piece of intelligence...

412
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,630
we can even deceive

413
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,120
those closest to us.

414
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,270
Our conscience and moral bottom line

415
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,250
are constantly being tested.

416
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,650
But this is our job.

417
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:03,110
This is what an agent should do.

418
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,660
I've always believed

419
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,130
that our attitude toward the weak

420
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,270
represents the bottom line of this era.

421
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,350
Once we cross that line,

422
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,960
all our beliefs become mere fantasies,

423
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,710
not worth following.

424
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:16,020
Don't let anyone else hear those words.

425
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,750
It's dangerous.

426
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:18,750
I can't do it.

427
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,340
I followed you back then

428
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,900
because I owed you a debt of gratitude.

429
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,800
I chose this path

430
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,660
because I believed it was a path to save our country.

431
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,540
But now, as I go down this path,

432
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,110
I find it filled with more and more

433
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,440
innocent killings and despicable plots.

434
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,390
Do you know what the Director said to me

435
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,130
on the day he issued my appointment?

436
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:47,880
He said, "Jingping,

437
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,600
what I admire most about you

438
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:50,910
is that you're ruthless enough.

439
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,150
Not just to others,

440
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,170
but even more so to yourself."

441
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,340
At this moment, you should selflessly

442
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,070
throw yourself into your work.

443
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,950
How to be selfless?

444
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,230
It's to make yourself absolutely ruthless and cold-hearted.

445
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,690
Don't harbor any illusions about anything.

446
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,040
It's not that you can't do it.

447
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,420
You're just too weak.

448
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,110
Hongqi, still awake at this hour?

449
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:41,910
Let's talk in my room.

450
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,040
Don't wake Grandma.

451
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:57,090
What did I tell you yesterday?

452
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,400
This isn't about having a backbone.

453
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,690
I must join the NBIS.

454
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,950
"Must?"

455
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:07,940
You're telling me that you "must?"

456
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,470
Take that word "must"

457
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,640
and swallow it back down.

458
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,100
Don't you know what kind of place the NBIS is?

459
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,280
Not to mention the daily gunfire.

460
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,070
Just those dirty, messy things that go on;

461
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,750
you're not unaware of them, are you?

462
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,610
It's either eat or be eaten there.

463
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,050
Do you have a death wish?

464
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,950
Since I've chosen this line of work,

465
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,260
I'm prepared to give my life at any moment.

466
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,020
Shut up!

467
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,360
I hate hearing you say these things the most.

468
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,010
Shen,

469
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,530
all of these things you're doing...

470
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:41,040
Yes,

471
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,100
it's because Dad asked you to.

472
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:42,660
But...

473
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,840
Now Dad is gone.

474
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:48,270
No one can consider these things for you anymore.

475
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,800
I really want to help you,

476
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,080
but I'm willing yet unable.

477
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:55,030
Sometimes, I even end up making things worse for you.

478
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,960
You're really too green.

479
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,440
You're not their match.

480
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,860
Just think about what happened right now.

481
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:05,990
You've just agreed to cooperate with Wen Yeming.

482
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,220
She turned around

483
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,030
and sent assassins to wait outside Mi Lan's house

484
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:09,730
for us.

485
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,950
The matter with Huang

486
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,030
was clearly a trap,

487
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,400
just waiting for you to fall into it.

488
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,270
Grandma was almost kidnapped by Bai Qingkui.

489
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:19,790
And that NBIS,

490
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,630
how did they manage to

491
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,240
rescue Grandma so timely?

492
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,100
Isn't that a coincidence?

493
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,870
Aren't you the one who least believes in coincidences?

494
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:28,670
I think

495
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,740
the NBIS and Bai Qingkui

496
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,600
were working together on this.

497
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,640
NBIS' way of doing things,

498
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,710
to put it nicely,

499
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,770
is just despicable!

500
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,430
Okay,

501
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,200
I believe you.

502
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:49,670
You can stay clean even in a dirty environment.

503
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,420
But can you guarantee

504
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,060
that no one is plotting against you behind your back?

505
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,390
You do have some skills.

506
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:58,510
You might be able to take on ten men at once.

507
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,700
Even if you're made of iron,

508
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,670
how many hits can you withstand?

509
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,160
Can you take down everyone

510
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,770
who's scheming against you?

511
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,610
Can you?

512
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,070
Hongqi, don't worry.

513
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,030
I can manage.

514
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,910
Did what I just said fall on deaf ears?

515
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:19,580
Fine.

516
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,070
What about Uncle Yang?

517
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,870
Does Uncle Yang know about this?

518
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,390
This is my own decision.

519
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,910
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

520
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:27,480
Hongqi,

521
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:30,110
please, don't tell anyone about me

522
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:30,970
and Uncle Yang.

523
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,610
Also, you must remember,

524
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,180
you must forget about

525
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,360
our meeting with Uncle Yang

526
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,400
at Lushan Temple.

527
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:37,710
My mind is made up,

528
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,190
and I won't change it.

529
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,430
Who?

530
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:02,570
Me.

531
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:17,990
Chief,

532
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:19,780
how did you know about this place?

533
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,710
No one knows about this safe house.

534
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,710
As long as I want, there's nothing I don't know.

535
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,210
Is this the target of your investigation?

536
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,530
Li Liang was certainly not innocent.

537
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,990
However, not everything he said

538
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,020
was a lie.

539
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,000
You want to investigate Deputy Chief Zhu,

540
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,230
but do you have any evidence?

541
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:46,820
No.

542
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:47,990
Then do you know

543
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,350
about the relationship between Deputy Chief Zhu and the Commander?

544
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:50,800
I do.

545
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,790
And you're still going to investigate him?

546
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,360
Yes.

547
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,750
And if I forbid it?

548
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,130
I'm not used to saying things I don't mean.

549
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,240
So, I can't answer

550
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,430
your question.

551
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:01,510
So, in other words,

552
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,990
as long as it's someone you want to investigate,

553
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,990
no matter who they are,

554
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,520
what background they have,

555
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,430
or what kind of pressure someone puts on you,

556
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,430
nothing can stop you, is that right?

557
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,140
Yes.

558
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:15,230
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.

559
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:18,670
This matter is strictly

560
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:20,190
between the two of us.

561
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,540
Without my permission,

562
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,600
you cannot share information with anyone else.

563
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,810
Can you do that?

564
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:25,870
No problem.

565
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,870
Do you have any leads?

566
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,350
First, we need to confirm

567
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,390
the relationship between the Deputy Chief and Li Liang.

568
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:34,190
I mean,

569
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,850
their real relationship.

570
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:39,070
I've spoken with Chief Cheng at the Shanghai Station.

571
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,310
If he has any news,

572
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:42,060
he'll let me know immediately.

573
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,150
And, on the day that Wen Yeming and Li Liang

574
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,020
went to Shanghai,

575
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,190
Deputy Chief Zhu requested

576
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,400
a large sum of funds from the station.

577
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,310
I've already spoken with the General Affairs Department about it.

578
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,170
You can go ahead and investigate.

579
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,350
Thank you, Chief.

580
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,360
You're welcome.

581
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,230
But I want to tell you

582
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,470
that you need to act quickly.

583
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,790
If it really is him,

584
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,980
he won't give us much time.

Zhang Fei.

Do you like his bravery and righteousness,

592
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,770
or his violence and ingratitude?

593
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,900
A roar at the head of the Dangyang Bridge;

594
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,830
the shout breaks the bridge, making the water flow backward.

598
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,960
Chief,

599
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,590
I didn't do any of this.

600
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,630
It was the Deputy Chief!

601
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,390
He told me to take these photos!

602
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,270
This mole

603
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,130
must be someone very meticulous.

Li Liang

605
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:22,920
didn't seem likely.

606
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,110
Someone has checked these photos.

607
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:10,070

608
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,590

What's up?

631
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,830
You called me here so urgently.

632
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,389
You have any news about the thing I asked you

633

to find out, haven't you?

634
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:54,710
Li Miaohan has several places that she frequently visits.

635
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:57,000
I asked several of the guys working over there

636
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,440
about whom she went with,

637
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,760
how long she stayed,

638
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,830
and whether they exchanged anything.

639
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,120
I've written it all down here.

640
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,560
That's quite detailed.

641
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,030
Well done, Gangzi.

00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:06,630
-Thanks for your hard work.
-No problem.

643

00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,770

-Really?
-Yeah.

00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,910

649
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,910

00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,550

665
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:52,510
I have something to do.

666
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,570
I'll be going then.

667
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,260
Aren't you going to have breakfast?

668
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:56,900

672
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,730
Yes.

673
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,590
You do, huh?

674
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:15,710
Which one do you like?

675
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:16,790
I like this one.

676
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,470
I like this one too.

677
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:20,800
The little bird. Which one is an elephant?

678
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,200
This one is an elephant.

679
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,150
How do you know this is an elephant?

680
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:26,710

681
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:27,790

682
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:28,370
Yanzi,

683
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,040
look what I brought for you.

684
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,030
It's fried dough sticks.

685
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:31,990
Take them and share.

686
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,070
One for each of you.

687
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,350
Go ahead.

688
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,470
Have fun, kids.

689
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,120
Okay.

690
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,670
I want one.

691
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:44,910
I want one too.

692
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,510
Me too.

693
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,690
What are you doing here?

694
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:51,770
You're following me.

695
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:55,230
Haven't you ever followed me?

696
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,270
You not only followed me but also monitored my family.

697
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:00,130
Let's call it even on this matter.

698
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,310
I did that because...

699
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:03,710
Bringing up old scores is a petty woman's behavior.

700
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:04,510
Are you one?

701
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,420
No, you're not.

702
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,120
You are a true heroine with the spirit of a warrior.

703
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,370
Bringing up old scores is beneath you.

704
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,240
How did you find this place?

705
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,590
I'm warning you.

706
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:17,880
I won't allow anyone to use the children as leverage.

707
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:22,360
I wouldn't stoop to such despicable actions.

708
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:27,550
Last time, you covered my car with all those gaudy stickers.

709
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,030
I guessed those advertising stickers

710
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,630
were meant for the children.

711
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,110
You plastered my car with those stickers.

712
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,710
What will you give them then?

713
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,690
I'm here to bring some stickers for you.

714
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:39,960
Thanks.

715
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:40,910
You're welcome.

716
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:43,110
Colleagues are like family, after all.

717
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,590
You have something on your mind.

718
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,570
Did your family support you

719
00:37:58,570 --> 00:37:59,850
joining the NBIS?

720
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,590
They don't know.

721
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,000
They don't know?

722
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,680
So you're keeping it from them?

723
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,230
They're all gone.

724
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:13,370
So the question doesn't stand for me.

725
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:15,910
I'm sorry.

726
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,530
I didn't know about it.

727
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,130
It doesn't matter.

728
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,830
I'm not the only orphan in the world.

729
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:24,020
It's not shameful to bring that up.

730
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,280
There's no shame in losing your parents.

731
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,950
What's truly shameful is choosing the wrong path

732
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:33,030
and bringing disgrace to your parents.

733
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,490
You are truly exceptional

734
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,410
and kind-hearted as well.

735
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,210
If your parents knew,

736
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,420
they would certainly be proud of you.

737
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,970
Your family doesn't agree...

738
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,370
It's your big brother?

739
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,830
How did you guess that?

740
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,550
Normal people would think

741
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,840
it's my grandma who disagrees.

742
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:10,150
Although I haven't had much interaction with your grandmother,

743
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,510
I can tell

744
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,190
that she is open-minded

745
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,050
and has a strong sense of justice.

746
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:17,130
As long as the path you're on is right,

747
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,470
she won't stop you.

748
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:20,830
But your brother,

749
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,390
he's too impulsive

750
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:25,030
and doesn't think things through thoroughly.

751
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,960
Moreover, your joining the NBIS

752
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,960
was indirectly facilitated by him,

753
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,550
so he must be feeling uneasy about it.

754
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,350
It would be strange if he agreed.

755
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,860
But you don't need to take it too hard.

756
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,600
Your brother's opposition

757
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,240
isn't mainly about you.

758
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:41,960
It's because he hasn't come to terms with it himself.

759
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:56,070
The mole is already dead.

760
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,320
Can you hand over the codebook now?

761
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:06,600
You believe that Li Liang was the mole?

762
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:07,810
He was caught red-handed.

763
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:08,870
Why wouldn't he be?

764
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,990
And the evidence is conclusive.

765
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:12,470
Everything adds up.

766
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,610
Li Liang was definitely suspicious.

767
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,910
Although he was not clean,

768
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,310
he's not the one we're looking for.

769
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,350
Chief, please take a look.

770
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:24,030
This signal

771
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:26,270
appeared at 1:38 AM this morning.

772
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,220
Is there anything unusual about it?

773
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,460
There's nothing unusual.

774
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,800
It hasn't appeared before.

775
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,060
This is the first time.

776
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,390
Based on this signal,

777
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,270
I've marked out a general area.

778
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,680
Within this area,

779
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,450
there's a location that makes me very uneasy.

780
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,370
Take a look at this location.

781
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:41,730
[Linli Training Base]

782
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,340
Strengthen the surveillance.

783
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,260
Report to me immediately if anything happens.

784
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,790
Yes, sir.

785
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:58,820
Do you know?

786
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,280
I'm not the only one who has suspicions about this matter.

787
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,520
I came to the archives room at night

788
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:10,610
and found that someone had tampered with the files of the Li Liang case.

789
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,620
Someone has checked these photos.

790
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:37,420
Clearly, there are still many suspicious aspects to this case.

791
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,960
So there are still many people

792
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,360
interested in this case.

793
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,950
You can report your doubts to the Chief.

794
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:44,880
There's no need.

795
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,510
What I mean is,

796
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:50,950
the Chief will certainly have a clearer perspective than we do.

797
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:51,750
If my analysis of this case

798
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,470
is very accurate,

799
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:56,310
then this mole must be more sophisticated than Li Liang

800
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:57,640
and harder to deal with.

801
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:59,900
So the Chief will surely come up with a more comprehensive

802
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,180
and safer plan.

803
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:03,110
If we report it hastily,

804
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,590
it might interfere with the Chief's plan,

805
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:05,750
which wouldn't be good.

806
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:08,010
Don't you think my analysis makes sense?

807
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:12,600
Stop wearing that stern face all the time.

808
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:16,150
Yun Hongshen didn't tell Wen Yeming

809
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,830
all of his suspicions.

810
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:21,220
He feels that the person behind Li Liang is Kunwu.

811
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,310
And Kunwu pushing Li Liang  forward at this point

812
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:26,240
clearly had deeper implications.

813
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,440
He wants to use Li Liang

814
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,350
to end the internal vigilance against the mole within NBIS.

815
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:31,610
Once the mole is dealt with,

816
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:33,390
the organization will feel secure internally.

817
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:35,420
Then, Yun Hongshen handing over the codebook

818
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,420
would be a natural course of action.

819
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,900
His real target

820
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,130
is the codebook.

821
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,150
How is it, Young Master?

822
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:43,270
Detailed, right?

823
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,540
Our Rat may be illiterate,

824
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,750
but he has sharp eyes

825
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:47,630
and a good memory.

826
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,270
As soon as the news of Qu Wenzhi's defection

827
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:50,950
was published in the newspaper,

828
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:52,920
Rat recognized him immediately.

829
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,200
He had seen with his own eyes

830
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,330
that Qu Wenzhi had spent the night at Li Miaohan's house.

831
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,160
That's right.

832
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:03,390
She really has no sense of self-respect.
