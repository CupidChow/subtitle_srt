4
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,390
This is the cipher key.

5
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,720
There should also be a codebook.

6
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,479
I sent Kawashima back to that small inn again.

7
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,479
All of Myna's belongings are gone.

8
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,710
The innkeeper said

9
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:52,890
that the things were taken by two young people.

10
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,170
It must be Yun Hongshen and Yun Hongqi.

11
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,190
Hongqi,

12
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,470
after I leave,

13
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,860
you'll take care of the family.

14
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,160
Dad, I'm still worried.

15
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,350
I'm afraid I can't do it.

16
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,810
The Yun family in my hands...

17
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:47,490
Hongqi,

18
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,430
you're overthinking it.

19
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,590
A family's prestige

20
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,660
isn't built by business operations alone.

21
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,230
It relies on its family values

22
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,390
and its legacy.

23
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,880
Keep your heart pure,

24
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,790
and your conduct righteous.

25
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,060
You are a descendant of the Yun family

26
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,140
and my son.

27
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,230
I believe you will do well.

28
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,350
Dad.

29
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,190
I can definitely do it.

30
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,310
I'm sure I can.

31
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,470
You can't sleep either, huh?

32
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:49,750
You too?

33
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,400
I'm thinking about something.

34
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,340
Actually,

35
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,150
I was thinking...

36
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,680
how about tomorrow,

37
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,000
we go fishing?

38
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,680
Hongqi,

39
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,550
let's talk outside.

40
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,080
Alright.

41
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,170
First thing tomorrow morning, I'll call the newspaper.

42
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,320
I'll tell them I'm a witness to the murder

43
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,490
at the Good Time Cafe

44
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,870
and want to provide them with a tip.

45
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,730
You're trying to lure the murderer out, aren't you?

46
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,350
What does this murderer

47
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,650
have to do with Dad?

48
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,550
I suspect the murderer who plotted to kill Dad

49
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,480
must be a Japanese spy

50
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,170
who has been hiding in Changsha.

51
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,770
The murderer who killed Myna

52
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,730
should also be Japanese.

53
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,570
I see.

54
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,270
This murderer and this spy

55
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,710
are likely connected.

56
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,110
If we find this murderer,

57
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,310
we can trace it back to the person who killed Dad.

58
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,110
Is that right?

59
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,270
That's correct.

60
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,030
Then your tip needs to be accurate

61
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,670
to lure the murderer out.

62
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,390
Making things up won't work.

63
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,320
The murderers should be two men.

64
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,630
From the patterns and texture of the shoe soles

65
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,830
and the smell of Punch cigarss throughout the room,

66
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,560
I can pretty much conclude that

67
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,710
one was well-dressed,

68
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,170
and the other might have been his attendant.

69
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,200
They came in through the back door.

70
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,790
This also indicates that

71
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,540
the murderer might be a person of some renown.

72
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,950
Therefore, he wouldn't risk

73
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,830
being recognized by others.

74
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,200
I've practically watched you grow up.

75
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,930
I've seen you play chess with many people.

76
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,470
But I've never seen you like this before,

77
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,240
struggling so much to make a move.

78
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,909
This move

79
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,350
is to venture deep into rival territory alone.

80
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,010
I fear there may be no way back,

81
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,110
so I don't dare to make the decision.

82
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,110
When your Uncle Yun was alive,

83
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,450
do you know why he was determined to establish a school?

84
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,950
He always had a lifelong wish:

85
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,100
to keep the sound of learning alive,

86
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,230
and to pass on knowledge from generation to generation.

87
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,170
Shen grew up listening to these teachings.

88
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,740
In his heart,

89
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,750
there is a spirit of inheritance.

90
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,310
And Shen's chess playing

91
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,190
was also taught by Muzhi.

92
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,600
Although his chess skills are not as good as Muzhi's,

93
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,600
he has the determination

94
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,590
to play this game well.

95
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,310
I believe

96
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,710
he will pass down his grandfather's teachings

97
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,909
and the chess skills taught by Muzhi.

98
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,630
He has this aspiration,

99
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,510
and I'm truly gratified.

100
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,330
As a descendant of the Yun family,

101
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,860
this is also what he should do.

102
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,130
Hello.

103
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,070
I'm

104
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,930
a witness to the murder at Good Time Cafe yesterday.

105
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,320
Did you see clearly?

106
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,470
What?

107
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,120
There were two killers?

108
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,950
We will certainly compensate you for your help.

109
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,750
Alright,

110
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,900
let's meet and talk.

111
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,150
There's a witness for the cafe case?

112
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,150
Yes,

113
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,870
he asked to meet me at Hongyun Tea House.

114
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,950
Congratulations!

115
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,430
This bizarre murder case has caused quite a stir.

116
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,710
If you can get an exclusive,

117
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,970
you'll become the star of our newspaper.

118
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,280
I hope your words bring me luck.

119
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,300
There shouldn't be any witnesses.

120
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,960
We deliberately parked the car at the bar on the next street

121
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,280
and walked to the cafe.

122
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,390
After reaching the back door,

123
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,080
I repeatedly observed

124
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,460
that no one noticed us.

125
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,330
There shouldn't be any,

126
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,710
but that doesn't mean there really weren't any.

127
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,630
At least he's right about two people.

128
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,110
Go and take care of this.

129
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,280
Don't leave any evidence behind.

130
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,350
Yes.

[Hongyun Tea House]

132
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,530
We sit here with so many people passing by.

133
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,660
It's quite inconvenient to do things.

134
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,950
Look.

135
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,340
Here we sit.

136
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,340
What's behind us

137
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,900
are residential buildings

138
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,360
which have all been burned down now.

139
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,790
No one can hide here.

140
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,730
The murderer couldn't be hiding here either.

141
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,790
Look over there.

142
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,990
Where?

143
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,160
Hongqi, don't move.

144
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,500
Use your eyes to look.

145
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,030
How can I look without moving?

146
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:44,800
Hongqi.

147
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,200
Hongqi.

148
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,730
If they don't go around,

149
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,860
no one can hide here.

150
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,110
The murderer can't hide here.

151
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,830
I've already checked before we came in.

152
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,120
If the murderer wants to choose the best position,

153
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,180
it can only be that corner of the roof.

154
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,000
But that corner of the roof

155
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,590
is blocked by a plant in front.

156
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,220
So this position is a sniper's blind spot.

157
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,540
It's safest for us to sit here.

158
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:29,990
What if the murderer

159
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,210
doesn't want to snipe us from a distance?

160
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,520
What it he disguises as an ordinary person

161
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,510
and sneaks into the tea house

162
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,990
or waits for us somewhere

163
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,650
near the tea house,

164
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,480
trying to take us at close range?

165
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,010
Impossible.

166
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,630
We called at 7:30.

167
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,790
The meeting with the reporter is at 8:30.

168
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,760
The murderer only has an hour.

169
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,950
When he got the news,

170
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,030
he had to get here as soon as he can.

171
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,670
After he arrived,

172
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,520
he needed to observe everything here immediately.

173
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,640
He didn't have time to make a thorough

174
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,410
close-range shot plan without being exposed.

175
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,030
His only plan is remote sniping.

176
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,820
What if

177
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,090
he waits for us to leave

178
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,130
and then snipes us from a distance?

179
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,150
Once we're out,

180
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,550
there won't be any blind spots anymore.

181
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,140
Hongqi,

182
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,240
that's a safe option,

183
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,980
but the problem is he doesn't know us.

184
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,380
He can't see the entire second floor from the roof.

185
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,190
If he wants to know everything, he'll have to enter the teahouse.

186
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,640
If he enters the teahouse,

187
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,840
there won't be any long-range sniping.

188
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,510
The place we're sitting

189
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,110
is the closest to the stairs.

190
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,010
Once there are people coming up,

191
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,090
we can see everyone clearly.

192
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,710
But the murderer won't come up here.

193
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,780
He just needs to stand in that position and look up,

194
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,220
and he can see the general location of us.

195
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,280
So,

196
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,790
this is an essential skill for a professional killer.

197
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,480
The two of us,

198
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,800
dressed up sneakily.

199
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,240
Even a ghost would know

200
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,840
we're not here to drink tea.

201
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,580
I see.

202
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,970
So this murderer's

203
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,540
purpose for entering the teahouse

204
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,020
is to identify the target,

205
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,500
then return to the rooftop

206
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,120
to snipe us from a distance.

207
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,360
I won't let him have the chance.

208
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,870
As soon as he comes upstairs, we'll run out.

209
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,210
When he's trying to lock onto the target,

210
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,000
we'll take him out.

211
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,040
But you don't know what he looks like.

212
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,080
How can you be sure who the killer is?

213
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,480
He'll arrive here

214
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,230
no later than 8:25.

215
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,390
He should be

216
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,810
a man under 35 years old,

217
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,800
with a solitary personality,

218
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,360
who's received professional training,

219
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,420
and travels light.

220
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,640
Don't worry,

221
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,690
A killer has a killer vibe.

222
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,650
As soon as he appears,

223
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,360
I'll be able to recognize him.

224
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,660
Shen!

225
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,520
How are you?

226
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:06,590
Hongqi,

227
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,520
I'm really fine.

228
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,140
Today is the seventh day since Dad's passing.

[Ancient Lushan Temple]

230
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:02,990
Dad.

231
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,740
Your son

232
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,230
is here to see you.

Bow.

234
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:07,730
Dad,

235
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,880
why do you sometimes

236
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,810
place sunflowers in front of this tombstone,

237
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,590
and other times chrysanthemums?

238
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,320
Is there any meaning behind it?

239
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,250
Chrysanthemums are for the deceased;

240
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,030
they're more sorrowful.

241
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,170
Sunflowers

242
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,410
represent sunshine and hope,

243
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:26,730
just like every

244
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,420
soldier fighting on the battlefield against Japanese invasion.

245
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,470
If one day

246
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,280
I'm the one lying here,

247
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,390
don't forget to bring me a bunch of sunflowers.

248
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:38,990
Dad.

249
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,790
Hongshen.

250
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,150
Since you've returned to Changsha,

251
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:51,950
from now on,

252
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,730
I'll look after you on behalf of your father.

[Hall of Kshitigarbha]

254
00:16:59,150 --> 00:16:59,950
Muzhi,

255
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,640
only when saying goodbye to a true comrade-in-arms

256
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,520
do we place a bunch of sunflowers on their gravestone.

257
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,680
Always cherishing hope and light

258
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,950
is our shared wish.

259
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:13,970
My father once said

260
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,780
that you two had a bond forged in life and death.

261
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:21,430
So you were truly comrades-in-arms.

262
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:24,700
Being able to fight side by side with Muzhi

263
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:27,190
is the greatest joy of my life.

264
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,860
It's just a pity

265
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,810
that he left us too soon.

266
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,320
It's all my fault.

267
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,320
My father died because of me.

268
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,410
Your father...

269
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,210
was a true warrior.

270
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:52,890
Uncle Yang.

271
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:53,600
Hongshen,

272
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,210
you can feel guilty,

273
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,640
but you can't let your guilt crush yourself.

274
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,080
Understand?

275
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,290
I understand.

276
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:04,810
Uncle Yang,

277
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,680
I want to join you.

278
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,910
I want to become your comrade.

279
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:12,890
My father also said

280
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,650
when the time is right,

281
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,200
he would let me truly join you.

282
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:20,880
This was his wish,

283
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,960
and it's my wish too.

284
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,370
Muzhi,

285
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,410
Hongsheng will eventually walk on this right path.

286
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,650
If you knew this in the afterlife,

287
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,110
you would feel comforted.

288
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,650
Rest assured.

289
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,810
I will guide him along this path.

290
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,410
If they're done talking, they'll naturally come out.

291
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,850
Isn't it better if we wait here patiently?

292
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:04,840
Alright.

293
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:06,610
Tell me

294
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,110
what exactly happened in Shanghai.

295
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,000
How did your father actually die?

296
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,610
It seems Cheng Huize was right.

297
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,730
The most lethal shot that hit your father

298
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,990
was probably not fired by Wen Yeming.

299
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:36,760
But Uncle Yang,

300
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:40,220
even if she wasn't the one who pulled the trigger,

301
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,780
the people behind it must be connected to her.

302
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,730
Since this whole Myna thing started until now,

303
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,460
she has always been in the game.

304
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,860
I can't be sure if she's a friend or foe.

305
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,830
She might be just like you,

306
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,650
unable to determine

307
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,580
what kind of person you really are.

308
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,410
Hongshen,

309
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,050
sometimes,

310
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,500
what you see may not be true.

311
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,320
Some things are more than that.

312
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,650
In front of the overall situation,

313
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,310
we should put aside our prejudice

314
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,850
and unite everyone we can unite.

315
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,410
Are you saying

316
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,340
I should unite with Wen Yeming?

317
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,680
But could she trust me?

318
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,760
Some people

319
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,540
may have just taken the wrong path.

320
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:23,740
From what I know,

321
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,860
Wen Yeming is actually

322
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,010
a person with principles

323
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:30,890
and boundaries.

324
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,810
She has her soft side.

325
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,780
She doesn't like killing.

326
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,490
If you don't believe me,

327
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,290
or if you have any doubts,

328
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,340
go to a place and see for yourself.

329
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,410
Old Madam.

330
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,440
Shen and Hongqi haven't called yet?

331
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:55,820
Not yet.

332
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,220
It seems they don't dare to call.

333
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,580
Old Madam,

334
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,630
would you like some chrysanthemum tea?

335
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,270
Look,

336
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,170
you've got blisters on your lips.

337
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,280
Put it here.

338
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,000
I'll go back to work then.

339
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,630
Call me if you need anything.

340
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,210
Muzhi,

341
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,220
I can see it.

342
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:24,260
Shen has followed the same path as you.

343
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,300
Now Hongqi has been dragged into it as well.

344
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,260
These old bones of mine can't be of much help to them.

345
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:33,770
Master.

346
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,240
If you have a spirit in heaven,

347
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,710
please bless them and keep them safe.

348
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,980
Uncle Yang,

349
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,430
you're done talking?

350
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:47,420
Let's go.

351
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:49,330
Shen.

352
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:52,610
Uncle Yang.

353
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,530
Uncle Yang,

354
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,050
could you tell me

355
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,710
what kind of people you and my father really are?

356
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,510
Chinese.

357
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,980
That's all you need to remember.

358
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,610
Alright, Uncle Yang,

359
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,440
I won't ask any more questions.

360
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,870
I have only one request.

361
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:21,850
If someone has to

362
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,120
sacrifice his life,

363
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,020
I hope that person is me.

364
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:35,380
I'm sorry, Uncle Yang,

365
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,460
I spoke out of turn.

366
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,410
Qi,

367
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,020
your father made the decision

368
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,800
for a reason.

369
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,030
You should trust him.

370
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:44,930
You and Shen,

371
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,870
each have your own missions.

372
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,670
What Shen is doing now

373
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,210
is not something you're good at,

374
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,020
nor is it something you can help with

375
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,410
even if you want to.

376
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,570
Being a good Young Master of the Yun family

377
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,000
is the best way you can help him.

378
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,060
Do you understand?

379
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:07,960
Alright.

380
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,840
I will make sure the Yun family

381
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,080
becomes Shen's strongest support.

382
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,390
That's right.

383
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:16,690
Let's go.

384
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:28,050
Even if your descendants are not bright,

385
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,230
scriptures must still be read with might.

386
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,620
-Live a life that's simple and true.
-Shen.

387
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,670
Why did you bring me here?

388
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:44,970
Waiting for someone.

389
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,250
Waiting for someone?

390
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:47,980
Who are we waiting for?

391
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:51,860
Do not drink excessively.

392
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,000
Shen,

393
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,430
you saw it, didn't you?

394
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:46,610
Kid.

395
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,000
How old are you, kid?

396
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,980
Twe... twelve.

397
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,160
I see you're holding a book.

398
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,760
You like reading, don't you?

399
00:24:58,810 --> 00:24:59,610
Good.

400
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,370
Here.

401
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,550
Take this money.

402
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,770
Go buy yourself something to eat.

403
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,430
Did you see?

404
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,970
This is the hope of a nation.

405
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,940
It's not scary to be in a desperate situation.

406
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,420
As long as we have hope,

407
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,630
we have a chance to strike back.

408
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,540
But Shen,

409
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,010
saving the country is not just a slogan.

410
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:24,960
We must hold

411
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,380
the determination and courage

412
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,710
his determination and courage to regret.

413
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,090
So,

414
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,740
no matter what difficulties you face,

415
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,140
don't give up.

416
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,100
Remember?

417
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,610
I'm talking to you, Shen.

418
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,300
What were you thinking?

419
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,590
Hongqi,

420
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:44,900
look.

421
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:52,980
A scene of ruins.

422
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,000
A group of children.

423
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,920
There doesn't seem to be anything unusual.

424
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,000
There's nothing unusual.

425
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,760
Just a scene of ruins

426
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,590
and a group of children

427
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,380
who can still read with their backs straight

428
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:10,690
even in such miserable circumstances.

429
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:17,760
I know why you brought me here.

430
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,850
I'll build another primary school here later.

431
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,140
You're acting strange today.

432
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,760
What do you mean?

433
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,730
What do you think

434
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,630
of someone who teaches

435
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,880
these children to read

436
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,980
and takes care of them?

437
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,080
Kind.

438
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:37,390
Loving.

439
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,320
Visionary.

440
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,330
So, such a person

441
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,980
shouldn't be a bad person, right?

442
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,260
Who exactly are you talking about?

443
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:56,150
[Changsha Station]

444
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,450
Li's rice noodles.

445
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:56,200
Come and have a try.

446
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,200
The best rice noodles.

447
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,980
Li's rice noodles.

448
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:04,490
The best Li's rice noodles in Changsha.

449
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:18,250
Even if your descendants are not bright,

450
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:22,300
scriptures must still be read with might.

451
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:26,710
Live a life that's simple and true.

452
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:31,520
Teach your children with values that do.

453
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,030
Do not be greedy.

454
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,000
Wen Yeming?

455
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,250
Look what I've brought for you.

456
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,170
Did you miss me?

457
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:45,590
I know you're hungry.

458
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,090
Here.

459
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,040
One for each of you.

460
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,370
Everyone gets one.

461
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:49,220
All of you.

462
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,300
Is she the one you asked me to wait for?

463
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,370
Uncle Yang said,

464
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,810
she brings food every time she comes,

465
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,050
taking care of these children

466
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,990
and even teaching them to read.

467
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,180
I think she's just putting on a show for others.

468
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:06,770
She avoids people every time she comes,

469
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,990
coming and going quietly.

470
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,490
She's real to these kids.

471
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,610
How are you?

472
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,650
It doesn't seem like she's acting.

473
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:15,440
So what?

474
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:16,920
I think

475
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:19,530
there must be

476
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,720
a sad place in her heart too.

477
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,670
She isn't putting on an act for others.

478
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,930
She's not a bad person.

479
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:29,420
She's not the direct killer of Dad either.

480
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,610
That's possible.

481
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:36,440
She probably

482
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,400
fell into someone else's trap.

483
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:43,160
Shen,

484
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,980
do you realize what you're talking about?

485
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:47,250
What you're saying now

486
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,850
means your previous deductions don't hold up.

487
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:51,450
So,

488
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,880
if you follow her lead,

489
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,640
you won't find the answers you're looking for.

490
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:57,580
Hongqi,

491
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,050
I have the codebook.

492
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,130
As soon as that person appears,

493
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,390
I'll definitely know.

494
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,600
Because he has the cipher key.

495
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,480
The what?

496
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:08,790
The cipher key.

497
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,940
It's the key to the codebook.

498
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,170
These are different types of ciphers.

499
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:30,460
They appear to be very complex

500
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,050
and difficult to crack.

501
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,630
In fact, they all have internal patterns.

502
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,360
Once you grasp these patterns,

503
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,970
breaking them isn't that difficult.

504
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,770
There's another type of cipher.

505
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:40,610
For example,

506
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,690
for example I have a book in my hand.

507
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,550
I'll give you a set of numbers now.

508
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:52,620
10, 12, 08.

509
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,410
Try to figure it out.

510
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:02,890
Page 10,

511
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,610
line 12,

512
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,900
the 8th character.

513
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,570
Clever.

514
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,950
That's the cipher key to decoding this cipher.

515
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:14,480
The prerequisite is that you must know which book it is,

516
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,550
and which edition.

517
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,180
This cipher is simple,

518
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:21,090
but it's unbreakable.

519
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,260
I see.

520
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,580
So we must have both

521
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,110
the codebook and the cipher key

522
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:32,040
to decipher Myna's intelligence.

523
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,460
That's right.

524
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,470
We have the codebook now.

525
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,130
It's like a bomb.

526
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,450
And we don't have any help now.

527
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,740
So we may become

528
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:43,620
the Japanese's target.

529
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:46,470
Uncle Yang suggested us to cooperate with the NBIS,

530
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,640
which means

531
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,370
to cooperate with Wen Yeming.

532
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:50,400
Uncle Yang?

533
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,690
Uncle Yang wants us

534
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:55,690
to cooperate with a shady organization like the NBIS?

535
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,550
How are we supposed to cooperate?

536
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,740
Call Wen Yeming

537
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,280
and tell her you want to turn yourself in

538
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,560
to gain her trust?

539
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:04,690
Hongqi,

540
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,850
let's test the waters first.

541
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:07,780
It's dangerous.

542
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,520
Hongqi,

543
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,320
I need to ask your friend Huang for a favor.

544
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,230
I need a phone number.

545

[Operation Team Leader's Office]

546
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:41,730
Hello?

547
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,000
This is Yun Hongshen.

548
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,730
You're quite bold, aren't you?

549
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:46,850
I'm not your enemy.

550
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:48,720
Also,

551
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,840
I'm not the murderer who killed Myna.

552
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,640
But I have leads on the murderer.

553
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,630
I can work with you to find out.

554
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,250
But on one condition:

555
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,610
you must call off the manhunt for me

556
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:59,410
and all surveillance on my home.

557
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:00,900
I don't believe you.

558
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,100
And I don't intend to work with you.

559
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,600
Believe me, this won't do you any harm.

Once you meet my demands,

561
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,100

Come and have rice noodles.

Delicious rice noodles.

00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,340
Li's rice noodles.

566
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,930
At the intersection of Deyang Road and Chengyin Road,

567
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,590
there is a landmark building.

568
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,540
The clock on the building

569
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,820
chimes on every hour.

570
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,390
The owner of that rice noodle stall

571
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,780
sets up her stall every day at noon

572
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:40,510
and in the evening on Deyang Road and Xiaoxiang Road respectively.

573
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,120
This call from Yun Hongshen

574
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,810
was from somewhere near Deyang Road.

575
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:49,760
Madam,

576
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,330
we've uncovered Myna's true identity.

577
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,860
His real name is Mi Xingwei.

578
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:53,970
He's from Changsha.

579
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,100
What a coincidence,

580
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,730
That nurse from the Military Hospital, Mi Lan,

581
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:57,920
turns out to be his daughter.

582
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,630
What?

583
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:01,250
I've already sent people to watch Mi Lan's house.

584
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,650
Just give it a try.

585
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:03,830
We might get lucky.

586
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,460
No. 17 Deyang Road.

587
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:08,200
It can't be such a coincidence.

588
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,550
Li Xuemin is dead.

589
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,550
The ambulance arrived two minutes late.

590
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,010
Those crucial two minutes

591
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,320
cost Li Xueming her life.

592
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,130
Then why was the ambulance late?

593
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,590
The nurse accompanying the ambulance said

594
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,800
they heard gunshots as they were getting close

595
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,760
and thought the incident happened over there, so they went in that direction,

596
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,090
which caused the delay.

597
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,800
At that time, did you see two young men

598
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,450
who were well-dressed?

599
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:34,540
No.

600
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,790
With so many people on the street,

601
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,460
you said "no" without knowing which young men

602
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,570
I was asking about?

603
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,220
When the ambulance passed by,

604
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,680
I glanced out of the window

605
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,340
and happened to see a man in his forties walk by,

606
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,000
but I didn't see two young men.

607
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,980
This Mi Lan knows Yun Hongshen.

608
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,700
They are likely at Mi Lan's home now.

609
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,170
Hurry!

610
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:53,030
Gather the team and head to Mi Lan's house.

611
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:53,760
All members of Team One,

612
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,320
move out!

613
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:55,930
Mr. Wen.

614
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,700
What's so urgent?

615
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,460
Do you need any help?

616
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,130
No need.

617
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:01,750
Thank you.

618
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,420
Why are you back so late?

619
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,470
Who asked the reporter to meet?

620
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,600
It was Yun Hongshen.

621
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,660
We've fallen into their trap.

622
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:10,850
It seems they've already guessed

623
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,380
that we have the cipher key.

624
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,430
He just wanted to lure you out

625
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,100
to find a way to get the cipher key from you.

626
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,020
They're at No.17 Deyang Road.

627
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:33,100
Onitetsu has repeatedly warned us not to touch Yun Hongshen.

628
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:33,900
And our work

629
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,700
has been riddled with mistakes these days.

630
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,920
Are you going to listen to Onitetsu

631
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,230
or to me?

632
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:46,480
I'll listen to you.

633
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,230
Remember,

634
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,940
kill Yun Hongqi,

635
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,300
capture Yun Hongshen,

636
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,580
and find the codebook.

637
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,130
Yes.

638
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,850
Okay.

639
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:00,850
I understand.

640
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:04,720
Head nurse,

641
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,330
the patients in rooms 201 to 205

642
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:08,850
can all be discharged today.

643
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:11,580
A new batch of wounded will be brought in tonight.

644
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,870
Those on duty today are in for a tough time.

645
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,300
I'll get back to work now.

646
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:18,220
Go ahead.

647
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,740
Mi Lan, what's wrong?

648
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,730
-I…
-What’s wrong?

649
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,340
I probably didn't sleep well last night.

650
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,480
I felt dizzy when I came in this morning.

651
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,470
Why am I palpitating so badly?

652
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,780
You should go get checked out.

653
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:37,180
No need.

654
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,740
I'll probably be fine after resting.

655
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:41,210
Stop working.

656
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,200
Go home now.

657
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,930
But the hospital is so busy today.

658
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,920
Don't worry about it.

659
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,530
Besides, how can you work in this condition?

660
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,530
Go home now.

661
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:51,970
Alright.

662
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,480
Thank you, Head Nurse.

663
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,740
Be careful on the road.

664
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,500
Notify them

665
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,460
to get all the hospital beds ready.

666
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,270
Hurry up.

667
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,720
Sir, it's here.

668
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:45,990
Stop here, please.

669
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:50,750
Thank you.

670
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:51,700
Thank you, miss.

671
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,490
Hello,

672
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,280
I'd like a pot of tea.

673
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:12,870
Okay.

674
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:29,830
Thank you.

675
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,760
Please enjoy.

676
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:37,890
Let me tell you,

677
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,700
I'm your older brother after all.

678
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,830
Although what you said is right,

679
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,360
you should listen to me too.

680
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,290
At least consider it, right?

681
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,610
Sexual harassment!

682
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:17,290
Mi Lan.

683
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:17,960
Help!

684
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,350
It's NBIS's car.

685
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:08,540
Let's go!

686
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:31,320
Hongqi.

687
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,130
I told you so.

688
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,520
The NBIS people aren't reliable.

689
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,390
They can't be trusted.

690
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,450
You still believe in them so much

691
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:38,450
and try to cooperate with them. You—

692
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,220
Miss Mi Lan,

693
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,620
what are you doing here?

694
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:43,910
Shouldn't you be at work at this time?

695
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,600
I did go to work today,

696
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:47,980
but then I felt really unwell.

697
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:51,520
The head nurse told me to come home and rest.

698
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,690
But when I got back to my house,

699
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:54,990
after getting out of the car,

700
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:57,080
I noticed something was wrong.

701
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:58,870
There were a lot of people,

702
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,630
and they seemed to be carrying guns.

703
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,490
There were two groups of people.

704
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:06,360
The ones shooting at us weren't from the NBIS.

705
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,870
You can even tell that?

706
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,290
You might not have noticed.

707
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:11,490
When we were running,

708
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,520
Wen Yeming was fighting with those people.

709
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,000
shooting straight for the vital spots.

710
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,120
She was serious.

711
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,680
Then how did they know we were here?

712
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:23,210
Li's rice noodles.

713
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:25,330
Delicious rice noodles.

714
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,820
I might have accidentally

715
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:31,290
given something away during the phone call.

716
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,110
May also be...

717
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:37,530
What is it?

718
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,850
Myna had his ID with him.

719
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,420
It has his real name on it.

720
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:45,630
It wouldn't be difficult to trace his background.

721
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:55,690
Why are you looking at me?

722
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,690
Who is Myna?

723
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,970
Does he have anything to do with me?

724
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:05,690
Say something.

725
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,970
Why aren't you saying anything?

726
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:09,300
What exactly happened?

727
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:11,330
Say something!

728
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,170
Mi Lan,

729
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,470
Myna's real name

730
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:21,600
is Mi Xingwei.

731
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,070
He was murdered.

732
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,650
That's impossible.

733
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,380
My father...

734
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:38,530
my father is living well by himself in Shanghai.

735
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,850
He can't be in trouble.

736
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:42,850
You lied to me.

737
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:44,500
You lied, didn't you?

738
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,080
This can't be true.

739
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,460
My father can't be in trouble.

740
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:53,890
He's fine in Shanghai.

741
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,650
How could anything happen to him?

742
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:56,730
You bad people!

743
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:02,970
You lied.
