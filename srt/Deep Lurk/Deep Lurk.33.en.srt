00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,900
Stay here.

195
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,900
Move the manhole cover.

196
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:41,370
[Changsha Station]

197
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,470
You mean

198
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,660
letting Ling Han die in today's operation?

199
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,270
This is Chief's order,

200
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,000
as well as Director's.

201
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,150
If one day

202
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,750
I had a conflict with Chief,

203
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,630
which side would you take?

204
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:36,910
Stop!

205
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,710
ID.

206
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,950
Stop!

207
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,100
Stop!

208
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,630
Go.

209
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,069
Young Master.

210
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,670
How is it?

211
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,310
Everyone is here.

212
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:13,710
Let's go.

213
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:22,130
No reinforcements for now; wait for my order.

214
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,210
Yes.

215
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,390
What do you think?

216
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,990
They're trying to confuse us,

217
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,310
making it hard for us to judge

218
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,920
what Ling Han will do next.

219
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,030
I can guarantee that

220
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,910
he's hiding around here

221
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,170
and will come out when it gets dark.

222
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,750
It's getting dark soon.

223
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,350
Chief,

224
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,020
why don't you go back to the station first?

225
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,100
I'll take care of things here.

226
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,570
Ling Han has been cornered by now.

227
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,070
We don't know what he'll do next.

228
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,510
I'm afraid he'll harm you.

229
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,550
I want to see how he will harm me.

230
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,130
Do you remember what I told you?

231
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,950
If we find out he is the mole,

232
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,560
I'm gonna give you justice.

233
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,110
Now that we've found out,

234
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,790
then there's no need for him to live.

235
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,890
I want to see him die in front of me.

236
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,110
And when you went to save those kids,

237
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,950
you clearly knew that it was Ling Han's trap.

238
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,330
Why did you jump in?

239
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,550
The key is with you.

240
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,850
Why didn't you take it back to the station first?

241
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,060
If you and Wen Yeming

242
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,330
fall into his hands,

243
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,000
the safe won't be safe.

244
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:41,250
Aren't you afraid that Ling Han will get this codebook?

245
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,790
If Ling Han

246
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,480
can't get the key,

247
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,170
he won't jump into the net we set.

248
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,950
I want to use the key as bait.

249
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,260
You're quite bold.

250
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,710
Because I know

251
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,580
Chief won't let Ling Han get the codebook.

252
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,550
Why is Young Master Yun here?

253
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,150
When you see them later,

254
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,630
show no mercy.

255
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,400
Ling Han won't appear again.

256
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,290
Why?

257
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,530
Since they've made so many fake Ling Han,

258
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,510
they must be trying to cover the real Ling Han.

259
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,110
The more coverup they have,

260
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,590
the more it means that Ling Han won't come here.

261
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,030
This place

262
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,040
should be a battlefield for Mi Lan and Zong Fang.

263
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,830
They purposely lured Yun Hongqi here

264
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,510
to mess up the situation

265
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,790
so they could take the cipherkey and escape.

266
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,670
This is bad.

267
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,130
Young Master Yun wants to kill Mi Lan and Zong Fang

268
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,510
to avenge Madam Yun.

269
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,550
It's not that easy to

270
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:42,730
catch her alive.

271
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,550
I don't think he's here to make trouble.

272
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,440
Prepare to fight.

273
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,080
Yes.

274
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,300
Let's go!

275
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,180
If anyone sees Mi Lan,

276
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:51,780
don't hold back.

277
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,390
Beat her to death.

278
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,610
You hear me?

279
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,750
Why are you here?

280
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,750
Mi Lan deliberately leaked her whereabouts to me.

281
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,370
I have to show her respect.

282
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,940
Deliberately?

283
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,150
Dao.

284
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:03,780
Young Master.

285
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,870
Someone like Mi Lan

286
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,780
came yo buy tickets at the train station in person.

287
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,600
She wants everyone to know her whereabouts.

288
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,730
She's trying to fool us

289
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,630
with this little trick?

290
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,110
I guess I was right.

291
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,020
The train station is just a smoke screen.

292
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,570
They knew you were eager for revenge,

293
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,480
so they lured you here

294
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,890
and caused a conflict between us.

295
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,070
Then they can get

296
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,630
more time, and maybe

297
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,150
a few more can escape.

298
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,680
We're going to put on a good show later

299
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,060
and make them believe it.

300
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,190
Yun Hongqi!

301
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,840
You're obstructing my work!

302
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,820
Wen Yeming!

303
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,350
You can arrest me now!

304
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,550
But let me tell you,

305
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:42,830
if you arrest me, it's exactly what Mi Lan wants.

306
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,880
My guys are not easy to deal with.

307
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:45,980
They could raise a rumpus

308
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,230
and escape in chaos,

309
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,480
leaving you nothing.

310
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,900
You're a smart person.

311
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,650
Instead of going back empty-handed,

312
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,910
why don't you bring a body back to report?

313
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,190
Isn't it better?

314
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,210
Don't think I dare not arrest you!

315
00:20:58,810 --> 00:20:59,610
What are you doing?

316
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,390
All you NBIS do

317
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,350
is fighting with your own people.

318
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,250
What?

319
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,190
Fght?

320
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:09,920
What are you doing?

321
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,830
Don't ask for trouble.

322
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,310
You're the bullies here.

323
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,870
-Shoot.
-Always blaming on others.

324
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,030
Go ahead.

325
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,020
Retreat.

326
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,550
You are really capable,

327
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,930
pointing a gun at your own people.

328
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,190
The Japanese are over there.

329
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,660
Go shoot them!

330
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,590
Are you bullying people here?

331
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,520
Let's go.

332
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,040
It must be a fake alarm.

333
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,090
Keep chasing.

334
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,030
Thank you for your cooperation.

335
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,790
But still, as I said,

336
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,350
you've never been trained.

337
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,240
You're no match for them.

338
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,440
As for the rest,

339
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,110
you won't be able to help.

340
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:10,960
Go back now.

341
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,590
Okay.

342
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,590
Call me if you need help.

343
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,250
Gangzi,

344
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,430
let's go.

345
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:16,840
Be careful.

346
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,060
If anything happens to you,

347
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:18,910
he won't stand it.

348
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,310
Search the station carefully,

349
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,540
front and back!

350
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,220
-Yes!
-Yes!

351
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:24,870
Let's go.

352
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,320
It's almost over.

353
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,480
Young Master.

354
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,490
What's almost over?

355
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,870
Everything is almost over.

356
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,190
Shen said they are going to close the net.

357
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,220
Great.

358
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,180
That Mi Lan,

359
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,080
-what will happen to her?
-Die!

360
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,590
She will die!

361
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,240
Either die in her own people's hands,

362
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,760
or die in the hands of the NBIS,

363
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,290
or die in Shen’s hands.

364
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,230
Anyway,

365
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,260
she will be punished.

366
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,070
Get the chair.

367
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:29,130
This place must have just been trampled.

368
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,900
A woman indeed.

369
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,300
Keep a close eye on it.

370
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,760
Team A, go over there. Restore the electricity quickly.

371
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,470
Team B, guard the front door.

372
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,710
Team C, guard the back door.

373
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,510
Hurry up!

374
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,750
You two come with me.

375
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,750
The rest of you stay here.

376
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,750
Don't leave no matter what happens!

377
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,420
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

378
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:08,670
Ling Han.

379
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,530
You were careless.

380
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:22,450
You wouldn't have made such a stupid mistake before.

381
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,100
He's here.

382
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,790
He must be waiting for the mess outside

383
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,830
and jump in through the window.

384
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,870
Even you can think of it.

385
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,320
He would never take the way.

386
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:34,550
I guess

387
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,430
he'd blow up the switchboard

388
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,540
and then ccme down

389
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,110
to distract the people behind us

390
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,780
and make them panic.

391
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,630
Then he'd come in to get the codebook.

392
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,520
How about this?

393
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,660
What's the point of saying it now?

394
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,010
Protect the Chief!

395
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,400
The Organization has found out about

396
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,680
Ling Han's background.

397
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,450
Your father was an official in the former Qing Dynasty.

398
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,530
You're not Japanese.

399
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,280
Chief.

400
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,050
Are you okay?

401
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,660
I've lived to death

402
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:05,670
for nine years.

403
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:11,020
Flowers in the Mirror.

404
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,830
Yun Hongshen knows that

405
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,110
he could only make Ling Han

406
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,040
believe that he's not Japanese,

407
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,630
and he would hand over the cipher key.

408
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,550
Since Ling Han is not Japanese,

409
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,470
but Ke Jingping must

410
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:26,680
let him die.

411
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,750
This action

412
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,540
made Yun Hongshen begin to suspect

413
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,030
Ke Jingping's identity.

414
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:33,810
He's a good agent.

415
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,580
What a pity.

416
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,740
We've found the car.

417
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,830
It's parked at two blocks away from the train station,

418
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,290
in a very remote alley.

419
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,350
Unfortunately,

420
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,830
we couldn't find

421
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,150
any valuable witness.

422
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,780
I've checked this car.

423
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,370
It was stolen this morning.

424
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,180
The owner has a clean background.

425
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,400
Nothing suspicious.

426
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,560
The car thief and the person who set off the air alert

427
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,670
should be the same one.

428
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:35,630
By the way, ask around.

429
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,130
There should be a lot of rickshaws going

430
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,040
toward the train station at that time.

431
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,730
After Mi Lan abandoned the car,

432
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,600
they probably left in a rickshaw.

433
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,390
Go have a try.

434
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:44,970
Yes.

435
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,140
Leader Wen,

436
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:47,900
Chief is back.

437
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,170
He wants you in the meeting room for a meeting.

438
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:17,469
If it wasn't for Yun Hongqi,

439
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:19,790
we'd have Mi Lan and Zong Fang by now.

440
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,929
He didn't behave. What about you?

441
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,620
The sooner we get the cipher key,

442
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,989
the less our soldiers will die

443
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:27,510
on the battlefield.

444
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,710
Didn't you tell him about the stakes?

445
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:32,860
I'm sorry, Chief.

446
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,980
And you, Wen Yeming.

447
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,250
Yun Hongqi obstructed official duties,

448
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,190
resulting in the injury of our secret service personnel.

449
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,940
Didn't you know what to do?

450
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,270
Chief,

451
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,330
I had a conflict with Yun Hongqi

452
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,870
because we agreed on it.

453
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,600
We're going to put on a good show later

454
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,860
and make them believe it.

455
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,630
Only by turning the trick against them

456
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,570
can we lure Mi Lan and Zong Fang out.

457
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,560
I don't want to hear this nonsense.

458
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,380
I just want to know where the cipher key is.

459
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,250
Who can tell me?

460
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,110
Which one of you?

461
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,750
I suggest we re-investigate

462
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,610
the passengers on the same ship as Mister.

463
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,230
I suspect the two dead Misters

464
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:08,840
were just a cover.

465
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,950
The real Mister has lurked in Changsha

466
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,720
and made contact with Mi Lan and Zong Fang.

467
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,470
The operation this morning

468
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,950
proves my deduction.

469
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,110
Obviously,

470
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,910
Mi Lan and Zong Fang have got new help.

471
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:22,950
As long as we find the real Mister

472
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,260
and follow the clues,

473
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,950
we can find Mi Lan and Zong Fang.

474
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,780
They must know where the cipher key is.

475
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:29,470
Chief,

476
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,760
I don't think it's necessary to investigate further.

477
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:34,290
You know, after today's mission,

478
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,580
the trick of the real and fake Mister

479
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,870
has been exposed.

480
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,670
I think

481
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,580
Mi Lan and Zong Fang know it too.

482
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,110
This Mister must have

483
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:43,470
moved after the mission was completed.

484
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:45,300
There's no need to investigate further.

485
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,250
But we can't let go this clue.

486
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,510
This is the only way

487
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,690
we can make a move right now.

488
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,190
Even if Mister has moved,

489
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,370
I'm sure he's in touch with the Mi Lan and Zong Fang.

490
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,960
We've been through the manifest for

491
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,260
the last batch of passengers.

492
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,350
This time, let's do it more specifically.

493
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:01,500
I believe the result will come out soon.

494
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:02,780
Keep investigating.

495
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,110
Find this guy

496
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,260
before you go to work tomorrow.

497
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,190
Besides,

498
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:09,820
when can you give me the cipher key?

499
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,350
Well,

500
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:12,920
I'm not sure.

501
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,040
Not sure?

502
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:16,980
Interesting.

503
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:19,310
Your biggest rival, Ling Han, is dead.

504
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,730
Now the rest are just some small fry.

505
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,480
But now you're not sure.

506
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,560
Didn't you just say that

507
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,670
as long as we find Mister,

508
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,290
we can find Zong Fang and Mi Lan?

509
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,300
It's not hard to find Mister.

510
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,480
It's hard to find Mi Lan and Zong Fang.

511
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,150
And I always feel

512
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,750
Ling Han couldn't have died so easily.

513
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:37,930
It seems that he

514
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,270
had some backup plan.

515
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,320
So?

516
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,110
So when he was alive,

517
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,800
you two were equal rivals.

518
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:45,950
Now he's dead,

519
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,090
but you become a coward.

520
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:47,950
No, I...

521
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,490
I don't want to hear your explanation.

522
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,300
I only give you three days.

523
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:00,710
Everyone,

524
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,400
three days later,

525
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:04,850
I want all this to finish.

526
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,670
Understand?

527
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:06,470
Yes.

528
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,260
Everyone, I have something to say.

529
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,380
Although we have paid

530
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,590
a heavy price for this operation,

531
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:26,150
after all, we've taken back the codebook.

532
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,410
For someone as capable as Ling Han,

533
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:31,430
who is absolutely loyal to the KMT,

534
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,570
losing him is a huge loss to Hunan Station.

535
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,900
I hope you all to restrain yourselves

536
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,570
and your subordinates.

537
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,750
Regarding Ling Han,

538
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:43,900
this is the only one statement,

539
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:45,270
no matter to whom,

540
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,700
internally and externally.

541
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,150
Got it.

542
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:49,850
Dismiss.

543
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:15,970
Chief,

544
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,430
this bag

545
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,790
was found at the place where Ling Han

546
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:20,780
kidnapped the deputy chief.

547
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,380
How did you find this bag?

548
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,240
There was a mark engraved on the spot

549
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,350
where the bag was found that is unique to our station.

550
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,480
Maybe it was left by Leader Yun.

551
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:31,850
You may leave.

552
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:32,810
Yes.

553
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,020
According to the situation,

554
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:57,350
the person who set off the air alarm

555
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:59,110
is the same one who drove the car and saved

556
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,110
Mi Lan and Zong Fang.

557
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,120
This means this person knows

558
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,950
the backup plan if the operation fails.

559
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,790
Normally,

560
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,250
the person who knows

561
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,690
the backup plan must be trusted.

562
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,840
So I think

563
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,280
we can assume that this person is Mister.

564
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,680
I've just talked to Wen Yeming.

565
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:18,110
According to her analysis at the crime scene,

566
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,540
we can infer that this woman's

567
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,550
height is probably

568
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,110
between 1.6 to 1.7 meters.

569
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:22,980
Not too thin.

570
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:26,130
Is it possible that it's a thin man and his

571
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:26,920
weight and height

572
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,920
is within this range you mentioned?

573
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:30,810
It's not likely.

574
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,590
Because the power of men and women

575
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,030
is still very different.

576
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,110
People of the same height and weight

577
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,910
leave very different marks

578
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,470
when they exert themselves.

579
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,790
Especially a long curly hair found

580
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,630
under a window at the crime scene.

581
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,580
I'm sure Mister is a woman.

582
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:47,110
I see.

583
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,390
Director Gong.

584
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,830
The day you caught the fake Mister,

585
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:52,270
our people were there too.

586
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,250
After your people do the preliminary screening,

587
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,600
have my team cross-reference with yours.

588
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,450
That's more efficient, right?

589
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,270
Thank you.

590
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,450
It's my duty.

591
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:07,330
What did Yun Hongshen give you?

592
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,300
You disobeyed my order again and again.

593
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,750
And now you dare come here

594
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:11,870
and doubt my decision.

595
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,050
Wen Yeming,

596
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:14,790
you've really let me down.

597
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,470
It has nothing to do with others.

598
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,380
I can't accept it myself.

599
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,430
Letting Ling Han die as a hero

600
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:22,470
and be admired

601
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,050
by those who know nothing.

602
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,170
It's not fair.

603
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,630
I can't face those people

604
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,710
who died because of Ling Han

605
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:29,920
and their family.

606
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,480
I feel guilty.

607
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,390
I can't tell them without conscience

608
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,270
that their sacrifice was worth it.

609
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,390
Sir,

610
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,050
you told me before

611
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,520
that our job

612
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:41,560
might not be understood

613
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:42,950
or fair and square.

614
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:44,610
But everything we've done

615
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:47,000
is for the future of this country, isn't it?

616
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,500
Is a false peace,

617
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:49,870
making a traitor a hero,

618
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,050
part of tomorrow too?

619
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,880
That would be horrible.

620
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,570
For the sake of someone,

621
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,150
the truth is buried,

622
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,180
and the right and wrong are confused.

623
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,590
Is such a tomorrow worth looking forward to?

624
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,190
Fine, you wanna talk about the truth?

625
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,010
I'll tell you what the truth is.

626
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,480
The truth is a compromise

627
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,930
between the various forces!

628
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,640
There is no real fairness or justice in this world.

629
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,150
It's not black or white.

630
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,460
It has its grey zone.

631
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,030
There are some things you have to compromise on.

632
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:14,760
You know?

633
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,710
Even if there is no absolute fairness,

634
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,630
you can't distort the truth.

635
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:19,810
The truth?

636
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,590
If I tell you the truth,

637
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,060
do you think you can handle it?

638
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:26,010
Now, let me ask you.

639
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:28,260
Have you ever suspected that Yun Hongshen is a Communist?

640
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:32,970
Tell me!

641
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:36,950
Yes.

642
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:39,770
Yang Ziming cleared him of suspicion.

643
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,640
But there's still something suspicious about him.

644
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:44,430
Do you dare say you've never suspected him?

645
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,550
You've suspected.

646
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:52,910
But you don't dare look into it.

647
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:54,630
Because you just can't

648
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:55,680
face the fact.

649
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:02,720
Go back.

650
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,900
Don't hold on to Ling Han.

651
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,980
There are many things that you may not like,

652
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:10,780
but you have to accept it.

653
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,470
Looking at these files,

654
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:46,270
Yun Hongshen's more certain that

655
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:48,500
Kunwu is not Ling Han,

656
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,960
but someone else.

657
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,150
As more and more

658
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:53,590
information in the files

659
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:55,570
is presented in front of Yun Hongshen,

660
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,630
all his doubts

661
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,610
now point to Ke Jingping.

662
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,170
He is the most likely

663
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,550
Kunwu.
