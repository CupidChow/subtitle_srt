00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:43,390
Hello,

4
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:44,170
who's this?

5
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,610
Dad, it's me.

6
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,450
I've almost finished all the preparations.

7
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,979
It should be up to your standards.

8
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:50,920
By the way, Dad,

9
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,300
I just checked

10
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,710
and noticed that we missed sending out five invitations.

11
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,750
For some of them, it's not a big deal.

12
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,060
They're all our old acquaintances.

13
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,789
A phone call from you to explain

14
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,660
should be fine.

15
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,550
But for the other two,

16
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,140
we need to formally send them invitations.

17
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:05,790
Alright.

18
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,080
These are all minor issues.

19
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,490
We can handle them.

20
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,900
You need to pay attention to yourself.

21
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,100
I want the guests tonight to have a night

22
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,790
they'll never forget.

23
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:17,829
Okay, Dad.

24
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,579

25
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,630
There's a cocktail party at the Shanghai Hotel tonight.

26
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,230
The pianist in the lobby is sick,

27
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,030
and they need someone to fill in.

28
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:36,590
I remember that you play the piano.

29
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,320
Would you like to take this job?

30
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:40,670
Yes.

31
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,110
What time should I come over?

32
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,260
The cocktail party will start at 7:00 PM.

33
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,390
You'd better arrive a little earlier.

34
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:47,970
Got it.

35
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,740
Cousin, is there anything else you need me to do?

36
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,600
I've arranged a rickshaw for you.

37
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,670
The rickshaw puller's ID number is 0502.

You must remember that.

40
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,640
Understood.

41
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,790
Before you go, there's one more thing

42
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,390
I'd like to discuss with you.

43
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,000
It's about Shen.

44
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,470
When this matter is over,

45
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,930
I'd like to recruit him

46
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,000
to work for us.

47
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,829
Didn't you tell me before

48
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,020
that we should wait a bit longer to see?

49
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,310
He's still immature

50
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,630
and reckless.

51
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,710
He wanted to find Qu Wenzhi

52
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,630
before Viscount did

53
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,910
and used this as a bargaining chip

54
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,910
to force me into telling him everything.

55
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,510
Then yes, what he did was indeed too reckless.

56
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,360
It's a pity

57
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,860
that it alerted Viscount.

58
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,960
If we had just followed him for a little longer,

59
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,870
we might have found out even more.

60
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,430
If he can't handle this kind of test,

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,070
he is not qualified to join our Party.

62
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,870
Luckily, he's idolized you since he was a child

63
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,230
and has a deeply ingrained trust in you.

64
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,720
Otherwise, in a moment of impulse,

65
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:07,050
he might have turned against you in the name of justice.

Many people, even facing the brutal war,

still maintain an unwavering belief in victory.

99
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,750

that someone's smuggled something in.

107

One is an anesthetic,

108
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,520
which isn't too concerning,

109
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,409
but the other is a bit problematic—

110

cyanide.

The Second Young Master Yun also went to the Tous Red Wine House today.

Muzhi,

117
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,000
I know you like cigars.

118
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,260
So I specifically asked a friend to bring them back from Cuba.

119
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,990
They're premium Cuban cigars.

120
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,590
Try one.

121

131
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,590
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

132
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,830
I didn't mean it.

133
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,110
I'm really sorry.

134
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,530
How much of a bribe did you take?

135
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,690
The money was from Miss Xu, right?

136
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:55,840
Yes, it was.

137
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,910
You take him to the back door,

138
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,070
and someone will take him away.

139
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:45,670
Yes.

140
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,190

Yes, I live in Shanghai.

142
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,290

By the way,

00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,870
you said you're feeling unwell today.

148
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,800

151
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,510
If you have heart problems, you need to take medicine.

152
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,370
Did you take it?

153
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,110
I brought the medicine,

154
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,370
but I forgot to take it.

155
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,550
Next time

00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,790
if something like this happens again,

157
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,520
you must remember to remind me.

158
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,630
Since you say so,

159
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,370

So, it took me a bit longer.

190
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,530
He is already dead.

191
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,070
There's no need to take him out anymore.

192
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,630
You can leave now.

193
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,290
Yes, ma'am.

194
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,450
I've informed the family.

195
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,640
Let's wheel him out in a moment.

196
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,110
Okay.

197
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:29,710
Someone's dead.

198
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,640
Let's go, quick!

199
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:31,520
Oh my God!

200
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,360
What's going on?

201
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,550
How did someone end up dead here?

202
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,950
I don't know either, sir.

203
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,150
The one who died should be Qu Wenzhi.

204
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:06,880
Have a seat.

205
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,510
We've got the stuff.

206
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,800
It doesn't matter whether he's dead or alive now.

207
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,640
Mr. Tanaka,

208
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,040
tonight was really a blast.

209
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,110
You've foreseen his every move.

210
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,750
You're really impressive.

211
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,650
Are you certain that Yun Hongshen is really under your control?

212
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:28,380
I'm certain.

213
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,340
I administered the anesthetic myself.

214
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,990
He passed out in less than two seconds.

215
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,110
What's wrong, Mr. Tanaka?

216
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,170
Is there a problem?

217
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,200
I can't believe that someone who had been secretly investigating me for so long

218
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,250
without my noticing

219
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,000
died so easily like that.

220
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,760
We don't know how long he had been investigating you.

221
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,290
He might have just started.

222
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,240
Moreover,

223
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,370
your plan was so well-crafted,

224
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,550
and there were no loopholes at all.

225
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,410
He couldn't have seen through it.

226
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,230
No.

227
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,310
Yun Muzhi must know quite a bit.

228
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,620
I always have a feeling...

229
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,780
that this matter

230
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,830
is not over yet.

231
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:17,850
Who is it?

232
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,520
It's me, Miss Xu.

233
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:20,960
It's Ye.

234
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,320
I'll go get the door.

235
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,150
Looks like I wasn't wrong.

236
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,820
Yun Muzhi really isn't that easy to be killed.

237
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,130
You don't understand what's going on, right?

238
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:27,670
Alright.

239
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,670
Let me clear things up for you.

240
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,660
My father said

241
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,760
that falling into your trap

242
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,590
was the first step of his plan.

243
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,710
Falling into his trap

244
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,550
without raising his suspicion,

245
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,150
tonight's operation

246
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,000
should be a good start.

247
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,160
Your father knows me very well.

248
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,910
The Shanghai Hotel is indeed a great place,

249
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,000
where all sorts of people

250
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,010
mingle together.

251
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,320
So this makes it very convenient to pass messages.

252
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:56,960
I guess...

253
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,110
you must know

254
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,030
I sent the red wine to the guests staying at the hotel

255
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,230
through the manager.

256
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,310
You were quietly trying to keep us calm,

257
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,270
but your real plan

258
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,480
was to take us all down

259
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,950
in one sweep tonight,

260
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:08,910
right?

261
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,710
You had someone smuggle in cyanide.

262
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,070
You weren't really trying to hide it from anyone.

263
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,730
In the midst of truth and fake,

264
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,360
making it hard for us to figure out what was really going on.

265
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,890
It was indeed a clever move.

266
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,410
But when a person has a target they're wary of,

267
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,050
they will lower their guard on other things.

268
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:33,210
So, you first chose that cigar infused with the drug.

269
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:36,820
You also anticipated that my father would refuse it.

270
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:37,910
And you also guessed

271
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,890
that he would feign heart discomfort,

272
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,920
so taking medicine then became a natural course of action.

273
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,050
But according to most people's logic,

274
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,130
you wouldn't act immediately.

275
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,330
Why?

276
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,170
Because the time interval was too short,

277
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,820
and you weren't fully prepared either.

278
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,060
But in fact,

279
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,360
the thing you used to kill

280
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,240
wasn't that cigar,

281
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,720
but that glass coated with cyanide.

282
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,870
That's the key.

283
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,710
All the big shots in Shanghai

284
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,430
know that your father loves cigars.

285
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,130
But how could I have predicted

286
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:15,490
that he wouldn't smoke cigars tonight of all nights?

287
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,280
The common trait of smart people is that they like to...

288
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,560
suspect what others are least likely to suspect.

289
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,320
My father loves smoking cigars.

290
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,940
That's something everyone knows.

291
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,410
And logically speaking, my father would definitely smoke

292
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,700
the cigars that Mr. Frank gave.

293
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,350
But if it were

294
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,770
someone as clever as you,

295
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,560
you definitely wouldn't smoke it.

296
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,820
Because you'd suspect

297
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,520
that we had tampered with that cigar.

298
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,030
So, you believed

299
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,810
that my father certainly wouldn't smoke it,

300
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:41,390
right?

301
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,470
Yun Muzhi is indeed a master.

302
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,250
He could predict what I was thinking.

303
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,590
That glass of red wine

304
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,680
should also be a trick to mislead me,

305
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:55,750
right?

306
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,950
He made me believe

307
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,950
that you were trying to deal with me.

308
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:19,220
So, my line of thinking was misguided.

309
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,950
After that,

310
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,910
I indeed kept thinking about

311
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,790
what methods you would use next

312
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,650
to deal with me,

313
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,000
but I overlooked...

314
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,990
that you were actually turning the tables on me.

315
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:31,990
Of course.

316
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,510
You swapped the anesthetic?

317
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,370
If it had seemed too fake,

318
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,600
it would have been hard to cover up.

319
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,730
Haven't you seen my two good partners?

320
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,060
Second Young Master?

321
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,260
Second Young Master.

322
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,230
Second Young Master?

323
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:15,630
Don't be anxious.

324
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:16,870
It doesn't work that fast.

325
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,730
It'll take a while to take effect.

326
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:21,540
Alright.

327
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,800
Things have been pretty much sorted out.

328
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,200
Then, let's go somewhere else to talk.

329
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,530
Feeling weak, aren't you?

330
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,110
How was the tea?

331
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:53,590
He actually...

332
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,400
foresaw it too...

333
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,150
Of course.

334
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,870
You saw my father drink that glass of water with your own eyes.

335
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:01,760
Then, Miss Xu

336
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,940
successfully rushed over to meet up with you.

337
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,620
But you always felt uneasy in your mind.

338
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,440
You kept thinking

339
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,150
about where exactly things went wrong.

340
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,190
So, you let your guard down.

341
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:11,390
There is only a little bit of anesthetic

342
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:13,350
in this cup of tea.

343
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,220
The smell was faint.

344
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,630
Under normal circumstances,

345
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,250
you would definitely have noticed it immediately.

346
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,710
But your attention was entirely elsewhere.

347
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,350
And Miss Xu was immersed in the fact

348
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,920
that she had just eliminated a formidable opponent.

349
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,760
So...

350
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,560
What's wrong with him?

351
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,200
From the moment we entered,

352
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,770
he already knew he wouldn't escape tonight.

353
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:45,230
So, he didn't want to be captured alive by us.

354
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,660
Looks like I wasn't wrong.

355
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:54,590
Yun Muzhi really isn't that easy to be killed.

356
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,310
What should we do now?

357
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,110
Drag him away.

358
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,070
Wait.

359
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,110
Put the flowers in place.

360
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,570
And take away whatever needs to be taken.

361
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,430
Young Master,

362
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,990
I've been looking all over for you.

363
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,960
Why are you back so late?

364
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,680
Something terrible

365
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,750
has happened at home.

366
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,090
What happened?

367
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:10,000
Mr. Yun has passed away.

368
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,520
Who are you trying to fool now?

369
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,440
Mr. Yun had a sudden heart attack during the party.

370
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,990
He was taken to the hospital, but they couldn't save him.

371
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,590
I couldn't find you anywhere.

372
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,820
And I don't know how to handle

373
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,700
Mr. Yun's body.

374
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:22,470
Right now,

375
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:25,070
it's still in his room.

376
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:25,990
Dad.

377
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:27,190
Dad!

378
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,110
Alright, alright, alright.

379
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,710
You don't need to go up there.

380
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,030
After Mr. Yun's funeral is over,

381
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:35,020
I'll accompany the Second Young Master to escort the coffin back to Changsha.

382
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,180
So, our family will be falling apart.

383
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:40,360
You two should return to your hometown as well.

384
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,240
Have you found it out?

385
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:15,920
A few days ago,

386
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,470
Xu Meijia called, saying her father was sick

387
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,040
and that she needed to go back to her hometown to visit him.

388
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,570
We had discussed before...

389
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,240
that she was likely to be getting reassigned back to Japan.

390
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,560
She bought a train ticket

391
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,290
with a fake hometown listed as Changchun.

392
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,670
In a station baggage locker,

393
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,400
I found this.

394
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,180
Xu Meijia's train ticket is for tonight.

395
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,200
Viscount

396
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,900
stored this letter in the locker beforehand.

397
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,760
Clearly, he wanted her to take it.

398
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,200
And Viscount, until his dying moments,

399
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,460
wanted to hide the key.

400
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,050
It's clear this letter is very important.

401
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:44,530
So,

402
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,050
there must be something wrong with this painting.

403
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,390
It's really him.

404
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:51,550
Kunwu.

405
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,960
Kunwu?

406
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,590
Is there something wrong with this knife?

407
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,910
King Mu of Zhou went on an expedition against the Western Rong tribes.

408
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,710
The Western Rong presented the Kunwu knife

409
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,240
and fire-laundered cloth.

410
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,110
It is said that cutting jade with this knife

411
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,770
was like cutting through mud.

412
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,740
This knife...

413
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,030
has appeared in the world again.

414
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,030
Are you saying...

415
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,680
this knife has reappeared in the world?

416
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,260
Could it be...

417
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,400
that the Japanese woman and these two children in the painting

418
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:39,630
are waiting for someone codenamed Kunwu?

419
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,950
That's the general situation.

420
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,610
We're still looking into the specific details.

421
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:48,930
[Japanese Commander, Okamura Ningji]

422
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,190
Send a telegram to Kunwu,

423
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,830
informing him about the situation here in Shanghai.

424
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:50,360
Yes, sir.

425
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:54,810
Dad,

426
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,740
say something.

427
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,600
Am I right or wrong?

428
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,600
Tell me your thoughts on this painting first.

429
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,620
The mountain rain is about to cease,

430
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,040
and rays of sunlight are breaking through.

431
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,150
The river is drifting beneath clouds painted with sunset's glow.

432
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:12,640
This is Song Zhiwen's poem "Crossing the Great Yu Ridge."

433
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,210
Mountain rain lifts its veil;

434
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,880
River clouds turn sunset-rose.

435
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,340
Hope there's a day to return;

436
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,870
I dare not resent Changsha.

437
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,850
He wanted to tell the viewer of the painting

438
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:25,130
that the Japanese army would soon occupy Changsha.

439
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,260
When that happened,

440
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,160
he'd be able to reunite with his family.

441
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,490
The painter is in Changsha?

442
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:38,840
I can tell you now

443
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,590
that the person Viscount wanted to meet was Qu Wenzhi,

444
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:44,190
Senior Military Advisor to the Ninth War Zone.

445
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,380
The Ninth War Zone?

446
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,740
He has defected from Changsha?

447
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:49,700
Dad,

448
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,030
given his rank,

449
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,630
he knows everything about the Ninth War Zone's

450
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,610
troop deployment

451
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,070
and the defense strategy.

452
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,470
If he falls into the hands of the Japanese...

453
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,030
Dad.

454
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,400
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

455
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,780
If I had known earlier that he was a traitor,

456
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,670
I would have killed him at the train station.

457
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,800
I only learned this news this morning.

458
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:12,670
I didn't have time to tell you

459
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:13,930
before you made a mess.

460
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,610
Then why didn't you tell me at noon?

461
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:19,330
After I found Qu Wenzhi at the Shanghai Hotel,

462
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,200
I should have eliminated him immediately.

463
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,330
Every minute he lives

464
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,690
puts Changsha at greater risk.

465
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:24,770
Then let me tell you now

466
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,110
that someone is on to this matter.

467
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,320
It has nothing to do with you.

468
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,400
I just want to know

469
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:31,170
if what I did was right.

470
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,290
Of course, it was right.

471
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,720
Then you should tell me the truth.

472
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,190
The truth is that Yun Muzhi, the president of the Bank of France,

473
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,640
died of a sudden heart attack tonight.

474
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,310
In a few days,

475
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:47,310
you'll escort the coffin back to your hometown.

476
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,230
From now on,

477
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,880
I'll have nothing to do

478
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,710
with the Bank of France or Frank.

479
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,170
When things settle down,

480
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:54,590
we can come back.

481
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,710
By then, I will give you

482
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,750
a perfect answer.

483
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:00,550
Perhaps

484
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,190
you will have the chance

485
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,510
to fight alongside me.

486
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,590
[Viscount was killed by Yun Muzhi and his son. Yun Muzhi is dead.
To ensure the Hunting Operation is foolproof, Yun Hongshen must be eliminated...]

487
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,500
Commander,

488
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,400
Kunwu has sent a telegram back.

489
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,890
He sent a telegram back immediately.

490
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,910
There must be something major going on.

491
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:30,830
[Yun Muzhi's cunning. Please confirm whether his death is true.]

492
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,680
Years of intelligence work

493
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,520
have honed Yun Muzhi's

494
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:43,410
sharp instincts for detecting dangerous enemies.

495
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,350
This unseen opponent

496
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:48,380
has sent an ominous signal to Yun Muzhi.

497
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,360
Two hours ago,

498
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,830
Yun Muzhi just received news

499
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,310
that on the sea,

500
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,040
40 kilometers from downtown Shanghai,

501
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,320
senior commanders from

502
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,280
the Japanese North and Central China Area Army

503
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,160
were holding a secret meeting.

504
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,150
This meeting

505
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,480
is certainly not convened because of

506
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,490
Qu Wenzhi's defection,

507
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,389
but what he brought with him

508
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:11,710
must be one of the topics of this meeting.

509
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:15,110
If Kunwu was in Changsha,

510
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,940
then Qu Wenzhi's defection

511
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,790
was clearly planned and executed by him.

512
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,630
A dangerous figure who had remained dormant for so long.

513
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,949
It's fine that he hasn't made a move,

514
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:27,750
but when he finally does, it's bound to be a big one.

515
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:31,469
Although there are no clear signs yet,

516
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,110
Yun Muzhi has a strange feeling

517
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,360
that Qu Wenzhi's defection

518
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,800
might just be the beginning.

519
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,600
At 3:44 a.m.,

520
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:46,030
the phone rings twice and hangs up.

521
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,960
It's the code between Myna

522
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:50,429
and his most reliable informant.

523
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:51,429
Whenever the phone

524
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:53,750
rings precisely at 3:44 a.m.,

525
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:56,150
a storm of blood and intrigue is about to

526
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:59,190
sweep through Shanghai's intelligence community.

00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,720
What's with all the theatrics?

00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,470
From now on,

534
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,110
and who he's met,

539
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,240
my condolences.

540
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:31,370

Cheng Huize,

542
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,230
do you know why I punched you?

543
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,550
You know very well

544
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,390
how my dad helped you in the past.

545
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,360
And how did you repay him?

546
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:39,770
Bite the hand that feeds you.

547
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:41,080
You had it coming!

If this punch makes you feel a bit better...

552
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,630
then it's worth it.

553
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,220
But remember,

No, I don't.

be selling intelligence?

Qu Wenzhi just arrived in Shanghai yesterday.

Today, he's already selling intelligence at a high price.

600
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,330
This cannot be mere coincidence.

601
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,710
You suspect that his intelligence is related to Changsha?

602
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,710
There's a strong possibility.

[Zhu He, Deputy Chief of the Kuomintang's NBIS Hunan Station]

But even so,

607
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:05,910
the confidential intelligence concerning Changsha can't be leaked.

00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:07,750
If it were to be leaked,

609
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,640
the Chairman would be furious.

610

At that time, our station...

Chief,

612
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:21,670
if that intelligence is really related to Changsha,

613
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:24,510

Yes, sir.

Let me tell you the truth.

00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:52,590
The East Asia Broadcasting Station

621
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:55,110

622
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,390
The trading companies mentioned there

623
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:58,510
are actually intelligence agencies from different factions.

The intelligence agencies in Shanghai

628
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:08,450
have developed an unspoken understanding among themselves.

629
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:09,510
So how does it work?

630
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:13,380

You said he's the most mysterious intelligence broker in Shanghai.

He doesn't act unless absolutely necessary,

637
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:28,550
and when he does, it's always a major piece of intelligence.

Yes.

00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,680
He doesn't act lightly.

00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,190
If he does,

Could it be...

658
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,700
that this intelligence is related to Changsha?
