[Deep Lurk]

2
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,789
[Episode 28]

3
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,990
Mi Lan had made up her mind.

4
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,579
No matter what, she would protect Kunwu.

5
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,430
It was her sole mission in Changsha,

6
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,630
the very reason for her existence.

7
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,470
He'll join us immediately once he sees the signal.

8
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,530
Let's head to Point B

9
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,370
and wait for him there.

10
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,990
Ling Han was almost certain

11
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,090
that the one summoning him wasn't anyone else

12
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,510
but Yun Hongshen.

13
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,110
He felt a surge of excitement,

14
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,560
having anticipated this outcome for a long time.

15
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,980
He was confident

16
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,290
he would be the one to laugh last.

17
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,750
Isn't it strange?

18
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,390
How come each one of the Yun family

19
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,500
is ridiculously clever?

20
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,570
He figured it out in no time.

21
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:44,150
The Yun family's century-old reputation wasn't earned for nothing.

22
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,290
Kids raised in families like that

23
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,190
are bound to be sharper than the rest.

24
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,350
And Yun Hongshen is trained for this.

25
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,750
His brother, being around him, would naturally pick up some skills.

26
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,230
Chief,

27
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,590
do you want to take a break?

28
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,550
It's going to be a long night.

29
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,670
No,

30
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,550
I'll hold on

31
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,540
a bit longer.

32
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,270
Chief.

33
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,150
Deputy Chief.

34
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,030
Wen Yeming called.

35
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,470
She's found Mi Lan's safe house.

36
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,840
Did she mention Yun Hongshen?

37
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,510
She didn't.

38
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,110
Alright,

39
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,350
send someone to search the safe house,

40
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,149
and tell Wen Yeming to get back here.

41
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:18,940
Yes.

42
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,550
I asked her to retrieve the codebook,

43
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,160
and she came back with a safe house.

44
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,030
She's really getting bold, isn't she?

45
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,310
Hello?

46
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,990
-Mr. Shi.
-Chief.

47
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:33,909
Chief.

48
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,750
Mr. Shi.

49
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,950
Chief Ke,

50
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,470
what did I instruct you?

51
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,310
Secret arrests. Secret arrests.

52
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,250
Do you even know what that means?

53
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,990
Now look at the mess you've made.

54
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,800
The entire city of Changsha knows about it!

55
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,700
Don't even explain!

56
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,310
What happened?

57
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,630
It's chaotic outside.

58
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,750
This is outrageous!

59
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,150
We want justice!

60
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,620
The police have no shame!

61
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,030
What do you want?

62
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,030
Look at how unreasonable the police are!

63
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:08,930
This case

64
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,580
wasn't even under our jurisdiction!

65
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:12,600
Nonsense!

66
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,800
You're just playing a game of hot potato with the NBIS!

67
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,070
People, judge for yourselves!

68
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,830
I went to the NBIS during the day,

69
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,590
and they told me

70
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,310
homicide cases

71
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,470
aren't their responsibility

72
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,710
and sent me to the police!

73
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,430
Fine,

74
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,280
so here I am!

75
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,750
And now the police are telling me to go back to the NBIS!

76
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,220
I'm not leaving today.

77
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,710
I'll stay here

78
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,720
until someone takes responsibility for this case!

79
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:33,840
Old Madam Yun's body isn't even cold yet,

80
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,590
and the NBIS is bullying us like this!

81
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,670
It's shameless!

82
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,030
They're even accusing Yun Hongshen of being a Communist.

83
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,870
This is absurd!

84
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,080
Sister,

85
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,110
you have connections with Madam Chiang.

86
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,370
You have to talk to her about this.

87
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,950
This cannot go unanswered!

88
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:52,190
Hello.

89
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:55,990
Alright.

90
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,370
Wait for me there.

91
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,420
I'll be right there.

92
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,670
Young Master Yun.

93
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,750
Where are you going?

94
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,040
Follow me if you want to know.

95
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,950
Gangzi,

96
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:42,900
go!

97
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:49,610
Yun Hongshen

98
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,870
did not heed Yang Ziming's advice

99
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:52,909
to leave Changsha.

100
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,340
He decided to stay.

101
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,710
Yang Ziming knew well that

102
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,470
Yun Hongshen

103
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,750
would never carry the codebook on him—

104
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,270
it would be far too dangerous.

105
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,270
So, where would

106
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,670
Yun Hongshen hide the codebook?

107
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,630
Suddenly, Yang Ziming

108
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,710
noticed the clock on the wall.

109
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,220
The time was clearly incorrect.

110
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,310
He recalled that

111
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,950
this was the exact time

112
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,940
he last met with Yun Hongshen.

113
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,710
Could

114
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,940
Yun Hongshen be hinting that

115
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,370
the codebook was hidden inside the clock?

116
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,350
Didn't Mr. Shi say

117
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,110
to hand Yun Hongshen over to him?

118
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,390
Why is he so hung up on these minor details?

119
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,840
This is no minor detail.

120
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,070
If this gets out of hand,

121
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,620
more and more people will start paying attention.

122
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,270
If they can't take Yun Hongshen away,

123
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,710
Mr. Shi fears it might ruin the Director's plan.

124
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,800
And Yun Hongqi—what a handful.

125
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,150
None of the Yun family members

126
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,990
give anyone a moment's peace.

127
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,350
Hello?

128
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,590
Chief,

129
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,510
this is Ling Han.

130
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,720
Don't make any rash moves.

131
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,100
I'll send someone over immediately.

132
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,310
Director Gong,

133
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,230
there's an abandoned factory 200 meters north of

134
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,490
the intersection of Siping Road and Xinghua Street.

135
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,100
Ling Han will lure Yun Hongshen there.

136
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,550
For this operation,

137
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,800
you must bring Yun Hongshen

138
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,420
back to me unscathed.

139
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,710
I repeat—

140
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,270
he must be unharmed.

141
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,580
News about Yun Hongshen?

142
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,670
Ling Han said Yun had been tailing him,

143
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,030
and after a long standoff,

144
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,670
he's only now managed to report in.

145
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:13,770
Looks like these two

146
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,470
are locked in a deadly battle.

147
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,660
A perfect match,

148
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,350
wouldn't you say?

149
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,010
Let's see whose luck runs out first.

150
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,320
Officer Wen.

151
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,440
Miss Wen.

152
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,070
So you know everything?

153
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,190
I have a question.

154
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,470
If I'm not mistaken,

155
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,730
wasn't it your team that forced Shen to join the NBIS in the first place

156
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,300
to help you find the cipher key?

157
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,480
And how long has it been?

158
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,590
You're already turning on him,

159
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,430
burning bridges after crossing them?

160
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,390
Is this the rule of the NBIS?

161
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,680
Is it?

162
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,470
I'm working on a way to resolve this.

163
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,120
Resolve?

164
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,440
You mean listening to your superior

165
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,100
and digging up more evidence against Shen?

166
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,830
Say something.

167
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,670
Wen Yeming, don't tell me you don't know

168
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,870
how much Shen admires you.

169
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,710
The only person he trusts in the NBIS is you.

170
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,110
I'm not asking you to treat him as a confidant,

171
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,430
but at least don't become the accomplice who brings about his downfall.

172
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,090
How could I possibly harm him?

173
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,940
Whatever you're willing to do for him,

174
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,370
I'm willing to do the same—

175
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,190
no, even more.

176
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,270
Turn away!

177
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,940
You're in no position to say that.

178
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,110
You—wait.

179
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:21,950
It can't be.

180
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,340
You and Yun Hongshen have a secret hideout.

181
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,430
A garden built by a former Qing dynasty official.

182
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,470
After the fall of the Qing,

183
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,630
it was abandoned,

184
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,590
left untended for years.

185
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,460
You used to play there often when you were kids.

186
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,350
You'd take him to catch crickets,

187
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,590
crawl through dog holes, climb trees

188
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,190
-and perform on the stage.
-Enough!

189
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,330
Alright,

190
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,430
I believe you.

191
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:41,870
I trust you.

192
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,180
Okay,

193
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,940
you should go back now.

194
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,120
I promise you

195
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,990
I'll do everything I can to save him.

196
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,360
Do you have a plan now?

197
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,630
I can't reveal too much just yet,

198
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,680
but

199
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,070
I've made some progress.

200
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,470
I'm worried that once he's caught,

201
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,030
Mr. Shi will take him away immediately.

202
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,670
If that happens, Yun Hongshen is finished.

203
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,770
We absolutely cannot let Mr. Shi

204
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,160
take him to Chongqing.

205
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,230
Don't worry—

206
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,620
I have a way.

207
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,630
I'll use high-level influence

208
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,510
to keep Shen in Changsha.

209
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,270
Good.

210
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,630
I'll go find the Chief right away.

211
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,670
Wait for my update.

212
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:38,670
Chief.

213
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:39,630
Deputy Chief.

214
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,440
What task did I assign to you?

215
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,200
I have solid reasons to suspect

216
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,220
that Ling Han is the real mole.

217
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,000
Ling Han claims he had Wei Xiaojun follow Yun Hongshen.

218
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,030
This is how those photos of Yun Hongshen making a phone call were taken.

219
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,540
Using those photos,

220
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,070
I've pinpointed the photographer's location.

221
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,420
The angle suggests the person was in a fixed position—

222
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,920
directly across from the phone booth,

223
00:14:58,950 --> 00:14:59,950
at a parallel distance.

224
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,370
With Wei Xiaojun's skill level,

225
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,000
there's no way he could have tailed Yun Hongshen

226
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,920
this closely without being noticed.

227
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,040
So, I suspect

228
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,970
the photos weren't taken by Wei Xiaojun at all—

229
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,410
but rather by Mi Lan, from the window of her safe house.

230
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,550
So, you've been explaining all this

231
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,430
just to prove that

232
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,990
Wei Xiaojun didn't take the photos—

233
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:13,950
Mi Lan did?

234
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,140
Now, let me ask you—

235
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:15,750
was it really Yun Hongshen

236
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,510
who made that phone call?

237
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,850
There's another possibility.

238
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,150
Mi Lan might have photographed

239
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,320
Yun Hongshen making a call,

240
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,790
but the call itself

241
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,720
might not have been to Ling Han's office at all.

242
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,580
I know what you're thinking.

243
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,710
If Ling Han is the mole,

244
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,950
then the alleged call to the Director

245
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,270
doesn't hold up.

246
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,200
And if that's the case,

247
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,110
it clears Yun Hongshen of any suspicion of being a Communist,

248
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:34,830
right?

249
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,870
Yun Hongshen couldn't have made that call.

250
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,150
His goal was to expose Ling Han,

251
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,640
not to incriminate himself.

252
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,460
Where's the evidence?

253
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,790
Do you have any actual evidence?

254
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,780
We should compile everything we've discovered

255
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,790
and report it to the Director.

256
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,070
So he can reassess

257
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,270
Ling Han's whistleblower claims.

258
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,530
If it's inconvenient for you,

259
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,190
I can take this to Mr. Shi myself.

260
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,670
Do you even understand Ling Han's relationship

261
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,630
with the Director?

262
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,110
The Director personally recommended him.

263
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,750
If Ling Han turns out to be the mole, how will that reflect on the Director?

264
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,720
Are you really so desperate to save Yun Hongshen

265
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,310
that you're willing to throw caution to the wind?

266
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,710
I believe that when it comes to

267
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,000
someone's innocence and life,

268
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,710
the Director's reputation is secondary.

269
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:06,590
Watch your tone!

270
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:15,020
Chief,

271
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,630
calm down.

272
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,730
You know your student well—

273
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,990
she's always been persistent, focused on facts,

274
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,760
and committed to rooting out traitors

275
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,950
while preserving talent.

276
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,880
That's her way of showing loyalty to KMT and the nation,

277
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,990
isn't it?

278
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,150
However, Wen Yeming,

279
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,850
you know clearly the situation we're in.

280
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,550
Shi Changsheng's calling Chief every other minute.

281
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,310
The stress for the Chief is overwhelming.

282
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,610
And now you're adding to it by being stubborn.

283
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,950
There are tasks we must carry out,

284
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,200
but the key is in

285
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,630
how we handle them.

286
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,680
Don't you agree?

287
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,230
Yes.

288
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,380
However, Chief,

289
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,280
in my opinion,

290
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,570
Wen Yeming's approach has merit.

291
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,510
We should give it a try.

292
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,150
This Yun Hongshen matter

293
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:08,140
requires extreme caution.

294
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,030
Of course,

295
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,270
we can protect the Director's reputation

296
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,740
while also being thorough.

297
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,329
But if you keep someone

298
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,010
like Ling Han close,

299
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,859
who's both cunning and deceitful,

300
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,510
the risk is too great.

301
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,869
Enough—I've heard you.

302
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,109
Zhu He didn't fully trust that

303
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:28,740
Yun Hongshen was free of Communist ties,

304
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,450
but he was more convinced

305
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,440
that Ling Han was the true traitor.

306
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,830
Having already clashed with Ling Han,

307
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,250
Zhu He subscribed to the adage: "The enemy of my enemy is my friend."

308
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,070
If forced to take sides,

309
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,560
he would rather stand with Yun Hongshen.

310
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:47,860
Sir!

311
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,000
Come in.

312
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,630
Chief,

313
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,030
we've completed the search of the safe house

314
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,590
Leader Wen identified.

315
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,470
Please advise.

316
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,670
Send all findings

317
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,750
to Deputy Chief Zhu.

318
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,230
Do not archive the information,

319
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,390
but keep it confidential.

320
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,300
Yes, sir.

321
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,230
You. Go out!

322
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:28,350
Zhu,

323
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,530
I've thought over what you said. You're right.

324
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,240
I want to see the results of your investigation soon.

325
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,790
But I have one condition.

326
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:37,610
I understand.

327
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,590
Mr. Shi is still in Changsha.

328
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,640
We'll investigate Mi Lan and her associates discreetly.

329
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:42,660
You can rest assured—

330
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,580
I won't alert

331
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,840
anyone unnecessarily.

332
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,880
Now, have some water.

333
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,110
Don't bother scheming.

334
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,770
They'll be here soon.

335
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,960
You won't find the codebook.

336
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,430
As long as Wen Yeming can find it,

337
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:13,670
so can I.

338
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,950
I promise you,

339
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,150
today won't be the end.

340
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,850
Even if I die,

341
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,870
I'll expose your true identity

342
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,030
and ensure you get what you deserve.

343
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,190
From the moment you left the station,

344
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,950
it's been six or seven hours.

345
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:31,990
I'm sure

346
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,030
you've planned meticulously,

347
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:34,910
ensuring that

348
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,580
if capturing me fails,

349
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,820
you can still accuse me.

350
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,390
But don't forget—

351
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:40,950
you're finished.

352
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,350
Soon, you'll lose both your freedom and your life.

353
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,110
Meanwhile,

354
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,030
I have plenty of time

355
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,070
to dismantle every move you've made.

356
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,430
And most importantly,

357
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,430
Director Dai has no tolerance for Communists.

358
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:53,750
Yun Hongshen,

359
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:55,830
you've lost.

360
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:21,790
Yun Hongshen!

361
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,230
You're surrounded.

362
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,070
Don't put up any more futile resistance.

363
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:25,970
Surrender now!

364
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,540
What did Tang Zhiyi (the Viscount) tell you

365
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,290
before he died?

366
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,990
When you meet him yourself,

367
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:32,890
you can ask him directly.

368
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,500
Too bad.

369
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,440
You set the game,

370
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,430
but you won't see its conclusion.

371
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,510
Yet, a game without an end

372
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,430
might not be such a bad thing after all.

373
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,160
Thankfully, we made preparations in advance.

374
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,920
-Sir.
-Don't even think about it.

375
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,950
I won't let you see him.

376
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:02,480
You were tasked with finding the codebook,

377
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,270
but you've been busy clearing his name instead.

378
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,290
This is the first time in your life

379
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,840
that you've disobeyed me.

380
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,040
I'm sorry.

381
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,310
I've disappointed you.

382
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,420
Disappointment is one thing.

383
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,430
But if the Director finds out about this,

384
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,890
your career will be over.

385
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:23,950
I don't care.

386
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:24,690
But I do!

387
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,030
I brought you back,

388
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,840
got you into school, and guided you into this profession.

389
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,670
I don't want to see you ruined

390
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,580
over an unsuitable attachment.

391
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,640
I want your life to have value.

392
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,750
Do you understand me?

393
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:41,790
I'm sorry.

394
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,550
Stop saying sorry.

395
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:47,230
Just go back.

396
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:58,720
Wait.

397
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,610
If you want to investigate Ling Han, go ahead.

398
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:09,670
Thank you.

399
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,270
Thank you, Sir.

400
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,570
How did you find me?

401
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,790
I've been following you the entire time.

402
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,550
Got to enjoy quite the show along the way.

403
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,690
Did Uncle Yang send you?

404
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:28,810
Yes.

405
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,580
What does he want to say?

406
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,370
He asked me to tell you this:

407
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,270
your idea

408
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,700
aligns perfectly with his plan.

409
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,310
First, make a spectacle of this situation.

410
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,650
Draw as much public attention as possible.

411
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,510
That way, the NBIS will have no choice but to proceed cautiously.

412
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:43,990
In turn,

413
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,470
Yun Hongshen's case

414
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,850
will have to be handled out in the open.

415
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,590
So, you've done a great job.

416
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,510
I've arranged everything.

417
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:56,200
Tomorrow, the real drama begins.

418
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,830
The NBIS thinks they can cover everything up—

419
00:24:58,990 --> 00:24:59,620
not a chance.

420
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,310
Now it's your move.

421
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,310
Given the current situation,

422
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,370
you only have one job:

423
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,430
Keep stirring the pot.

424
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,390
As for

425
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,870
rescuing Yun Hongshen,

426
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,990
leave that to us.

427
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,030
Why?

428
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,590
Can't I participate?

429
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,640
You absolutely can't.

430
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,430
Why?

431
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,270
This is far too complicated.

432
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,790
You don't have the capability for it.

433
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:26,880
Fair enough.

434
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,070
You've been tailing me all day,

435
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,590
and I didn't even notice.

436
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:32,990
That's not what I meant.

437
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,990
Do you trust your Uncle Yang?

438
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:35,720
I do.

439
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,790
Then you should trust the Party

440
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,280
that Yun Hongshen and your father

441
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,630
were willing to give their lives for.

442
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:49,920
Alright.

443
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,630
But I'll stay prepared.

444
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,240
Just in case you need me.

445
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,390
It's not just in case.

446
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,840
We'll definitely need you.

447
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,510
For now, though,

448
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,790
before this matter is completely resolved,

449
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,170
don't go home.

450
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,590
Once the NBIS gets hold of Yun Hongshen,

451
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,280
they'll officially take over your family estate.

452
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:12,280
They'll also conduct a thorough search of Yun's Residence.

453
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,070
If you go back,

454
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,350
they won't let you stay.

455
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,110
Staying out

456
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,470
will make your movements

457
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:19,900
and our communication

458
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:20,950
much easier.

459
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:22,230
Right?

460
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:25,770
Alright.

461
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,590
Let them search if they want.

462
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,790
But there's one condition:

463
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:34,390
If they dare damage even a single brick of Yun's Residence,

464
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,270
I'll make them regret

465
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,370
ever stepping foot inside.

466
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:42,830
Deal.

467
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,610
I won't let you face this alone.

468
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,560
Madam.

469
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,340
Why haven't you gone home yet?

470
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:35,510
Don't want to?

471
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,110
How about you?

472
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:38,910
Are you alright?

473
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,870
Leader Yun is in trouble.

474
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:42,270
You must be feeling terrible.

475
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,910
If there's anything I can do to help,

476
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:45,950
just let me know.

477
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,660
One must first protect oneself to be able to help others.

478
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,170
In this situation,

479
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:52,920
you need to be extra careful.

480
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,750
I understand.

481
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,550
Don't worry.

482
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,470
Let me give you a ride.

483
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:58,620
Okay.

484
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,470
Officer Wen.

485
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,100
Officer Wen,

486
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,270
any news about the Second Young Master?

487
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,400
He's already been brought back to the NBIS.

488
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:24,870
But don't worry.

489
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:25,670
He hasn't suffered

490
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:26,960
and won't be mistreated.

491
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:28,920
As for the rescue plan,

492
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,430
I've made some progress.

493
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,770
The Chief has agreed to officially investigate

494
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,680
the person who framed Yun Hongshen.

495
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:35,750
And you...

496
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:36,710
Don't worry.

497
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,540
Young Master has made all the necessary arrangements.

498
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,410
It's not convenient for us to stay at home now.

499
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,510
Here's our phone number.

500
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,750
Call us if there's an emergency.

501
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:52,750
A pair of cufflinks

502
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,820
isn't worth making a special call about.

503
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,990
I believe

504
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,240
Jingyu must have hosted

505
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,430
a trusted and familiar guest

506
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,790
yesterday afternoon.

507
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,430
In her call, she mentioned Shanghai,

508
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,310
cufflinks,

509
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,440
and the left drawer.

510
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,730
At least one of these keywords

511
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,710
was meant to signal Yun Hongshen,

512
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,390
revealing the purpose of her message—

513
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,230
and to be precise,

514
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,680
the identity of her guest.

515
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,910
Chief,

516
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,740
I suspect the person who instructed Jingyu

517
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,800
to make that call was Yang Ziming.

518
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,070
Do you have any evidence?

519
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:21,960
Yes.

520
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:24,220
Yesterday, I saw a freshly cleaned ashtray

521
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,330
in the Yun family's living room.

522
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,990
No one in the Yun family smokes,

523
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:30,600
so it must've been prepared for a guest.

524
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:31,830
Given the guest smokes

525
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,500
and is someone familiar with Jingyu,

526
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:35,790
the pool of suspects is quite small.

527
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,940
I immediately suspected Yang Ziming.

528
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,790
After returning, I had Director Xu

529
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,600
check Yang Ziming's phone records—

530
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,470
both at his office and home.

531
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,830
It turns out his office received a call

532
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:45,510
from a furniture store

533
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,590
named Zhiya House.

534
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,990
I sent people to investigate.

535
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,110
When they arrived,

536
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,140
the store was completely abandoned.

537
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,510
Taken together,

538
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,550
this evidence suggests

539
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,310
Yang Ziming has a relationship with Yun Hongshen

540
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,610
beyond their family connection.

541
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:02,630
If the assumption

542
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:05,110
that Yun Hongshen is a Communist is true,

543
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,310
then Yang Ziming is likely his superior.

544
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,350
Director Gong, you are being unusually quick to respond today.

545
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,570
Not as fast as your ability to predict everything.

546
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,560
Alright.

547
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,910
Since you're the one who discovered Zhiya House,

548
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:20,150
you'll handle the follow-up investigation.

549
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:20,860
Yes.

550
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,710
Also, check Yun Hongshen's house thoroughly.

551
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,830
Now that things have escalated this far,

552
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,590
we might as well go all in.

553
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:31,040
As for Mr. Shi's reasons for coming to Changsha,

554
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,590
he might leave disappointed.

555
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,710
Got everything ready?

556
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:40,300
Yes.

557
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:40,900
Good.

558
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,790
Remember what I told you.

559
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:43,710
Director Gong,

560
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,550
I'll go with you.

561
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,230
Director Ling,

562
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,660
why are you being so polite today?

563
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,370
Usually, you jump right in uninvited.

564
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:54,790
See you there.

565
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,100
Let's go.

566
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:33,620
Directors,

567
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,400
this is where they hid their radio transmitter.

568
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,220
This is just an outdated and useless piece of information.

569
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:44,010
At most, it proves the furniture store

570
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,200
was a Communist contact point.

571
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,200
It won't give us any

572
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,570
more valuable leads.

573
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,390
Our goal is to find a breakthrough,

574
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,900
something to firmly establish

575
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,580
Yun Hongshen as a Communist.

576
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,210
Understood.

577
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,490
Tweezers.

578
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,130
[Yun Residence]

579
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,450
-Search thoroughly.
-Yes.

580
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,790
Have you found anything?

581
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:54,550
Not yet.

582
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:21,820
Well, what do we have here?

583
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:23,940
They've done their homework,

584
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,390
tracking your every move

585
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:28,030
for days.

586
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,210
As long as the heart beats,

587
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,449
youth and freedom endure.

588
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,739
Classic Communist rhetoric.

589
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,850
White Clouds Beyond the Depths.

590
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:20,179
Could this be from Yun Hongshen?

591
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:21,380
Red Sun,

592
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,429
a Communist underground publication from Shanghai.

593
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,380
I think it's safe to conclude

594
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,350
that Yang Ziming instructed Jingyu to make that call.

595
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:35,370
Zhiya House was a Communist contact point.

596
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,480
They also sent people to the docks earlier

597
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,150
and discovered Zhang Xiancheng had been compromised.

598
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:41,030
They immediately notified Yang Ziming.

599
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:43,360
Yang Ziming was eager to know about Zhang Xiancheng's situation,

600
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,500
so he had Jingyu call and inform Yun Hongshen.

601
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:47,350
After their meeting,

602
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,489
they likely split up.

603
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,199
Yun Hongshen tried to capture me,

604
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:52,090
while Yang Ziming rushed back to Zhiya House

605
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,320
to evacuate their people

606
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:54,679
and destroy sensitive documents.

607
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:56,830
I had the technical team analyze

608
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,110
that loose thread we found at Zhiya House.

609
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,750
It's from high-end fabric.

610
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,710
There's no way the store's owner or staff

611
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,070
would wear something that luxurious.

612
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,180
And their customers wouldn't have

613
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,760
gone into the storage area either.

614
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,110
So, I'm certain

615
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,520
the clothing belongs to Yang Ziming.

616
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,320
And the murderer who killed Jingyu?

617
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:15,950
Yun Hongshen.

618
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,490
He returned home to destroy evidence

619
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,540
but was caught by Jingyu.

620
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,960
To protect his secret,

621
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,040
he had no choice but to silence her.

622
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,040
There were no signs of a struggle at the scene.

623
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,350
It's clear

624
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,480
Jingyu walked in willingly.

625
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:28,990
At that time,

626
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,720
the only people

627
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,290
she'd let her guard down for

628
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,120
in the study

629
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,790
would be Yun Hongshen

630
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,870
or Yun Hongqi.

631
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,630
That doesn't make sense.

632
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,570
If it were Yun Hongshen, he could have easily sent her away—

633
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:42,800
there was no need to kill her.

634
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:43,480
True.

635
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,450
A dead person can keep a secret,

636
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,950
but killing her would only

637
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:47,940
draw more suspicion.

638
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,040
Yun Hongshen returned to change the narrative,

639
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,310
not to create bigger problems

640
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,820
for himself.

641
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:53,980
It must have been a snap decision.

642
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,280
Our people arrived just as it happened.

643
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,040
He had no other choice

644
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,250
but to eliminate her.

645
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,710
You seem to have a knack for understanding the killer's mindset.

646
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:04,560
It's just speculation.

647
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:05,800
We'll need solid evidence

648
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,240
to confirm it.

649
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,860
How's that piece of paper coming along?

650
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,150
The technical team is working on restoring it.

651
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,290
Xu Bi is supervising.

652
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,230
As soon as it's restored,

653
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,320
he'll begin decoding it.

654
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,190
Minister Yang.

655
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:09,930
Chief Ke.

656
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,180
You dropped in uninvited.

657
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,350
What's the occasion?

658
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:14,790
Sorry to intrude.

659
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,210
May I take a look at your coat?

660
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:19,780
My coat?

661
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:20,380
Yes.

662
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:22,920
Sure.

663
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,540
Here you go.

664
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,470
Thank you.

665
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,470
Perfect fit.

666
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,030
Chief Ke,

667
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,150
you're quite attentive to detail.

668
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:17,630
Even small matters

669
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,040
don't escape you.

670
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:22,710
Minister Yang,

671
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,030
you've been very busy lately.

672
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:27,630
Chief Ke,

673
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,030
I just don't understand

674
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:31,290
what exactly you want to say.

675
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,210
Alright,

676
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,510
let's cut to the chase.

677
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,990
What was Zhang Xiancheng's mission in Changsha?

678
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,550
Zhang Xiancheng?

679
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:43,010
Who is Zhang Xiancheng?

680
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,150
We're both adults here.

681
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:48,110
Let's not play dumb.

682
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,230
I'm not playing dumb.

683
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,500
I'm genuinely clueless.

684
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,160
Fine.

685
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,050
Let me lay it out for you.

686
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,470
Zhang Xiancheng came to Changsha on a covert mission,

687
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,200
and you were his contact.

688
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,350
When something happened to him at the docks,

689
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,610
Zhiya House immediately

690
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,180
called you to report the situation.

691
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,230
To gather

692
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,900
more intel on Zhang Xiancheng,

693
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,320
you went to the Yun's Residence.

694
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:14,070
You had Jingyu call Yun Hongshen,

695
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,910
hoping to bring him back for a conversation.

696
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,230
Through the information Yun Hongshen relayed,

697
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,750
you realized the entire network

698
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,970
was compromised.

699
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:23,150
That's why

700
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:25,390
you ordered Yun Hongshen and the people

701
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,280
at Zhiya House to evacuate.

702
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,120
Now Zhiya House is empty.

703
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:31,510
But Yun Hongshen, focused on capturing Ling Han,

704
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,700
disobeyed your orders

705
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,840
and got himself arrested.

706
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,750
As for you, you stayed behind

707
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:39,220
for one reason—

708
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,360
to rescue Yun Hongshen

709
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,430
before things spiral

710
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,860
further out of control.

711
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:44,920
So you,

712
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:45,910
Yun Hongshen,

713
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,840
Zhang Xiancheng,

714
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:48,540
and the people at Zhiya House,

715
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:49,910
are all Communists.

716
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,580
Good story.

717
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:55,370
Clever plot.

718
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,310
However,

719
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:00,010
Chief Ke, I'd like to ask,

720
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,230
do you have evidence

721
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,790
for any of this?

722
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:04,650
Does evidence matter?

723
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,190
Ah,

724
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,270
I almost forgot—

725
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,150
the NBIS never needed evidence

726
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,690
when framing people,

727
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,530
right?

728
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,240
Evidence or no evidence,

729
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,110
I just want to know,

730
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,830
if I report everything I just said

731
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:20,270
to my superiors,

732
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,440
what do you think their reaction would be?

733
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,610
I recall hearing a joke recently.

734
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:29,090
You have a subordinate named Ling Han, right?

735
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:30,150
Rumor has it,

736
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,790
he's a Japanese spy.

737
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:37,770
Well...

738
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,080
Imagine if

739
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:42,130
Mr. Chen Lifu heard about this—

740
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,190
how do you think he'd react?

741
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,260
As expected of Minister Yang—

742
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,160
even your threats are artful.

743
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,670
Threats?

744
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,630
You misunderstand me.

745
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:02,890
I'm merely

746
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:06,190
stating facts.

747
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,190
Chief Ke,

748
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:12,250
please have some tea.

749
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:15,430
No need.

750
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:17,190
I have official duties to attend to.

751
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:17,930
I'll take my leave.

752
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:18,660
I won't see you out then.

753
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:37,740
Keep a close eye on him.

754
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:38,330
Yes, sir.

755
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,790
Were you followed?

756
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:56,840
No.

757
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,070
I was careful.

758
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,150
Now tell me,

759
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,550
why were you so desperate to meet?

760
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,200
Yun Hongshen slipped this into my house.

761
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,780
[Illegitimate Child]

762
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:10,430
Deputy Chief,

763
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:12,190
what does this mean?

764
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,870
Such a smart young man.

765
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,860
It's a shame he has to die.

766
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:42,230
It wasn't me.

767
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,310
I just arrived too.

768
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:44,790
My bullets are all accounted for.

769
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:45,790
Check if you don't believe me.

770
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:52,870
Something's wrong inside.
