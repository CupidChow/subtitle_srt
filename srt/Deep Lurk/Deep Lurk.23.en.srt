97
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,290
She was trying to make me suspicious of Li Miaohan.

The person who silenced Cong Hu and his mistress

114
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,670
could also be a breakthrough.

115

Have you investigated that?

116
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,120
Cong Hu took a back road on his way home,

117
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,220
possibly because he heard his mistress was sick

118
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,170
and was in a hurry to get back.

119
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,140
The road where he was killed is very remote.

it's difficult to pinpoint a direction.

The person who killed Cong Hu's mistress

126
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,470
must be an experienced killer.

127

and we catch them,

141
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:07,770
that would count as an achievement, wouldn't it?

142
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,960
What exactly are you trying to do?

I want to catch the killer more than anyone.

147
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,600
When our Master was alive,

148
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,710
we did have a grudge against the Young Master Yun,

149
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,950
but even then, we didn't dare to do anything too drastic,

150
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,280
let alone now.

151
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,750
Even if it were just for the sake of our brothers,

152
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,680
I wouldn't dare to make a mortal enemy of the Yun family.

153
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,120
I know it wasn't you.

154

You're wise, Madam.

155
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,920
So wise.

What did you ship that day?

159
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:42,970
Don't you know?

160
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,030
I remember now.

161
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,130
The newspapers have been talking about this a lot lately.

162
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,540
Well...

163
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,220
As for that special shipment,

164
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,600
we never ask what the client is shipping.

165
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,020
It's the code of the trade.

166
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,260
No,

167
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,250
it's no use just staring at me like that.

168
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,350
Even if you beat me to death,

169
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,540

Come out!

179
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,430

I've been your neighbor for seven or eight years.

186
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,910
Your father didn't feed you.

187
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,990
I often stole food from our home to give you.

188
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,930
Now you've made it big,

189
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,890
you have no conscience at all!

190
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,080
Sister, let's go inside to talk.

191
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:58,820
I'm not going in.

192
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,120
I have to say this in front of everyone

193
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:02,600
to clear things up.

194
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,610
Zeng Mengying!

195
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:06,570
Taking advantage of my illiteracy,

196
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,050
you conspired with Zhang from the pharmacy to put on an act

197
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,980
[Contract]

198
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,330
and tricked me into signing this investment agreement.

199
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,170
You're trying to drag my husband Tang into this mess?

200
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,570
Let me tell you,

201
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,850
there's not a chance!

202
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,850
My husband knows nothing about this.

203
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,160
He hasn't even seen this thing.

204
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,970
Now that you've fallen from grace,

205
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,780
you're using this to threaten him,

206
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,220
making him clean up your mess.

207
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:26,920

208
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,370
I signed it,

209
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,200
and I put my fingerprint on it.

210
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,240
If you want to come at someone, come at me.

211
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,690
I'll see it through to the end.

212
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,570
You two are putting on a show for me now.

213
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,050
If you're not going to honor it, you should have said so earlier.

214
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,910
Why make such a scene?

215
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,640
When you took money from our family,

216
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,240
you two didn't have this attitude.

217
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,570
If I took any dirty money from your Happy House,

218
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,810
may I be struck by lightning

219
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,890
and die a horrible death!

220
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,680
Do you dare to make such a vicious oath?

221
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,820
Mrs. Tang,

222
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,800

223

Fine.

225
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,850
Then make a vicious oath right now.

226
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:06,190
If what you, Jin Gui, just said wasn't true,

227
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,610
may Bai Qingkui never be reborn as a human

228
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,240
and forever remain an animal.

229
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:13,830
You...

230
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:14,640
What?

231
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,690
You don't dare, do you?

232
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,720
You don't dare to make the oath, right?

233
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,400
Everyone,

234
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,600
did you all see that?

235
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,650
She doesn't dare to make this vicious oath at all.

236
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,600
My husband and Bai Qingkui,

237
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,880
as well as all the dirty business Jin Gui and others did,

238
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,930
do not have the slightest connection!

239
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,430
Absolutely nothing!

240

241

So, what can I do for you?

309
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,260
You had an old classmate named Su Xiao.

Are you still in touch with her?

311
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,410

312

This Mr. Zhou, who suddenly appeared,

320
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,400
made Mi Lan very uneasy.

321
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,590

323
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,080

00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,300
I didn't mean it that way.

375
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:22,890
Well,

376
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,170
I'm now representing the Organization to give you a proposal.

377
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,300
Please consider it.

378
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,500
Go ahead.

379
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,350
Patriotic individuals close to our Party

380
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,250
have jointly established a school in the base area,

381
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,590
specifically for taking in orphans of martyrs

382
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,370
and children who fight in special positions.

383
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,170
All their living needs

384
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,800
will be taken care of by the Party organization.

385
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,350
You mean

386
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,620
the Organization will help me take care of my children?

387
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:49,250
Of course.

388
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,530
Moreover,

389
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,010
there, they will receive an excellent education.

390
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:54,960
There are dedicated people to take care of them.

391
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,770
If you're willing,

392
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,790
I'll arrange for Du to send them there as soon as possible.

393
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,210
Now, with the Japanese army eyeing Changsha from outside the city,

394
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:09,250
I want to do more work for the Party.

395
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:11,300
But these two children

396
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,000
are indeed a burden for me.

397
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,290
If the Organization can help me take care of the children,

398
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,530
that would be great.

399
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:17,570
However,

400
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,970
I'm afraid of causing trouble for the Organization.

401
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,770
You don't need to have such concerns at all.

402
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,430
This is also to lighten your burden

403
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,460
so you can work better.

404
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:27,960
It's settled, then.

405
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:29,920
Thank you.

406
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,910
Why don't you take a break for a while?

407
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:34,900
We won't assign you any tasks during this period.

408
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,490
No need.

409
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:36,970
I can manage.

410
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,660
Does the Organization have a new assignment?

411
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,460
Second Young Master,

412
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,280
you're back.

413
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,140
Did I wake you up?

414
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,380
I haven't fallen asleep yet.

415
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:25,360
I was waiting for you to return.

416
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,020
What's wrong? Did something happen?

417
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,570
Officer Wen came by.

418
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,030
I asked her if there was anything,

419
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,140
but she said no,

420
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,070
just passing by.

421
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:35,790
I see.

422
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,140
You should go to bed early.

423
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,890
Then, Second Young Master,

424
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,200
you should rest early too.

425
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,090
Can't sleep, huh?

426
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,770
About your situation,

427
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:49,900
Yang has told me everything about it.

428
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,760
I completely understand how you feel.

429
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,730
Actually,

430
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:00,120
I've had a similar experience to yours.

431
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,140
Many years ago,

432
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,320
because of a wrong decision I made,

433
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,880
my closest brother

434
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,190
and my best friend got killed.

435
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:20,120
My brother had just started a family,

436
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,800
and my sister-in-law was pregnant.

437
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,050
He was only 21 when he died,

438
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,070
never hearing his child call him "Dad."

439
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,330
My best friend was killed

440
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,270
while covering for me.

441
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,750
I hated myself so much at that time.

442
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,650
I took all the weapons

443
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:43,080
and went to seek revenge alone.

444
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,470
I thought

445
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,630
if I could kill all the enemies,

446
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,490
even if it cost me my life,

447
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:51,070
at least I'd have done right by my brothers.

448
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,770
Later, Yang saved me.

449
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,130
He asked me a question.

450
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,050
He said, "If you die,

451
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,280
who will your sister-in-law,

452
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,490
your unborn nephew,

453
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,150
and your friend's family

454
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,690
rely on in the future?"

455
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:15,810
Young man,

456
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,100
we need to make amends for our mistakes.

457
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,730
Treating the living well

458
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,510
is the greatest comfort to the deceased.

459
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,220
Thank you.

460
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:30,780
Hello?

461
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:31,960
Mr. Yang,

462
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:33,660
I'm your real estate agent.

463
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,210
I'm returning to my hometown to stay with relatives tomorrow.

464
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,000
I'll have to entrust your property to someone else to look after.

465
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:56,210
Something's happened in Shanghai.

466
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,140
Tomorrow morning,

467
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,590
we'll have a guest coming to Changsha.

468
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,950
Have Nighthawk pick him up personally.

469
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:00,700
Understood.

470
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,170
Be good when you get there.

471
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,610
Take care of your sister.

472
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:25,920
Did you hear me?

473
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,170
You're the big brother.

474
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:27,780
Okay.

475
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,460
Come on.

476
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:47,880
Get in the car.

477
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,110
-Be good.
-Bye, Dad.

478
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:07,920
Goodbye.

479
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:26,580
Captain.

480
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:30,740
Leader Yun,

481
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:31,490
what brings you here?

482
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:32,290
Captain Tang,

483
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,480
I know who ran over and killed Cong Hu.

484
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,060
[Cao's Bun Shop]

485
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,260
Come on!

486
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:41,530
Cao's Bun Shop, big buns!

487
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,620
Thin dough, big filling, and eighteen folds!

488
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:49,370
Officers,

489
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:51,130
please come in.

490
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,350
What would you like?

491
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:53,950
Does he look like him?

492
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:57,480
Captain,

493
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,260
you know what,

494
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,400
he does look quite similar.

495
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:02,230
His physical characteristics match the description given by the witness.

496
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:05,270
W-What do you mean?

497
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:06,580
Name?

498
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,520
Cao Yuan.

499
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:09,520
The day before yesterday, between 9:00 and 9:30 AM,

500
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,100
where were you?

501
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,350
The morning of the day before yesterday?

502
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,310
I was in my shop.

503
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,180
Who can prove it?

504
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:16,160
All the staff here can prove it.

505
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,250
Besides them, who else can prove it?

506
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,160
Who else?

507
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:25,810
There were quite a few customers in my shop that day,

508
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:29,000
but I don't know them

509
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,080
and can't find them.

510
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:32,170
Alright then,

511
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,600
provide me with the physical characteristics

512
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,270
of the customers who ate here that morning,

513
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:36,130
all of them.

514
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:37,210
We'll go look for them ourselves.

515
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,040
Officer,

516
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,270
customers come and go to my shop every day.

517
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,400
I can't remember all of them.

518
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,370
Can't remember, huh?

519
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:48,840
Take him away.

520
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,450
Let's go.

521
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,760
No, no, no, please, Officer.

522
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,430
What is this all about?

523
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,940
There must be a reason, right?

524
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,560
Do you know Jin Gui from Happy House?

525
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,680
I've heard of her,

526
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,880
but I don't know her.

527
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,160
Let him go.

528
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:01,520
Her bodyguard

529
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:04,070
was run over and killed by someone on a motorcycle the day before yesterday.

530
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,000
Someone reported

531
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,400
that they saw you at the scene.

532
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:06,900
This...

533
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:09,330
But you said you were at your bun shop that morning,

534
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,610
and you can't find any suitable witnesses.

535
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,580
So, we have no choice but to ask you

536
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,930
to come back to the police station with us.

537
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,010
Who is that,

538
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,450
making baseless accusations in broad daylight?

539
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:22,510
Officer,

540
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,050
how about this?

541
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,370
I'll think it over with my staff

542
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,400
and see if we can remember who came here that day.

543
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,990
I'll report back to you later.

544
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:30,830
Is that okay?

545
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,190
Report back later?

546
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,510
What if you run away?

547
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,660
No, I won't, Officer.

548
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:40,450
My shop is still here.

549
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,930
Even if I can run away, I can't bring my shop with me.

550
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,760
I see.

551
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:47,680
Alright then.

552
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:50,010
I'll give you one more day.

553
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,760
You must think carefully.

554
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:57,620
Thank you, Officer.

555
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,200
Let's go.

556
00:37:59,170 --> 00:37:59,880
We're leaving.

557
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,490

00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:45,930
follow them.

562
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:46,650
Okay.

563
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:54,780
Take care, Sir.

564
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,410
Cao Yuan assassinated Li Miaohan's lover.

565
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:05,230
It's clearly on Zong Fang's orders.

566
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:06,410
From this, we can see that

567
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,160
Zong Fang is his superior.

568
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,570
And Mi Lan is Zong Fang's superior.

569
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,860
As long as Cao Yuan goes to tell Zong Fang

570
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:13,840
about the police visit,

571
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,830
Zong Fang will definitely inform Mi Lan.

572
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,250
Because this matter involves Cong Hu's murder.

573
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,630
Hello, Military Hospital.

574
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,400
Excuse me,

575
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,520
is the Head Nurse available?

576
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,550
The Head Nurse is in surgery.

577
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,560
She might not be available for another hour.

578
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:31,770
Is there any message you'd like me to pass on to her?

579
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,670
Please tell her

580
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,350
that the matter she asked me to handle the day before yesterday morning

581
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,600
has been questioned by someone.

582
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:41,170
Alright.

583
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,520
I've got it.

584
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,430
I'll definitely pass on the message to her later.

585
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,560
[Call 69745 if anything abnormal happens]

586
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,500
I think I understand what you mean.

587
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,230
Look,

588
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,230
Zong Fang

589
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:06,000
is afraid that the NBIS will trace from Cao Yuan

590
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,250
to him and Mi Lan.

591
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,780
So he will definitely warn Mi Lan.

592
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,060
And Mi Lan was previously

593
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,440
frightened by Mr. Zhou from the nursing school.

594
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,030
Now, with Cao Yuan's incident added,

595
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,030
she's worried that the NBIS will target her,

596
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,040
which could lead to uncovering Kunwu.

597
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:21,890
So,

598
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:24,250
when she receives Zong Fang's warning,

599
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,740
she will immediately inform Kunwu.

600
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,470
That's right.

601
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,070
Notify the directors of the divisions

602
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:45,100
to stand by in their offices.

603
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:47,210
We might need to have a meeting later.

604
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,240
Understood.

605
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:59,590
Now,

606
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,560
I'll just wait and see if Ling Han takes the bait.

607
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,240
Ask Xu Weihua to come to my office.

608
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,530
Sir, stop here.

609
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:34,590
Thank you.

610
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,840
About Wu Tong's allergy to Florida water,

611
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,540
who else knows about it?

612
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:47,860
Wu Tong said

613
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:49,410
this kind of thing shouldn't be spread around.

614
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,450
If his enemies found out,

615
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,990
they might use it against him.

616
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,250
So,

617
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:55,300
besides me,

618
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:56,870
only his parents know.

619
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:57,890
Oh, right.

620
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:58,780
There's one more person.

621
00:41:59,150 --> 00:41:59,610
Who?

622
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:00,990
Liu.

623
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,700
Once, when Liu came to see Wu Tong,

624
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,020
he was wearing Florida water.

625
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:06,710
Wu Tong had an allergic reaction right away.

626
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,360
So Liu found out.

627
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:09,750
But I asked him

628
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,950
not to tell anyone.

629
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:12,140
Liu...

630
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,520
Leader Wen.

631
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,320
The scent of Florida water...

632
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:32,640
The person who interrogated Wu Tong that day was Xu Weihua.

633
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:35,400
Is this just a coincidence?

634
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:37,850
We need to dig deeper into Wu Tong's allergy.

635
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,660
I think the person who could do this

636
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:40,740
right under our noses

637
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,420
is most likely the mole.

638
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,560
Wu Tong had the incident during Ling Han's interrogation,

639
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,540
during the interrogation of Linghan, right?

640
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,990
Has Ling Han's office phone been tapped?

641
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:50,600
Yes.

642
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,320
Come in.

643
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:53,970
Chief.

644
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,120
Deputy Chief.

645
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:58,480
Wu Tong's test results are out.

646
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,060
Liu is already dead.

647
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,320
There's no way to confirm

648
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,850
if he told anyone about Wu Tong's allergy

649
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:03,650
to Florida water.
