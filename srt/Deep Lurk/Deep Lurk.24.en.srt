[Episode 24]

3
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,910
Wu Tong's examination report is out.

4
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:42,550
Liu is already dead.

5
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:43,850
There's no way to confirm

6
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,270
if he told anyone about Wu Tong's allergy

7
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,009
to Florida water.

8
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:47,710
Bai Qingkui, Zong Fang,

9
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,570
and the mole in our station might know it.

10
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:51,990
The person who interrogated Wu Tong that day

11
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:53,850
was Xu Weihua.

12
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,150
Just now in the hallway,

13
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,990
I smelled a faint scent

14
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,380
of Florida water on him.

15
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,580
I asked around a few colleagues,

16
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,150
and he has indeed been using Florida water these days.

17
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,740
Xu Weihua?

18
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,580
He couldn't have come up with such an intricate method

19
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,600
to harm Wu Tong.

20
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,390
Go and detain Xu Weihua.

21
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,530
You interrogate him personally.

22
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,480
Alright.

23
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,470
Come with me.

24
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,360
Deputy Chief,

25
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,420
is there some misunderstanding between us?

26
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,870
Where were you going?

27
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,620
I...

28
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,520
I'm on a mission.

29
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,790
Director Ling assigned it.

30
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,090
What mission?

31
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,730
Ling Han ordered me to follow Yun Hongshen.

32
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,870
Hello.

33
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,710
How much is this?

34
00:02:58,730 --> 00:02:59,460
Ten cents.

35
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,000
I'll take a look.

36
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,710
[You're exposed. Withdraw immediately.]

37
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:25,900
What is she doing?

38
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,440
Rickshaw! Rickshaw!

39
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,310
Exposed.

40
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,430
No, that's not right.

41
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,829
Something must have gone wrong.

42
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,120
It was wiped so clean.

43
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,110
He was afraid of leaving fingerprints.

44
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,570
Truly a meticulous person.

45
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:07,920
Catch him!

where are you going?

49
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,960
Before my patience runs out,

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,880
you'd better answer my questions truthfully.

51
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,420
Yes.

52
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:35,190
Did you send Xu Weihua

53
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,450
to interrogate Wu Tong that day?

54
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,110
Yes.

55
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,430
Did you know that Wu Tong was allergic to Florida water?

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,240
I didn't know before that day.

57
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,250
How can you prove it?

58
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,350
I can't.

59
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:49,040
You just received a phone call in your office.

60
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,950
Tell me what it was about.

61
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,820
[You're exposed. Withdraw immediately.]

62
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,940
What else do you have to say?

63
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:25,510
Chief.

64
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,500
This is obviously a trap set by a smart man.

65
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,450
A seemingly irrefutable piece of evidence,

66
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,420
combined with a few undeniable doubts,

67
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,360
is enough to make you question me.

68
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,650
But in fact,

69
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,130
apart from this recording just now

70
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,190
that can directly prove I'm suspected of being a mole,

71
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,270
all other accusations

72
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,260
don't stand up to scrutiny.

73
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,560
Xu Weihua has been using Florida water these days.

74
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,260
Many people know about this.

75
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,159
Those who could use this information

76
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,170
are not limited to just me.

77
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,000
I don't want to hear these explanations.

78
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,159
I just want to know,

79
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,260
what would you do if you were exposed?

80
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,330
Flee?

81
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,060
Or stubbornly cling to Yun Hongshen's codebook?

82
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,560
Speak!

83
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,430
I can't directly refute

84
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,350
your accusations against me,

85
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,790
but I can indirectly prove my innocence.

86
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,600
I prepared a surprise for you.

87
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,850
If you use it properly,

88
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,470
we might be able to eliminate the spy network in Changsha.

89
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,310
Why didn't you mention this before?

90
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:22,850
You know the reason.

91
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,120
Our security risks still exist.

92
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,280
Do you think there are no

93
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,750
security risks now?

94
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,870
As long as this secret is known only to you and me,

95
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,010
there's no fear of leaks.

96
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,350
Alright.

97
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,720
I'd like to hear

98
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,150
what kind of surprise you have for me.

99
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,450
If there isn't one,

100
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,200
a bullet will be waiting for you.

101
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,940
Take him to the interrogation room.

102
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,310
If you have anything to say to me in private, go ahead.

103
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,710
Chief,

104
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,300
I have a question I'd like to ask you.

105
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,990
Speak.

106
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,000
There's a paradox in today's events.

107
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,720
If I were really the mole,

108
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,240
how could the Japanese possibly

109
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,300
have someone call directly to my office?

110
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,250
The risk of exposure would be too high.

111
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,710
So the person who made the call is the key.

112
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,950
Someone is framing me.

113
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,500
What do you think?

114
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,270
I didn't expect you to be such a master of sophistry.

115
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,630
I believe this is all logical reasoning.

116
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,830
I believe you agree with this deep down.

117
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:36,950
Otherwise,

118
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,230
based on that recording alone,

119
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,690
you could have just executed me.

120
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:40,850
But you didn't.

121
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,490
It shows that you still want to find out the truth.

122
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,190
I believe in reasoning that aligns with human nature.

123
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,080
But I also believe in deductions that align with human nature.

124
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,540
Ling Han, I know you very well.

125
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,120
You are extremely confident,

126
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,270
but at the same time, extremely insecure.

127
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,020
You enjoy manipulating others,

128
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,710
just like you're doing now.

129
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,260
You're clearly in a desperate situation,

130
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,480
but with your own abilities,

131
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,680
you can turn the tables.

132
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,830
You are excited, aren't you?

133
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,270
It's precisely because you're excited

134
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,870
that you've lowered your risk assessment.

135
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,430
Yes,

136
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,410
you can control the entire situation.

137
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,590
You're also very clever.

138
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,640
But others aren't fools either.

139
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,950
Tell me what the truth is.

140
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,270
Ji Fang, the head of the Technical Investigation Department,

141
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,990
had a fiancée before.

142
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,840
They suddenly broke up recently.

143
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,140
I found it strange,

144
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:36,150
so I did some digging.

145
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:37,950
It turns out that woman

146
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:39,409
is Zong Fang's radio operator.

147
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,120
I didn't alert anyone.

148
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,320
I just secretly monitored this radio station.

149
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,840
All the investigation results

150
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,140
and monitoring records are in my safe house.

151
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,420
The one you visited last time.

152
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,270
Dao,

153
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,460
do you think if I had gone back earlier that day,

154
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,880
I could have saved Grandma?

155
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,220
I think the Old Madam would have wanted you to return later,

156
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,800
the later the better.

157
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,500
If you had gone back at that time,

158
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,850
you would have run into her,

159
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,260
the killer.

160
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,110
She wouldn't have been kind to you.

161
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,190
The Old Madam loved you the most.

162
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,920
She absolutely wouldn't want to see you

163
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,360
come to any harm.

164
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,480
You don't understand.

165
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,850
You don't get it.

166
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:34,950
Young Master.

167
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,420
Take care of yourself.

168
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,330
Where are you going?

169
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,390
I know you're hurting right now.

170
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,120
I'll go kill her for you.

171
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,160
Even if the Second Young Master blames us later,

172
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,860
I will take full responsibility for my actions.

173
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,890
It won’t implicate you.

174
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,670
You can't kill her.

175
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,470
Your martial arts skills are indeed better than mine,

176
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,610
but that's only good for fighting ordinary people.

177
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,280
Shen told me

178
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,670
these spies are trained in lethal techniques.

179
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,620
If you go, you'll be throwing your life away.

180
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,920
There's no coming back.

181
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,580
Young Master,

182
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:12,810
it's alright.

183
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,610
-I won’t come back alive if I go...
-Shut up!

184
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,030
I'm warning you,

185
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,120
from now on,

186
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,840
don't ever say such nonsense in front of me again.

187
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,670
Do you understand?

188
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,550
Stay here.

189
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,090
Young Master!

190
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,270
Young Master.

191
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,680
Dinner is ready inside.

192
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,750
I just caught some fish today.

193
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:30,620
There's braised fish,

194
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,350
and steamed fish.

195
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,330
Hei.

196
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:33,910
Thank you

197
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,910
for taking care of us during this time.

198
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,050
It was Yang who sent you here.

199
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,090
His friends

200
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,300
are my friends.

201
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,680
Please, don't be so formal.

202
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:42,880
Young Master,

203
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,550
hurry up.

204
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,220
I've warmed up the yellow rice wine.

205
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,020
Okay!

206
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,690
Let's eat.

207
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,830
It's a 30-year-old vintage.

208
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:57,790
How much do you have?

209
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,790
Plenty.

210
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,710
Since you said so.

211
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:06,690
[The spy network has been severely compromised. Please send personnel for replacement immediately.]

212
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,190
Deputy Chief.

213
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:38,750
Have a seat.

214
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,500
I didn't expect Ling Han to have an ace up his sleeve.

215
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,480
Someone like him,

216
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,540
will always have a backup plan.

217
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,530
It's not surprising.

218
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,430
Aren't you planning to tell me

219
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,820
who called Ling Han?

220
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,380
Unless I can convict Ling Han,

221
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,810
I can't say anything.

222
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,410
We should think about

223
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,640
what to do next.

224
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,020
I think we can

225
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,520
make use of that enemy radio station.

226
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,920
Although Ling Han was ruthless this time

227
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,520
and sacrificed some of his operatives,

228
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,460
but

229
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,020
he should think about how to explain this to the Japanese.

230
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,820
That's an issue.

231
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,690
So he must have another move planned.

232
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,170
I'm wondering

233
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,190
how valuable that radio station is.

234
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,440
If it's just

235
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,600
an auxiliary station,

236
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,970
then everything we've done might have been in vain.

237
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,760
So...

238
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,220
Hello.

239
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:38,450
Where's Wen Yeming?

240
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,720
Leader Wen just left.

241
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,380
Leader Yun,

242
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,090
do you need anything?

243
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:42,090
Where did she go?

244
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,070
I have an urgent matter to discuss with her.

245
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,630
She went out after receiving a phone call.

246
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,010
She didn't say where she was going.

247
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,380
Secretary Wu,

248
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,360
it's me.

249
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,550
Is it convenient to talk?

250
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,640
Yes, it is.

251
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,280
Go ahead.

252
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,670
Have you had someone follow Ling Han these past few days?

253
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:15,680
We have,

254
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,500
but he's very alert.

255
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,760
Our people often lose him.

256
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,210
However,

257
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,220
I've managed to narrow down a general location.

258
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,120
Where is it?

259
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:26,580
Xiangyang Road.

260
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,240
Where did you run off to?

261
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:36,790
Deputy Chief,

262
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,550
I request that you return to the station immediately

263
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:39,670
and help me trace a phone call.

264
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,490
What's so urgent?

265
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,130
It's a matter of life and death.

266
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,690
Wen Yeming might be in danger.

267
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,860
Ling Han revealed an enemy radio station.

268
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,350
Ke Jingping will definitely investigate further.

269
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,310
But now both Ling Han and Zhu He are under suspicion.

270
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,710
If Ke Jingping is planning any action,

271
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,640
he won't just keep those two out of it,

272
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,250
but he won't fully trust

273
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,820
the other department directors either.

274
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:02,530
The only person he can trust

275
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,990
and who is capable of completing the mission

276
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:04,890
is Wen Yeming.

277
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,440
The most urgent matter now

278
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,750
is to find Wen Yeming first.

279
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,340
But where exactly is Ling Han's safe house?

280
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,270
Sir.

281
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,060
Are we safe?

282
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,300
We are.

283
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,360
I parked the car

284
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,550
two blocks away from here

285
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,310
and walked here.

286
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,960
I'm sure no one followed me.

287
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,340
Sir,

288
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,270
do you have a mission for me?

289
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,890
We've been continuously uncovering Japanese spies in Changsha.

290
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,970
They should be short-staffed now,

291
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,370
so they've reported to their superiors

292
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,190
and asked for more men.

293
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,690
There's no news yet,

294
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,870
but I estimate it won't be later than tomorrow.

295
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,480
So, stay in this area.

296
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,490
If there's any news,

297
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,600
report to me immediately.

298
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:51,610
Yes, Sir.

299
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,580
Before this mission is over,

300
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,680
you are not to contact anyone

301
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,550
except me.

302
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:57,570
Can you do that?

303
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,720
Any problems?

304
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:02,710
No, Sir.

305
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,770
I must uncover the Japanese spy network in Changsha.

306
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,350
This is where Ke Jingping

307
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,460
made the call to Wen Yeming.

308
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,150
Secretary Wu arranged for someone to follow Ling Han.

309
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,470
Although they couldn't find his safe house,

310
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,210
they did get the key location of Xiangyang Road.

311
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,670
Yun Hongshen used the phone booth and Xiangyang Road as coordinates

312
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,630
to mark out a general area.

313
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,640
The Chief urgently called Wen Yeming away,

314
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,870
which indicates the situation is urgent.

315
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,110
He couldn't have gone far to make the call,

316
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,230
so Ling Han's safe house

317
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,150
should be within this area.

318
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,550
This street is full of old houses.

319
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,170
The residents know each other.

320
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,430
So it's impossible for Ling Han

321
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,670
to set up his safe house here.

322
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,330
These are schools, police stations, and banks.

323
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,190
[Hunan Bank]

324
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,750
It can't be here either.

325
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,870
There are too many people coming and going.

326
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,850
It's impossible to keep it secret.

327
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,640
And many police officers know him.

328
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:55,930
This is a commercial street.

329
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,270
There's a high turnover of people.

330
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,050
The advantage is that he won't stand out in the crowd.

331
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,880
The disadvantage is that this is also

332
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,830
a place where people gather to hear gossip.

333
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,580
Given Ling Han's personality,

334
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,720
he wouldn't take such unnecessary risks.

335
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,660
None of these places seem likely.

336
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,340
I can't go door to door asking.

337
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,920
That bastard.

338
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,020
Where on earth did he set up his safe house?

339
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,300
Ling Han is a contradictory person.

340
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,500
He's cautious,

341
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,730
yet he has an adventurous spirit that most people don't have.

342
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,100
So on one hand,

343
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,180
he handled all the books in his house

344
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,280
without leaving any clues.

345
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,820
On the other hand,

346
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,800
he has a book

347
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,030
of the same book as Wen Yeming's.

348
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,070
This book itself doesn't have any flaws,

349
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,670
but in the eyes of a clever person,

350
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,890
the existence of this book is a clue.

351
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,230
If I investigate further,

352
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,720
I'll definitely uncover his inner secrets.

353
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,940
This is his weakness.

354
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:53,900
He's arrogant.

355
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,630
He firmly believes he's smarter than everyone else.

356
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,620
So,

357
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:57,950
sometimes he takes risks

358
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,430
that most people wouldn't dare to.

359
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,240
Among these seemingly impossible places,

360
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,260
there must be one that's the most unlikely,

361
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,490
yet relatively the safest place.

362
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,430
That's the place.

363
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,069
This area used to be where several major banks were concentrated.

364
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,260
After the big fire,

365
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,280
the government consolidated these banks

366
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,250
to form a new Hunan Bank.

367
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,560
Before the fire,

368
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,670
one of the banks was secretly expanding

369
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:36,860
a small underground vault.

370
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,510
[Hunan Bank]

371
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:38,750
This vault

372
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,550
was the private property of a high-ranking official.

373
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,260
This official was executed by Chiang Kai-shek

374
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,750
for dereliction of duty.

375
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,540
The person in charge of overseeing the construction

376
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,350
also died in the fire.

377
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,160
So this small vault became a secret.

378
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:09,670
Who's there?

379
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:10,640
It's me.

380
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,460
Why are you here?

381
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:25,730
Did the Chief send you?

382
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:29,850
Did you come on your own?

383
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:31,550
What do you want?

384
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,710
Tell me about your mission.

385
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:39,960
I can't tell you.

386
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,890
Unless the Chief agrees,

387
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,740
I must keep it secret from everyone.

388
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,400
It's the rules.

389
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,550
Do you know

390
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,240
when you accepted this mission,

391
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,110
it meant you were walking into the line of fire?

392
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,170
When Ling Han revealed this internal radio station,

393
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,500
he had already decided to send you out

394
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,810
to appease the Japanese.

395
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,160
He knows very well

396
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:58,990
in this situation,

397
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,290
the Chief will only trust you.

398
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,380
What did I tell you?

399
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,790
I know.

400
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,400
If I'm unlucky, I might not come back.

401
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,470
Don't talk nonsense.

402
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,460
Even if it's dangerous,

403
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,470
even if I can't come back,

404
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,030
even if I'm framed,

405
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,300
I have to complete this mission.

406
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,230
This is the oath I once took.

407
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,840
it's more precious than my life.

408
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,700
I can't betray it. You understand.

409
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,590
What about me?

410
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,750
Wen Yeming.

411
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,150
Let me finish.

412
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,280
In the past, when the Chief assigned me a mission,

413
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,950
my first reaction was excitement.

414
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:45,890
But just now,

415
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,250
when the Chief gave me orders,

416
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,590
I found myself thinking,

417
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,930
"What a pity.

418
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,480
I won't have time to say goodbye to him."

419
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,750
You know what?

420
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,300
People at the station

421
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,900
say in private that you're not a woman,

422
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,560
but a cold-blooded animal.

423
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,590
You never smile.

424
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,450
My real name...

425
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,210
Is Wen Yanzi.

426
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,920
For ten years,

427
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,270
I haven't allowed myself to be weak for a single moment.

428
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:33,730
I can't have weaknesses

429
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,790
or attachments.

430
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,640
Only then can I focus solely on completing my missions.

431
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,250
Now,

432
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,030
I'm allowing myself to be weak for five minutes

433
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,710
to admit my feelings for you,

434
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,860
to admit that I've had moments of doubt about my beliefs,

435
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,350
and to admit that I've

436
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,020
fantasized about being your woman.

437
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,600
When these five minutes are over,

438
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,320
I will still fulfill my original oath.

439
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,860
You should go.

440
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,250
I won't tell you anything.

441
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,410
I must complete this mission.

442
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,660
I also have a mission that I must complete,

443
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,190
a mission that can never change in this lifetime.

444
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,000
It's to be with you forever,

445
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,550
to protect you always.

446
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,260
No matter how dangerous it is for you,

447
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,070
I will protect you.

448
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,990
Since I've come here,

449
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,090
I can't possibly give up.

450
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,700
I want to complete this mission with you,

451
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,360
no matter how dangerous it is.

452
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,060
Even if we die at the enemy's gunpoint,

453
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,070
I hope

454
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,480
I can be by your side,

455
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,750
holding your hand as we die.

456
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:41,980
Explain.

457
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:43,600
Ling Han and I

458
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,230
have a grudge against him and the Japanese behind him.

459
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,820
I must participate in this operation.

460
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,870
Yun Hongshen, let me tell you this.

461
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,940
Even if you know the content of the recording,

462
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,480
I don't necessarily have to use you.

463
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,960
I can lock you up,

464
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,640
or even have you executed.

465
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,040
When the Chief comes and sees me later,

466
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,400
he'll definitely be very angry.

467
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,130
No matter what he says or does,

468
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,880
don't say anything.

469
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:14,880
Just stand by and watch.

470
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:16,800
Chief,

471
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,460
this is not the best option.

472
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,780
Currently, the identity of the mole in the station is a mystery.

473
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:22,870
Who can you truly trust?

474
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,070
Especially in this operation,

475
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,430
the most critical points

476
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,290
can only be entrusted to those you trust the most.

477
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,290
Wen Yeming alone can't handle it all.

478
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,740
Do you think I trust you?

479
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:32,900
I know that.

480
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,750
But besides Wen Yeming,

481
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,330
I am the most suitable candidate.

482
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,600
Because I hate the Japanese the most.

483
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,700
I will stop at nothing to get revenge.

484
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,080
So there's no way I would leak information.

485
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,640
And I will do everything in my power

486
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,680
to complete this mission.

487
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,430
Alright.

488
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,340
You said you followed me today.

489
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,580
Tell me about my route.

490
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,000
You left the station and took the main road.

491
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,720
You drove all the way to the city center,

492
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,970
then switched cars there.

493
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,150
You turned from Huangxing Road onto a small street,

494
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,620
finally parked the car

495
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,190
in an abandoned factory two kilometers away.

496
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,590
From there, you took a rickshaw

497
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,470
and got off near the police station.

498
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,560
You're quite cunning, aren't you?

499
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,030
You've avoided all the important questions.

500
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,910
Like where I switched cars,

501
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,440
which small street I turned onto from Huangxing Road,

502
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,590
and at the police station entrance,

503
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,790
did I get off on the left or right side?

504
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,790
I indeed can't answer these questions.

505
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,350
You're an expert and a master.

506
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,440
In all of Changsha, those who can keep up with you

507
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,410
are almost none.

508
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,550
I lost you several times in between,

509
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,100
so I drove around trying my luck,

510
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,000
attempting to cover all possible routes.

511
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:36,920
That's how I found this place.

512
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,400
You don't need to beat around the bush with me.

513
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,210
Ling Han's situation today is related to you, isn't it?

514
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,120
Speak!

515
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,540
I only did some guiding.

516
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,190
If Ling Han had no issues,

517
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,650
nothing would have happened.

518
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,550
Don't play these little tricks with me.

519
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,820
I'm aware of all your little games.

520
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:00,860
What did you do at the police station this morning?

521
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,860
To warn the tiger by beating the mountain.

522
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:02,990
As it turns out,

523
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,310
my plan was successful.

524
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,890
What about the person who called Ling Han?

525
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:06,720
It was Mi Lan.

526
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,510
If we want to catch her,

527
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,370
we can do it anytime.

528
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,350
Yun Hongshen, let me tell you this.

529
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,690
If you want to join this operation,

530
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,320
just listen to me.

531
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,710
Don't act on your own again.

532
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,110
Understood?

533
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:24,650
Understood.

534
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:28,830
Without my orders,

535
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:30,730
neither of you two is allowed to leave this place.

536
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,440
Wen Yeming.

537
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:34,910
Wen Yeming!

538
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,300
If he leaves without permission,

539
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,390
I'll hold you responsible.

540
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,290
Yes.

541
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,350
Chief,

542
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,790
Ling Han will surely find a way to notify his accomplices.

543
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:49,950
You should...

544
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,520
Whether Ling Han is the mole in our station

545
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,870
is not certain yet.

546
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,590
If your eagerness for revenge

547
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:55,690
jeopardizes our mission,

548
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,400
don't blame me for turning against you.

549
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,120
Zhang,

550
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,540
in the drawer of my office,

551
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:20,800
there's a copy of “Comprehensive History as a Mirror.”

552
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:21,830
Could you bring it to me?

553
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,010
I'd like to pass the time.

554
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,210
If you're not comfortable with that,

555
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,080
you can show it to the Chief first,

556
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:33,560
then bring it to me.

557
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,270
Chief, you wanted to see me?

558
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,150
If I'm not mistaken,

559
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,530
regarding Ling Han's matter,

560
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,060
you and Yun Hongshen have already formed an alliance, haven't you?

561
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,080
[Comprehensive History as a Mirror]

562
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,030
That's correct, Chief.

563
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,050
I am indeed working with Yun Hongshen

564
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:30,730
to catch the mole together.

565
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,880
Do you approve of the reckless thing

566
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,640
he did today?

567
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,620
I've confirmed with Captain Tang.

568
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,580
After they left Cao's Bun Shop,

569
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,990
Cao Yuan found an opportunity to go out

570
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,320
and made a phone call to Zong Fang's office.

571
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,510
Right after that, Zong Fang's call

572
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:46,800
was made to the Military Hospital.

573
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,390
Yun Hongshen came to me last night

574
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,630
and told me about this plan.

575
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,830
I thought we could give it a try,

576
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,220
so I tapped Zong Fang's phone.

577
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,480
Captain Tang's testimony

578
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:01,290
and the wiretap records of Zong Fang are all here.

579
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:09,250
Director Gong,

580
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,430
send people immediately

581
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,460
to arrest Zong Fang, Mi Lan,

582
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,800
and the owner of Cao's Bun Shop.

583
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,670
of Cao's Baozi Shop.

584
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,310
Hurry!

585
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,070
Search!

586
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,270
Search thoroughly!

587
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:38,650
Tell me,

588
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,220
when did your boss leave?

589
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,820
He left in the morning

590
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,560
and hasn't been back since.

591
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:45,870
Chief.

592
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:46,870
Come in.

593
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:49,950
Chief.

594
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,710
Director Ling just asked me to go to his office

595
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,540
to get this book.

596
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,930
He said it was to pass the time.

597
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,150
He asked me to bring it to you for inspection first.

598
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,110
Chief,

599
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,040
Ling Han

600
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,310
will definitely find a way to notify his accomplices.

601
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,170
He was not just getting a book.

602
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,580
He was sending a signal.

603
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,560
Who saw you taking the book?

604
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,230
Just now,

605
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,700
when I came out of Director Ling's office,

606
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,430
there was only a janitor cleaning in the hallway.

607
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,720
Go arrest that janitor!

608
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,270
Yes, Sir.

609
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,550
This janitor's name is Wei Xiaojun.

610
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,320
He's 28 years old

611
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,570
and came to the station two years ago.

612
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,090
We searched his dormitory

613
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,590
and found a large amount of cash,

614
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:54,190
definitely higher than his normal income level.

615
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,860
As for whether he came to the station with a mission

616
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,200
or was turned while at the station,

617
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,030
I'm still investigating.

618
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:14,110
Have you looked at all the photos here?

619
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:18,770
Yes, I have.

620
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:19,820
There's nothing unusual.

621
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:20,860
What is it?

622
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,300
Have you found something?

623
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,610
Everything here,

624
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,800
including these photos,

625
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,530
seems like it was deliberately arranged by Ling Han

626
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,400
for us to see.

627
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,490
You mean

628
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,840
Ling Han wouldn't keep his real secrets

629
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:32,550
here?

630
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,390
His real secrets

631
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,410
would only be hidden in his heart.

632
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,110
How could he let others see them?

633
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,710
What he's showing

634
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,310
are all unimportant things.

635
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,400
And he's very confident that

636
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,570
no one can see through his flaws.

637
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:52,090
[Changsha City Chamber of Commerce]

638
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:58,710

639
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:59,470

00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:07,470
Director,

648
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,510
that signal has appeared again.

649
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,960
Zong Fang, Mi Lan, and Cao Yuan.

650
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,590
These three people have nothing to do with me.

651
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,610
Yun Hongshen set me up

652
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:24,440
for his eagerness for revenge.

653
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,400
I don't want to hear these logical deductions.

654
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,350
I want real evidence.

655
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:31,430
Chief.

656
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,350
Since Yun Hongshen saw with his own eyes

657
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,390
that Mi Lan called me,

658
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,020
why didn't he arrest her immediately?

659
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,550
Answer my previous question.

660
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,920
What evidence do you have to prove your innocence?

661
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,520
I've already given you the evidence.

662
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:43,760
By tomorrow at the latest,

663
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,200
there will be a conclusion to this matter.

664
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,960
How do you explain Wei Xiaojun?

665
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,950
Wei Xiaojun was indeed working for me,

666
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:53,210
but I only asked him to keep an eye on

667
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,590
the situation of certain people in the station.

668
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:55,880
That's all.

669
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,740
Once he saw someone

670
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,600
go to your office to get "Comprehensive History as a Mirror,"

671
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,930
he would then make a call to pass on the information.

672
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,890
This was prearranged between you two, wasn't it?

673
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,480
I don't understand what you're saying.

674
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,620
I really just wanted to read a book.

675
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,280
It was too boring being locked up.

676
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:12,110
Reading a book?

677
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,200
Do you know that you and Yun Hongshen

678
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,550
have something in common?

679
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,390
It's that neither of you will give up until the very end.

680
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,070
But today, he's slightly ahead of you.

681
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,580
He not only gave me a complete set of deductions,

682
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:26,570
but he also provided me with a complete set of evidence.

683
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:27,830
And you?

684
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,900
You're just here quibbling.

685
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,600
Please be patient a little longer.

686
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,390
My evidence might already be on its way.

687
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:39,880
Chief,

688
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:40,710
urgent matter.

689
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:49,750
Chief,

690
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,490
this signal has appeared many times before.

691
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,590
I didn't report it to you because I hadn't grasped its pattern.

692
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,040
With everything that's happened today,

693
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,150
it suddenly appeared again.

694
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:57,450
I think it's not normal.

695
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,520
Before this signal appeared,

696
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,440
was there any overlap

697
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,430
with the matters we're investigating?

698
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,270
Not completely,

699
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,470
but very close.

700
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:04,930
Continue investigating.

701
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,400
Yes, Sir.

702
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:16,870
Tomorrow's operation

703
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:17,990
can only

704
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,350
be successful.

705
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:28,820
Are you saying she used a dog

706
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,120
to transmit the intelligence?

707
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,480
Most likely.

708
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,480
That woman

709
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:36,680
lives almost outside the suburbs.

710
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,620
Most of the area there

711
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:39,640
is inhabited by poor families.

712
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,940
They can't afford to install telephones.

713
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,180
So it's impossible

714
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,620
to transmit information by phone.

715
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,840
Moreover, after receiving the message,

716
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,110
she never went out again.

717
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,070
Only a dog went out.

718
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,380
About an hour later,

719
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,640
the dog came back.

720
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,910
This woman is too clever.

721
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,000
She actually thought of

722
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,470
using a dog to transmit information.

723
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,720
How about this?

724
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:00,300
Tomorrow's operation will be divided into two action groups.

725
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,810
One group will arrest this woman,

726
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,220
and the other group will arrest Mister.

727
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:03,970
Yes, Sir.

728
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,590
Tomorrow at 12 p.m.,

729
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,350
a train will arrive in Changsha.

730
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:09,390
A passenger ship will arrive at the port at the same time.

731
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,890
But the problem is,

732
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,740
we know nothing about this Mister.

733
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,110
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

734
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,250
I think that Mister is just a code name.

735
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,890
The Japanese wouldn't send just one person.

736
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:23,770
He's probably just a liaison.

737
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:26,940
The list of newly dispatched personnel

738
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,590
should be on him.

739
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:32,020
This Mister must be an important person.

740
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,380
He's very important to us to crack the Japanese spy network in Changsha.

741
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:36,840
So,

742
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,240
get this person.

743
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:39,190
-Yes, Sir.
-Yes, Sir.

744
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,010
Then, Chief,

745
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,100
what about Mi Lan and Zong Fang?

746
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,550
Mi Lan can't be found.

747
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,470
Zong Fang and Cao Yuan were both killed in the explosion.

748
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,740
They say even their bodies weren't found.

749
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,920
I feel something's not quite right about this.

750
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,630
Zong Fang and Cao Yuan aren't dead at all.

751
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,290
You mean

752
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,710
this whole thing

753
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,230
is just an elaborate trap?

754
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,030
Zong Fang and Cao Yuan were exposed,

755
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:06,650
so they simply found a way to fake their deaths.

756
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,310
This way, they can better escape our attention.

757
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,320
Moreover,

758
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:11,710
with Zong Fang "dead,"

759
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,710
it will be easier

760
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,610
to prepare for receiving Mister tomorrow.

761
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,080
Right?

762
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:17,670
That's right.

763
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,710
The Fuhua Passenger Ferry arriving at 12 p.m. tomorrow

764
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,900
belongs to the Hunan Shipping Company.

765
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,450
Zong Fang has shares in this company.

766
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,440
With this advantage,

767
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,680
he can plant his own people

768
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,750
in the shipping company and on the passenger ferry.

769
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,070
This way,

770
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,510
he can better ensure Mister's safety.

771
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,190
Even if something unexpected happens on the ferry,

772
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:41,390
he can eliminate witnesses.

773
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,850
So there's a very high chance Mister is coming by ship.

774
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,470
On the surface,

775
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:49,050
whether Mister comes by ship

776
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,920
or by train, both are possible.

777
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,640
But this telegram was sent to Zong Fang.

778
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,920
When the Japanese plan the route,

779
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,680
they not only consider safety issues,

780
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:59,780
but also take into account the difficulty of Zong Fang's arrangements,

781
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,420
potential incidents that might occur,

782
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,440
and how they would handle them.

783
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,700
So I want Mister alive.

784
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:06,710
-Yes, Sir.
-Yes, Sir.

785
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:11,480
Alright,

786
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:14,510
Tell me,

787
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:16,140
how did you know Zong Fang isn't dead?

788
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:19,830
Chief,

789
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,090
I guessed.

790
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,080
Guessed?

791
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,070
Do you think I'll believe that?

792
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:27,700
Whether you believe it or not,

793
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,240
this answer is indeed a guess.

794
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:33,300
Fine.

795
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,570
Then let me tell you something I guessed.

796
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:39,020
You're the one who kidnapped Li Miaohan's lover, aren't you?

797
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:41,430
Don't you plan to tell me

798
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,720
some of the intelligence you know?

799
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,560
Kiddo.

800
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,970
A person who carries too many secrets walks

801
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,710
with heavy steps.

802
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,550
If you can't walk at the critical moment, you will die.

803
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,220
Understand?

804
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:57,970
Understood.

805
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,670
[Bureau of Investigation and Statistics]

806
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:11,830
Without my orders,

807
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,140
none of you are allowed to leave the meeting room.

808
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:21,680
Wen Yeming.

809
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:22,990
Chief.

810
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:24,610
How are the preparations going?

811
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,520
Everyone was in position five minutes ago.

812
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:27,710
Go ahead.

813
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:28,610
Yes, Sir.

814
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:50,710
Director Gong,

815
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,290
the target is still at home.

816
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,260
No abnormalities detected.

817
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,560
Keep a close eye on her.

818
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,990
Wait for my orders to act.

819
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:56,720
Understood.

820
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,030
-Cigarettes.
-Candied haws.

821
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:23,580
Come take a look!

822
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:25,670
Cigarettes!

823
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,810
Flowers for sale!

824
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,860
Flowers for sale!

825
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,290
-Flowers for sale!
-Take a look.

826
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:38,880
Bro,

827
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:39,630
can I borrow a light?

828
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,380
Your first task

829
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,840
is to play your current roles convincingly.

830
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,560
-No need to observe.
-Thank you.

831
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:46,110
Don't do anything suspicious.

832
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:56,190
What kind of person will he be?
