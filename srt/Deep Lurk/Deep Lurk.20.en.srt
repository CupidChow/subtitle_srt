[Deep Lurk]

2
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:37,789
[Episode 20]

3
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:39,310
She's innocent.

4
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,789
She doesn't know anything

5
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:41,920
about my affairs.

6
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,039
I beg you.

7
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,229
Please keep her out of this.

8
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,360
Keep her out of this.

9
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,550
As long as you cooperate,

10
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,200
I won't disturb her.

11
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,630
I will.

12
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,990
On July 2nd,

13
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,630
who asked Bai Qingkui to smuggle goods?

14
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,699
After what happened with Deputy Chief Zhu,

15
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,960
I was so angry that I was up half the night.

16
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,470
But after I calmed down and thought about it,

17
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,300
I believe there are only three possibilities.

18
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:16,820
First,

19
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,490
Deputy Chief Zhu and Li Liang were not wrongly accused.

20
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:21,630
Then this matter

21
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,430
will become a complete scandal.

22
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,350
The Deputy Chief of the Hunan Station has defected to the enemy and betrayed the country.

23
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,410
It doesn't matter if I'm implicated,

24
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,030
but the losses caused by this matter

25
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,990
would be immeasurable.

26
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,870
The second possibility is that there is such a person behind it all,

27
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,630
someone who has managed to fool even Ling Han and myself.

28
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,350
The danger and cunning of this person

29
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,470
are beyond what we can imagine.

30
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,560
The third and most terrifying possibility...

31
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,360
is that this person is Ling Han.

32
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,950
Now, throughout the entire station,

33
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,790
I don't even

34
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,870
know who to trust and who not to trust.

35
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,810
I've failed in my duties as Chief.

36
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,430
Sir,

37
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,810
please don't think like that.

38
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,610
You have a clear conscience,

39
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,380
so naturally you wouldn't expect

40
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,830
someone to be so vile and shameless behind your back.

41
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,560
Don't worry;

42
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,930
I'll help you investigate and clarify everything.

43
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,230
Chief,

44
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,810
the Commander's adjutant has arrived.

45
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:26,650
Adjutant Chen.

46
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,310
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,790
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

48
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,430
Chief Ke,

49
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,150
I know you're busy,

50
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,560
so I'll get straight to the point.

51
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,560
I'm here on the Commander's orders.

52
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,870
There are two matters

53
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,990
that I need to get answers to from you.

54
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,870
I know what the Commander wants to ask.

55
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,130
I'm currently investigating the cipher key,

56
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,260
and there will be major progress soon.

57
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,600
As for Deputy Chief Zhu,

58
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,640
I know his relationship with the Commander.

59
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,510
However, I hope that no one interferes

60
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,970
while I am investigating.

61
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,079
You've covered everything,

62
00:03:59,079 --> 00:03:59,970
and I really...

63
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,390
But Chief Ke,

64
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,080
if you answer me like this,

65
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,350
I won't be able to report back properly.

66
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,410
What exactly is this major progress?

67
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,490
When can we obtain the cipher key?

68
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,540
When will Deputy Chief Zhu's case

69
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,180
be cleared up?

70
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:16,990
Chief Ke,

71
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,870
you're putting me in a difficult position.

72
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,730
Adjutant Chen,

73
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,070
the situation is exactly as I've said.

74
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,980
Even if the Commander himself were to ask,

75
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,630
I could only say the same thing.

76
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,390
Chief Ke,

77
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,190
the Commander said

78
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,690
that tracking down the cipher key

79
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,150
is indeed a bit difficult.

80
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,710
If...

81
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,710
you find it beyond your capabilities...

82
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,090
You can assure the Commander

83
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,130
that if even I can't find it,

84
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,210
then it's unlikely anyone else will be able to.

85
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:46,710
Chief,

86
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,150
Deputy Chief Zhu wants to see you.

87
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,750
Chief!

88
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,590
Chief, something terrible has happened.

89
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,590
Director Ling's interrogation causes Wu Tong to have an attack.

90
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,450
Please go check on him right away.

91
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,720
I can't take it anymore.

92
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,460
I can't take it anymore.

93
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:05,930
I'm so uncomfortable.

94
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,800
What's going on?

95
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,020
He suddenly became like this just as he was about to confess.

96
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,950
It's so strange.

97
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,170
Chief Ke,

98
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,760
this is not acceptable.

99
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,120
Deputy Chief Zhu has also contributed to both the Party and the country.

100
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,390
If you treat him the same way,

101
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,990
it'll be too disheartening.

102
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,190
Take him to the hospital first.

103
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,520
Let's interrogate him after he's better.

104
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,160
I can't take it anymore.

105
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,770
Are you allergic to the smell of Florida Water?

106
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,030
How did you know?

107
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,159
I've already asked.

108
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,600
Do as I say,

109
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,590
and I'll guarantee you get out.

110
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,850
Why are you helping me?

111
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,350
Your Yun family and Boss Bai were sworn enemies.

112
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,430
Although you've done many bad things,

113
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,960
you haven't truly committed truly evil acts.

114
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,290
There's still a chance for you to reform.

115
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,840
Too many innocent souls have died here.

116
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,570
Our Yun family has always acted with integrity,

117
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,890
and we never kick a man when he's down.

118
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,110
Let me ask you:

119
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:19,750
has my brother ever deliberately made things difficult for you over the years?

120
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,280
If you want to get out alive and see Xiaohua,

121
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,800
then follow my plan.

122
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,380
Director Ling will be interrogating you soon.

123
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,790
Have an episode in front of him,

124
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,250
and you can avoid torture.

125
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,080
Your spirits seem quite high.

126
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,190
Please, this way.

127
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,220
Director,

128
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,770
Adjutant Chen is here.

129
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,520
Let's go.

130
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:16,610
Adjutant Chen,

131
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,670
you're here.

132
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:18,870
Chief.

133
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,000
Deputy Chief Zhu,

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,630
are you alright?

135
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,390
I'm fine.

136
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,440
I'm doing great.

137
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,740
Why are you here?

138
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,910
The Commander has heard that you've been wrongfully accused,

139
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,570
so he specifically asked me to come check on you.

140
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,070
Rest assured;

141
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,130
the Commander will definitely

142
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,550
get to the bottom of this matter.

143
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,900
No matter

144
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,630
who dares to set you up,

145
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,600
they will pay the price.

146
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:41,830
Really,

147
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,610
the Commander is so thoughtful.

148
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,710
Despite all his work, he still sent you all the way here.

149
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:46,390
Don't worry.

150
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,530
There's no need for you to come here.

151
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,590
The Chief here can solve the problem.

152
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:50,360
It's alright.

153
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,159
Head back now.

154
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,480
The Commander is so busy.

155
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,750
He can't do without you.

156
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,790
Then, I'll head back first?

157
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,030
Go back. Everything is fine.

158
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:03,630
Chief Ke,

159
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,080
I'll take my leave then.

160
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,060
Please keep the Commander's orders

161
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,350
in mind.

162
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,270
You can reassure the Commander.

163
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,720
Adjutant Chen, take care.

164
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,670
Come on, Chief.

165
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,460
Have a seat.

166
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,890
Have a seat.

167
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,700
You wanted to see me about something?

168
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,350
I guess the thing you want to tell me

169
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,750
is related to the case.

170
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,190
It's more appropriate for Director Ling to be here.

171
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,070
Now that things have come to this point,

172
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,270
I'll be frank.

173
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,300
I sent someone to kill Bai Qingkui

174
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,080
because I had been using him

175
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,080
to smuggle Western medicine from enemy-occupied areas.

176
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,800
As you know,

177
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,150
prices are skyrocketing now.

178
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,440
We can't make ends meet without some side business.

179
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,300
Now, given the sensitive timing,

180
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,870
I was afraid that if this matter came to light,

181
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,070
I wouldn't be able to explain myself.

182
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,430
So, I took the desperate measure of killing Bai Qingkui.

183
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,590
As for Xu Nian,

184
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,790
I did send him to keep an eye on Yun Hongshen.

185
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,550
Yun Hongshen is too cunning.

186
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,430
The intelligence he obtains

187
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,000
is far more extensive than what he's told us.

188
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,490
So I sent someone to monitor him

189
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,930
just to get

190
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,550
the intelligence he's unwilling to share with us.

191
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,740
Do you have any evidence

192
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,070
for what you're saying?

193
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,310
I don't.

194
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,150
Originally, Bai Qingkui could have been a witness,

195
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,240
but I killed him.

196
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,590
But he should have secretly

197
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,070
recorded all the transactions between us.

198
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,470
And his mistress, Gui,

199
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,050
is likely aware of it too.

200
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,230
As for Xu Nian...

201
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,950
Yun Hongshen has long known

202
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,520
that I sent Xu Nian to monitor him.

203
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,560
Why did he only expose it yesterday?

204
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,270
Director Ling, I think you already know the answer

205
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,540
without me explaining it, right?

206
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:08,310
Chief,

207
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,090
I have something to attend to.

208
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:09,750
I'm off now.

209
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,360
Now that Ling Han has left,

210
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,760
can you tell me the truth?

211
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,230
Chief, please have a seat.

212
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,290
Forget about that.

213
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,790
What's the real reason

214
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,650
you had someone kill Bai Qingkui?

215
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,430
On the day that Wen Yeming and Li Liang went to Shanghai,

216
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,750
you applied for a large sum of funds.

217
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,450
You had only one task then, and that was to assassinate Qu Wenzhi.

218
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,050
That operation wouldn't cost that much.

219
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:40,910
Let me tell you,

220
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,660
Ling Han doesn't know about this yet.

221
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,460
I hope you will tell me the truth

222
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,760
before he finds out.

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,870
The Japanese have occupied Shanghai.

224
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,110
In this situation,

225
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,270
Shanghai may be the safest place.

226
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,280
After the Chairman decided to abandon Changsha,

227
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,610
many people's assets became vulnerable.

They all believe

229
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,490
that putting money in Shanghai is a good choice.

230
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,470
Chief, I think

231
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,070
you should stop pursuing

232
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,240

Do you have any business in the evidence room?

It's fine if you'd rather not say.

248
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,650
It's nothing, really.

249
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,110
I just suddenly thought

250
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,500
that, first, Wu Tong had an episode,

251
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,590
and then the Deputy Chief requested to see the Chief.

252
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,080
These two matters happened one after another,

253
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,880
drawing everyone's attention.

254
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,860

255
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,510
tamper with the physical evidence at this time,

256
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,700
it would be very easy for them to succeed.

Who is this person you're referring to?

258
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,350
What kind of tampering could they do?

259
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,550
It's too early to say.

00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,550
Is there something wrong with that bullet casing?

261
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,820
The file cabinet was opened.

262
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,950
I suspect that the bullet was swapped.

263
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,070
I won't let this person

264
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,340

that I planned and directed an operation yesterday.

303
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,390
The operation had two objectives:

304
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:10,830
first,

305
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,110
to lure out and capture Li Miaohan's accomplices.

306
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,570
Second,

307
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,430
to find Bai Qingkui

only the Chief,

There was a small problem on my end.

317
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,960
Li Miaohan's lover was first intercepted

318
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,390
and then silenced.

that he had been sent by the Deputy Chief.

and confirmed that the type of firearm compatible with this bullet

333
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,790
is the Japanese Type 97 sniper rifle.

334
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,930
This type of firearm is very rare in Changsha.

335
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,230
Neither the military nor the police are equipped with it.

336
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,230
In other words,

337
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,480
the killer is very likely to be Japanese.

a Mauser sniper rifle bullet we used,

341
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,600
then the blame

342
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,450
might have been pinned on the Deputy Chief.

right after the break-in at the evidence room.

346
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,700
I suspect that the bullet was swapped.

What evidence did he leave in the evidence room?

00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,110
If you're making claims without any proof,

00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,990
we can... only assume you're seeing things.

Yes, say it here.

368
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:22,810

369
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:23,840
Say it.

and Deputy Chief Zhu's case.

374
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:42,990
Wen Yeming.

375
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:45,180
Yes, sir.

376
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:48,150
I'll leave you to investigate

377
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,870
Li Miaohan's lover and his movements,

378
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,190
as well as why Wu Tong suddenly fell ill.

379
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:52,720
Yes, sir.

380
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,430
Director Gong, Director Xu, and Director Ling.

381
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:55,980
Yes.

382
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,350
Regarding Deputy Chief Zhu's matter,

383
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,550
I'm assigning the three of you to jointly investigate.

384
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,410
It needs to be not only quick

385
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,830
but also accurate and reliable.

386
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,030
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

387
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,390
Everyone,

388
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,080
what I want is not just a result,

389
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,430
but our Hunan Station's

390
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,390
loyalty to the Party and the country, from top to bottom.

391
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,120
Understood?

392
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:13,910
Yes, sir!

393
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:25,770
Director Ling,

394
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,660
you wanted to see me?

395
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,010
Have a seat.

396
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,870
You didn't participate in yesterday's operation,

397
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,870
so let me fill you in on some details.

398
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,000
Please go ahead.

399
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,510
Yesterday, I found a bill at Happy House.

400
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,390
It recorded some brief information

401
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,370
about Bai Qingkui's smuggling cargo

402
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,920
on July 2nd.

403
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,470
I can now confirm

404
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,690
that the cargo was Qu Wenzhi.

405
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,820
This confirms your previous speculation

406
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,880
that Qu Wenzhi did leave

407
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,910
on Bai Qingkui's smuggling ship for laborers.

408
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,390
Yes.

409
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:59,030
But there's one thing that's very suspicious.

410
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,170
[Zong ships via waterway, July 2nd]

411
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,980
You suspect that the character "Zong"

412
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,950
was added later?

413
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,490
I'm not suspecting.

414
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,490
I'm certain of it.

415
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,010
The person who added this character lacks experience,

416
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,430
handling it very crudely.

417
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,290
It clearly was done by an amateur.

418
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,670
I even suspect

419
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,430
that someone deliberately arranged for me

420
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,300
to find that bill.

421
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,500
Because finding just one bill in the scroll

422
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,050
is suspicious in itself.

423
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,880
Do you have any suspects in mind?

424
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,940
I suspect that the person who switched the bullets

425
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,900
and the one who planted the bill for me to find

426
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,030
are the same person.

427
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,920
Yesterday, Yun Hongshen led a team

428
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,780
to stake out near Huangxing Road.

429
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,590
During that time,

430
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:43,270
he volunteered to keep watch at the tea house downstairs.

431
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,060
He was alone

432
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,470
in that tea house for nearly an hour and a half.

433
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,470
During that time,

434
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,480
his team members

435
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,630
could only see his back from upstairs.

436
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,310
Are you saying that the person in the tea house

437
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,510
wasn't actually him?

438
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,390
That's something you'll need to verify further yourself.

439
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,200
While Yun Hongshen was keeping watch at the tea house,

440
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,200
someone approached Safe House No. 3

441
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,240
and kidnapped Li Miaohan's lover.

442
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,780
They were very quick, in and out,

443
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,180
leaving no trace behind.

444
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:09,820
Are you implying...

445
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,470
that this kidnapper

446
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,230
is very likely to be Yun Hongshen, right?

447
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:16,420
Right now, all of these assumptions are just hypotheses.

448
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,740
Whether they can be proven or disproven

449
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,410
will depend on your investigation from this point forward.

450
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,680
You wanted to see me?

451
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,900
Was it you who switched the bullets?

452
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,170
Your reason.

453
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,030
This is the original bullet that was in the evidence room—

454
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,030
a Mauser bullet.

455
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,420
After yesterday's operation,

456
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,480
our team investigated the scene

457
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,610
and confirmed that the sniper's position

458
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:55,070
was 450 meters away from Li Miaohan's lover.

459
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:58,530
But the effective range of a Mauser sniper rifle is 800 meters.

460
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:00,670
If shot at 450 meters,

461
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,470
the impact would have completely shattered his skull.

462
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,420
So someone switched the Type 97 bullet

463
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,980
with a Mauser rifle bullet.

464
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,190
They're trying to connect the murder of Li Miaohan's lover

465
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,270
with the death of Bai Qingkui.

466
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,510
Therefore...

467
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,150
I went to thwart their scheme.

468
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:18,390
Were you the one who kidnapped Li Miaohan's lover?

469
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,910
That's quite a bold assumption.

470
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:22,580
You didn't deny it.

471
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,630
And I didn't admit it either.

472
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,070
What did you get from him?

473
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,300
When did you start

474
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,800
monitoring Yun Hongshen?

475
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,670
About a week ago.

476
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,380
Didn't he notice you?

477
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,140
I'm not sure.

478
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:46,630
During the time you were monitoring him,

479
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,240
did he do anything unusual?

480
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:54,670
When he was within my sight,

481
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,140
no.

482
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:57,790
But

483
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,030
there were times

484
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,490
he disappeared from view.

485
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,200
That means he was already aware of your surveillance.

486
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,920
Before he confronted you yesterday,

487
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,780
what did you do?

488
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,670
He suddenly...

489
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,150
went to the tea house.

490
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,380
I thought he was trying to escape,

491
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,620
so I followed him in.

492
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,070
But when I followed him to the back door...

493
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,120
The person inside the tea house

494
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,630
wasn't Yun Hongshen at all.

495
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,890
At the agreed time,

496
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,050
he returned and swapped with his stand-in.

497
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,830
But you happened to run into him.

498
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,890
So he had no choice but to capture you.

499
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,180
Otherwise, if you had continued to follow his stand-in,

500
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,180
everything he had been doing would have been exposed.

501
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,430
During the time Yun Hongshen was on lookout at the tea house,

502
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,960
did he do anything unusual?

503
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,220
No.

504
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,950
He sat by the window the whole time.

505
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,630
He barely moved at all.

506
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,310
When you went to find him,

507
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,970
did you see with your own eyes

508
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,310
that it was Yun Hongshen sitting there?

509
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,870
No, I didn't.

510
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,190
When I arrived,

511
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,830
he suddenly left.

512
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,610
When I caught up with him,

513
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,350
he had already caught Xu Nian.

514
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,610
Before the operation,

515
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,700
what did he do?

516
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,990
Tell us everything you know,

517
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,560
and don't leave anything out.

518
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,610
Before the operation...

519
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,840
I don't know what he was doing before your meeting.

520
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,310
Besides, our team leader likes to be alone,

521
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,560
so I didn't want to disturb him.

522
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,390
What about after the meeting?

523
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,710
After the meeting...

524
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,940
he assigned us... our tasks.

525
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,510
Then we inspected our weapons together.

526
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,270
Oh, right.

527
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,880
He also gave us two cartons of cigarettes.

528
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,670
What happened when he was handing out the cigarettes?

529
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,270
Nothing.

530
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,390
N-N-Nothing.

531
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,760
Speak properly while you can.

532
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,560
I-I-I,

533
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:00,550
I found a photo in his drawer.

534
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,390
What photograph?

535
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,450
Do you want to say this somewhere else?

536
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,710
No, no, no, I don't want to.

537
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:12,970
I'll say it right here.

538
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,950
It was you.

539
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,310
You were following the Deputy Chief,

540
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,510
and our leader t-t-took a picture of it.

541
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,710
Was he following me

542
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,550
or the Deputy Chief?

543
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:38,130
If he was following the Deputy Chief,

544
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,610
then there's much more to this story.

545
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,370
Director Ling,

546
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,200
what do you mean by that?

547
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,790
Could it be that you know

548
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,920
why he was following the Deputy Chief?

549
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,080
Sir.

550
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:36,350
From analyzing the collected

551
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,530
confessions and physical evidence,

552
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,590
we can at least draw this conclusion:

553
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,920
Yun Hongshen knew early on

554
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,790
that Deputy Chief Zhu had sent someone to follow him.

555
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,190
So he also

556
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,610
conducted counter-surveillance on Deputy Chief Zhu.

557
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:47,060
As for the motive behind the surveillance,

558
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,880
it's quite obvious.

559
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,520
He had already determined that Deputy Chief Zhu

560
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,840
was the mole in our station.

561
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,530
He kept following Deputy Chief Zhu

562
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,490
to find more conclusive evidence.

563
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,460
This... explains a lot.

564
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:59,670
In other words,

565
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,890
he deliberately let Liu Chao see the photo,

566
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,690
who later reported it to the Deputy Chief,

567
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:06,850
which provoked the Deputy Chief to kill Bai Qingkui to silence him

568
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,780
and then implicated Xu Nian,

569
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:12,190
indirectly confirming that the Deputy Chief had something to hide.

570
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,850
But why would he do all of this?

571
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,050
He wanted to kill the Deputy Chief?

572
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,270
Chief,

573
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,380
don't forget

574
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,820
why Yun Hongshen returned to Changsha.

575
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,820
Back in Shanghai,

576
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,630
Yun Hongshen's father, Yun Muzhi,

577
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,160
was killed by the Japanese.

578
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,190
He came all the way back to Changsha

579
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,750
just to find the real culprit behind it.

580
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,730
If Deputy Chief Zhu is really the mole,

581
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,070
then he is indirectly responsible for Yun Muzhi's murder.

582
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,620
Yun Hongshen wants to use us

583
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,810
to kill Deputy Chief Zhu

584
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,010
to avenge his father.

585
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,040
Where's Yun Hongshen?

586
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:54,970
Leader Yun,

587
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:56,430
the Chief wants to see you.

588
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:11,710
Chief.

589
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,770
Have a seat.

590
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:23,110
Director Ling... has something to say to you.

591
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,630
You've made Deputy Chief Zhu

592
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,160
the target of your revenge,

593
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,380
so you framed him.

594
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,410
I did suspect him,

595
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,540
but framing him is a bit much.

596
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,650
At most, I'd call it using him.

597
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,530
Chief,

598
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,760
have you seen all the photos?

599
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,580
These photos?

600
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,330
Not this one.

601
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,350
It's another one.

602
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,850
Is this one?

603
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,400
The person who took the photo

604
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,130
was partially reflected in the rearview mirror.

605
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,000
I didn't find that outfit at Li Liang's place.

606
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,170
I suspect that the person who took the photo wasn't Li Liang.

607
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,750
I wanted to show it to you,

608
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,590
but now that's not possible.

609
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:18,930
Let's do this.

610
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,900
Go home and reflect for a few days while suspended.

611
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,780
Hand over your work to Wen Yeming.

612
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,510
Understood.

613
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:34,920
Chief.

614
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,970
You two, go out as well.

615
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:39,760
Yes, sir.

616
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:40,420
Yes, sir.

617
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,090
I'll ask Ji Fang to see if there's any way

618
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:52,060
to restore the photo to its original state.

619
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,720
The photo is so badly damaged;

620
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,720
how could it possibly be restored?

621
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,960
I don't quite understand

622
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,180
how you handled Yun Hongshen.

623
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,820
If I wasn't worried about stability at the station,

624
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:07,950
I would've even suspended you for a couple of days for reflection as well.

625
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,270
-Chief.
-Don't Chief me.

626
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,820
Deputy Chief Zhu may be compromised.

627
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,560
Yun Hongshen may be compromised.

628
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,020
Are you beyond suspicion?

629
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,670
You must have already traced

630
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:29,870
the funds Deputy Chief Zhu used, right?

631
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,550
Not saying anything?

632
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,830
Is this how you treat me as your Chief,

633
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:36,350
right?

634
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,710
Some things are beyond my control.

635
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,240
Even if I investigate more,

636
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:47,290
it won't make any difference.

637
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:48,610
No difference?

638
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:50,430
One has the Director's backing,

639
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,200
while the other has the Commander's support.

640
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,880
Each one of you

641
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,350
pays lip service to me as the Chief while disobeying in secret.

642
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,470
To be honest,

643
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:57,630
I'm starting to wonder

644
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,650
if you all have sided with someone else,

645
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:00,810
what will happen to our station?

646
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,650
I'm simply avoiding unnecessary meddling.

647
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,250
I haven't sided with anyone.

648
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,060
You and the Director are on the same side.

649
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,660
Since we're on the same side,

650
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:11,060
there's no such thing as lip service or secret disobedience.

651
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:13,630
Yeah.

652
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:17,360
Whether our station stands righteous or compromised,

653
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,870
even I can't see clearly now.

654
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,020
I'm starting to suspect that our station

655
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,480
has almost become a nest for Japanese spies.

656
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,690
Director Ling,

657
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,840
your recent work performance

658
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,240
is making me very uneasy.

659
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,180
I'm sorry to have disappointed you.

660
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,510
I'll turn the situation around as soon as possible.

661
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,310
Let's do this.

662
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,060
Continue with your other work,

663
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:39,070
but stop following up on the  matter with Yun Hongshen.

664
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:39,870
Chief.

665
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,630
I've already made my decision.

666
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,040
Yes, sir.

667
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,550
Leader Wen,

668
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,070
I've organized all the tasks I was handling

669
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,250
into written reports.

670
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,050
It's all here.

671
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,590
If you have any questions,

672
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,790
feel free to call me anytime.

673
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,400
You...

674
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,230
If he is Onitetsu,

675
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,750
could his contact be Kunwu?

676
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,460
How do they communicate with each other?

677
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,100
If my assumptions are correct,

678
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,380
Ling Han is Kunwu.

679
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:19,889
Given his cautious nature

680
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:22,070
and the recent series of incidents,

681
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,870
he will surely cut all contact with his operatives

682
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,469
to avoid exposing any flaws.

683
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:29,460
This person won't take any action in the near future.

684
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,590
There's no use in keeping an eye on him.

685
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:54,250
Grandma,

686
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:54,969
I'm back.

687
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,230
You're back.

688
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,190
That's great.

689
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,310
What's wrong?

690
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,200
You look so downcast.

691
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,200
What happened?

692
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,060
I have some good news.

693
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,330
I'm on leave for the next few days.

694
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,670
You're on leave?

695
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,730
That's wonderful.

696
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,800
You've been running yourself into the ground lately.

697
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,950
Why did they suddenly give you time off?

698
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,230
My boss said

699
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,840
I've been working too hard lately,

700
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:23,410
so he told me to go home and rest for a few days.

701
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:24,890
It's good.

702
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,820
There's been a lot going on at the school recently.

703
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,810
Your brother has been leaving early and coming home late.

704
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,330
Now you can rest at home

705
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,140
and keep me company.

706
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,630
Oh, Grandma,

707
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,110
this orchid you embroidered—

708
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,570
it looks just like the real thing.

709
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,430
I can almost smell its fragrance.

710
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:44,390
True to the saying, "Embroidered flowers exude fragrance,

711
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,060
and stitched figures brim with spirit."

712
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,760
My grandma's craftsmanship

713
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,230
is truly exceptional.

714
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:49,870
Oh, you.

715
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,440
You're just sweet-talking

716
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,150
your grandmother.

717
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,390
That's right.

718
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,550
No one can claim first place

719
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,220
if my grandma's second.

720
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,150
Grandma,

721
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,900
who are you planning to give this to?

722
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,970
After I finish embroidering it,

723
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:08,210
I want to give it to Mi Lan.

724
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:11,150
Mi Lan is such a thoughtful girl.

725
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:15,590
She heard from your brother that I've been having trouble sleeping,

726
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,110
so she brought me some calming pills.

727
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,580
She even bought several packs of Chinese herbal medicine

728
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,910
for me to soak my feet in.

729
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,710
She even learned massage techniques.

730
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,270
With her being so thoughtful,

731
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:27,870
how can I not reciprocate?

732
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,980
Don't you think so?

733
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,430
Absolutely.

734
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:32,590
Grandma,

735
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:36,630
then you should give, well,

736
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,070
the lily embroidery to her.

737
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,230
I heard from Dao

738
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:42,210
that my brother bought a lily brooch for Mi Lan.

739
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,950
If paired with the lily you embroidered,

740
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,070
it would be

741
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:47,930
simply perfect.

742
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,340
He can give his gift,

743
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,350
and I'll give mine.

744
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:52,180
Why should they be the same?

745
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,840
Shen,

746
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:56,560
what do you think of this girl, Mi Lan?

747
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:59,530
It doesn't matter what I think of her.

748
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,850
What matters is how my brother thinks.

749
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,590
Besides, I don't know her very well.

750
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,330
Grandma,

751
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,040
why are  you suddenly asking about this?

752
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,300
Did something happen?

753
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,030
He's already had enough on his plate lately.

754
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,670
Let's not add to his troubles.

755
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,990
What if I'm overthinking it?

756
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,510
It's nothing.

757
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,040
I was just asking casually.

758
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:24,760
What if I'm overthinking it?

759
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,340
That's good, then.

760
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,580
Well, Grandma,

761
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,510
I'll go back to my room to rest now.

762
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,640
I've been exhausted these past few days.

763
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,350
If I don't come down for dinner,

764
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,320
don't call me.

765
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,200
Just look at you,

766
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,050
always skipping meals and eating so irregularly.

767
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:58,310
How's it going?

768
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,190
Judging by the Yun family's attitude toward me,

769
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,420
it seems that before Kawashima died,

770
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,620
he didn't reveal

771
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,510
my true identity to Yun Hongshen.

772
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,430
Otherwise, considering Yun Hongshen's personality,

773
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,890
once he had locked onto me,

774
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,180
he would have taken action immediately.

775
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,230
Take a look at this yourself.

776
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,880
I hope you can give me a reasonable explanation.

777
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,740
I was just acting.

778
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,490
Your plan has reached a critical moment.

779
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,680
I really need to gain Yun Hongshen's complete trust.

780
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:41,530
Only in this way...

781
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,690
When a woman falls in love with a man,

782
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,750
her eyes can't lie.

783
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,830
-You've fallen for him...
-No,

784
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:48,550
I haven't.

785
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,530
My teacher, Kudo Takuma, once taught me,

786
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,780
"If you want your enemy to completely trust you,

787
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,360
and if you want to make this act convincing,

788
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,510
you must genuinely immerse yourself in it."

789
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,980
I don't want to hear such explanations from you.

790
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,330
Take a good look at the photo.

791
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,530
What's that woman doing in the picture?

792
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,960
She's seeing off the man she loves.

793
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,010
She's thinking about their next meeting.

794
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,590
She's imagining that man turning back

795
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,780
and seeing the burning passion in her eyes.

796
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,240
You're playing with fire.

797
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:15,990
No.

798
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:18,070
You're well aware of

799
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,050
how the Shadow Agency deals with traitors.

800
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:20,650
Of course.

801
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,790
I know you're not afraid of death.

802
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:25,190
But do you think they'll let Yun Hongqi off?

803
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,400
Please don't doubt

804
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,860
my loyalty to our country.

805
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:29,910
No one

806
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,640
can make me betray our country.

807
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,160
Yun Hongqi...

808
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,470
he won't become an obstacle for me.

809
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,690
Please, you must believe me.

810
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:39,750
He has already become your obstacle.

811
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:42,810
You know very well

812
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:45,040
that the NBIS hasn't stopped monitoring you,

813
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,900
yet you let them take such photos.

814
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:49,490
Your vigilance and judgment are slipping.

815
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,830
I have reason to doubt

816
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,460
that you're losing the ability to carry out this mission.

817
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,520
I can correct this flaw immediately.

818
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,270
Please, you must believe me.

819
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,040
Have you always fantasized

820
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,690
about telling him everything

821
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,350
and even handing me over to him

822
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,300
in exchange for his forgiveness,

823
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,430
and then you two could run away together?

824
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:07,960
No.

825
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:08,940
I really haven't.

826
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:09,800
Let me tell you,

827
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:12,320
stop indulging in such fantasies.

828
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,530
Because Yun Hongqi

829
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,080
would never forgive you.

830
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:17,830
Because the blood of the Chinese people on your hands

831
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,640
is enough to stain the entire Yun family red.

832
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,410
Do you know why the Yun family

833
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,430
is so highly respected in Changsha?

834
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,030
Because the Yun family has its own unyielding principles.

835
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,700
When it comes to their enemies,

836
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,470
they show no mercy.

837
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,460
Do you believe

838
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:35,070
that if Yun Hongqi knew the truth,

839
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,690
the first person to come for your life

840
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:37,420
would be him?

841
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,560
Do you think Yun Hongqi

842
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,580
truly has genuine feelings for you?

843
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,660
You're wrong.

844
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:45,190
He's been investigating you all along.

845
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,390
He and his family

846
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,070
have never truly trusted you.

847
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:51,010
When you were taken to the NBIS last time,

848
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,280
he knew about it.

849
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:53,930
He also knows

850
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,550
that you're being monitored by the NBIS.

851
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,150
If he really cared about you,

852
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,840
he would've found a way to have the NBIS

853
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,500
lift the surveillance on you.

854
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,610
If he really trusted you,

855
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:06,390
after all the time you've spent with Yun Hongqi,

856
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:09,590
you would have uncovered Yun Hongshen's every movement.

857
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:10,910
He might have a tiny bit of feeling

858
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:12,350
for you,

859
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:15,390
but those feelings are insignificant,

860
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,120
and they'll fade in an instant.

861
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,940
Because, to them,

862
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,680
you are nothing.

863
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,150
As for being set up by Ling Han

864
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:42,300
and consequently falling into a deadlock,

865
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,110
Yun Hongshen had long been mentally prepared for it.

866
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,340
Kunwu is clearly not

867
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,020
an easy opponent to deal with.

868
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,620
What frustrates him is

869
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:52,160
that, in front of a cunning, seasoned opponent like Ling Han,

870
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,050
every step he took—

871
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:55,180
despite being carefully calculated—

872
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,830
still left loopholes,

873
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:00,140
while Ling Han remained flawless.

874
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,540
What loopholes could he have?

875
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,220
He didn't personally kill

876
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,850
Li Miaohan's lover.

877
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,630
Bai Qingkui didn't seem to know him.

878
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,560
Jin Guoqiang's car accident

879
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,820
and even Myna's murder

880
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,610
have nothing to do with him.

881
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:23,930
What else is there?

882
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:31,900
The cipher key.

883
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,760
He was the one who took the cipher key.

884
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,350
Good morning, Old Madam.

885
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,150
Good morning.

886
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,630
Where are the Young Master and the Second Young Master?

887
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:46,590
It seems something happened at the school.

888
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:48,590
The Young Master left at the crack of dawn,

889
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:50,090
and the Second Young Master also said he had something to do.

890
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:52,020
He just rushed out a moment ago.

891
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:54,390
You see, both of them are busy.

892
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:55,310
Such a big family,

893
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:56,680
and it's just the two of us now.
