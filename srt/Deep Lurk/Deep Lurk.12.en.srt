00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,120
There's only one place in the city that supplies these goods.

4
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,250
It's the Lifeng Boutique Gallery at the Changsha Hotel.

5
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,350
The current situation is so chaotic.

6
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,950
How did he manage to get so many high-end goods?

7
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,110
The owner of that shop must be quite capable.

8
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,780
It's said he has powerful connections.

9
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,720
He even managed to use

10
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,990
military aircraft, flying from Hong Kong to Changsha,

11
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:55,990

13
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,790

14
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,020
Such unscrupulous merchants!

You can say that again.

If you ask me, people like him

17
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,230
should be sent straight to the frontlines,

18

00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,950
Young Master Yun,

192
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,710
what do you take me for?

193
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,840
A friend, of course.

194
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,240
Did...

195
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,790
Did I do something wrong?

196
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,550
Your actions

197
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,860
make me feel very uncomfortable.

198
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,950
I only helped you with a small favor,

199
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,990
but you gave me such an expensive gift.

200
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,850
Do you think that's appropriate?

201
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:28,840
I don't think this is

202
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,900
how friends should treat each other.

203
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,430
So you think I brought you here

204
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,430
as a wealthy young master,

205
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,470
using money

206
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,950
to tempt an innocent, naive girl?

207
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,790
I swear,

208
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,960
I didn't think that at all.

209
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,150
The reason I brought you here

210
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,310
is because someone told me

211
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,510
that women feel better when they're shopping.

212
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,870
I just wanted to make you feel better.

213
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,710
I've never had genuine feelings for a woman before.

214
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,510
I don't know how to please you...

215
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,340
Yes,

216
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:10,720
I like you.

217
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,510
I fell for you at first sight.

218
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,680
The first time I saw you,

219
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,310
you were covered in blood

220
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,970
in the ruins of the classroom.

221
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,030
But when you took off your mask,

222
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,910
I saw the purest

223
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,270
and most beautiful face in this world.

224
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:31,940
The reason

225
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,130
I bought that lily brooch for you

226
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,790
is because the first impression you gave me

227
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,950
was like a fresh lily.

228
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,030
Pure,

229
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,390
clean,

230
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,820
and beautiful.

231
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,030
I'm not as good as you say.

232
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,490
You are.

233
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,790
You are as good as I say.

234
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,750
Mi Lan,

235
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,540
I'm not saying all this to...

236
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,110
To force you to accept me right away.

237
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,310
Could you consider it?

238
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,600
Consider to give me a chance

239
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,110
to accompany you.

240
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,680
Maybe

241
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,190
I can really protect you,

242
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,760
and eventually give you a home.

243
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,710
Okay?

244
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:10,990
Hishiko,

245
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,590
you've done well.

246
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,070
But you need to know

247
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,150
that relying on strength alone is far from enough.

248
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,540
To become a weapon for our empire,

249
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:25,750
you must abandon everything that makes you human.

250
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,590
No family,

251
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,230
no children,

252
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,270
and most importantly, no self.

253
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,230
You are just a sword,

254
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,320
ready to serve the emperor at any time.

255
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,590
Mi Lan.

256
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,630
Yun Hongqi.

257
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,230
There's no possibility between us.

258
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:49,790
Why?

259
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,570
We're not from the same world.

260
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,950
I'm just an ordinary person.

261
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,230
My wishes are small,

262
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,540
and simple.

263
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,070
But it may be very hard

264
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,070
for you to fulfill.

265
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,790
You can tell me.

266
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,430
For example,

267
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,870
I don't like expensive jewelry,

268
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,010
nor do I like living in big houses.

269
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,230
I dislike even more a life surrounded by servants.

270
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,070
I just want someone

271
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,830
who treats me very, very well,

272
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,390
someone who would never

273
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,270
think I'm bad,

274
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,870
and who might even

275
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,110
satisfy some of my capricious,

276
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,710
small demands.

277
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,190
For example,

278
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:34,870
I might ask him

279
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,800
to be a rickshaw puller for me once.

280
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:37,950
But for you,

281
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,150
this is

282
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,550
absolutely impossible.

283
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,590
You are the eldest young master of the Yun family.

284
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,630
Everyone in Changsha

285
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,150
wants a smile from you.

286
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,830
How could you lower yourself

287
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,290
to do something like that?

288
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,430
Forget it.

289
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,320
We're not right for each other.

290
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,710
Let's not

291
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,550
see each other again.

292
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:18,870
Yun Hongqi.

293
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:20,400
Ma'am,

294
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,110
please sit properly.

295
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,790
Young Master,

296
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,320
what are you planning to do?

297
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,280
Drive and follow me.

298
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:31,990
Yun Hongqi.

299
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,390
I actually cried for someone.

300
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,150
It wasn't planned,

301
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,870
and it wasn't acting.

302
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,080
I just cried for him, purely.

303
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,630
I'm still human.

304
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,430
I cried for an enemy.

305
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,540
But this is wrong.

306
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,690
It's absolutely not allowed.

307
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,430
I'm a bit thirsty.

308
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,590
Let's go to the tea stall ahead for some tea.

309
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:11,730
Alright.

310
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,630
Yun Hongqi took Mi Lan

311
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,390
to the boutique gallery at the Changsha Hotel?

312
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:19,910
Yes.

313
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,310
They stayed there for over half an hour.

314
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,720
It seems he's investigating the origin of the Punch cigars.

315
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,070
Have you checked this store?

316
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,430
We've checked this store

317
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,430
right after.

318
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,390
We found that they recently took an order

319
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,510
for a large batch of Punch cigars.

320
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,950
The client's registered name is Li Miaohan.

321
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,030
The movie star?

322
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:38,830
Yes,

323
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,910
Li Miaohan doesn't smoke cigars.

324
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,110
She must have given the cigars to someone else,

325
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,910
like

326
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,510
the man she's dating,

327
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,910
her work partners,

328
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,130
or

329
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,150
someone who helps her career.

330
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,430
Check all these men.

331
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,190
It's best to figure out who received the cigars,

332
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,190
when they received them,

333
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,630
and how many they received.

334
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,430
In short,

335
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,870
the more detailed the information, the better.

336
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,600
Understood.

337
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:03,870
Your family

338
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,810
is really different from others.

339
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,349
They are truly great.

340
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,099
Of course,

341
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,910
they are the best grandparents,

342
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:13,810
parents,

343
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:15,290
and siblings in the world.

344
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,550
But I have nothing.

345
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,310
Yun Hongqi,

346
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:25,020
you're truly a very, very good person.

347
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,109
I'm really happy

348
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:29,110
to be liked by you.

349
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,880
Are you really happy?

350
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,810
If you're happy, that's good!

351
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,030
The reason I brought you out this time

352
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,550
was to make you happy.

353
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,990
Making you happy is my mission.

354
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,730
Once you're happy,

355
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,230
my mission is complete.

356
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,790
Have some water...

357
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,950
Oh, have some tea.

358
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,270
Thank you.

359
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,210
Have some tea.

360
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,820
Thank you for bringing me back today.

361
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,180
Mi Lan.

362
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,270
We're

363
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,240
still considered friends, right?

364
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,750
I bought this brooch specially for you.

365
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,510
Just think of it as a gift between friends.

366
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,310
Please accept it.

367
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,070
Okay?

368
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,230
This gift is too precious.

369
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,550
I can't accept it.

370
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,390
It's okay.

371
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,390
Now Shen is at the age

372
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,110
to find a girlfriend.

373
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,070
Once he finds one,

374
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,270
I'll have him give it to his girlfriend.

375
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,990
It looks quite nice.

376
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,360
Mi Lan,

377
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,830
since we're friends,

378
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,090
if you ever need help in the future,

379
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,150
please let me know.

380
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,870
Okay?

381
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:20,710
Okay.

382
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,430
Goodbye.

383
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,110
I knew you didn't trust me after all.

384
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,160
You are both monitoring and eavesdropping on me.

385
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:21,990
Hello.

386
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:23,470
Hello,

387
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,130
please connect me to the Military Hospital.

388
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,200
Hello,

389
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,990
Head Nurse.

390
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,990
This is Mi Lan.

391
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:34,920
Yes,

392
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,010
Young Master Yun brought me back.

393
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,190
Head Nurse,

394
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,430
I'd like

395
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,750
to ask for a leave these days.

396
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,430
No,

397
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,830
I'm in good health.

398
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,070
I just want to

399
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,960
sort out

400
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:56,230
my father's belongings these days.

401
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:00,910
Yes,

402
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,310
I'll keep them

403
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,500
as a memento.

404
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,410
Thank you, Head Nurse.

405
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,030
Madam,

406
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,750
I got new intelligence about Mi Lan.

407
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,150
I can't assess its value.

408
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,410
Please take a look.

409
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,480
Myna's belongings?

410
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:03,950
Yun Hongshen.

411
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,260
Hello,

412
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,310
this is Mi Lan.

413
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,270
I'm really sorry.

414
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,710
I have something I'd like to ask for your help with.

415
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,660
Go ahead.

416
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:14,970
It's like this.

417
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,760
My father's seventh-day memorial is coming up,

418
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,130
but he hasn't been buried yet.

419
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,510
I wanted to ask,

420
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,070
is it possible to bring my father's body back

421
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:27,960
so he can be laid to rest?

422
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:29,830
But

423
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,320
I'm a little scared to go by myself.

424
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,720
I'm a bit scared of Ms. Wen.

425
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,390
You can have my brother accompany you.

426
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,920
He happens to be free today.

427
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,300
I...

428
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:45,120
I don't really want to bother him anymore.

429
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,410
Since we know that there's no chance between us,

430
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,310
it's better not to give him any false hope.

431
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,070
I see.

432
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,990
It's okay. I understand.

433
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,830
If it's a bother,

434
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,550
forget it.

435
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:59,550
It's not a bother.

436
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,870
Stay at home and wait for me.

437
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,600
I'll come pick you up right now.

438
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,120
Thank you.

439
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,410
Ms. Wen.

440
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,520
What brings you here?

441
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,110
Ms. Wen.

442
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,230
Ms. Wen,

443
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,550
is there something you need?

444
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,870
I'm about to go out.

445
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,670
I can stay home if necessary.

446
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,640
Ms. Wen,

447
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:12,150
can I take my father's body back?

448
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,840
Are your father's belongings in this box?

449
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,490
Yes.

450
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,950
I'm sorry,

451
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,510
but your father's belongings are very important evidence.

452
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,030
I can't give them to you just yet.

453
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,050
I'll return them after I finish collecting evidence.

454
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,580
But this is my father's box.

455
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:28,870
Ms. Wen,

456
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,040
you can't take it.

457
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,840
I'm just borrowing it for a while.

458
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,870
I'll return it as soon as I'm done.

459
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,250
Ms. Wen,

460
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:37,920
what do you need my father's things for?

461
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,000
There are only two pieces of clothing

462
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:40,960
and some money.

463
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,540
You can take the money.

464
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,010
What do I need your money for?

465
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,070
Let me say it again,

466
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,320
these things are very important evidence.

467
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,450
They may help with your father's case.

468
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:50,670
Ms. Wen,

469
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,940
you don't need to help investigate my father's case anymore.

470
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,750
Yun Hongshen has already promised me.

471
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,540
He'll help me catch

472
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,470
the murderer who killed my father.

473
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,210
And he specifically told me

474
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,570
to take good care of the things in the box.

475
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:03,800
He really said that?

476
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:04,990
Yes.

477
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:06,650
Ms. Wen,

478
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,270
you really can't take my father's box.

479
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:10,910
You don't need to investigate my father's case.

480
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:11,950
I must take this box.

481
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,790
I really can't let you take it.

482
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,000
Yun Hongshen,

483
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,600
you're here.

484
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:26,820
Ms. Wen

485
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:30,050
wants to take my father's belongings as evidence.

486
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,590
Ms. Wen,

487
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,440
this box,

488
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,290
you really can't take it.

489
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,520
Give it to me.

490
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,030
What if I don't give it to you?

491
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,500
As long as I'm here, you can't take it.

492
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,300
Ridiculous.

493
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,160
Stop fighting.

494
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,860
Ms. Wen,

495
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,830
stop fighting.

496
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,660
Yun Hongshen,

497
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:15,930
stop fighting.

498
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,500
Taking this box won't do you any good.

499
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,040
There's nothing in it that you want.

500
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,780
Just because you say there's nothing doesn't mean there isn't.

501
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,590
Yun Hongshen,

502
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,610
is this the attitude of cooperation?

503
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:06,950
It seems to me that you are determined to go against me.

504
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,630
Look at what you've done.

505
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,270
The things you want to investigate

506
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,800
have nothing to do with her.

507
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,750
Yet, you've repeatedly gone after her.

508
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,190
I thought

509
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,210
you were different from those who will stop at nothing.

510
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,010
But now I see,

511
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,150
you're just the same.

512
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:25,060
You've truly disappointed me.

513
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,190
Whether you're disappointed or not has nothing to do with me.

514
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:29,390
Do you think I care about what you think?

515
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:37,470
Put away that hypocritical attitude of yours.

516
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,600
Does she know that when I took her away,

517
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,800
you were only a few meters away from her?

518
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,960
Why didn't you stop me?

519
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,890
Isn't it because you doubt her too?

520
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,340
Let's talk outside.

521
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,070
Let's both calm down

522
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,670
and clear this up, okay?

523
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:00,790
It's you who's not calm.

524
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,390
For a woman

525
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,380
whose identity hasn't even been verified,

526
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,770
you're actually turning stupidity into heroism.

527
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:06,570
Yun Hongshen,

528
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,190
I really overestimated you.

529
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,720
You're not even worthy of being my opponent.

530
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,130
The fundamental reason

531
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,910
you let Mi Lan go

532
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,850
isn't because she can help me decipher intelligence,

533
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,960
but because you're pretty sure she's not a problem,

534
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,490
right?

535
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,070
So why are you forcing her like this now?

536
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,670
A few more times, and she won't survive.

537
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,020
I don't care about her.

538
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,200
I'm only interested in that box.

539
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,600
Let me be honest with you,

540
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:34,260
there's only Myna's belongings in that box.

541
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,270
I hid the intelligence in

542
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,980
a place only I know.

543
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,620
Taking that box is meaningless.

544
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,120
I swear on my father's name,

545
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,240
the intelligence is not in that box.

546
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,670
You really care a lot about this Mi Lan.

547
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,080
Swearing on your father's name?

548
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,870
Are you sure she won't tarnish

549
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,400
your father's reputation?

550
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,670
Just because Mi Lan is Myna's daughter

551
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,590
doesn't mean you should keep hounding her.

552
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,470
Isn't it because

553
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,130
when I took Mi Lan away,

554
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,430
you didn't take any rescue measures,

555
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,190
and now you feel guilty about her?

556
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,480
What does that have to do with me?

557
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,620
I don't owe her anything.

558
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,760
And I'll never forget my responsibilities

559
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,490
just because of your mistakes.

560
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,280
A crazy guy.

561
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,370
These candy wrappers,

562
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,730
you're still keeping them?

563
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,250
These candy wrappers

564
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,210
represent my father's love for me.

565
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,290
When I see them,

566
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,790
I feel warm inside.

567
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,950
I can't bear to throw them away.

568
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:44,870
What do you think,

569
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:48,020
should I fold them into a wind chime?

570
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:49,680
Sure.

571
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,580
I'll help you fold them.

572
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,480
They're beautiful.

573
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:33,780
Look,

574
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,080
when the wind blows,

575
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,510
all the colors seem to jump up.

576
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,340
The wind is picking up.

577
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,800
I'll go make you a cup of tea.

578
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:58,440
Alright.

579
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,790
There's also a method for creating codes

580
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,670
called the Nine-Square Grid cipher.

581
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,270
It comes from ancient times,

582
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,850
the He Tu and Luo Shu diagrams of the Fuxi era.

583
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,030
Look,

584
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,490
these white and black dots

585
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:24,150
contain many secrets.

586
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,990
The nine positions represent the numbers one through nine,

587
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,390
nine different numbers.

588
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,440
But when you add them horizontally and vertically,

589
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,390
the sum of the numbers is always fifteen.

590
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,480
In modern mathematics, this is called a magic square of order three.

591
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:47,750
The Nine-Square Grid.

592
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,510
What did you say?

593
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,190
Miss Mi Lan,

594
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,880
I have an urgent matter. I'll leave first.

595
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,590
Yun Hongshen.

596
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,990
I clearly found the right method,

597
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:19,520
so why does it all stall at the critical point?

598
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:30,020
These numbers seem boring and tedious,

599
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,520
like a game of hide-and-seek.

600
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,230
Only by understanding the rules within

601
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:37,310
can you become the winner of the game.

602
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:42,830
The matter with the cigars has made progress.

603
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:43,960
Guess who's been

604
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,160
ordering cigars in large quantities.

605
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:47,670
Hongqi,

606
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,160
just say what's on your mind.

607
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,700
Don't keep me in suspense.

608
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,280
I'm also annoyed right now.

609
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:55,950
What's wrong?

610
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,310
Are you feeling unwell

611
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,440
or is it the codebook you can't unlock?

612
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,080
Yeah,

613
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,910
I keep feeling like the clue is about to appear,

614
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:06,150
but every time I reach for it, it's gone.

615
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,510
Forget it.

616
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,790
Who's the one buying cigars?

617
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,750
Li Miaohan.

618
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,120
It's actually her?

619
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:21,900
Hongqi,

620
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:24,870
have you ever met Li Miaohan

621
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:26,820
or had any dealings with her?

622
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:28,110
I've only

623
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,830
met her a few times

624
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:30,670
in some public events.

625
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,710
I don't know her well.

626
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,429
But

627
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,110
don't be fooled by her short stature,

628
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,750
she has limitless charm.

629
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,600
The people she interacts with are all either rich or noble,

630
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,760
and her relationship with them

631
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,130
isn't that of friends,

632
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,000
but fleeting encounters.

633
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,389
Have you ever seen her smoking cigars?

634
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:47,790
No.

635
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:48,500
She smokes cigarettes.

636
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,580
But I think

637
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,449
she buys cigars to give to her friends.

638
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:54,400
So,

639
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,350
do you want me to check it out for you?

640
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,190
Don't hesitate to ask me,

641
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,530
I have time.

642
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,610
Don't hesitate anymore.

643
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:06,840
Let me tell you,

644
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:08,030
when it comes to investigating this kind of thing,

645
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,910
your methods won't be effective.

646
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,080
Do you know why?

647
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,670
The only people interested in Li Miaohan's romantic affairs

648
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,840
are the wives of those friends,

649
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,580
or the ordinary folks outside.

650
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,550
Do you believe that

651
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,340
the information you struggle to find

652
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,470
can't compare to what I can easily get

653
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,810
by asking a few people?

654
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,620
Do you believe it?

655
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,590
Do you?

656
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:30,170
I believe it, of course I do. Absolutely.

657
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,390
Who is my brother?

658
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,390
In Changsha,

659
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:34,250
there's no one who doesn't know Young Master Yun.

660
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,250
That's right.

661
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,380
I'm flattered.

662
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,550
But you know me,

663
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,350
since I was young,

664
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,150
I've always enjoyed making friends.

665
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,670
If someone in Changsha asks

666
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,790
who has the most friends,

667
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,020
it's gotta be me, hands down.

668
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,780
Of course,

669
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,520
my brother really is amazing.

670
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,580
By the way, Hongqi,

671
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:56,360
let's get back to the main topic.

672
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,040
Stop going to Xu Nian.

673
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:00,670
Also,

674
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:04,280
he might have already become someone else's spy.

675
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,910
This time, he didn't handle the matter with Myna properly;

676
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,510
he's really been unethical.

677
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,890
It's time to give him a warning.

678
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:12,820
As for us,

679
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,930
we need to take it slow.

680
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,730
Making too much noise will alert the enemy.

681
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:18,390
And you absolutely cannot ask about the cigars.

682
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,890
You should try to find out

683
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:22,040
if she's had any recent contact with anyone,

684
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,830
what kind of people she's been involved with,

685
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,170
whether she's had any arguments,

686
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:27,230
or any unusual behaviors or actions.

687
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,300
Got it.

688
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,510
You don't need to worry about that.

689
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,510
I'll let you know.

690
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:33,580
Hongqi,

691
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,120
there's something urgent right now

692
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,580
that I need your help with.

693
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,550
You need my help?

694
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,070
Tell me.

695
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,510
It's about Mi Lan.

696
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,720
She wants to retrieve her father's body

697
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,980
and bury him properly.

698
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,040
But I had a quarrel with Wen Yeming.

699
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,570
If I'm the one to speak up,

700
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,130
it's definitely not going to happen.

701
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,870
She came to talk to you about this?

702
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,490
Actually, she could've

703
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,530
just told me directly.

704
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,500
She said it's impossible between the two of you.

705
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,230
It would waste both of your time.

706
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,830
Did you say something to her?

707
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,390
I really didn't expect it.

708
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:20,350
On the surface, she seems like a gentle, delicate girl,

709
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,510
but it turns out

710
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:24,030
her heart is so determined.

711
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,270
It's my fault too.

712
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:26,970
About her father's matter,

713
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,750
I should have taken care of it for her earlier.

714
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,480
It would have allowed her to rest in peace sooner.

715
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,280
Hongqi,

716
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,350
there are plenty of good girls.

717
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,020
Don't be too stubborn.

718
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,250
What?

719
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,180
I just hope that one day,

720
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:50,220
you fall in love with a girl,

721
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,610
and she doesn't agree,

722
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:55,030
and you can comfort yourself with this phrase.

723
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,350
Yun Hongqi,

724
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,470
please come in.

725
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,100
Alright.

726
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,030
Prepare yourself.

727
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,430
We're going out for a bit.

728
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,590
Today, we're planning to lay your father to rest.

729
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,490
I'm really sorry.

730
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:32,670
Actually,

731
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,620
I didn't want to trouble you.

732
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,910
Helping each other out between friends isn't a trouble.

733
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:38,710
Besides,

734
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,710
you've helped us so many times before.

735
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,870
This time I'm just returning the favor.

736
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:43,900
It's only right.

737
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,630
You really don't need to overthink it,

738
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,160
I have no ulterior motives.

739
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:49,970
I know.

740
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,290
I certainly trust your character.

741
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,230
That's good.

742
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,590
Then you get ready.

743
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,250
I'll wait for you downstairs.

744
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,800
He's here, Young Master.

745
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,470
Young Master Yun.

746
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:33,950
Huang.

747
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:34,750
Keep it.

748
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:35,900
Dao.

749
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:36,390
This...

750
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:36,870
Take it.

751
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:37,590
Huang,

752
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,830
the task I'm giving you this time

753
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:40,890
carries some risk.

754
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,020
Take this money,

755
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,590
and reward your fellows.

756
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,430
Don't let them take risks for nothing.

757
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,110
Got it.

758
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,170
As you instructed.

759
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,210
Here's the situation.

760
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:54,400
Hurry up.

761
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:05,290
[Grave of late father, Mi Xingwei]

762
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:23,130
[Dadechang Jewelry]

763
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,430
Mi Lan,

764
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,920
the deceased is gone,

765
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,110
but you must take care of yourself.

766
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:37,240
I think your father's spirit in heaven

767
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,490
wouldn't want to see you like this now.

768
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,300
It'll get better in a few days.

769
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,480
I'll live well.

770
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,730
I can't let my father pass away with worry.

771
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,780
[Chief's Office]

772
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,160
The men in the photos

773
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:09,020
are either Li Miaohan's lovers

774
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,820
or have an ambiguous relationship with her.

775
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,410
They all smoke cigars.

776
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,030
Theoretically,

777
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:16,470
they are all suspects.

778
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,640
I'm having people investigate them one by one.

779
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,610
The key is to figure out what they were doing

780
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:23,090
and where they went

781
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:25,190
during the suspicious time frame on the day Myna was killed.

782
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,720
It should be resolved soon.

783
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:40,190
Commander.

784
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,070
I know.

785
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:47,710
I will hand over the intelligence to you as soon as possible.

786
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:49,030
But I really can't

787
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,630
be certain about the timing.

788
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,610
Is the Commander urging us again?

789
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:03,070
He wants us to provide him with intelligence as soon as possible

790
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:05,310
and to uncover the mastermind behind it.

791
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:06,950
No matter how much power he has,

792
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:07,750
he doesn't have the right

793
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,750
to interfere with our NBIS affairs.

794
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:17,190
Shoot.

795
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:19,050
-You are quite angry.
-Director.

796
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:20,830
Things have changed.

797
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,220
We need to get Myna's intelligence as soon as possible.

798
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:29,910
Miss Mi Lan,

799
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,070
in my life,

800
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:34,530
I've always wished to have a granddaughter,

801
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:37,350
but unfortunately, I'm not blessed with that.

802
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,310
So,

803
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,150
if you don't mind,

804
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:43,000
you're always welcome to visit my home.

805
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,310
Alright,

806
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:45,700
if you don't mind,

807
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:48,210
I'll definitely come visit frequently.

808
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:50,170
I'd be more than happy to have you.

809
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,100
-Grandma.
-Grandma.

810
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:54,600
Miss Mi Lan,

811
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:55,600
you've come at just the right time.

812
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,190
I have some things I'd like to ask you.

813
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:58,190
Please, sit down.

814
00:42:58,190 --> 00:42:58,990
By the way,

815
00:42:58,990 --> 00:42:59,750
Hongqi,

816
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,120
last time, Wei brought me some donkey-hide gelatin.

817
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,310
Could you take me to find it?
