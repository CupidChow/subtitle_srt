00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,670
My leg...

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,130
Let's go.

5
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,370
Check on the girls' school.

6
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,079
Alright.

7
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,170
Give me a hand.

8
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,230
Take it slow.

9
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,360
How is it?

10
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,180
It hurts.

00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,250
How's it going?

00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:57,960
Principal Wei,

14
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,220
what's the situation?

15
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,240
Several students didn't make it out during the air raid.

16
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,900
They're trapped underneath.

17
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,690
Is she alright?

18
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,170
Careful!

Watch out!

Are you okay?

22
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,630
Stay back!

23
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:24,880
Slowly, gently.

How is she?

28

How... how is she?

29
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,210
She... She didn't make it.

30
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,250
I hope you can still smell

34
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,960
Do you need to go to the hospital for a check-up?

35

I'm fine.

36
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:37,870
No need.

00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,870
I still have to tend to other wounded.

38
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,570
I'll get going now.

39
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,100
Alright.

41
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,230
may I know your name?

42
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,460
Our young master feels terribly guilty

43
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,580
about your injury.

44
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,450
He'd like to visit and apologize personally.

45
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,510
That's not necessary.

46
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,840
Don't trouble yourselves over my injury.

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,870
I'll wait right here

65
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,110
and trap him like a turtle in a jar.

but there's no sign of Yun Hongshen.

You told me on the phone that it was locked down tight.

77
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,630
So where is he now?

78
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,030
He grew wings and flew away?

79

I'm absolutely certain.

81
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,430
So, he made it to the station and then escaped again?

For the past few days, the students have been protesting.

87
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,289
Did the girls' school join in?

88
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:38,090
Yes, they did.

89
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,390
But out of respect for the Yun family,

90
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,870
our people held back.

91
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,870
That's why we couldn't

92
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,730
fully suppress the protests.

93
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,960

He personally planned tomorrow's operation.

95
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,460
Yun Hongqi is known

96
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,190
for his integrity

97
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:58,960
and extensive connections.

98
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,490
He has friends everywhere.

99
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,450
If he finds out about tomorrow's operation,

100
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,720
he won't be pleased.

101
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,440
If a conflict breaks out,

102
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,940
it'll be embarrassing for everyone.

103

The deputy station chief has ordered absolute secrecy.

104
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,410

reach Yun Hongqi's ears,

106
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,980
so we could still have the upper hand.

107
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,390
Most of the guys here are locals from Changsha.

108
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,430
Many owe a debt of gratitude to the Yun family.

109
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,410
It's almost impossible

110
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,450
to keep this under wraps.

111
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,930

you

122
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,220
should just stay at home.

-It's been taken care of.
-Okay.

138
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,160
But she was busy,

139
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,880
so her head nurse received them on her behalf.

00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,260

Okay.

NBIS really has nothing better to do.

157
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,680
Instead of catching Japanese spies,

00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,560
Carry on with your work.

382
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:56,900
Young Master.

383
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,340
Gangzi ran into Rat on his way here.

384
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,600
He asked Gangzi to pass along a message.

385
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:05,580
Last night, Wu Tong and Cong Hu

386
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,820
went to some little shops that collect old newspapers.

387
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,150
They asked the owner to sell them newspapers from years ago.

388
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,400
What kind of old newspapers?

389
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,200
It seems to be

390
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,600
the issue covering the 15th anniversary of the girls' school.

391
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,880
The 15th-anniversary issue?

392
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,370
Yes.

393
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:23,840
What's going on?

394
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,740
They're looking for Shen.

395
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:59,630
[Guli Mountain Temple]

396
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,460
That issue had photos of our whole family.

397
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,420
Now they're searching for a young man...

398
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,440
Who else could it be but Shen?

399
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,790
But isn't the second young master in Shanghai?

400
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:49,450
He would've told you if he came back to Changsha!

401
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,910
Something's definitely wrong.

402
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,080
This is the Bank of France.

403
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,260
Whom may I direct you to?

404
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:06,660
Hello,

405
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,780
I'd like to speak with Bank Manager Yun Muzhi.

406
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,820
I'm sorry, sir,

407
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,110
but Mr. Yun passed away from a heart attack a few days ago.

408
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,330
Young Master, what's wrong?

409
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,640
What's the matter?

410
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,060
What's wrong, Young Master?

411
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,460
Has something happened?

412
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,380
It's impossible.

413
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,860
This can't be true...

414
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,660
Something's not right.

415
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,300
If anything had happened to Father,

416
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,010
Shen would've told us.

417
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,110
No way...

418
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,660
Some-something's happened.

419
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,070
No.

420
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,100
Did something happen to Master Yun?

421
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,300
Secretary Liu said

422
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,580
Uncle Yang came back a few days ago, right?

423
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,060
Yes.

424
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,000
Minister Yang just returned from Shanghai.

425
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,400
Let's go to the city hall.

426
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:56,420
I don't want to see another report

427
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,480
like this again—it's far too sloppy.

428
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,500
Yes, Minister Yang.

429
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,430
I'll be more careful in the future.

430
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,830
Call Chen Si and tell him

431
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,460
this is from me: I want to see

432
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,700
an exact account of every penny spent.

433
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,020
If even one cent is unaccounted for,

434
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,580
he won't get another dollar

435
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,450
from me.

436
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,430
Understood.

437
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,250
Minister Yang,

438
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,300
here's a document

439
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,030
that requires your signature.

440
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,040
Building an official residence?

441
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:20,970
At a time like this,

442
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,580
when the nation is in crisis?

443
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:23,270
Tell him

444
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,620
I won't sign it.

445
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,460
If he insists, he can come to see me personally.

446
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,220
Minister,

447
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,080
you have a visitor.

448
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,220
You can get back to work.

449
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,100
In half an hour,

450
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,100
we'll have a meeting in my office.

451
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,810
Yes, sir.

452
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,210
Qi,

453
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,520
you really live up to your reputation

454
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,020
—you've got ears everywhere.

455
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,020
I just got back, and here you are already.

456
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,820
Secretary Wu,

457
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,100
you can go attend to other matters.

458
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,700
Don't let anyone disturb us.

459
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,200
Here.

460
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,560
Sit down, sit down.

461
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,120
Have a seat.

462
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:01,840
Uncle Yang.

463
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,140
Qi.

464
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,700
You don't look well.

465
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:05,620
What's wrong?

466
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,540
Uncle Yang, did something happen to my father?

467
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,750
Who told you that?

468
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,620
I called the bank at noon.

469
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,790
They said

470
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,140
my father had a sudden heart attack...

471
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,190
And passed away.

472
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:23,060
Is that true, Uncle Yang?

473
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,890
Your father is fine.

474
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,540
Not a scratch on him.

475
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,620
But he's run into some trouble,

476
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:34,790
so he had to fake his death to get out of a tight spot.

477
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,120
During this period,

478
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,420
he might not be able to contact you,

479
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:40,650
so you'll need to be mentally prepared.

480
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:41,860
But remember,

481
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,780
in front of others,

482
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,100
you need to act like it's real.

483
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,820
Is that true, Uncle Yang?

484
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,770
Don't you trust me?

485
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,220
I do.

486
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,580
Uncle Yang, I trust you.

487
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,280
Uncle Yang,

488
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,700
but why didn't Shen contact us

489
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,940
after coming back?

490
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:03,850
If this is all about

491
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,570
making the fake death seem real,

492
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,740
wouldn't it be better to spread the news widely,

493
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,670
so everyone believes my father...

494
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,470
There's no reason to keep it hidden from me, is there?

495
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,150
How did you know Shen is back?

496
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,990
Uncle Yang, here's what happened:

497
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:23,260
The new school campus land for the girls' school—

498
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,940
Bai Qingkui was after that land too,

499
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,570
but in the end, I secured it.

500
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,220
He's been holding a grudge ever since

501
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,750
and has been sending people to cause trouble.

502
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,100
I anticipated this,

503
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,660
so I had someone keeping an eye on things.

504
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,420
I heard

505
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,580
he's been looking for the report

506
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,740
on the girls' school's 15th anniversary.

507
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,250
That newspaper had a group photo of our entire family.

508
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,380
And just this morning,

509
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,820
he sent someone to the train station

510
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,580
to search for a young man.

511
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,090
So, I'm guessing…

512
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,080
They're looking for Shen.

513
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,500
That Bai Qingkui...

514
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,110
He's got quite the reach.

515
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,700
He even found out in advance that Shen was back.

516
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,360
Uncle Yang, you might not know this,

517
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,150
but Bai Qingkui

518
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:59,060
runs all sorts of shady businesses.

519
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,460
Plus, his ships frequently go to Shanghai.

520
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,840
So, I was thinking…

521
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,220
Maybe he got wind of something.

522
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,630
And now he wants to capture Shen,

523
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:08,580
using him as leverage

524
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,310
to force me into negotiations.

525
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,590
It's very likely that Shen noticed

526
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,380
something was off at the train station

527
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,980
and decided to hide himself.

528
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,620
He'll reach out to you

529
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,180
once he's safe.

530
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,500
Don't worry.

531
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:22,650
Oh, Qi,

532
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,210
about your father's situation...

533
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,070
Don't tell your grandmother yet.

534
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,230
Wait until Shen comes back,

535
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,860
and he can

536
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:33,210
explain everything clearly.

537
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,550
Only then should you inform her.

538
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,220
I understand.

539
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,870
I won't say anything

540
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,820
until I get the full picture.

541
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,020
Good.

542
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,640
Dao.

543
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,620
Starting today,

544
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,300
you need to learn to act.

545
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,140
Act?

546
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,380
Act sad.

547
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,930
Sad?

548
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,980
But Second Young Master hasn't returned yet.

549
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,840
I'll act sad once he's back, okay?

550
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,380
I'm driving now.

551
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,490
Also,

552
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,180
no one outside of our family

553
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,180
can know about my father's situation.

554
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,630
Got it, Young Master.

555
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,340
Yang Ziming felt very uneasy.

556
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,740
According to their original plan,

557
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,210
Yun Hongshen should have arrived in Changsha

558
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,700
yesterday morning by ship, accompanying the casket.

559
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,740
By now, he should have been here.

560
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,280
But just now, Yun Hongqi mentioned

561
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,340
that Yun Hongshen came back by train.

562
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,590
Clearly, something unexpected must have happened.

563
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,590
Minister Yang.

564
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:52,760
[Pay Phone]

565
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,150
Hello, brother?

566
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:01,100
It's your seventh cousin here.

567
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:02,820
Seventh cousin!

568
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,380
I heard you went down to Southeast Asia?

569
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,260
Southeast Asia? No way!

570
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,440
I was tricked into going up to the northeast.

571
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,040
Just managed to get back now.

572
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,590
So, how are you now?

573
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,260
Don't worry.

574
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:13,820
I'm fine.

575
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:14,740
Everything's good.

576
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,600
It's like this,

577
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,870
my fifth uncle

578
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,830
wanted me to ask—

579
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:20,580
Why haven't you contacted the family lately?

580
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,330
The phone line at my home

581
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,480
has been faulty for days.

582
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,300
I see.

583
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:33,750
Oriole had completely lost contact with Yun Muzhi.

584
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:37,180
This confirms that something has indeed happened to Yun Muzhi.

585
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,710
What exactly transpired during this period?

586
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,820
Perhaps Yun Hongshen

587
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,780
is the only one who knows the truth.

588
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,100
Contact Nighthawk immediately.

589
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,050
Have him find out

590
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,780
if Hongshen has indeed returned to Changsha.

591
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,780
In my study, on the second shelf of the bookcase, there's an album.

592
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,700
It has photos of me, Hongshen, and Hongqi together.

593
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,650
Show him the photos

594
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:03,340
so he can recognize Hongshen.

595
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:03,820
Yes.

596
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,340
I'll get on it right away.

597
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,420
[Supervision Department]

598
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,020
When did he come back?

599
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:47,770
Last night.

600
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,370
I heard he went straight to his office after arriving,

601
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:52,180
didn't even report to the Station Chief.

602
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,040
That's inappropriate, isn't it?

603
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:55,290
Watch your mouth.

604
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:56,620
You know better than anyone

605
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,730
that he's the last person here you'd want to offend.

606
00:32:58,730 --> 00:32:59,660
Right, right...

607
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,260
[Loyalty to the Party, Love for the Nation, Uphold Confidentiality]

608
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,300
Come in.

609
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,340
Chief.

610
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,080
Deputy Chief.

611
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,920
You go ahead.

612
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,500
I have a meeting to attend.

613
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,050
Good work.

614
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,940
Thanks for your hard work.

615
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,900
You must be exhausted.

616
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,030
You don't look well—

617
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,940
how many hours did you even sleep?

618
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,540
It's fine.

619
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:54,850
Chief,

620
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,770
is Wen Yeming coming back?

621
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,820
I have a few questions to ask her.

622
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,100
Chief,

623
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:01,860
I'm back.

624
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,620
You're back just in time.

625
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,950
Director Ling has some questions for you.

626
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,780
How did Qu Wenzhi die?

627
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:11,560
He was taken out by a sniper.

628
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,199
Three shots,

629
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,260
killed on the spot.

630
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,699
I had colleagues in Shanghai investigate.

631
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:17,139
The assassin was highly skilled—

632
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,810
left no trace to follow.

633
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,139
Based on your experience,

634
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:22,199
those three shots…

635
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:24,050
How many shooters were involved?

636
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:26,690
Judging by the timing and angles of the shots that hit Qu Wenzhi,

637
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,620
there were likely three shooters.

638
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,150
Did he say anything

639
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:31,900
before he died?

640
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:34,230
I asked him

641
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,040
who arranged for his release,

642
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:37,699
but he was too scared to say.

643
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:38,850
His wife and child have vanished—

644
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:41,310
they're likely in the hands of the Japanese.

645
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:42,250
No wonder.

646
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,170
Chief,

647
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:46,219
I suspect we have a mole in our upper ranks.

648
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,780
The Chief is really playing favorites.

649
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,179
Both of us went to Shanghai for the mission,

650
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,710
but he only sees Wen Yeming.

651
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,180
He's clearly

652
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,540
planning to give all the credit to her alone.

653
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,920
Alright, that's enough.

654
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,660
This time, getting through

655
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,590
having no merit or fault is already the best outcome.

656
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,910
Qu Wenzhi's case has reached the higher-ups—

657
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,500
it needs to be dealt with.

658
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,760
Wen Yeming went solo to Shanghai to capture the traitor—

659
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,620
that was her own cunning.

660
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,930
If she succeeds, we all share the glory,

661
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,620
and we together might get a reprieve.

662
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,780
If she fails,

663
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:21,540
having someone to share the blame with

664
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:24,510
would at least make her punishment less severe.

665
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:29,210
That's me?

666
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,150
The Chief sure puts a lot of thought

667
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:35,060
into Wen Yeming.

668
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,660
I agree with Director Ling.

669
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,340
All the commanders in the Ninth War Zone

670
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,940
are under our surveillance.

671
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,900
Every independent operation

672
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,610
goes through layers of approval.

673
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,330
Routes, security plans—

674
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,720
they're all set by us.

675
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,420
Under such circumstances,

676
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,100
for Qu Wenzhi to not only defect

677
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,250
but successfully escape,

678
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,580
it would've been impossible without inside help.

679
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,980
-I suggest...
-Director Ling.

680
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,820
You're in charge of investigating the mole.

681
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,350
I'm entrusting this to you.

682
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,780
If you need anything,

683
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,260
get Wen Yeming to assist.

684
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,230
Yes, sir.

685
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,020
Yes, sir.

686
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,830
You should go rest soon.

687
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:07,700
Yes, sir.

688
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,860
Anything else?

689
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,310
The communists who disrupted the assassination of Qu Wenzhi...

690
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,640
We've eliminated them.

691
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,060
Sir,

692
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,100
those communists

693
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,220
shouldn't have been killed.

694
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,150
That's not your place to question.

695
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,110
Putting aside political allegiances,

696
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,580
repaying kindness is the most basic principle of being human.

697
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,400
Wen Yeming.

698
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:40,170
How can one allow others to sleep soundly beside one's own bed?

699
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,600
The communists have already infiltrated

700
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,720
even the inner circle of the Ninth War Zone Commander.

701
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,070
The Principal is furious.

702
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,740
You know that's his bottom line—

703
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,340
he won't let anyone touch it.

704
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,630
I don't understand.

705
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,870
We are all Chinese.

706
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,940
With the enemy at our doorstep, we should unite against them.

707
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,110
These internal conflicts are just a waste of time and resources.

708
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:58,110
Doesn't he worry about breaking the nation's spirit?

709
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,700
Sir...

710
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,650
Enough! Don't bring this up again!

711
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,050
If even I can't do anything about it,

712
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:08,960
what can you do?

713
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,060
Sometimes, I even question

714
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:14,950
whether I chose the right path back then.

715
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,180
I don't want to hear you say things like that again!

716
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:16,980
Do you hear me?

717
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,300
I know you're in pain,

718
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,870
and I know what's going on in your mind.

719
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,330
Because I was once your age.

720
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:45,830
But understand this:

721
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,540
Sometimes, to achieve your goals,

722
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,600
you have to make compromises. Got it?

723
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,940
-But...
-No buts.

724
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,500
Finding the mole, uncovering who was behind Qu Wenzhi's defection,

725
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,370
and fighting the Japanese—it's all the same.

726
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:59,300
It's just a matter of perspective.

727
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,550
Understood.

728
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,210
[Yun Residence]

729
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:11,960
I'll get it.

730
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,130
Hello,

731
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,340
Secretary Liu?

732
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,300
That's great.

733
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:21,860
Okay.

734
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,420
I'll be sure to thank you in person another day.

735
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,340
Alright, alright.

736
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:25,930
Goodbye.

737
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,350
It's been an entire day,

738
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,260
and that rascal Shen still hasn't reached out to me.

739
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,140
Grandma,

740
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,620
it was Secretary Liu.

741
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,620
He told me that the paperwork

742
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,220
for the girls' school land has been finalized.

743
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,500
That's wonderful.

744
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,320
One less thing to worry about.

745
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,300
Exactly.

746
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,110
That's why knowing how to deal with people is key.

747
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,710
If you cater to their needs,

748
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,140
things get done quickly.

749
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,860
But it seems like you have something else on your mind.

750
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,460
Do I?

751
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,510
Don't you think he seems a bit distracted?

752
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:21,940
This person.

753
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,090
Keep an eye on his movements

754
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:26,860
and protect him as much as possible.

755
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,730
[Chinese Communist Underground, Changsha Police Bureau, Captain Tang]

756
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:27,750
Understood.

757
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:08,410
She's been very cautious along the way,

758
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:09,600
using various methods

759
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,460
to check if anyone is tailing her.

760
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,680
She didn't come here

761
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:15,290
just for a meal.

762
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,600
On the day Qu Wenzhi defected,

763
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,910
the intersection he used for his escape

764
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,310
was passed by a bus

765
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,030
that arrived on schedule,

766
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,740
without any incidents.

767
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,560
We can rule out any issues there.

768
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,340
However, the license plate of the truck

769
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,070
that blocked our view was clearly switched—

770
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:35,030
the original vehicle was out of town at the time.

771
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,820
The ambulance that collided with the truck

772
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,620
was from the Military Hospital.

773
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,270
They had received a notification from the frontlines,

774
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:42,590
requesting them to pick up wounded soldiers.

775
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,790
That part checks out,

776
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,880
but the timing of the call was just too perfect.

777
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,500
I suspect both the truck and the ambulance were involved.

778
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,630
But now that several days have passed,

779
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:54,170
the people involved and any evidence

780
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,490
are likely destroyed.

781
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,080
We'll have to backtrack

782
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,080
and investigate Qu Wenzhi himself.

783
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,400
There's another lead—

784
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,730
the route Qu Wenzhi took to leave Changsha.

785
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,100
You really didn't have to escort me back;

786
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,500
I can take care of myself.

787
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,200
Hurry upstairs

788
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:43,470
and rest.

789
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,020
See you tomorrow.

790
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,670
He is following Director Ling.

791
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,320
He's simply courting death.
