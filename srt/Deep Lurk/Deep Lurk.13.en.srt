00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,830
[Episode 13]

3
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:38,950
Oh, right,

4
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,759
Hongqi,

5
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,220
last time Wei gave me some donkey-hide gelatin.

6
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,110
I forgot where I put it.

7
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:47,070
Can you take me to find it?

8
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:49,410
I want to give it to Mi Lan.

9
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:51,820
Donkey-hide gelatin is best for girls.

10
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,509
Certainly, Grandma.

11
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:53,789
-Let me help you.
-Here.

12
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:54,590
Okay.

13
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:55,570
Okay.

14
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,110
Please, stay seated.

15
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,240
Go ahead and ask.

16
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,870
I'll tell you

17
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,430
everything I know.

18
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,740
Did your father have any little habits

19
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,600
that were different from others?

20
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,830
Or...

21
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,480
did he have any taboos that outsiders didn't know about?

22
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:19,920
In short,

23
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,910
were there any details about his daily life that others aren't aware of?

24
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,800
My father didn't like the number four.

25
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,890
When eating,

26
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,670
he always preferred to finish what he didn't like first,

27
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,140
leaving what he liked to the end.

28
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,230
He liked to eat rice with soy sauce at home,

29
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,420
but he never did that in front of others.

30
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,680
He said it didn't look good.

31
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,110
That's all.

32
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,010
He didn't like the number four

33
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,110
and preferred to leave the food he liked until the end to eat?

34
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,600
Yes.

35
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,800
That's his pattern.

36
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,220
Miss Mi Lan,

37
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,460
thank you.

38
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:00,910
Yun Hongshen,

39
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,440
are you investigating my father?

40
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:03,980
Yes.

41
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,870
We've made some progress.

42
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,070
If there's anything you need me to do,

43
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:07,910
just tell me.

44
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,350
No matter what the cost,

45
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,310
I will avenge him.

46
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,510
Don't worry.

47
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,980
I'll find that person soon.

48
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,620
Director.

49
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,540
You may go out now.

50
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,140
-I'll transcribe this telegram myself.
-Yes.

51
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,590
There's another method of encoding

52
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,250
called the Nine-Square Grid.

53
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,090
The nine positions represent the numbers 1 to 9,

54
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,510
and the sum of the numbers

55
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,710
in any row or column always adds up to 15.

56
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:52,430
He didn't like the number 4.

57
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,350
He always preferred to finish what he didn't like to eat first,

58
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,430
leaving what he liked to the end.

59
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,700
Dad, I finally did it.

60
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,480
I succeeded.

61
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,060
Cracking Myna's code is just the first step.

62
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,110
The real test has just begun.

63
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:23,930
I know.

64
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,430
Kunwu will surely find a way

65
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,910
to stop me from obtaining the cipher key.

66
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,790
Actually, what's truly terrifying isn't your opponent,

67
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,390
but the mental blocks you've set for yourself.

68
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,270
When you fear him,

69
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,200
he seems exceptionally powerful.

70
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,909
You should face him head-on.

71
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,050
He's just an opponent, nothing more,

72
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,270
with weaknesses

73
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,190
and flaws.

74
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,470
So believe in yourself

75
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,740
that you will definitely defeat him.

76
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,390
Dad,

77
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,830
do you believe I can do it?

78
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:20,870
Sir,

79
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,910
are there any new orders from the Director?

80
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,780
Those Communists never stop causing trouble.

81
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,630
What happened?

82
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,670
The Communist Party leaked the news that the Principal

83
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,630
had ordered the Commander to abandon Changsha

84
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,110
and retreat to Hengyang.

85
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,860
Now, things are in chaos in Chongqing.

86
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,909
The students are on strike, workers are protesting,

87
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:47,870
and the newspapers are full of all kinds of reports.

88
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,820
Those big shots are going to the Principal's house every day to demand an explanation,

89
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,710
and even Madam Sun has stepped in.

90
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,560
The Principal is really troubled,

91
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,960
and the Director is under a lot of pressure.

92
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,310
We should take a proactive stance

93
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,630
and find the intelligence and the mastermind

94
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,490
behind the assassination plan as soon as possible.

95
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,750
How's Yun Hongshen's progress on decoding the codebook?

96
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:09,880
I'm not clear

97
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,100
on the details yet.

98
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,710
It seems that Yun Hongshen doesn't trust us.

99
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,970
He wants to do many things at his own pace,

100
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,960
especially when it comes to decoding the codebook.

101
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,270
Sir,

102
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,070
I hope you'll reconsider your decision.

103
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,000
Letting Yun Hongshen join the NBIS

104
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,390
may not be the right choice.

105
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,190
I trust my judgment.

106
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,450
But he's too unpredictable.

107
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,720
Don't you think he harbors hostility towards us?

108
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,970
Don't you think

109
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,220
it would be a great accomplishment

110
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,600
to tame a wild, untamable beast?

111
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,110
But we still haven't verified

112
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,830
his true identity.

113
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:53,990
Sir,

114
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,110
don't forget,

115
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,230
behind Yun Hongshen is Yun Muzhi.

116
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,390
You once told me yourself

117
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,020
that there are too many doubts surrounding Yun Muzhi,

118
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,830
and even you can't see through him.

119
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,430
Since Yun Hongshen returned to the country,

120
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,030
he had been by his father's side.

121
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,290
No one knows whether he's black or white.

122
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,350
Using a person like him

123
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,070
is too risky for us.

124
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,240
It seems you still have strong reservations about him.

125
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,510
Come in.

126
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,550
Chief,

127
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,700
Wild Fox sent a telegram back.

128
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,560
You may leave.

129
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,400
We've figured out Yun Hongshen's identity.

130
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,740
This guy is not only useful,

131
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,680
but if used properly, he'll be a sharp sword.

132
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,870
You must understand,

133
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,870
the more sharp swords like you and Yun Hongshen I have,

134
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,630
the better.

135
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,660
Why would I discard something that valuable?

136
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,750
Changsha's Little Mengchang.

137
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,750
Wherever there are people in Changsha,

138
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,550
there are friends of Yun Hongqi.

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,790
You know,

140
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,590
sometimes having too many friends isn't necessarily a good thing.

141
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,220
Are you planning to use Yun Hongqi as the breakthrough point?

142
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:29,860
Wrong.

143
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,460
I just want Yun Hongshen to walk into our NBIS

144
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,030
with his head down.

145
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,670
Young Master,

146
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,270
all the instructions have been passed on.

147
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,150
Gangzi said

148
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,990
that Li Miaohan is somewhat of a celebrity.

149
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,950
Investigating her affairs won't be difficult.

150
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,950
He will gather

151
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,710
all the information and hand it over to us

152
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,640
in just two days.

153
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,830
Huang and Rat

154
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,110
also have their own connections.

155
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,440
Just wait patiently for two days,

156
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,030
and they'll definitely dig up

157
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,590
everything about Li Miaohan.

158
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,850
But if Li Miaohan really is problematic,

159
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,190
her public identity

160
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,420
must be flawless.

161
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,500
Young Master.

162
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,000
Why are you looking at me like this?

163
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,220
You know what?

164
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,070
The way you speak now

165
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,830
is just like Second Young Master.

166
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:39,420
Really?

167
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,440
Watch me imitate you.

168
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,180
Look.

169
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,750
Her public identity

170
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,990
must be flawless.

171
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,230
How was that?

172
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,160
Did it look similar?

173
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,310
Did it?

174
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,060
Mr. Dao.

175
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,040
You're not busy right now?

176
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,310
Young Master,

177
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,150
keep reading your book.

178
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,030
I'll get to work.

179
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,590
I'm very busy.

180
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,310
Keep reading your book.

181
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,840
I'll go and handle my tasks.

182
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,390
Mr. Qin,

183
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,110
I haven't been to your shop in a while.

184
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,640
How's your business doing?

185
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,650
Officer Huang,

186
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,590
the business hasn't been good lately.

187
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,720
I'm almost out of cigarettes to smoke.

188
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,380
Here.

189
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,550
Please don't mind if it's not enough.

190
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,350
Mr. Qin,

191
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,120
don't worry.

192
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,320
I

193
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,930
have got inside information.

194
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,990
Your business is sure to pick up soon.

195
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,590
Nobody move!

196
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,400
Don't move!

197
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:22,830
He did it?

198
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,870
By the time we got here,

199
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,190
he was already dead,

200
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,360
reeking of alcohol.

201
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,750
According to our preliminary investigation at the scene,

202
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,080
it appears to be an accident caused by drunk driving.

203
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,040
Let's go, Mr. Li.

204
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,990
Jin Guoqiang is the deputy commander of Changsha's city defense.

205
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,050
The Japanese will surely target him.

206
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,730
This guy is notorious for being a womanizer.

207
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,450
If Li Miaohan is problematic,

208
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,430
could Jin Guoqiang

209
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,040
already have been turned?

210
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,280
Does Qu Wenzhi's defection

211
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,110
have anything to do with him?

212
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,390
Shen,

213
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,910
Jin Guoqiang is dead.

214
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,510
When? How?

215
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,430
Half an hour ago.

216
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,230
Car accident.

217
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,510
He was killed to silence him.

218
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,870
We just started investigating Li Miaohan,

219
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,750
and Jin Guoqiang, who had an ambiguous relationship with her,

220
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,410
is now dead.

221
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,440
Isn't that a bit too coincidental?

222
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:26,950
Hongqi,

223
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,310
this is no accident.

224
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,410
There's a mole in the NBIS.

225
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,770
Wen Yeming must be investigating that Punch cigar too.

226
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,190
It was only a matter of time before she found out about Li Miaohan.

227
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,410
Once the NBIS personnel and resources are involved,

228
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,810
the mole would naturally find a way to know.

229
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,630
It's truly a clever move.

230
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,510
So, will Li Miaohan be in danger?

231
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,670
Should we put her under our control as well?

232
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,390
For now, she shouldn't be in any danger.

233
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,310
With Jin Guoqiang dead,

234
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,390
Li Miaohan will become

235
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,190
a key surveillance target for the NBIS.

236
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,910
If she were silenced at this point,

237
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,290
it would only leave traces behind.

238
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,490
The Japanese wouldn't be that foolish.

239
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:00,550
However,

240
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,120
with Jin Guoqiang's death,

241
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,450
the focus has become blurred.

242
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,910
Now it's an unresolved mystery

243
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,110
whether he was the one who was problematic,

244
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,030
or if it's Li Miaohan.

245
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,690
So, the trail has been cut off.

246
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,510
He went to great lengths

247
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,190
to create this car accident.

248
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:18,850
Hongqi,

249
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,690
he must have left some clues or evidence behind.

250
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,270
Even if there are clues,

251
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,070
I doubt we'll be able to see them.

252
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,190
The NBIS

253
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,590
will definitely keep the information under their control.

254
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,510
Young Masters,

255
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,670
you should go and have a look.

256
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,870
That Officer Wen is here again.

257
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,270
She said she's here to arrest Young Master.

258
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,670
Madam Yun,

259
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,870
we mean no offense,

260
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,140
but Young Master Yun is involved in a serious case

261
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,550
regarding the illegal sale of military secrets.

262
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,830
We must take him back

263
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,550
to cooperate with the investigation.

264
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,150
Whether he's involved or not

265
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,500
is not something you can accuse with just a few words, is it?

266
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,970
Quite the show you're putting on.

267
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,340
What are you doing here?

268
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,350
You must be familiar with Huang Tao

269
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,150
from the police station, right?

270
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,710
Especially you, Young Master Yun.

271
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,170
The NBIS certainly has a lot of guts now.

272
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:17,180
You even dared to bring people to our Yun's Residence.

273
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,160
I know Huang.

274
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,640
What's wrong?

275
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,510
There is a grocery store in the east of the city,

276
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:24,190
which serves as a secret underground intelligence exchange center.

277
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,030
Huang Tao sold information to the shop owner

278
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:26,910
multiple times,

279
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,720
including some important military secrets.

280
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,110
He has now been captured by us.

281
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,170
According to his confession,

282
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,470
there have been several illegal transactions between you.

283
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,110
You've really gone to great lengths.

284
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,720
Truly, great lengths.

285
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,280
If you want to prove someone guilty,

286
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,940
you'll always find a pretext.

287
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,270
Are you sure you want to keep talking here?

288
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:49,700
Grandma,

289
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,990
please stay at home and wait for us, rest assured.

290
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,230
My brother and I will go with them

291
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,290
to clear things up.

292
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,790
Don't worry.

293
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,270
This is just a misunderstanding.

294
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,270
My brother will definitely be fine.

295
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:01,990
Grandma,

296
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,670
don't worry.

297
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,990
This is just a formality.

298
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,030
We'll go over, explain things to them,

299
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,150
and everything will be fine.

300
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,420
We'll be back in the evening

301
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,750
to have dinner with you.

302
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,710
You're letting traitors and the Japanese go free,

303
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,550
while constantly harassing innocent people.

304
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,730
I really don't know what you're trying to do.

305
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,830
I swear on my loyalty to the Kuomintang that,

306
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,510
as long as we make things clear,

307
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,990
we will definitely bring Young Master Yun back

308
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,280
safe and sound.

309
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,270
Grandma,

310
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,670
don't worry.

311
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,470
Even if they had ten times the courage,

312
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,040
they wouldn't dare do anything to me or Shen.

313
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,040
Rest assured.

314
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,900
Take good care of Grandma.

315
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,080
Do what you should do

316
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,990
and don't do what you shouldn't.

317
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:49,870
Old Madam,

318
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,950
should we ask Minister Yang for help?

319
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,050
Let's wait a little longer.

320
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:02,970
[Keep Secrets]

321
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,630
Shen, remember,

322
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,030
don't succumb to them

323
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,030
because of me.

324
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:10,850
Do you hear me?

325
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,430
The Yun family,

326
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,150
no matter when,

327
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,970
should never bend the knee.

328
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,150
No matter who it's to.

329
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,660
Young Master Yun,

330
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,660
this way, please.

331
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,650
Our Chief wants to see you.

332
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,620
Huang's case is complicated.

333
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,290
To survive,

334
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,750
he has started to implicate others at random.

335
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,480
No matter what, Yun Hongqi will bear this charge.

336
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,380
You want to fabricate evidence to force me to submit,

337
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,540
so you can better control me, right?

338
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,230
You're wrong.

339
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,230
I'm just trying to give you a way out.

340
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,130
I know that,

341
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,630
whether your intentions are sincere or not,

342
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,830
you came back this time to join the NBIS.

343
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,850
Kunwu has already noticed you.

344
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,750
If you voluntarily join the NBIS at this point,

345
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
he'll definitely figure out your motives.

346
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,200
He won't just sit by.

347
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,150
So, your situation will be difficult.

348
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,730
I understand what you mean.

349
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,260
Although this is all a play,

350
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,970
we have to make it convincing.

351
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,569
Ke Jingping will definitely investigate you in secret.

352
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,430
As long as he confirms you're not his enemy,

353
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,830
he'll do everything he can

354
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,290
to get you to join the NBIS.

355
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,390
Because that way,

356
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,010
he can better control you.

357
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,300
So, you need to go with the flow

358
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,510
and follow his rhythm.

359
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,260
At the right time, you just need to tell him

360
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,740
that the codebook is in your possession.

361
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,550
Then he will speed up the process

362
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,860
and set up a trap

363
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,190
that even Kunwu will find convincing,

364
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,810
using it to pressure you into joining the NBIS.

365
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,510
The NBIS's ability to speak nonsense

366
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,360
never fails to be eye-opening every time.

367
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,050
You didn't deny it.

368
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,130
I didn't admit to it either.

369
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:05,910
I know very well

370
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,920
the purpose of your return to Changsha this time.

371
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,630
You are bound to join the NBIS.

372
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,430
Because we are on the same page.

373
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:13,680
So, I don't oppose it.

374
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,020
Young man,

375
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,170
you'd better watch your step.

376
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,480
I don't understand what you're talking about.

377
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,180
Chief Ke,

378
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,980
don't think you can use Huang

379
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,030
to convict my brother.

380
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,760
That's impossible.

381
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,870
If you don't release my brother

382
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,570
by tomorrow morning,

383
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,210
I believe many people will come to greet you,

384
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,540
including the commander of our Ninth War Zone.

385
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,990
If he finds out that you're not

386
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,590
investigating the mastermind behind the assassination attempt on him,

387
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,710
but have been keeping an eye on our Yun family and not letting go,

388
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,230
he will be very unhappy.

389
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,520
Even the Yun family

390
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,070
can't threaten the NBIS.

391
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,940
Don't go looking for trouble.

392
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:54,890
It's not a threat;

393
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:55,730
it's a fact.

394
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,630
Goodbye.

395
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,940
He's too arrogant

396
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,090
and hard to control.

397
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:09,950
He and his father

398
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,680
are both difficult to control.

399
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,710
But I have no interest

400
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,930
in controlling someone like him.

401
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,090
A little discipline would be enough.

402
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,070
Sir,

403
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,390
I have a question.

404
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,710
If he really wants to join the NBIS,

405
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,230
why didn't he just take the opportunity

406
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,000
you gave him?

407
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,670
If he had,

408
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,470
his act wouldn't be convincing.

409
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,790
It looks like we'll need to add more fuel to the fire.

410
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,590
Sir,

411
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,710
what exactly is Yun Hongshen's purpose

412
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,410
in returning to Changsha?

413
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,430
As an excellent agent,

414
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:50,030
you must always suppress your curiosity.

415
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,430
I'm sorry.

416
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,310
I was wrong.

417
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:53,960
You may go.

418
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,750
Deputy Regimental Commander Qi,

419
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,430
Director Ling means well.

420
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,020
Commander Jin was unfortunately murdered.

421
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,310
We need to investigate this case thoroughly

422
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,810
to bring peace to his spirit.

423
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:11,740
Don't you agree?

424
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,190
Calm down. Don't be impulsive.

425
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,790
If they were really capable,

426
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,430
would they need to check the body twice?

427
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,570
Deputy Commander Jin

428
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,510
was a well-known hero in the Counter-Japanese War.

429
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,270
How could they tamper with his body?

430
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,790
I'm really sick of these people

431
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:29,820
who are always acting mysterious.

432
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,750
Get out of my way!

433
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,830
Deputy Regimental Commander Qi! Deputy Regimental Commander Qi!

434
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,430
Brothers,

435
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,710
put down the guns!

436
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,650
Put down your guns!

437
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,980
Quickly, put them down!

438
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,770
Deputy Regimental Commander Qi,

439
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:40,960
everyone means no harm.

440
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,960
Why do you have to cause such a scene?

441
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,410
Director Ling,

442
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,690
you're finally done inspecting.

443
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,720
Deputy Regimental Commander Qi has become agitated.

444
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,430
Did he offend anyone recently?

445
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,360
What do you mean?

446
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,910
Wasn't it a car accident?

447
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,230
It was a car accident.

448
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,060
Let's go.

449
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,900
It's highly likely that the car accident was deliberately caused.

450
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,270
This piece of glass is very long.

451
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,210
It went through Jin Guoqiang's right eye and into the back of his head.

452
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,940
Based on the impact at the time,

453
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,700
if the glass had gone in during the accident,

454
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,870
the blood spatter should have been much larger,

455
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,230
and the bleeding would have been more extensive.

456
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,040
But look.

457
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,790
The blood spatter on Jin Guoqiang's face

458
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,920
is clearly smaller.

459
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,800
Also,

460
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,270
the bloodstains that seeped into the glass

461
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,530
don't match the facts.

462
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,240
Here, the bloodstain is deeper

463
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,350
and more natural,

464
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,850
while here it's much lighter,

465
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:36,970
with less blood.

466
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,830
So you're suggesting

467
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,410
that during the car accident,

468
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,830
the glass didn't insert into

469
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,490
the back of Jin Guoqiang's head,

470
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,020
but that someone forcibly

471
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,530
stabbed it afterward?

472
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,240
That's pretty much the conclusion we can draw.

473
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,810
Li Liang reported to me after he came back,

474
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,170
but he didn't mention the situation

475
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,310
you told me.

476
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,670
There are two possibilities:

477
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:11,220
First,

478
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,670
he lacks the necessary skills.

479
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,190
Second,

480
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,760
he's not lacking in skill,

481
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,820
but deliberately kept this from you.

482
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,110
Are you saying that this car accident is related to him?

483
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:20,760
Chief,

484
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,330
I don't want to keep investigating this so gently.

485
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,360
It's a waste of time

486
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,220
and ineffective.

487
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,590
So, what do you want to do?

488
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,940
You've already taken the first step.

489
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,570
I'll take a more forceful approach,

490
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,300
using others to pressure Yun Hongshen into complying.

491
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,970
As long as he hands over the codebook,

492
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,230
the mole will naturally reveal himself.

493
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:37,780
I agree.

494
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,640
Sir.

495
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,170
If that's the case,

496
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,230
Yun Hongqi is in serious danger this time.

497
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,430
This time,

498
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,090
he'll be lucky if he can keep his life.

499
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,890
And it's only because of the Yun family's

500
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:19,530
past contributions to the Kuomintang.

501
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,640
Even the Commander has tacitly approved it.

502
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,040
Your Boss Bai's good days

503
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,930
are about to come.

504
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,030
This is all thanks to you.

505
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,400
From now on,

506
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,470
we'll need to rely on you to look after us.

507
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,510
No need to mention it.

508
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,070
But I must remind you of something:

509
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,200
Even a weakened giant is still a giant.

510
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,390
Don't be too high-profile lately.

511
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:44,520
After all, the Yun family hasn't completely fallen yet.

512
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:45,910
I understand.

513
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,910
We'll make sure

514
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:49,040
not to put you in a difficult position.

515
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:49,700
Here, sir.

516
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,680
[Kunwu has surfaced. He may have been hiding in Changsha for a long time]

517
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,570
The first time we heard this codename

518
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:24,820
was five years ago.

519
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,490
You should still remember

520
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:27,930
the Kuramoto incident

521
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,110
in 1934.

522
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:33,200
Your father had a reliable informant

523
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:36,350
working at the Japanese Consulate in Nanjing at the time.

524
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,550
The night before Kuramoto disappeared,

525
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,470
this informant

526
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:42,410
heard this codename from Sumiyoshi Yoshiro,

527
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:44,810
the Consul General of Japan in Nanjing.

528
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,500
No need to clean here.

529
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,380
Go away.

530
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,810
I'm talking to you.

531
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,630
Get lost!

532
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,270
What are you doing?

533
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,990
Get out of the way!

534
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:24,010
The NBIS has already found Kuramoto.

535
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,570
If it weren't for Kunwu...

536
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,790
Sumiyoshi Yoshiro

537
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:39,690
always speaks quietly,

538
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,800
and she didn't dare to listen for too long.

539
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,330
So, she only vaguely

540
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,510
heard two key pieces of information.

541
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:56,030
[The person has remained silent in Changsha for many years. This time, as he surfaced, it must be for a major plan]

542
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,020
After the Kuramoto incident,

543
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,880
he went completely silent.

544
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,280
Your father investigated him for five years

545
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,400
but found no leads.

546
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:10,450
Not even his gender

547
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,040
or where he

548
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,040
was hiding.

549
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,790
Speaking of which,

550
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,550
Viscount

551
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:18,060
was an unexpected discovery during his investigation of Kunwu.

552
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:24,110
[Kunwu has been hiding for many years. His appearance this time must be part of a major conspiracy or action.
If we don't eliminate him, there could be great danger ahead]

553
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:53,130
[Nestling can reasonably be assumed to have been unable to escape due to being under surveillance by the Japanese invaders, and thus sacrificed itself to send a warning]

554
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,240
Boss Bai.

555
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,180
Boss Bai,

556
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,010
good news.

557
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,200
The heavy rain last night washed away

558
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,090
the new building that the Girls' School had just completed.

559
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:23,890
Good!

560
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,750
Excellent!

561
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,770
This is karma.

562
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,930
I've been waiting for this day for so long.

563
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,940
It looks like the Yun family is falling.

564
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,830
I need to plan carefully on

565
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,880
how to kick them

566
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,370
while they're down.

567
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:47,900
Hello?

568
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:49,850
Principal Wei.

569
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:52,380
Okay.

570
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,760
I'll be right there.

571
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,070
It was fine just a couple of days ago.

572
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,830
Why did it suddenly collapse?

573
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,270
Maybe the rain was too heavy yesterday,

574
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,400
and there was a strong wind too.

575
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,030
Grandma,

576
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:02,950
why don't you stay here?

577
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:03,710
I can go alone.

578
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:04,670
I'm going.

579
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,640
That's your grandfather's lifetime of effort.

580
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,620
I have to protect it for him.

581
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,320
Old Madam,

582
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,430
where are you going?

583
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,390
Aren't you going to eat?

584
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,630
I don't have time to eat.

585
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,830
Let's hurry up and take a look. Let's go.

586
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:47,620
[Xiangjiang Girls' School]

587
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:01,710
Madam.

588
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,750
Madam,

589
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,500
what brings you here?

590
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,050
I won't feel at ease

591
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,780
if I don't come and take a look.

592
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,630
It's not safe here right now.

593
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,630
Please follow me.

594
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,550
Be careful.

595
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,220
Alright.

596
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,240
Gosh.

597
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,670
How did it end up like this?

598
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,650
Yeah.

599
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,430
We're having them rebuild it now.

600
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,850
It collapsed over there too?

601
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:36,900
Yes.

602
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,980
It's very serious.

603
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,510
Please be careful.

604
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,950
Young Master would be heartbroken

605
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,110
to see this.

606
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,830
I never expected it to end up like this.

607
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,760
We must find a way to fix it quickly.

608
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:58,950
Be careful!

609
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,090
Here.

610
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,070
Take it easy.

611
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,000
Boss Bai, we've brought her here.

612
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,630
Cong Hu.

613
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:03,430
Help her up.

614
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,090
No problem.

615
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,140
Get up.

616
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,750
Old lady,

617
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,810
let me help you get some fresh air.

618
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,710
Mom?

619
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,380
Mom!

620
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,960
Mom!

621
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,300
Wu Tong, you bastard!

622
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,650
I'm going to kill you!

623
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,710
Grandma!

624
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,740
Shen!

625
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,550
I'm here.

626
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,190
Grandma.

627
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,220
How are you? Are you okay?

628
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,390
I'm fine.

629
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,680
I was scared out of my mind.

630
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,010
I got splashed with mud.

631
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,260
It's fine.

632
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,670
Who gave you the guts?

633
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:42,830
How dare you?

634
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,440
-Alright.
-Dao.

635
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:45,830
Forget it.

636
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,360
They were just following orders.

637
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,670
Go back and tell Bai Qingkui

638
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:49,870
that when our Young Master arrives,

639
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:50,630
he'll be doomed.

640
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,190
Get lost!

641
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:56,860
What are you doing here?

642
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,990
Does this have anything to do with you?

643
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,440
Our Chief has something to say to you.

644
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,100
Grandma,

645
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,270
I'll go over there first.

646
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,390
Please wait for me here.

647
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,670
I'll head back first.

648
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,270
Alright.

649
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,070
Be careful.

650
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,070
Dao.

651
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:17,510
Be careful.

652
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:19,950
Are you all right?

653
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,030
To force me into submission,

654
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,830
you, a dignified station chief,

655
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,530
actually resorted to such a despicable method.

656
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,350
I think you should see it as me

657
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,110
just being in the right place at the right time

658
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,390
and saving your grandma.

659
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,850
You should be thanking me.

660
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,770
You knew someone was going to harm my grandma,

661
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,090
but you didn't warn me.

662
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,320
Instead, you allowed the situation to escalate.

663
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,440
It's already generous of me not to get back at you.

664
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,770
You want me to thank you?

665
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,440
You should know very well

666
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,500
that cooperating with me is your only option right now.

667
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,010
I don't understand what you mean.

668
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:05,370
Right now, you're like a ticking time bomb.

669
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,000
One wrong move, and you could harm your family.

670
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,540
Your brother is very capable,

671
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,430
but there's a big gap between fields of expertise.

672
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,790
If the Japanese want to act behind his back

673
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,870
and target your grandma,

674
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:14,800
it would be easy.

675
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:17,260
You've seen clearly what just happened.

676
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,510
Even someone like Bai Qingkui

677
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,740
could achieve this with ease,

678
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,340
let alone

679
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,720
those trained Japanese agents.

680
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,310
Young man,

681
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,090
I'm trying to help you.

682
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,680
Once I find the cipher key

683
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,130
and decode the intelligence,

684
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,000
should I really hand it over to the NBIS?

685
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,640
No,

686
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,350
you're not handing it over to the NBIS.

687
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,480
You're giving it to Chinese soldiers.

688
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:39,470
Every soldier on the battlefield

689
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,200
fighting against the Japanese

690
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:44,110
needs accurate and effective intelligence.

691
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,070
However,

692
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,950
the codebook must not be handed over

693
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:49,430
until Kunwu is found.

694
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,180
Deal.

695
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,140
Since I want to join the NBIS,

696
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:56,820
I must prove my loyalty.

697
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,930
Since the mole is so eager to get the codebook,

698
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,690
I'll give him what he wants and

699
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,990
let them see my loyalty.

700
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,580
I haven't misjudged you.

701
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,840
You're a smart person.

702
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:26,340
Just say it.

703
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:27,739
About what just happened...

704
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:29,030
Bai Qingkui's kidnapping of the Old Madam of the Yun family

705
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,110
was related to me.

706
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,610
Why?

707
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,989
If you're an agent,

708
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,380
don't ask me why.

709
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,400
You told me before

710
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,630
that our ultimate belief

711
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,520
is to let all the elderly and children

712
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,070
live freely and safely

713
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,440
on their own land.

714
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,030
Aren't these actions of yours

715
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,429
tarnishing that belief?

716
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:56,330
Harming the elderly and children

717
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,710
is the most despicable thing in the world.

718
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,910
Well, do you know what sacrifice means?

719
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,620
When the country is in danger,

720
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,820
sometimes the result is more important than the process.

721
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,910
There are some things

722
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,750
I can never do.

723
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,090
So, you will never surpass Ling Han.

724
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,910
He was also involved in this matter?

725
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,980
The most crucial step was taken by him.

726
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,000
Wen Yeming?

727
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,430
What's going on with you lately?

728
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:41,960
Director Ling,

729
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:45,070
we may not be able to keep being friends anymore.

730
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,950
Did I do something wrong?

731
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,470
People with different paths cannot be friends.

732
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,430
I can never bring myself

733
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:52,690
to encourage others to kidnap an innocent elderly person.

734
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,880
This was to achieve the goal more quickly.

735
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,790
We are running out of time.

736
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:56,510
Moreover, that elderly person didn't...

737
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:59,170
I respect your reasons, but I don't accept them.

738
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,710
Everyone has a time of passion and purity.

739
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:07,790
But reality is too cruel.

740
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,070
One day, you will change too.

741
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:09,560
No.

742
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,950
I won't.

743
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,340
This is the difference between you and me.

744
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,400
There are some things I will never do.

745
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,470
You can leave now.

746
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,400
What about Shen?

747
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,560
What did you do to him?

748
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:46,950
He's about to become an agent

749
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,010
of the NBIS.

750
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,470
[Bureau of Investigation and Statistics]

751
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,050
Have a seat.

752
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:23,390
Everyone,

753
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,780
this operation is highly classified.

754
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,250
Apart from everyone present here,

755
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,880
I do not want anyone else to know

756
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,450
the details or steps of the operation.

757
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,220
Understood?

758
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,080
Understood.

759
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,740
Chief, I don't trust him.

760
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,600
I feel the same way.

761
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:39,240
Who can prove that you're not the mole?

762
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,600
Your identity has not been verified yet.

763
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,910
I don't want to take any unnecessary risks.

764
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:47,190
Your task in this operation

765
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,270
has already been completed.

766
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:49,450
As for the rest of the operation,

767
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:50,980
you don't need to take part.

768
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,540
Director Ling, actually, you only need to

769
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:56,510
cooperate with us in the later stages

770
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,030
to complete the small part you're responsible for.

771
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:58,800
There's no need for you

772
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,330
to be involved any further.

773
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:03,190
This is the NBIS,

774
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,380
not your home.

775
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,850
I can tell you

776
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,190
that everyone present here today

777
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,590
is someone I consider highly trustworthy.

778
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,710
You may have your own thoughts,

779
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,840
but in the face of this operation,

780
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,840
you must cooperate wholeheartedly

781
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,750
and prioritize the greater good. Understood?

782
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:19,480
Understood.

783
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,160
Yes.

784
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,690
Chief,

785
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:24,990
I have a request.

786
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,350
Go ahead.

787
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,070
Before the mole is found,

788
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:29,960
Myna's codebook

789
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,360
can only be handled by me,

790
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:32,950
including reports to Chongqing

791
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,350
and the Commander,

792
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,600
as well as the subsequent feedback and summaries.

793
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,560
You are saying that even the Chief cannot handle it,

794
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,170
right?

795
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:44,800
Yes.

796
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,030
Yun Hongshen,

797
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,910
you need to change this habit of working alone.

798
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,790
I don't know where you were trained before,

799
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,260
but now that you are a part of

800
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,270
the NBIS Hunan Station,

801
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,750
you must familiarize yourself with

802
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,210
the working procedures here as soon as possible.

803
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:01,160
You don't even trust the Chief.

804
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:03,230
So why did you join us?

805
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,470
Zhu.

806
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,170
I agree with Yun Hongshen's idea.

807
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,990
As long as we handle the beginning properly,

808
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,520
the rest will be no problem.

809
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,670
Can you guarantee that?

810
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,330
No problem.

811
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:16,250
Good.

812
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:19,540
It is 8:46 now.

813
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,900
The operation will officially begin in 14 minutes.

814
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,480
You will go to the telegraph room alone to send the telegram

815
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,750
and report the decoded intelligence

816
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,260
to Chongqing.

817
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:26,960
Yes.

818
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,970
[Proceed as planned]

819
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:54,800
Go and report to the Chief that something has happened.

820
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,290
Yes!

821
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,050
I'm sorry, Chief.

822
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:03,670
I failed in my duties.

823
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:06,190
I don't want to hear any more of these excuses.

824
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,570
Go and find this person.

825
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:08,430
Yes.

826
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:18,300
See?

827
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,780
This is how your brain works.

828
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,880
Such a small trick,

829
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,970
and you couldn't even see through it.

830
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:33,750
Don't you two feel you've failed in your duties?

831
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,550
One of you is nicknamed "Eagle Eye,"

832
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,590
and the other is nicknamed "Nightmare,"

833
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,550
yet you allowed such a dangerous person

834
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:41,210
to stay right under our noses!

835
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:45,270
Deputy Chief Zhu.

836
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:45,760
Yes.

837
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,790
After this is over,

838
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:50,310
I want you to personally screen

839
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:51,910
all the middle management and above.

840
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:52,400
Yes.

841
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:54,330
Director Ling,

842
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:58,790
this mole's life must end today.

843
00:42:59,080 --> 00:42:59,760
I promise.
