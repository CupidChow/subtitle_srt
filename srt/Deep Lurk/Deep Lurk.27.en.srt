[Deep Lurk]

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,740
[Episode 27]

3
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,470
Mr. Shi,

4
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,509
you misunderstood me.

5
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,430
I just want to defend Changsha; that's all.

6
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,910
Defend Changsha?

7
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,910
The Chairman has issued explicit orders:

8
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,210
abandon Changsha,

9
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:48,150
retreat to Hengyang,

10
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,110
preserve our strength

11
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,390
and prepare for a future counterattack!

12
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,550
But some people just insist on disobeying orders.

13
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,640
You should know

14
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,789
that a soldier's duty is to obey orders!

15
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,229
That Xue dared to openly defy orders.

16
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,430
Then he is being disloyal to discipline,

17
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,990
disloyal to the Party and the nation,

18
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,630
and disloyalty to the Chairman!

19
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,470
Think about it!

20
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,829
Alright, enough about that.

21
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:18,230
What about the Myna thing?

22
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,350
How's it going?

23
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,910
There's no breakthrough progress yet.

24
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,510
So there's no progress at all, is that right?

25
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,350
Chief Ke, let me tell you clearly,

26
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,390
the Director is very dissatisfied

27
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,070
with your recent performance.

28
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,490
Yun Hongshen is holding onto this codebook,

29
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,110
and you're just letting him!

30
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,500
You're a superior officer.

31
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,190
First Wen Yeming,

32
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,630
and now Yun Hongshen.

33
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,650
Look how arrogant you spoiled them,

34
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,840
making them lawless!

35
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,350
I'm doing this for the interests of the party and country.

36
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,980
I have no doubt about that.

37
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,230
But you need to know

38
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,660
that who's the greatest enemy of our party and country

39
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,630
besides the Japanese?

40
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,740
The Communists!

41
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,990
The person who called the newspaper was Mi Lan.

42
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,870
This result wasn't unexpected for Wen Yeming.

43
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,880
If Mi Lan was also involved in today's operation,

44
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,370
and even played a commanding role,

45
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,670
it at least proves one thing:

46
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,660
her position in the Japanese spy network in Changsha is not low.

47
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,910
She's likely on par with Zong Fang.

48
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,750
What's more frightening is

49
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,150
she was involved in the entire operation,

50
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,710
yet didn't expose herself,

51
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,660
and successfully escaped in the end.

52
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,550
This woman is more formidable than she imagined.

53
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,710
She must tell Yun Hongshen about this.

54
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,829
Hurry up.

55
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,270
This one, this one!

56
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,750
What are you playing? Let me do it instead.

57
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,430
I'll definitely win.

58
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,140
I told you to listen to me.

59
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,930
Do you even know how to play?

60
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,540
Leader Wen.

61
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,390
Where's Yun Hongshen?

62
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:53,750
I don't know.

63
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,520
He went out.

64
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,950
You have nothing else to do

65
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,810
besides playing cards here, huh?

66
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,870
If you're really that bored,

67
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,550
go to the shooting range and practice.

68
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,630
Or else,

69
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,480
go to the training room and practice for two hours!

70
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,220
Yes.

71
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,230
Why is she meddling in our team's business?

72
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,020
Let's continue.

73
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,010
Chief Ke,

74
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:22,190
this is related to the Director's entire plan.

75
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,390
Whether it's preventing the Communists from growing stronger,

76
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,950
implementing the Principal's policy of purging the party,

77
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,140
or Xue's defiance of the Principal's orders,

78
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,630
and the contest between Chen Lifu

79
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:35,460
from the CBIS and us,

80
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,990
all of this requires escorting Yun Hongshen back to Chongqing

81
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,080
to confirm his suspicion of being a Communist.

82
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,670
I will obey the order.

83
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,230
What about Yang Ziming?

84
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,960
This is the Director's

85
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,180
second task for you.

86
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,230
Secretly investigate Yang Ziming.

87
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,750
Two principles:

88
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,360
First,

89
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,750
don't alert him.

90
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,390
Second,

91
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,430
you must have solid evidence.

92
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,340
Yang Ziming has deep connections in high places.

93
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,510
Without solid evidence,

94
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,670
we can't handle him.

95
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:14,860
Understood.

96
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,550
Go.

97
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,190
Hurry up!

98
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,630
Get in.

99
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,510
What are you doing?

100
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,190
Let me out!

101
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,950
I'm not just a reporter!

102
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,270
I'm also a free person!

103
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,710
I have freedom of speech!

104
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,950
I have the right to report truthfully!

105
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,909
When I get out,

106
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,610
I will definitely write about my experience at the NBIS,

107
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,110
every single detail of it!

108
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,510
I won't compromise!

109
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:53,180
[Chief's Office]

110
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,909
Chief, you're finally back.

111
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,670
What's the matter?

112
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,310
Wei Xiaojun set up a hidden room

113
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,390
at his girlfriend's place.

114
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,040
One of my men went to search it

115
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,060
and found two suspicious photos inside.

116
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:05,950
Let's talk inside.

117
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,990
I'm aware of all your little tricks.

118
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,800
What did you do at the police station this morning?

119
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,850
To warn the tiger by beating the mountain.

120
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,630
What about the person who called Ling Han?

121
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,390
It was Mi Lan.

122
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,550
The call made to Ling Han's office yesterday morning

123
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,850
was from this phone booth.

124
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,750
And the clothes Yun Hongshen wore in the photo

125
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,790
are indeed the same ones he wore yesterday.

126
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,270
What's your point?

127
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,270
I think Yun Hongshen made the call

128
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,430
instead of Mi Lan.

129
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,560
His purpose

130
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,950
was to make us believe that Ling Han is the mole.

131
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,370
Where have you been?

132
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,950
Hello?

133
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,080
Come to my office.

134
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,790
Yes.

135
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,390
How is this possible?

136
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,350
How could he be a Communist?

137
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,950
Who reported him?

138
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,710
Ling Han, right?

139
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,760
It must be him.

140
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,380
Yun Hongshen is investigating him,

141
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,760
so he turned the tables.

142
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,290
Are you sure there's nothing wrong with him?

143
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,030
He's the one who called Ling Han's office.

144
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,800
Let me put it this way:

145
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,350
the Director has determined he's a Communist,

146
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,750
so he must be one.

147
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,350
Only by confirming his guilt

148
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,590
can we implicate Yang Ziming

149
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,080
and further suppress the CBIS.

150
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,130
This is simply thug logic!

151
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,360
At a time like this, and we're still fighting among ourselves?

152
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,200
Just to cater to the leader's ideas,

153
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,600
condemning someone without evidence.

154
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:01,710
Sir,

155
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,140
we live under the enemy's gun every day,

156
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,740
yet in the end, we don't even have

157
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,800
the right to defend ourselves.

158
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,380
With such a leader,

159
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,950
is loyalty still necessary?

160
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:10,870
Shut up!

161
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,190
Do you know what you're saying?

162
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,070
Have you forgotten everything

163
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,670
I taught you when you first started?

164
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,230
Answer me!

165
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,230
As soldiers of the party and the nation,

166
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,670
we have no right to question the leader's decisions.

167
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,520
The only thing we can do is obey,

168
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,630
and show absolute loyalty.

169
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:33,679
Good.

170
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,630
What I want now

171
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,620
is your absolute obedience and loyalty.

172
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,900
-Sir.
-It's an order!

173
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,830
To immediately find

174
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,309
the codebook in Yun Hongshen's hand.

175
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:44,630
Also,

176
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,960
don't tip him off.

177
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,910
If you see him,

178
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,270
show no mercy.

179
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,670
From now on,

180
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,350
he is an enemy of our party and nation.

181
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,830
You know what to do when facing an enemy,

182
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,070
don't you?

183
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,940
Have your feelings for him

184
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,140
grown so deep already?

185
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,610
Answer me.

186
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,310
Rest assured,

187
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,830
I know what I should do.

188
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,670
Leader Wen,

189
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,540
here's what you asked for.

190
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,070
Thank you.

191
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,720
You're welcome.

192
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,310
To solve the predicament facing Yun Hongshen,

193
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,070
there's only one way forward.

194
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,310
That is to prove Ling Han is the real mole.

195
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,710
Because the words of a Japanese spy

196
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,370
obviously can't be trusted.

197
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,390
Wen Yeming isn't sure she could find Ling Han's

198
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,780
weakness in such a short time.

199
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,830
But she has no other choice.

200
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,390
The time left for her and Yun Hongshen

201
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,550
is running out.

202
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,310
The photos were indeed taken by Wei Xiaojun.

203
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,480
I've long suspected Yun Hongshen,

204
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,510
so I had Wei Xiaojun secretly keep an eye on him.

205
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,510
Chief,

206
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,070
these two photos,

207
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,510
along with the dispatch list in Mister's hand,

208
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,510
can clear my name, right?

209
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,630
You made the call to report Yun Hongshen, didn't you?

210
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,100
Yes.

211
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,570
I have the right to advise the Director directly.

212
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,310
To confirm his Communist suspicions,

213
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,550
you need evidence.

214
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,270
Chief,

215
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,070
if I'm not mistaken,

216
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,230
Yun Hongshen should have already fled by now.

217
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,110
What do you mean?

218
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,350
Hello?

219
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,430
Second Young Master, this is Jingyu.

220
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,170
What's wrong? Did something happen at home?

221
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,350
No.

222
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,340
Did you order a pair of cufflinks

223
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,930
when you were in Shanghai?

224
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,320
Yes, I did.

225
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,690
Are they delivered?

226
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,670
Yes,

227
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,630
they've just arrived.

228
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,120
I've put them in your room,

229
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,070
in the left drawer of your desk.

230
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:56,830
Alright,

231
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:57,690
I know.

232
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:02,900
This call

233
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,590
was from the maid called Jingyu

234
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,390
at the Yun's Residence.

235
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,910
Even if Yun Hongshen really ordered a pair of cufflinks,

236
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,030
there's no need to specifically call and notify him.

237
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,860
Unless these cufflinks are very important,

238
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,740
or this call had to be made.

239
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,670
In any case,

240
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,980
it must be one of these two reasons.

241
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,480
I believe you also noticed

242
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,830
that when Jingyu made the call,

243
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,630
her speech and demeanor were very calm.

244
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,870
There are two possibilities:

245
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,710
First,

246
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,740
she made this call on her own.

247
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,400
Second,

248
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,210
someone she trusts deeply asked her to make the call.

249
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,310
I believe it's the second possibility.

250
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,110
She learned through a reliable source

251
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,110
about Mr. Shi's purpose for coming to Changsha.

252
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,350
That's why she made this call.

253
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,240
Moreover, after Yun Hongshen received this call,

254
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,710
he immediately left the station.

255
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,230
This indirectly proves

256
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,750
all of my previous deductions.

257
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,230
What does that prove?

258
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,750
In our line of work,

259
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,750
who doesn't have

260
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,550
some special way of communicating with their family?

261
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,040
Yes,

262
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:49,990
if this kind of special communication way

263
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,390
happens during normal times,

264
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,950
you have time to hesitate.

265
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,070
But right now,

266
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,110
you must make a decision immediately.

267
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,310
Because every minute you hesitate,

268
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,470
the possibility of Yun Hongshen escaping

269
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,550
increases significantly.

270
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,470
Wait a moment.

271
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,230
You just used the word "immediately".

272
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,270
I don't need you to tell me

273
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,630
what I should or shouldn't do.

274
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,800
I think Mr. Shi thinks so too.

275
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,670
Zhu,

276
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,210
arrest Yun Hongshen immediately.

277
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:31,850
However,

278
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,270
don't make too much of a scene.

279
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,430
He's suspected of being a Communist.

280
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,870
Yes, yes.

281
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,420
Young man,

282
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,910
let me remind you,

283
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,750
sometimes when you do things,

284
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,210
you need to leave yourself a way out,

285
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,630
in case the result is too bad.

286
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,310
Thank you for the reminder, Chief.

287
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,370
I'm very clear about what I'm doing.

288
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,790
Get out.

289
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,870
I've been here all afternoon.

290
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,470
No one came looking for me.

291
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:30,870
Young Master,

292
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,070
why are you out here?

293
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,240
Was that Uncle Yang?

294
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,630
No,

295
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,080
it was one of my old customers

296
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,010
who came to settle the bill.

297
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:38,830
Hei,

298
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,190
you should know

299
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,510
I grew up on Uncle Yang's watch.

300
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,780
Even if he disguised himself,

301
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,070
I would still recognize him.

302
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,750
Has something happened at home?

303
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,270
No,

304
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,870
he just came to check on things.

305
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,350
Uncle Yang came and left without seeing me.

306
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,750
Something must have happened at home!

307
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,510
Hei,

308
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,990
you can't hide this from me.

309
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:07,670
Dao!

310
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,950
Dao!

311
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,790
Young Master.

312
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,510
Let's go home!

313
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,330
We're staying here just fine.

314
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:12,930
What's wrong?

315
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,980
Shen might be in trouble.

316
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,430
Hongshen hasn't left.

317
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,510
He must have gone to capture Ling Han.

318
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,470
Then I'll go find him now.

319
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,350
It's too late.

320
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,870
You won't be able to find him either.

321
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,310
And the NBIS has surely taken action.

322
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,270
We can't go against them.

323
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,310
Comrade Yang, please enlighten me.

324
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,860
What we need to do now

325
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,430
is to muddy the waters.

326
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,710
Only in this way

327
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,390
can Hongshen possibly escape unscathed.

328
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,510
If you act under the current circumstances,

329
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,200
you will certainly be exposed.

330
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:57,790
Let me do it.

331
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,110
If someone must be sacrificed

332
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,510
to protect everyone else,

333
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,030
then that person must be me.

334
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:04,670
No.

335
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,100
You and Yun Hongshen are more valuable alive than I am.

336
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,030
You won't satisfy their appetite.

337
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,580
Dai Li has secretly sent a special envoy here.

338
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,670
They want to escalate the situation.

339
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,640
If I'm not handed over,

340
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,100
they won't let it go.

341
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,230
Moreover,

342
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,110
with me drawing their fire and diverting their attention,

343
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,630
it will be easier for us to do things.

344
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,670
Comrade Wu,

345
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:30,950
from today on,

346
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,280
you will take over my position

347
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,870
to lead and assist

348
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,270
Hongshen's work.

349
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:36,910
Uncover Kunwu,

350
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,030
and obtain intelligence.

351
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:38,810
But...

352
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,010
There's no time for "buts".

353
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,510
You must firmly believe

354
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,990
that for our ultimate victory,

355
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,430
every drop of blood we shed now

356
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,070
will not be in vain.

357
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,790
Let's go to Zhiya House now

358
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,750
to arrange the upcoming work.

359
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:00,860
Yes.

360
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:11,720
[Zhiya House]

361
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,870
The one who betrayed us

362
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,320
should be

363
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,430
the liaison officer sent by Zhang Xiancheng

364
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,470
to meet the comrade from Northern Jiangsu.

365
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,430
Luckily,

366
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,590
he doesn't know much.

367
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,540
Even if the Japanese control him,

368
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,150
they won't be able to find that batch of gold.

369
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,870
But once this matter comes to light,

370
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,910
Shanghai will certainly be on high alert.

371
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,470
If we want to send someone there again,

372
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,430
it will be difficult.

373
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,230
This is exactly what I'm worried about.

374
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:44,990
Currently, the Kuomintang

375
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,030
has basically imposed a complete blockade on us.

376
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,190
The Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army

377
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,950
are still persisting in the resistance behind enemy lines.

378
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,830
Many wounded soldiers

379
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,590
have died due to lack of medical care and medicine.

380
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,430
I've heard

381
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,590
that they don't even have anesthetics for surgeries.

382
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,230
Many soldiers died from the excruciating pain.

383
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,150
Therefore,

384
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,230
Muzhi and I tried our best

385
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,630
to transfer the gold reserves,

386
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,750
intending to use it

387
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,349
to purchase Western medicine and medical equipment.

388
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,310
With it,

389
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,589
we could save so many of our comrades.

390
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:16,990
So, Du,

391
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,829
we must transfer this batch of gold

392
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,430
before anyone realizes

393
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,430
what's happening.

394
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,030
We?

395
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,710
Right.

396
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,030
You need to leave immediately

397
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:26,950
and go to Shanghai

398
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:29,850
to complete Zhang Xiancheng's unfinished mission.

399
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:30,980
Yes.

400
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,280
Is there a specific action plan?

401
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,150
After you arrive in Shanghai,

402
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,770
first make contact with someone

403
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,470
called Liu Maohua.

404
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,440
His public identity

405
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:43,150
is the deputy general manager of HSBC Trading Company.

406
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,240
He will help you settle in Shanghai.

407
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,300
Your contact code is...

408
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,070
I got it.

409
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,670
After you've settled in,

410
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,110
go to the French Concession immediately.

411
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,030
There's a Honglong Auto Shop

412
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,870
opposite the Guotai Cinema.

413
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,550
First, find the owner's wife of Honglong Auto Shop,

414
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,400
Li Huifen.

415
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,550
Ms. Li Huifen

416
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,390
is a loyal friend of our party.

417
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,290
She once helped relocate Comrade Wu Hao.

418
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,950
After you find her,

419
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:15,990
just tell her,

420
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,710
"Is the little brother feeling better?

421
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,400
Fifth Uncle from home sent me to check on him."

422
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,590
She'll understand then.

423
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,510
This code

424
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,470
is known to only a few people in the party.

425
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,110
Unless absolutely necessary,

426
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,190
we won't use this connection.

427
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,060
But the situation in Shanghai is so tense now.

428
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,590
Does this Ms. Li

429
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:36,990
really have the ability

430
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,870
to help us transport the gold out?

431
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,790
After Shanghai fell,

432
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,110
many officials and nobles went to Hong Kong.

433
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,790
The cars they bought in Hong Kong

434
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,030
are imported to Shanghai from Europe and America

435
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,830
through Honglong Auto Shop,

436
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,340
and then transported by British cargo ships

437
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,030
to Honglong's branch in Hong Kong.

438
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,950
This transportation line is no longer a secret.

439
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,070
The Japanese,

440
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,790
various embassies,

441
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,630
including the national government,

442
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,070
all have a tacit understanding

443
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,150
not to investigate it.

444
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,830
So it's very safe.

445
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:08,910
I understand.

446
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,830
You want to hide the gold in the cars

447
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,250
and transport it to Hong Kong through that shipping line.

448
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,090
Yes.

449
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,780
The enemy has now tightly sealed off

450
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,270
the transportation routes to Northern Jiangsu.

451
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,310
So,

452
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,670
we might as well transport the gold to Hong Kong

453
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:25,510
and hand it over to the Eighth Route Army's office there.

454
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,670
That's a good plan.

455
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,270
I'll pack up

456
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,270
-and finish things.
-Don't bother.

457
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,030
I'll take care of the follow-up work.

458
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,900
I've already bought you a train ticket.

459
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,600
Wu will take you to the train station.

460
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:36,750
What about you?

461
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,720
Will you be in any danger?

462
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,430
Don't worry.

463
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,170
I'll evacuate safely.

464
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,090
It's getting late.

465
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,160
Set off now.

466
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,590
I promise to complete the task.

467
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:55,720
Take care.

468
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,010
Get in the car.

469
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,390
Du just told me

470
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,590
that before we came,

471
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,160
Hei called him,

472
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,570
saying Yun Hongqi has returned.

473
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,710
After you get Du safely on the train,

474
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,910
go find Yun Hongqi.

475
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:15,500
Okay.

476
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,110
Our people only found Yun Hongshen's car,

477
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,230
but not himself.

478
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,430
Chief,

479
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,350
has he already left Changsha?

480
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,350
No, he hasn't.

481
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,070
He's determined to see Ling Han dead.

482
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,370
He won't leave Changsha.

483
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,020
[Ling Han]

484
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,150
The Director has determined he's a Communist,

485
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,550
so he must be one.

486
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:14,550
From now on,

487
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,270
he is an enemy of our party and country.

488
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,480
Are you alright?

489
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,670
Have you been implicated?

490
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,390
I'm fine.

491
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,210
What about you?

492
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,910
What are your plans?

493
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,610
I can help you.

494
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,290
I'm already investigating Ling Han.

495
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,220
As long as we prove he's the problem,

496
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,000
his accusations against you

497
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,420
won't be credible.

498
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,310
But you're too hasty.

499
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,620
Even if you want to force Ling Han to show his hand,

500
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,900
you can't do it so clumsily.

501
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,160
It's too easy to be used against you.

502
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:26,760
Wait.

503
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:29,740
Clumsy?

504
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,380
What do you mean by "used against"?

505
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,380
You made that call to Ling Han's office, didn't you?

506
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,060
If it weren't for my trust in your judgment,

507
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,680
even I would suspect

508
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,610
that you deliberately framed Ling Han.

509
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,010
I didn't make that call.

510
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,110
Who told you I made the call?

511
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,070
They photographed

512
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,590
you at the payphone booth on Tonghua Road,

513
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,830
making the call.

514
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,880
The time, location,

515
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,550
and other details all match up.

516
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,830
Who took those photos?

517
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:00,680
Wei Xiaojun,

518
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,190
the janitor at our station.

519
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:03,950
He's also Ling Han's undercover agent.

520
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,600
He was ordered by Ling Han

521
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,920
to secretly follow you.

522
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:07,870
The film

523
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,640
was found in the darkroom

524
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,620
at Wei Xiaojun's girlfriend's house.

525
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,160
Wei Xiaojun followed me

526
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:22,280
and photographed me making the call.

527
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,000
What was she doing?

528
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,890
It seems that Mi Lan did that

529
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,830
to arouse my suspicion

530
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,480
and lure me into that payphone booth.

531
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:50,770
That way,

532
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,410
I'd have been photographed.

533
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,020
Mi Lan knew what I was up to.

534
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,380
After Cao Yuan made the warning call,

535
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,890
all their reactions

536
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:01,820
were to prove

537
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,240
I framed Ling Han.

538
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,470
I thought I was setting up a plan,

539
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,230
but I had already fallen into their trap.

540
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,810
In the end, Ling Han was one step ahead.

541
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,800
So Ling Han's exposure

542
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,410
was actually

543
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,610
a grand play and a trap made for you.

544
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,320
He used himself as a bait to get you involved.

545
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,990
When you've played all your cards and reached a stalemate,

546
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,530
he turned the tables with those two secretly taken photos.

547
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,920
It's truly clever, one step linked to the next.

548
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:47,970
Yeming,

549
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,910
can you draw the composition of those

550
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:50,800
two photos for me?

551
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,120
Especially the spatial relationships.

552
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,060
The more accurate, the better.

553
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,700
These two photos are crucial.

554
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,150
You've really helped me a lot this time.

555
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,050
I'll take care of the rest.

556
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,660
Don't get involved anymore.

557
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,450
I really have to go now.

558
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,090
Take care of yourself.

559
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,830
Be careful.

560
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,970
You better come back alive, you hear me?

561
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,600
I don't want to be left behind again.

562
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,360
Don't worry,

563
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,270
I promise.

564
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,190
Also,

565
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,320
Yun Hongshen went to the evidence room this afternoon

566
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,000
and took Zhang Xiancheng's suitcase.

567
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,860
Why did he take Zhang Xiancheng's belongings?

568
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,720
Who exactly is this Zhang Xiancheng?

569
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,050
Do you think there's an issue with his identity?

570
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,680
Could he also be a Communist?

571
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,390
That's highly possible.

572
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:29,370
He risked his life to take a bullet for Yun Hongshen,

573
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,640
which spoke volumes.

574
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,440
But Chief,

575
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,710
if it's true,

576
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,470
our station will become a laughingstock.

577
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,050
The head of the Supervision Division is suspected of being a Japanese spy,

578
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,300
and the promising leader of the operation team

579
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,430
is now suspected of being a Communist.

580
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,940
Who can be trusted and who can't?

581
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,120
Only God knows.

582
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:52,490
I agree with the Deputy Chief's opinion.

583
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,130
There's a detail

584
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,310
that can prove his deduction is correct.

585
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,910
Before Yun Hongshen left the station today,

586
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,950
he received a call from his

587
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,180
household maid, Jingyu.

588
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,910
I believe before Ling Han left today,

589
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,710
he must have reported this to you, Chief.

590
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,710
Here's the call record. Please take a look.

591
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:11,520
You see,

592
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,480
trivial matters like receiving cufflinks

593
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,580
wouldn't need a call to Yun Hongshen.

594
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,830
It must be that the young maid Jingyu knew

595
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,490
Yun Hongshen's identity as a Communist had been exposed,

596
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,220
so she called to warn him.

597
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,220
Yun Hongshen.

598
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,710
Chief,

599
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:33,100
how did she know Yun Hongshen was exposed?

600
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,070
Bring this Jingyu and the cufflinks

601
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,210
back to me.

602
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:38,890
Remember, I want her alive.

603
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:39,580
Yes, sir.

604
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,710
Should we search the Yun's Residence?

605
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,430
Are you an idiot?

606
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,860
Do you have to make such a big fuss?

607
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,590
Are you afraid others won't know about it?

608
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,360
Understood.

609
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,540
You all go ahead.

610
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,310
I'm going to the restroom.

611
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,040
Hurry up.

612
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:18,690
Madam,

613
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:19,450
it's me.

614
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,580
What happened?

615
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,250
There's something wrong with the young maid at Leader Yun's house.

616
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,570
The Chief wants us to go and bring her in now.

617
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,280
If we catch her alive,

618
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:27,980
then Leader Yun...

619
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,170
Mind your own business.

620
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:30,950
Just do your job.

621
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,210
Don't get yourself into trouble.

622
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:05,880
Yun Hongshen doesn't believe the photographer was Wei Xiaojun.

623
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,760
Given that Mi Lan's contact is Kunwu,

624
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,710
then

625
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:12,010
the secrecy level regarding her true identity

626
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,920
must be very high.

627
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,000
Ling Han and Mi Lan

628
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,500
wouldn't allow a peripheral figure like Wei Xiaojun

629
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,400
to be involved in that day's operation.

630
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:23,470
The photographer was very likely to be Mi Lan herself.

631
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,820
So this is where you've been hiding.

632
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:50,520
Mi Lan is the most crucial part

633
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,880
of Yun Hongshen's next plan.

634
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:54,870
But she disappeared after making that call.

635
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:56,530
Clearly,

636
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:59,000
Mi Lan has a secret safe house.

637
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,330
Where this safe house is located

638
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,450
was once a puzzle for Yun Hongshen.

639
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,820
Although he had long confirmed that Mi Lan and Kunwu

640
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,160
had always been in contact through this payphone,

641
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,080
he didn't realize at the time

642
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,280
that Mi Lan's safe house

643
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,380
was near this payphone booth.

644
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,550
The residents in this area are diverse

645
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,950
with high population mobility.

646
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,310
It's indeed an excellent hiding spot.

647
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:22,870
Moreover, it's located

648
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,480
right across from that payphone booth,

649
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,980
allowing constant monitoring of

650
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,950
the situation around the phone booth.

651
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,860
Those two photos provided by Ling Han

652
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,860
may have framed Yun Hongshen for slander,

653
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,060
but at the same time,

654
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,840
they also helped him

655
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:39,620
pinpoint the location of Mi Lan's safe house.

656
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,660
[Onitetsu]

657
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,920
Yun Hongshen's absolutely certain about one thing:

658
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,020
Mi Lan wouldn't be able to reach Ling Han

659
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,520
by phone at this time.

660
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,790
Because he must be busy confirming

661
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,570
Yun Hongshen's Communist charges.

662
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,450
After Mi Lan saw that painting,

663
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:08,510
she must have guessed

664
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,910
that Yun Hongshen have obtained more solid evidence.

665
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,190
Therefore,

666
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,620
she'd undoubtedly do everything she can

667
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,960
to contact Ling Han.

668
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:43,650
Something's gone wrong.

669
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,500
Everyone, gather at point A.

670
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,280
Now.

671
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,200
This is Yun Hongshen's intention.

672
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:01,350
He wants to gather Kunwu and Onitetsu

673
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,150
and catch them all.

674
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,350
Something's not right.

675
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,719
Why is the door open?

676
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,120
When the Young Master and Second Young Master are not home,

677
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:39,540
the study door is always closed.

678
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,240
Go.

679
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,110
Report, Chief,

680
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,030
she is already dead.

681
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,560
This young lady's death is not simple.

682
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,500
I need to report to the Chief immediately.

683
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,560
You all guard the scene here.

684
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,980
If there are any suspicious individuals,

685
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:13,870
arrest them on the spot.

686
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,290
Yes, sir.

687
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:15,880
You two,

688
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,610
take her away.

689
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,170
Yes, sir.

690
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,340
Why is it you two again?

691
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,840
What are you doing here?

692
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,110
Who let you in?

693
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,230
Our apologies, Young Master Yun.

694
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,800
We've come uninvited. Sorry for the intrusion.

695
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,660
There's been an incident at your residence.

696
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,940
We're here on official business.

697
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,950
Please understand.

698
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,290
You've all come uninvited.

699
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,540
It seems this is no small matter.

700
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,910
What happened at my house?

701
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,650
Jingyu has been murdered.

702
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,470
What did you say?

703
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:17,810
Jingyu has been murdered.

704
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,070
Nonsense!

705
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,110
Jingyu!

706
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:24,230
Jingyu!

707
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,230
Jingyu!

708
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,830
Jingyu!

709
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,780
You're talking rubbish!

710
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:31,250
You said she's been killed.

711
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:32,350
Then where's her body?

712
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:33,690
Where's her body?

713
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,670
Our people have already taken it away.

714
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,710
Who did it?

715
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,200
We're investigating.

716
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,000
Young Master Yun,

717
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:40,970
please rest assured.

718
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,990
We will find the killer as soon as possible

719
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,260
and bring justice for the deceased.

720
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,830
How will you find them?

721
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:50,790
How?

722
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,750
By staying at my house

723
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:56,490
and waiting for the killer to turn themselves in?

724
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,380
Do you think the murderer

725
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,790
would be as stupid as you?

726
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,780
Watch your mouth.

727
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,250
At a time like this,

728
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:04,510
you're still putting on airs as Young Master Yun.

729
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,450
You wanna get beaten up again?

730
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,460
That's enough.

731
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,760
Screw you!

732
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:15,440
Go ahead.

733
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,110
No need.

734
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,150
Tell me,

735
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,070
since when?

736
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:33,980
Since when

737
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:37,610
did I have to listen to others

738
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,280
in my own house?

739
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,960
We don't have such rules in the Yun family.

740
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,070
We're here under orders to protect the scene.

741
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,240
It's our duty.

742
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,180
I don't care what you want to do.

743
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,510
Now that you're in the Yun's Residence,

744
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,220
you can't boss us around.

745
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:56,820
Get out.

746
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,850
We're carrying out our duties!

747
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,680
Get out!

748
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,500
Do you want me to beat you up again?

749
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:02,980
You want to draw your gun?

750
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:05,820
Go ahead!

751
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,090
We can guard outside.

752
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:09,440
But Young Master Yun,

753
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,240
I must remind you

754
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,300
that an intact,

755
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:13,600
undisturbed crime scene

756
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,390
is crucial for us to uncover the truth

757
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,270
in the future.

758
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,090
If

759
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:19,730
you also want to find the killer quickly,

760
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,680
please don't touch anything in your house,

761
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,760
especially in the study.

762
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,070
Let's go.

763
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:32,980
Go, go, go!

764
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,200
Let's see who dares to come in again.

765
00:39:58,370 --> 00:39:59,410
When we arrived,

766
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:01,230
that young girl Jingyu had just died.

767
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,000
I guess our arrival must have

768
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,200
scared off the killer.

769
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:05,090
Could it be

770
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:06,610
that the person who made Jingyu

771
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,680
call Yun Hongshen did it?

772
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,570
He was afraid we'd find him out,

773
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,550
so he killed her.

774
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,220
That's highly possible.

775
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:19,490
Yes.

776
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,220
Hello?

777
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:29,010
Hello?

778
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,470
This is Yun Hongqi.

779
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:32,350
I need to speak to your Chief Ke.

780
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,680
Ah, Yun Hongqi.

781
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,870
You want to speak to the Chief?

782
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:40,930
The Chief is in a meeting.

783
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:42,750
You can tell me what it's about.

784
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,690
Then please stand next to Chief Ke,

785
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,280
so you won't have to repeat our conversation later.

786
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:50,480
What's the matter?

787
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,760
What exactly has Yun Hongshen done?

788
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:53,770
This is confidential.

789
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:54,480
I can't disclose it.

790
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,280
But rest assured,

791
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,450
the Chief won't wrongly accuse Yun Hongshen.

792
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:58,640
He won't wrongly accuse him,

793
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:00,070
so it must be someone else who's framing him.

794
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,020
Was it Ling Han?

795
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,070
That's not for you to ask.

796
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,920
What charges has he fabricated against Hongshen?

797
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,510
Yun Hongqi,

798
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:11,750
the only reason I'm listening to your nonsense now

799
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:12,840
is because of

800
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,670
my respect for Old Master Yun and your father.

801
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,880
Don't push your luck.

802
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,550
My father was killed by the Japanese.

803
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,590
We have a grudge against the Japanese.

804
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,270
Ling Han wouldn't be that stupid to

805
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:26,420
put the label of traitor on Hongsheng's head.

806
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:27,980
Then what could it be?

807
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:32,510
Is it the Communist?

808
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,890
I've said all I can say.

809
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,200
Mind your own business.

810
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:56,980
Dao.

811
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:57,890
Young Master.

812
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,790
Young Master.

813
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,760
Why are you doing this?

814
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,150
Now, the more people

815
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,670
who know about this, the greater the pressure on the NBIS,

816
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:13,500
and the better chance we'll have to turn the tables.

817
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,430
I understand.

818
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:17,710
I'll arrange it right away.
