but don't make too much noise.

5
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,470

it will be hard for the Director

Good.

The fact that you can think this way

22
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,020

30
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,880

Ling Han felt that this was an insult.

37
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:56,850
It's also a warning.

38
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,260
Yun Hongshen sensed that he was being followed,

39
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,300
but after taking a detour,

40
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,610
he deliberately parked his car in front of his house.

41
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,730
This was clearly telling Ling Han

42

that the battle between them was far from over.

that Yun Hongshen gave the codebook

treat the Japanese as his mortal enemies for life,

170

00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,830
tacitly chose to ignore it.

191
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,110
It was only because Yang Ziming's identity

192
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,080
involved the conflict within the higher-ups.

193
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,290
Internal conflicts take precedence over positions,

194
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,960
which makes Wen Yeming very disheartened.

195
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,860
In fact, deep down, Wen Yeming has already realized

196
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,730
that Yang Ziming and Zhang Xiancheng

197
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,940
were Communists.

198
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,170
Secretary Wu,

199
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,410
how are you?

200
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,170
Are you hurt badly?

201
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,500
I'm fine.

202
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,050
Hongshen,

203
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,010
Yang asked me to tell you

204
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,790
not to feel

205
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,390
the slightest bit of self-blame over this matter.

206
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,370
You were indeed that catalyst that caused it to escalate,

207
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:50,480
but

208
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,820
the real target of the NBIS and Dai Li

209
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,460
has never been you,

210
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,260
but Yang.

211
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,380
Besides,

212
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,410
this matter also involves

213
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,540
the gold reserves we worked so hard to transfer.

214
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,000
These gold reserves

215
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,850
are directly tied to the lives of countless soldiers on the front line.

216
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,620
So, Yang's sacrifice was inevitable.

217
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,130
No.

218
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,610
It's not like that.

219
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,210
You're good at analyzing.

220
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,500
Then analyze this:

221
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,980
If you had died,

222
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,290
would they have let Yang go?

223
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,650
Yang used to say,

224
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,060
"Every life has its unique value.

225
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,490
Unless it's absolutely necessary,

226
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,210
you must never give up on it easily."

227
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,590
Yang did give up his life,

228
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,560
but with his one life,

229
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,090
he saved the lives of many others.

230
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,360
So this giving up was worth it,

231
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,440
and this sacrifice was heroic.

232
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,180
Why did he do that?

233
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,380
It was all to complete the Party's mission.

234
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,910
The Party has more tasks

235
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,340
waiting for us to accomplish.

236
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,920
So, we must

237
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,550
protect our lives,

238
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,530
take Comrade Yang as an example,

239
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,840
and continue working for the Party.

240
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:57,550
Right?

241
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:58,810
I will.

242
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,540
Your application to join the Party

243
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,900
has been approved.

244
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:16,609
Congratulations,

245
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,760
Comrade Yun Hongshen.

246
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,660
Grandma,

247
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:55,450
from now on,

248
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,000
I will wholeheartedly support Shen

249
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,310
and let him do what he wants.

250
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,400
He's become so outstanding now.

251
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,320
In the future, he will definitely become

252
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,830
someone as excellent as Dad.

253
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,620
I volunteer to join the Communist Party of China.

254
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,540
I volunteer to join the Communist Party of China.

255
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,610
I swear,

256
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,140
I swear,

257
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,700
I will dedicate my life to fighting for the cause of communism.

258
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,770
I will dedicate my life to fighting for the cause of communism.

259
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,100
Yun Hongshen,

260
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,700
for the road ahead,

261
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,240
you'll have to walk it on your own.

262
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:01,300
I hope that you will always remember

263
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,450
the oath you made today under the Party flag.

264
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,070
The person taking the oath:

265
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,440
Yun Hongshen.

266
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:20,790
Congratulations,

267
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,490
Comrade Yun Hongshen.

268
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:24,870
Thank you.

269
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,500
There's one more thing I need to tell you.

270
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,500
The organization has found out about

271
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,890
Ling Han's background.

272
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,920
Grandma.

273
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,780
Madam.

274
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,660
Leader Yun.

275
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,360
Madam,

276
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,580
someone came to see you just now.

277
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,020
He claimed to be a family member of Mr. Tong from the nursing school

278
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,230
and asked me to give this to you.

279
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,250
Alright, you can go ahead with your work.

280
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,950
[Onitetsu, Zong Fang]

281
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,380
This woman,

282
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,380
code name Onitetsu,

283
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,130
is a core member of the Changsha Japanese spy network

284
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:33,830
and holds a very high rank.

285
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:34,820
You could even say

286
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,440
she's the second-in-command of the Changsha Japanese spy network.

287
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,420
On the day I returned to Changsha,

288
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,010
I ran into her at the train station,

289
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,560
and it was with her help

290
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,330
that I successfully avoided Bai Qingkui's men.

291
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:45,680
On the day Myna and Wen Yeming

292
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,370
were making the deal at Boya Tea House,

293
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,260
I encountered this Mi Lan again.

294
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,570
It was through her

295
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,050
that I managed to escape from both Wen Yeming

296
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,020
and the Japanese hunt.

297
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,770
What a coincidence.

298
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,140
Before he died, Li Miaohan's lover

299
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,830
himself admitted that

300
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,940
the person who killed Li Miaohan was Onitetsu.

301
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,700
Who is Onitetsu?

302
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,180
At first, I thought

303
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,580
Cao Yuan, the owner of Cao's Bun Shop, was Onitetsu.

304
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,700
It wasn't until my grandmother was killed

305
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,610
that I realized the real Onitetsu was someone else.

306
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:20,950
Chief.

307
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,860
This handkerchief was originally

308
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,330
meant to be given to Mi Lan by my grandmother.

309
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,740
Before she was killed,

310
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,300
she embroidered a cross on it.

311
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,860
She was trying to tell me

312
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,100
who her murderer was.

313
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,980
Then why didn't you

314
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,170
report this information immediately?

315
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,940
I wanted to use her

316
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,110
to lure out the people behind her.

317
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:50,980
So,

318
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,960
the last time Ling Han was caught red-handed

319
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,480
was planned by you?

320
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:55,610
Yes.

321
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,670
But I failed in the end.

322
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,760
Then how do you explain the photo of you making the phone call?

323
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,290
I followed Mi Lan all the way to the phone booth.

324
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,300
After she made her call,

325
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,340
she secretly made a gesture.

326
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,730
I was worried she might have used some trick.

327
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,620
So, after she left,

328
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,730
I went over to take a look.

329
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,510
I didn't expect

330
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,780
that her deceptive gesture

331
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,490
was meant to bait me.

332
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,180
So, Mi Lan

333
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,420
had long seen through all your plans.

334
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,050
She was playing you at your own game?

335
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:24,960
Yes.

336
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:26,820
This Mi Lan

337
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:27,730
is a fake.

338
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:29,880
A fake?

339
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,050
Are you sure?

340
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,040
I'm sure.

341
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,450
Mi Lan's classmates

342
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,810
and her former colleagues at Benevolence Hospital

343
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,410
either died in the fire

344
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,720
or left Changsha.

345
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,210
There's almost no one who can confirm her identity.

346
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:44,470
After much effort,

347
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,440
I found two survivors.

348
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,670
Unfortunately,

349
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,100
these two people

350
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,020
were so badly burned in the fire

351
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,960
that they are now blind

352
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,420
and unable to identify Mi Lan in the photo.

353
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:56,780
But this morning,

354
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,870
things took a turn.

355
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,300
After Mr. Tong from the nursing school went blind,

356
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,730
his son read books and newspapers to him every day.

357
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:05,820
This morning,

358
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,050
Mr. Tong's son found an old book

359
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:09,720
with a photo inside.

360
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,440
The photo

361
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,140
was taken in the classroom

362
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,670
with Mi Lan's class and Mr. Tong.

363
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,300
Because it was so long ago,

364
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,400
Mr. Tong forgot about it.

365
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,610
After finding the photo,

366
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,790
his son brought it to the station and handed it to me.

367
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,370
Chief, as you saw,

368
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,820
no one in the photo

369
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,390
is the Mi Lan we know now.

370
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,870
This fake Mi Lan has been undercover in the hospital for so long.

371
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,270
It seems the real Mi Lan was killed long ago.

372
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,410
The day Qu Wenzhi escaped,

373
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:40,920
it was no coincidence

374
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,620
that the ambulance from the Military Hospital

375
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,460
appeared at the intersection

376
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,730
where he made his escape.

377
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,340
But this fake Mi Lan never anticipated

378
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,780
that Myna

379
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,480
was actually the real Mi Lan's father.

380
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,280
What was the purpose of this fake Mi Lan

381
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,670
approaching you?

382
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,540
To use her beauty to keep you distracted

383
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,900
and get the codebook?

384
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,760
You'd have to ask her that.

385
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,580
Although we don't yet have enough evidence

386
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,280
to prove that the fake Mi Lan is Ling Han's operative,

387
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,240
the photo

388
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,860
of Yun Hongshen

389
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,300
calling Ling Han,

390
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,900
along with Ling Han's testimony afterward,

391
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,380
can indirectly support the theory

392
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,900
that the fake Mi Lan has ties to Ling Han.

393
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,620
Based on the investigation and deduction above,

394
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,670
I have reason to suspect

395
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,340
that Ling Han, the fake Mi Lan, and Zong Fang

396
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,560
all belong to the same organization.

397
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,060
They are Japanese spies undercover in Changsha.

398
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,930
Ling Han

399
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,040
is the real mole within the station.

400
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:33,480
That's right.

401
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:34,850
That female reporter,

402
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,380
the former fiancée of Director Ji,

403
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,850
and Jingyu

404
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,620
should all have been killed by Ling Han.

405
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,460
He killed the female reporter

406
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:44,380
because she had recognized

407
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,180
the fake Mi Lan's voice.

408
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,790
As for Director Ji's fiancée,

409
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,380
she was a traitor in his eyes,

410
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,100
and also a witness to his murder and cover-up.

411
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,090
He certainly wouldn't have let her live.

412
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,160
So, Chief,

413
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,530
I suggest we arrest Ling Han immediately

414
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,720
and start an investigation into him.

415
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,080
Young Master.

416
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,600
I got the guns.

417
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,260
I haven't used a gun in so long.

418
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,170
I don't know if I still have good aim.

419
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,090
No problem.

420
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,700
Your shooting skills have always been excellent.

421
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,290
It'll be no problem.

422
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,270
No problem.

423
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,190
Young Master,

424
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,000
you can't go on like this.

425
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,900
I... I really can't watch this anymore.

426
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,620
You have nightmares every night and can't sleep.

427
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,150
If this continues, your health will be ruined.

428
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,180
Those aren't nightmares.

429
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,830
They're reminders from the heavens

430
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,350
not to forget the deep grudge of my grandmother's death.

431
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,200
If you can't stop my brother,

432
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,840
then protect him.

433
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,310
Mi Lan is a trained killing machine.

434
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,270
My brother is no match for her.

435
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,140
Hello?

436
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:24,900
Yes.

437
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,140
Really?

438
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:27,910
Okay.

439
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,090
We'll be right there.

440
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,130
Young Master,

441
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,480
we found Mi Lan.

442
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:34,780
Phone!

443
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:35,610
Where is the phone?

444
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,000
Over there!

445
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,550
Hello?

446
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,460
Deputy Chief,

447
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,970
Ling Han wants to kill me.

448
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,740
When did this happen?

449
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,780
Just now.

450
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,780
He lured me to a very secluded place

451
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,740
and wanted to kill me.

452
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,660
I almost died in his hands.

453
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,190
Where's Ling Han?

454
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,180
He drove...

455
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,380
drove to the suburbs.

456
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:10,900
Chief,

457
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,780
Ling Han injured Xu Weihua

458
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,500
and drove to the suburbs.

459
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,190
Chief,

460
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,100
Zong Fang is hiding at a construction site in the suburbs.

461
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,180
Latest news,

462
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,610
Zong Fang is hiding at a construction site in the suburbs.

463
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,820
The suburbs?

464
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,650
That's close to Xinhe Pier.

465
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,340
They can't be trying to escape, can they?

466
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,690
Zhu, take Wen Yeming with you

467
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:36,860
and make sure to intercept them.

468
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,180
-Yes.
-Yes.

469
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:39,380
Chief,

470
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:39,980
I'll go along.

471
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,860
Wait.

472
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:48,930
From now on,

473
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,510
the entire station is on level one alert.

474
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,740
All departments must work together

475
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,980
to ensure Ling Han is captured.

476
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,620
Yes.

477
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,890
Ling Han is a dangerous individual.

478
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,300
He knows the details of each of your work

479
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,140
and is also aware of your weaknesses.

480
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,100
What's even more frightening

481
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:01,900
is that this operation

482
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,390
may be his carefully devised scheme.

483
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,930
During this operation,

484
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,800
you must not rely on luck,

485
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,560
because he is smarter than any of you.

486
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,450
Of course,

487
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,180
we will eventually win.

488
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,460
But no one knows

489
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,940
what the price will be.

490
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,320
Good luck, everyone.

491
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,360
Yes.

492
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,410
Are you implying...

493
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,540
that Ling Han should die in today's operation?

494
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,220
This is the Chief's instruction,

495
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,880
as well as the Director's.

496
00:28:58,850 --> 00:28:59,660
Young Master,

497
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,100
do you think

498
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,170
we should inform

499
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,880
the Second Young Master about Mi Lan?

500
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,530
No.

501
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,200
The NBIS is also looking for Mi Lan and Zong Fang.

502
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,300
They are more professional than us.

503
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,020
They probably already know

504
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,220
where these two are.

505
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,720
Shen just said

506
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,100
we can't kill Mi Lan for now,

507
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,950
but I must catch Mi Lan myself.

508
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,480
Your brother knows where Zong Fang is as well.

509
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,260
He's going there to kill Mi Lan

510
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,940
to avenge your grandmother.

511
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,100
As for the whereabouts of the cipher key,

512
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,130
he doesn't care at all.

513
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,340
Do you know what to do?

514
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,700
I do.

515
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,460
Don't worry.

516
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:49,900
As for Ling Han,

517
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,290
it depends on who is faster.

518
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,700
Kunwu.

519
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,720
I have to move faster than him.

520
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,500
Deputy Chief,

521
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:48,940
something's wrong with these people.

522
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,300
Zong Fang should be here to meet up with Ling Han.

523
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,310
Is Group B almost there?

524
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:56,870
They should be arriving soon.

525
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,130
IDs.

526
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,980
The road over there was blown up.

527
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,900
You'll need to take a detour.

528
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,170
-I need to pass through here for something urgent.
-Okay.

529
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,740
Excuse me.

530
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,330
May we borrow your bikes?

531
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:19,840
Okay.

532
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,910
We must intercept Zong Fang and Ling Han here.

533
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:33,800
Yes.

534
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:10,910
Young Master,

535
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,580
when do we make our move?

536
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,420
Wait until they've been at a standoff for a little longer.

537
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:15,980
Why?

538
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:16,940
By then,

539
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:18,560
they will be so enraged

540
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,370
that they'll either kill each other or be killed.

541
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,530
Their focus will be entirely on each other,

542
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,570
and they won't notice us.

543
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,050
Young Master,

544
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,300
you're getting more and more impressive.

545
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,400
It's like you're a general from the past,

546
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,890
leading the troops.

547
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:30,780
Sir,

548
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,220
something is wrong.

549
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,850
Why is it so quiet around here?

550
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,290
There's not a single person.

551
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,820
Do you think Deputy Chief and the others are in trouble?

552
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,460
There must be a temporary command center here.

553
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,900
Let's flank them from behind.

554
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,370
Let's go.

555
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:47,740
That's Shen.

556
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:48,670
Well...

557
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,010
Let's go over to him.

558
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:50,900
Why?

559
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,040
He's so clever.

560
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:54,250
He's heading that way.

561
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,930
There must be a big fish there.

562
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,750
Zong Fang and Mi Lan might be hiding there.

563
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:58,480
-Okay.
-Let's go.

564
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:00,990

565
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:42,300
Wait until they all come up,

566
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,130
then flank them from behind.

567

568
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,020
and wait for orders.

Where are they?

570
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:51,730
They ran away?

571
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,389
An empty city trap.

572
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,380
Hurry.

573
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:15,830
Alert.

574
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,220
Young Master,

575
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,550
it looks like there's a way out over here.

576
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,120
Let's go.

577
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:55,970
Mi Lan!

578
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,180
I won't let you go!

579
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:01,850
Get down!

580
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,070
Young Master!

581
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:22,620
Hongqi, get down!

582
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,410
Are you okay?

583
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:25,820
She ran away.

584
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,610
She ran away again.

585
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:28,800
Hongqi,

586
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,130
we're about to close the net.

587
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,310
Don't get involved here.

588
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,780
It could interfere with our work.

590
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,040
Young Master.

Hongqi.

592
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:43,780
Hongqi.

593
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:48,900
Be careful.

594
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,460
Sir.

595
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:50,730
Sir,

596
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:52,420
Let's go and help the Deputy Chief and the others.

597
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,100
No need.

598
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:53,860
Why?

599
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,670
Since they're using misdirection,

600
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:57,450
let's play them at their own game.

601
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:58,780
I'll give you an address,

602
00:36:58,810 --> 00:36:59,660
and you go there to provide support.

603
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:00,900
Hurry up!

604
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,370
Yes.

605
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:02,790
Let's go.

606
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:56,700
Deputy Chief,

607
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,230
don't you think something feels off?

608
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,310
I've sensed it too.

609
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,360
It seems like their goal is to delay us.

610
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:02,090
Yes.

611
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,350
This operation is just a smokescreen.

612
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,810
Their purpose must be something else.

613
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,380
We need to end this quickly.

614
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,650
We can't waste time with them.

616
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:19,410
Deputy Chief,

617
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,220
please go back first.

618
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,240
Leave this to us.

619
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,110
Can you handle it?

620
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,210
Don't worry.

621
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,340
You guys,

622
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,730
escort the Deputy Chief back.

623
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:26,100
Yes.

624
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,200
Be careful.

625
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:31,100
Why are there only a few of you?

626
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:31,780
Where are the others?

627
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,850
You'll know soon.

What cannot be seen with the naked eye

631
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,080
can only be seen with insight.

632
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:15,250
This insight

633
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:18,260
sees everything and yet sees nothing.

634
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,250

Chief,

638
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,570
we've checked everything.

639
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,110
There are no extra wires

640
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,770
or listening devices.

641
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,220
I've also checked the recorder.

642
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,650
I personally oversaw the task.

643

You can rest assured.

Chief,

645
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:35,780
Deputy Chief doesn't know your full plan yet.

646
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,150
Should we send someone to inform him?

647
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,060
No need.

648
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,380
If nothing goes wrong,

649
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,950

and the rest of the targets were eliminated.

653
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,640
Our side has one minor injury,

654
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:58,360
three serious injuries,

655
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,180
