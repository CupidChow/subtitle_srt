[Episode 15]

3
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,650
As soon as the news about Qu Wenzhi's defection

4
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,330
was published on the newspaper,

5
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,229
Rat recognized him immediately.

6
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,539
He had seen with his own eyes

7
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:47,740
that Qu Wenzhi had stayed the night at Li Miaohan's house.

8
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,550
That's right.

9
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,060
She really has no sense of self-respect.

10
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,090
You may know her face but not her mind.

11
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,310
That's why there are so many people

12
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,640
falling for Li Miaohan.

13
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,470
Go check on Huang for me.

14
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,400
He's been implicated because of me this time.

15
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,630
If the NBIS wasn't trying to pressure me,

16
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,560
they wouldn't have dug up his past.

17
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,600
Remind him as well.

18
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,230
Tell him to tone it down..

19
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,670
Some money

20
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,780
is not worth dying for.

21
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,430
Alright,

22
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,490
I'll go right away.

23
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,730
I'll take an apple.

24
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,620
In other words,

25
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,150
this truck, after delivering supplies to

26
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,590
the training base,

27
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,970
collided with Jin Guoqiang's car on its way back to the city.

28
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,870
Yes.

The time and details all match up.

31
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,560
The people who deliver supplies to the base

32
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,510
should be the same ones regularly, right?

33
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,030
This business was contracted to a

34
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,829
trading company called Shunde.

35
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,120
I heard this company has strong connections.

36
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,780
They've been doing business with the military.

37
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,670
Do you believe

38
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,020
that this fake car accident

39
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,550
must be related to this company?

This is quite interesting.

00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,450
In the past, our leader and Li Liang

43
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,980
couldn't stand each other.

44
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,070
Let alone discussing cases together,

45
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,950

46

Look,

this newly arrived leader Mr. Yun

48
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,810
is really charismatic.

please hand over the codebook in a moment.

00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,240
Deputy Chief,

92
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,180
I can't hand over the codebook.

93
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,860
Reason?

94
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,900
I forgot where I put it.

95
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,159
Didn't you memorize it all?

96
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:00,020
You can write it down from memory.

97
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,710
I went to sleep last night,

98
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,340
and when I woke up, I had forgotten everything.

99
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,730
What kind of attitude is that?

100
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:12,470
Zhu.

101
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,040
Wen Yeming, put him in solitary confinement.

102
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,670
Yes.

103
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,040
That's the situation in detail.

104
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,640
I'm planning to have someone investigate Shunde Company.

105
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,180
Sir.

106
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,390
Last night at the training base,

107
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,320
an unknown radio signal appeared.

108
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,890
Could it be from our own radio station

109
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,590
or some commercial station?

110
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,550
After the Shunde Company's truck delivered supplies,

111
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,500
it ran over and killed Jin Guoqiang.

112
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,180
The night Li Liang was killed,

113
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,030
an unknown radio signal appeared at the training base.

114
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,630
Although these two incidents seem unrelated,

115
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,040
they have a common point of intersection.

116
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,890
The training base?

117
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,030
That's right.

118
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,180
If my speculation is correct,

119
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,180
the training base is no longer safe.

120
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,430
The training base trains

121
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,630
elite talents.

122
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,350
If the enemy did infiltrate,

123
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,150
the consequences would be terrible.

124
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,860
Sir,

125
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,390
I suggest we screen all current personnel

126
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,310
at the base.

127
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,440
I'm assigning this task to you.

128
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,150
Yes, sir.

129
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,430
It seems the Japanese have

130
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,890
established a vast spy network in Changsha.

131
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,610
The assassin who appeared at Boya Tea House,

132
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:42,940
the person who killed Myna,

133
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,190
Li Liang,

134
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,930
and the unidentified radio waves from the base,

135
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,420
they seem unrelated,

136
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,890
but they should all be from the same spy network.

137
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,150
Moreover, they are currently very active.

138
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,060
Their target should be

139
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,120
the codebook in Yun Hongshen's hand.

140
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,570
You've detained Yun Hongshen

141
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,590
to protect the codebook?

142
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,110
I detained him

143
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,710
because of the task I just assigned you.

144
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:11,810
I understand.

145
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,590
You want to create a natural opportunity

146
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,990
for Yun Hongshen and me to infiltrate the base

147
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,120
and find the person hiding in the base.

148
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,390
That's right.

149
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,120
You should know

150
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,270
that among everyone at the station,

151
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,360
you're the only one I trust.

152
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,180
Even if you don't want to hand over the codebook,

153
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,070
you shouldn't publicly confront the Deputy Chief.

154
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,550
After all, he is our direct superior

155
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,510
and the Deputy Chief.

156
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,420
Why?

157
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,170
What else can I do?

158
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,270
I can't just tell the truth

159
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,870
in front of everyone.

160
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,390
I guess I was right.

161
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,530
The Chief doesn't believe either

162
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,790
that Li Liang is the only mole, right?

163
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,470
You publicly confronted the Deputy Chief,

164
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,230
showing no respect for your superior.

165
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,510
It's had a very bad influence.

166
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,790
The Chief wants you to go to the training base

167
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,290
to receive a short-term training

168
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,059
and learn how to respect your superiors

169
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,120
and follow orders.

170
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:39,250
Then may I ask, what is my real mission?

171
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,360
There are also Japanese spies hiding in the base.

172
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,240
Find him.

173
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:51,990
You

174
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,790
just take good care of yourself.

175
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,570
Don't worry about me.

176
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,350
Your brother

177
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,000
is here looking after me.

178
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,110
I won't keep you any longer.

179
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,010
Go on with your work.

180
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:02,630
Bye.

181
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:05,630
Hello?

182
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:08,680
Hung up.

183
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,760
He can't even tell us where

184
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,890
he's going to study

185
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,690
and how long he'll be gone.

186
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,720
What kind of job is this?

187
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,590
Grandma,

188
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,850
you don't need to worry about him.

189
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,590
He chose to go himself.

190
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,670
No one forced him.

191
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,700
No, Grandma.

192
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,300
What I actually meant was...

193
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,540
Shen has grown up now.

194
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,500
He knows what he's doing.

195
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,490
You don't need to worry about him.

196
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,440
Is this why you're mad at him?

197
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,510
Mad at him?

198
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,910
How would I dare to be mad at him?

199
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,870
He's so determined.

200
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,990
He told me his mind was made up.

201
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,270
I don't care about him.

202
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,470
No, Grandma.

203
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,510
Actually...

204
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,150
I don't have any issues with his job.

205
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:58,770
It's just the NBIS.

206
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,250
The NBIS's way of doing things

207
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,350
is really unspeakable.

208
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,450
What's the point of saying it now?

209
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,700
He's already joined.

210
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,350
Hongqi,

211
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,270
you're getting more and more responsible as an older brother.

212
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,190
Since your father passed away,

213
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,440
I know

214
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,910
you feel responsible

215
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,550
for everyone in the family.

216
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,810
Grandma.

217
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,670
I'm fine.

218
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,160
Your brother has grown up.

219
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,900
You should trust him.

220
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,730
He knows what he's doing.

221
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:54,990
[Japanese spy Li Fang]

222
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:16,470
Come in.

223
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,690
Chief Ji, are you busy?

224
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,470
No.

225
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,030
What's the matter?

226
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,490
Please take a look at this.

227
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:32,170
Is the blood on this from the driver, Qian Dahai?

228
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,020
It is indeed Qian Dahai's blood.

229
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,350
Director Ling has already asked me to examine it.

230
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,720
Judging from the depth of the wound and the degree of healing,

231
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,600
this should be a cut he received shortly before his death.

232
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,350
Cut shortly before death?

233
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,320
Alright.

234
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,520
Thank you.

235
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,990
Hello, Uncle Yang.

236
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:51,710
It's me,

237
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,470
Hongqi.

238
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:53,610
Yes.

239
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,390
I'm going out to take care of something later

240
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,870
and will be passing by your place.

241
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,990
Are you free for lunch?

242
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,650
I'd like to treat you to lunch.

243
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,710
Alright.

244
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,650
See you at noon.

245
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,490
It seems he

246
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,430
is coming to confront me.

247
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,920
Hongsheng joined the NBIS,

248
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,180
and he's extremely unhappy about it.

249
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,240
This Yun Hongqi

250
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,750
is quite the social butterfly.

251
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,850
He has friends from all walks of life,

252
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,030
petty thieves,

253
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,590
idlers,

254
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,110
even murderers and arsonists.

255
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,110
He can chat happily with all of them,

256
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,170
but he just hates the NBIS so much.

257
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,430
Hongqi makes friends

258
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,120
with his own principles.

259
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,510
He can accept that people make mistakes

260
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,580
or even have some bad habits,

261
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,340
but fundamentally,

262
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,570
the person can't be truly evil.

263
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,470
Some of the NBIS's methods

264
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,040
have crossed his moral line.

265
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,070
Oh, right,

266
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,760
tell Nighthawk

In this hard times,

270
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,100
we must not cause any trouble.

271
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,790
Otherwise, the Japanese will take advantage of it

272
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,170
and lead to serious problems.

273
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:04,780
Yes.

00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,070
I'll pay.

276
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,000
Don't bother today. It's my treat.

277
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,710
Alright, up to you.

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,100
Cheers.

282
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,630
You know,

283
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,670
I just sold some gossip about some officer's concubine

284
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,070
having an affair to reporters at most

285
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,510
to make a little money.

286
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,120
I mean,

287
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,640
how could I have the guts

288
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,790
to sell military secrets?

289
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,910
Now look what's happened.

291
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,470
and the police station has suspended me for self-reflection.

293
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,150
I'm not afraid of you laughing at me,

294
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,410
but if there's no money

295
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,210

I feel uneasy.

297

Such bad luck.

-Just take it.

any problems, just tell me.

Would our Young Master let you down?

What did I say?

00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,340

Why are you going?

324
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,630
Mid-level and above officers at the station

325
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,240
are required to regularly teach new trainees at the base.

326
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,500
It's my turn this time.

327
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,750
Well, I'd like to ask,

328
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,090
what are you going to teach?

329
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:09,610
Combat.

330
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,670

Let's go.

332
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:27,670
Uncle Yang,

333
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,830
I know there are some things I shouldn't ask about.

334
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,690
Since you know you shouldn't ask,

335
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,770
then don't.

336
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:35,750
Uncle Yang,

337
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,510
I see.

338
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,990
There's an organization behind you.

339
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,790
Your organization is better than the NBIS.

340
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,910
Otherwise, you and my father

341
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,510
couldn't have both joined this organization.

342
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,510
Uncle Yang,

343
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,110
please find a way

344
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,070
to get Shen to join your organization too.

345
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:51,670
Will you?

346
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,270
I want him to follow the right path.

347
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,760
He has joined the NBIS now.

348
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,230
How do you know

349
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,310
the organization behind us isn't the NBIS?

350
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,520
That's impossible.

351
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,070
How can you be sure

352
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,250
that Shen isn't on the right path?

353
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,260
Qi,

354
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,270
if you trust Hongshen,

355
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,210
don't ask about it anymore in the future.

356
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,540
You grew up by your grandma's side.

357
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,670
How come you haven't learned

358
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,810
any of her calmness and grace?

359
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,880
Grandma knows about it too?

360
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:28,870
Madam Yun

361
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,060
is a woman of great wisdom.

362
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,600
So...

363
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,320
So

364
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,080
I'm the only one who couldn't understand it.

365
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,320
Qi,

366
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,990
you're letting your emotions cloud your judgment.

367
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,830
You know?

368
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,110
Doing things

369
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,180
is sometimes like playing chess.

370
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,310
To fight our way out of

371
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,570
a perilous situation,

372
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,990
we have to detour,

373
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,290
to abandon things,

374
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,710
and disguise ourselves.

375
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,690
These are necessary sacrifices.

376
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:08,750
As long as we can win in the end,

377
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,579
these sacrifices are all worthwhile.

378
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,930
I understand, Uncle Yang.

00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,910
Can I make a sacrifice too?

380
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,650
Please don't try to dissuade me anymore.

for your help in the future,

you can assist him.

This spot is called the Rangu acupoint.

that it's not because of your lack of ability,

521

but because when you were carrying out the mission,

00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,460
you were just a bit short on luck.

He wanted to use the class to get rid of me.

First,

532
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,790
this man would temporarily block the news

533
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,450
and take advantage of the time

534
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,090
to find

Second,

537
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,780
the news hadn't been contained

538
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,790

00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:12,610
At this moment,

the real mole in the station

541
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:14,690

In any case,

543
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,370
his ultimate goal is to find the codebook.

544
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:20,230
Looks like these Japanese spies

545
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,290
are quite skilled.

546
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,240
But I will definitely root them out.

547
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,450
It's we,

548
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,390
we will definitely root them out.

549
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,320
Looks like your lesson was worth it.

550
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,550
I've said it before,

551
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,110
it's not that I don't trust you.

552
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,570
I just don't trust anyone.

553
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:43,200
We can't always let them teach us lessons.

554
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,130
We need to teach them a lesson too.

555
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,490
How about this?

556
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,000
You go back first

557
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:50,390
and report the latest situation here to the Chief.

558
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:52,850
I'll stay here and have a good time with them.

559
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:53,870
No way.

560
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,430
I'd rather die on the battlefield

561
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,590
than run away.

562
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,890
I'll send a message to the Chief later

563
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,920
and tell him I've got a target.

564
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,450
We can do it tomorrow night.

565
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,940

567
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:08,850
You're really tough.

568
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:11,120
You really made yourself a target?

569
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,840
I need to send a telegram to the Chief.

570
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,530
Alright.

571
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:06,140
[Target confirmed. We'll do it tomorrow night]

572
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,830
Why are you running away from me?

573
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,690
I won't eat you.

574
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:23,790
Oh, it's you.

575
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,380
I just lost something,

576
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,420
so I came to check.

577
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,190
As soon as I got here, I remembered

578
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,120
I didn't lose it.

579
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,920
Such a fool I am.

580
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,390
I thought you had done

581
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,360
something shady

582
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,170
and felt guilty when you saw me.

583
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,990
What shady things could I possibly do?

584
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:39,590
You

585
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,960
really are a born spy.

586
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,330
Everything that comes to you,

587
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:43,660
you have to think twice.

588
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,230
Can't help it.

590
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:46,810
I'll be going then.

591
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:47,810
See you tomorrow.

592
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,810
Li Liang isn't even on his list of suspects.

593
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,170
Yes.

594
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,540
Yun Hongshen actually suspected someone else.

595
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,760
It's just that Yun Hongqi came in at that moment,

596
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,070
so I didn't get to see

597
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,140
who Yun Hongshen's real suspect is.

598
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:08,930
Yes.

599
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,070
I'll use Li Miaohan as a lead

600
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,870
to make Yun Hongshen notice that person.

601
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:15,720
Yes.

602
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,140
Understood.

603
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,230
Alright.

604
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,910
The first time I saw you,

605
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,550
you were covered in blood

606
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,590
in the ruins of the classroom.

607
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,470
But when you took off your mask,

608
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,400
I saw the purest,

609
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,660

don't worry.

615
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:28,750

616
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,790

618

There's no rush.

619
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,270
Take your time.

620
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,900

621

625
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:42,210
I have something to tell you.

626
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,420
I need to help a friend with a favor,

627
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,990
and I must do this.

628
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,870
I swear on my parents' names.

629
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:50,520
I absolutely won't do anything bad this time.

630
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:53,570

00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,720
this friend has helped me a lot.

632
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,950
It's rare for him to ask.

633
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,750
If I don't handle this properly,

634
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,200
how can I face him in the future?

635

This friend of yours

636
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:07,750
is the Young Master of the Yun family, isn't it?

637
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,570

638

Hey, listen,

642
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:19,530

It's for the Old Madam of the Yun family.

As long as it's not out of line,

647
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:26,570
I'll have to help with it.

648
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,100
But let me be clear upfront.

649
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,670
You absolutely cannot do this alone.

If anything goes wrong,

651
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:35,310

00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:33,910
That's not acceptable.

733
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,210

00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,470
The weather is scorching.

756
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,860
Everyone, find a shady place

757
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,210
to get Instructor Teng settled.

758
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:17,950
As for the rest,

759
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:18,800
we'll discuss it later.

760
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,600
Dismissed.

761
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:24,740
Classroom 1.

762
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,560
Help out.

763
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:48,990
Instructor Zhang.

764
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,050
What are you doing?

765
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,360
Why are you in Teng Ping's room?

766
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:57,970
What good stuff did you put in there?

767
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,470
When I was in the business,

768
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,600
you couldn't even read.

769
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,510
What are you trying to prove?

770
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:12,670
Get out.

771
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,410
Don't interfere with my work.

772
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,820
Instructor Zhang,

773
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,400
you haven't answered my question.

774
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:26,630
Who do you think you are?

775
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,160
How dare you question me?

776
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,940
Considering Teng Ping helped you kill Jin Guoqiang,

777
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,790
you shouldn't treat him like this.

778
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,280
I need you to send reinforcements immediately.

779
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,480
Rest assured,

780
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,940
I will definitely hold on until the end.

781
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:03,830
What?

782
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:05,960
Want to kill me?

783
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:21,850
Teng Ping died at your hand for no reason.

784
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:23,860
I have to give him an explanation.

785
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,560
It's true that Teng Ping died at my hand.

786
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,080
However,

787
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:43,430
don't you want to know

788
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:45,940
who the real culprit behind Instructor Teng's death is?

789
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,780
If you do,

790
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:48,260
just cooperate.

791
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,550
The potassium cyanide on his dagger

792
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,210
was applied by you, wasn't it?

793
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,420
That's just your speculation.
