00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,820
[Episode 21]

3
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,380
How can a nurse

4
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,600
have such quick hands?

5
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:53,870
Old Madam,

6
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,800
by the time you finish embroidering this handkerchief,

7
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,590
Young Master and Miss Mi Lan

8
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:58,740
might already be engaged.

9
00:01:58,850 --> 00:01:59,979
Engaged?

10
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,910
Yes,

11
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,710
I heard from Dao that

12
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,560
Miss Mi Lan has already agreed.

13
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,670
Young Master is still mourning.

14
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,270
He can't get engaged

15
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:09,729
or married yet.

16
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,510
But Miss Mi Lan has already agreed.

17
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,290
So isn't it settled?

18
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,630
Mi Lan

19
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,130
makes me feel uneasy.

20
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,400
I can't just let Hongqi

21
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,110
marry her like this.

22
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,430
Jingyu,

23
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,950
give Mi Lan a call later

24
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,829
and tell her

25
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,630
to come over to our house.

26
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,950
I can finish embroidering this handkerchief today.

27
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,150
I want to give it to her.

28
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,150
Alright,

29
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,990
I'll call her right away.

30
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,470
Good.

31
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,660
Are Young Master and Second Young Master at home?

32
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:42,190
They both left early this morning.

33
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,220
Old Madam hasn't seen them yet today.

34
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,710
If Old Madam called me over alone,

35
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,280
things might be a bit easier to handle.

36
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,650
I can always find a way to dispel her doubts.

37
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,390
I'll play it by ear.

38
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,310
Old Madam,

39
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,500
Miss Mi Lan is here.

40
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,630
Hello, Granny.

41
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,030
Hello, Mi Lan.

42
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,550
Come on, have a seat.

43
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:09,990
I'll go back to work.

44
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,270
Granny,

45
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,630
you're looking at photos?

46
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,830
Yes,

47
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,640
when you get old,

48
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,960
you tend to reminisce,

49
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,430
take out photos and look at them from time to time,

50
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,920
recalling things from the past.

51
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,329
It's quite interesting.

52
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,930
Look at this one.

53
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,240
This is

54
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,900
the first graduating class of the Girls' School

55
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,120
in their graduation photo.

56
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,990
The graduates from this class

57
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,190
are the most successful.

58
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,400
Look at this one, and this one,

59
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,350
and the one standing next to me.

60
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,510
You must know

61
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,030
all these people now.

62
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,710
They're all famous figures in Changsha now.

63
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,470
Their articles are often published in newspapers.

64
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,350
And this one,

65
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,230
this pair of twin sisters.

66
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,510
Do they look alike?

67
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,410
Yes.

68
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,110
Their

69
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,290
interests and hobbies are almost exactly the same.

70
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,750
They even chose the same career path.

71
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,200
Both went into education.

72
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:07,990
Let me test you.

73
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,580
Guess who they are.

74
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,430
They're very famous.

75
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,330
The Ji sisters?

76
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,029
Correct.

77
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,829
The older sister

78
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,709
is now the Deputy Minister of Education,

79
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,890
and the younger one is the principal of Mingde Primary School.

80
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,780
Both Shen and Hongqi attended Mingde Primary School.

81
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,710
Which primary school did you attend back then?

82
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,840
So she's indeed suspicious of me.

83
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,510
Tea Garden Street Primary School.

84
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,830
Unfortunately, the Wenxi fire

85
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,170
burned the school to the ground.

86
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,190
I think I have a photo of your school.

87
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,700
Let me look for it.

88
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,610
Really?

89
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,210
Here it is.

90
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,390
Back then,

91
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,560
our Yun family donated many elementary schools.

92
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,190
This photo

93
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,830
was taken when Hongqi's grandfather

94
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:07,310
attended your school's opening ceremony.

95
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,740
I remember there was a well at your school.

96
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,750
Do you remember where it was?

97
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,510
The well?

98
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,040
Let's look at the photo.

99
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,110
It's interesting.

100
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,310
After the opening ceremony,

101
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,030
he asked me to take a photo of him by this wall.

102
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,790
The water from this well

103
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,060
was particularly sweet.

104
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,990
I remember now.

105
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:33,980
Yes,

106
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,750
that well at our school.

107
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,310
In the summer,

108
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,110
our teacher always liked to use that well

109
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,390
to cool watermelons for us to eat.

110
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,990
I was too small back then,

111
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,340
always losing out to other classmates.

112
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,320
You've grown to just the right height now.

113
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,330
[Yun Residence]

114
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,380
Look at me,

115
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,750
I've been going on about my old stories.

116
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,070
You probably don't want to hear these things.

117
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,570
I actually enjoy it.

118
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,310
Mi Lan,

119
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,970
your hospital isn't busy today?

120
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,760
The hospital isn't too busy.

121
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,909
I have a favor to ask you.

122
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,990
Please, go ahead.

123
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,409
Here's the thing,

124
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,930
the brother-in-law of our hospital's Head Nurse

125
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,110
has been arrested by the NBIS,

126
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,730
and he's fallen ill now,

127
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,770
quite seriously.

128
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,370
The Head Nurse's cousin wants to go and take care of him,

129
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,950
but the NBIS won't allow it.

130
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,650
Could you talk to Yun Hongshen to help

131
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,910
make an exception?

132
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,630
This is difficult for me.

133
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,290
The NBIS has its own discipline.

134
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,790
Besides,

135
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,500
I never interfere in Shen

136
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,550
and Hongqi's affairs.

137
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,550
But you don't need to worry too much.

138
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,790
I'll

139
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,750
ask him in private.

140
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,510
But I'm not sure it'll work.

141
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,330
That's great.

142
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,610
As long as you can ask, Granny,

143
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,270
I'm already very grateful.

144
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,000
Old Madam,

145
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,270
someone from Happy House is here.

146
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,600
Madam Yun,

147
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,870
I've come uninvited.

148
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:51,110
Please don't mind.

149
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,540
Please, have a seat.

150
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,540
Granny,

151
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,550
you have a guest.

152
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,830
I'll go back to work now.

153
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,909
I'll come visit you another day.

154
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,390
Alright.

155
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,510
Goodbye, Granny.

156
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:03,750
Come.

157
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,030
Old Madam,

158
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,920
this is a prized old

159
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,990
ginseng root from our Boss Bai.

160
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,830
It's excellent for replenishing energy and calming the spirit,

161
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,430
perfect for a long-lived person like you.

162
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,340
If you have something to say, just say it.

163
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,610
Boss Bai was impatient in life,

164
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,630
refusing to admit defeat,

165
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,860
and had offended the Young Master.

166
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:41,750
I'm here to apologize for him.

167
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,260
Everyone in Changsha knows

168
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,110
that the Old Madam has extraordinary grace.

169
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,590
Please be merciful

170
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,430
and don't hold it against us.

171
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,230
The way you put it,

172
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,790
if I don't show mercy,

173
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,050
then naturally I lack grace.

174
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,030
I didn't mean it.

175
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,150
It's better to resolve conflicts than to create enemies.

176
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,110
More friends mean more opportunities, right?

177
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,340
Our two families are not enemies.

178
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,480
We simply have different paths and cannot work together.

179
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,180
We can't be friends either.

180
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,780
Besides,

181
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,660
I never interfere

182
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,470
Hongqi's affairs.

183
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,430
If there's anything you want him to do,

184
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,310
you should go to him directly.

185
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,940
Young Master Yun is known for his filial piety.

186
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,550
No matter what it is,

187
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,430
as long as you can ask...

188
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,510
The question is,

189
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,900
why should I ask?

190
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,040
I know you have refined tastes

191
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,550
and look down on our line of work.

192
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,630
But times are tough these days;

193
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,590
we're just trying to make a living.

194
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,480
Human trafficking,

195
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,070
smuggling opium,

196
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,910
are these things

197
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,870
just for making a living?

198
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,520
Living in this world,

199
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,000
we're all just seeking wealth.

200
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,110
How the money is earned doesn't matter.

201
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,300
These are just minor details.

202
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,470
If you don't mind,

203
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,030
we could make money together.

204
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,070
You really have no shame, don't you?

205
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,590
Although Happy House has closed,

206
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,830
reopening isn't impossible

207
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,900
if we grease a few palms.

208
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,310
We have the people and the boats.

209
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,590
Your Yun family has the reputation and status.

210
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,310
If our two families join forces,

211
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,090
the wealth will surely pour in.

212
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,480
I

213
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,800
sincerely want to be friends with you.

214
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,350
If you agree,

215
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,730
I'll give you 30% of the profits.

216
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,120
At most, I can give up another 10%.

217
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,600
If I give up any more than that,

218
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,400
the business won't be viable anymore.

219
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,110
We Yuns are not money-hungry wretches.

220
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,360
We will not discuss this matter any further.

221
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,390
You may leave now.

222
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,750
-Well…
-From now on,

223
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,590
you need not come here again.

224
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,750
Jingyu,

225
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,510
see the guest out.

226
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,030
The Old Madam of the Yun family is no pushover.

227
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,190
Since she deliberately probed me,

228
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,160
she wouldn't have done it for no reason.

229
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,270
There must be a trap in her words.

230
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,550
What could it be?

231
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,710
All my answers were correct

232
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,610
and double-checked.

233
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,590
Which primary school did you attend back then?

234
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,150
Driver,

235
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,600
could you please take me to

236
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,070
the former Tea Garden Street Primary School?

237
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,490
Tea Garden Street Primary School burned down long ago.

238
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,670
Why do you want to go there?

239
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,910
I have a friend who used to attend that school.

240
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,390
She asked me to check

241
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,110
if the well in front is still there.

242
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,070
Miss,

243
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,590
your friend must be mistaken.

244
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,100
The school with a well in front is Mingde Primary School.

245
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,540
Forget about it.

246
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,270
Please take me back to where I got in earlier.

247
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,470
Alright.

248
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:24,750
Well...

249
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,350
-Why? Didn't work out?
-Hypocrite.

250
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:26,870
Let's go.

251
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,400
Old Madam.

252
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,230
Jingyu,

253
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,630
go find the Second Young Master quickly,

254
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,870
or ask his colleagues

255
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:41,930
to tell him to come back immediately.

256
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,090
Alright, I'll go right away.

257
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,500
Principal Wei,

258
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,030
is Hongqi there?

259
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,320
Could you please help me find him?

260
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,380
I have an emergency and need him to come home now.

261
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,230
Okay, thank you.

262
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,390
Madam,

263
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,110
the team protecting the Yun family

264
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:09,830
has sent a message,

265
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,080
saying Madam Yun wants us

266
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,110
to find Leader Yun as soon as possible.

267
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,950
He went out?

268
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,590
Yes,

269
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,670
he left early in the morning.

270
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,630
We don't know where he went.

271
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,150
Tell them to stand by.

272
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:17,830
I'll go look for him.

273
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,470
Yes.

274
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,630
Find him as soon as possible?

275
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,830
Did something happen to his family?

276
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,050
Where could he have gone?

277
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,270
Ling Han.

278
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,000
This is a place

279
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,670
Ling Han never allows others to set foot in.

280
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,990
Yun Hongshen believes

281
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,670
he will definitely find

282
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,270
something interesting here.

283
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,150
Not the cipher key,

284
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:02,190
not evidence of Ling Han framing Zhu He and Li Liang,

285
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,670
but rather, Ling Han's hidden

286
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,510
secrets that he doesn't want to reveal to others.

287
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,470
There's not a single photo in this house,

288
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,870
nor any photo albums.

289
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,310
It's as if in Ling Han's life,

290
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,410
there are no traces of anyone staying.

291
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,950
But as far as Yun Hongshen knows,

292
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,200
Ling Han has very deep feelings for his mother.

293
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,300
Then why doesn't he even keep a single photo

294
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,390
of his late mother with him?

295
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,740
Young Master Yun.

296
00:14:59,270 --> 00:14:59,660
Hi.

297
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,110
Hongqi, I was just looking for you.

298
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,290
Your mother just called.

299
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,430
She wants you to go back home immediately.

300
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,550
It seems quite urgent.

301
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:08,830
Alright.

302
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:09,870
I'll head back first.

303
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,110
If anything comes up at school,

304
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,030
please give me a call.

305
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:12,370
Okay.

306
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,440
Go back now.

307
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,980
Why isn't there even a single photo?

308
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,990
What exactly is he trying to hide?

309
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,310
Why are you here?

310
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,380
The team protecting your Grandma at your house

311
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,450
called back to the station,

312
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,390
saying your Grandma wants them to find you as soon as possible.

313
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,350
I guessed you might be investigating Ling Han privately,

314
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,840
so I came to try my luck.

315
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,660
Something urgent must have happened.

316
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,110
Otherwise, Grandma

317
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,380
wouldn't ask for help from people of the station.

318
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,830
You should go back now.

319
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:49,870
What about here?

320
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,120
I'll take care of the follow-up work.

321
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,010
Don't worry.

322
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,540
Your secret is safe with me.

323
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:54,640
Okay.

324
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,460
I'll be going then.

325
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,850
Miss Mi Lan,

326
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,430
why are you back?

327
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,790
You really scared me.

328
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,000
I was worried about the second madam of the Bai family.

329
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,160
They've already left.

330
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,590
Come on.

331
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,490
Have a seat.

332
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,750
Where's Jingyu?

333
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,670
Oh, her?

334
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,030
She's out running an errand for me.

335
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,300
Sit down.

336
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,670
You must be tired.

337
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,120
Let me make you a cup of tea.

338
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,080
Okay.

339
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,180
Thank you.

340
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:05,390
Have some tea.

341
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,540
Thank you, Mi Lan.

342
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:16,730
Have a seat.

343
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,400
[Photo taken of Mingde Primary School in the 10th year of the Republic of China]

344
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,190
You tricked me.

345
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,860
Who are you?

346
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,500
Hongqi. Hongqi.

347
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:02,930
No.

348
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,240
I have no chance to turn back.

349
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,020
No right to choose.

350
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,810
No freedom to decide between life and death.

351
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,630
I need you to do something for me.

352
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,760
Help! Help! Help!

353
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,330
Old Madam is dead!

354
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:14,790
Cong Hu.

355
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,850
Your sweetheart is looking for you,

356
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:17,940
saying she's sick

357
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,340
and wants you to go back.

358
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,360
I'm going back.

359
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:23,900
Okay.

360
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:06,590
Yang,

361
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:08,900
we're here.

362
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:23,350
Don't-

363
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:23,740
Get out of the way!

364
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,220
You-

365
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,110
This-

366
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,760
Young Master.

367
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,360
Grandma.

368
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,060
Grandma, please wake up.

369
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,670
Open your eyes and look at me.

370
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,890
I'm back, Grandma.

371
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,890
Grandma.

372
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,880
Grandma, please open your eyes and look at me.

373
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:17,060
Didn't you ask me to come home, Grandma?

374
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,750
Open your eyes and look at me.

375
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:36,630
Who did it?

376
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,130
-Who did it?
-Young Master.

377
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,960
Young Master.

378
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,510
Go find them.

379
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,870
Go find them!

380
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,620
Go find them!

381
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,390
Alright.

382
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,110
Go find them!

383
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,670
Go find them now!

384
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,270
Young Master.

385
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,110
How could this happen?

386
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,240
Grandma.

387
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,140
Please look at me again.

388
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:57,910
Captain Tang.

389
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,390
What happened?

390
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,610
The bodyguard at Gui's house was killed in a car accident.

391
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,840
What?

392
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,030
What's going on today?

393
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,150
Another one died?

394
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,190
Another one?

395
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:08,990
What?

396
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,490
Has someone else died somewhere else?

397
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,430
Madam Yun of the Yun family was poisoned and died.

398
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,180
What?

399
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,240
Yang.

400
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,110
Yang.

401
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:30,830
Wake up.

402
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:33,990
Something happened to the Yun family.

403
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,950
Madam Yun has been killed.

404
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,650
[Yun Residence]

405
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,270
On the same day that Yun Hongshen

406
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,280
proposed the strategic agent dispatch plan,

407
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,310
you went to the payphone booth on Hunan Road

408
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,890
and made a call to Shanghai.

409
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:28,980
I want to know

410
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,440
who answered that call.

411
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:31,440
Chief,

412
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,550
that's one of my informants in Shanghai.

413
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,740
You can check with our colleagues

414
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,560
at Shanghai Station.

415
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,280
Many days have passed since then.

416
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,460
You've had plenty of time and ability

417
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,820
to find a perfect witness.

418
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,000
I know what you're thinking,

419
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,910
but there's another possibility.

420
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,350
You watched me

421
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,220
so you could use me

422
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,960
to find out who's lurking around Okamura Yasuji.

423
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,000
I can't prove whether

424
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,260
my curiosity about this matter is reasonable or not,

425
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,830
but neither can you prove yourself,

426
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:58,510
can you?

427
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:03,780
Alright, alright.

428
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,750
We're all colleagues here.

429
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,260
There's no need for so many conspiracy theories.

430
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,830
I think both of you have been

431
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,210
too on edge lately.

432
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,730
I welcome you to make bold guesses.

433
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,870
But what I want is the most solid evidence

434
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:17,970
behind the speculation.

435
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:18,790
Understand?

436
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,350
Both of you, sit down.

437
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,270
Ling Han,

438
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,550
your most important task now

439
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,780
is to find the killer of Li Miaohan's lover.

440
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,470
Don't get too caught up

441
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:36,810
in these kinds of matters anymore.

442
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:37,870
Okay?

443
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:43,520
Yes, sir.

444
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:44,610
You may go.

445
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,900
[Bureau of Investigation and Statistics]

446
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,110
Director,

447
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,150
Madam Yun asked us to find Yun Hongshen earlier.

448
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,040
Leader Wen went alone

449
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,510
and managed to shake off our tail.

450
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,910
The team couldn't find Leader Wen,

451
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,870
so they came back.

452
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,070
Also,

453
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,910
Madam Yun is dead.

454
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,500
She died right after asking us to find Yun Hongshen.

455
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,110
Do you think it could be the Japanese

456
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,400
taking revenge on Yun Hongshen

457
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,070
by venting their anger on the old lady?

458
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,160
It may or may not be the Japanese,

459
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,710
but it's definitely not revenge.

460
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,740
Didn't you just say

461
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,310
that before Madam Yun was killed,

462
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:33,810
she asked our people to find Yun Hongshen?

463
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:36,220
She must have had some important information

464
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,590
that she urgently wanted to tell him.

465
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,750
Obviously,

466
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:40,510
it was a silencing.

467
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,860
But where was Yun Hongshen at that time?

468
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,120
This is the handkerchief Grandma wanted to give to Mi Lan.

469
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:37,330
My Grandma's embroidered orchid

470
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,690
looks just like a real one.

471
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:41,280
True to the saying, "Embroidered flowers exude fragrance,

472
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,920
and stitched figures brim with spirit."

473
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,750
My Grandma's craftsmanship

474
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:45,840
is truly exceptional.

475
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,600
Grandma,

476
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:50,060
who are you planning to give this to?

477
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,480
After I finish embroidering it,

478
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:55,150
I want to give it to Mi Lan.

479
00:29:59,170 --> 00:29:59,880
Since it's finished,

480
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,580
why is there an extra red cross?

481
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,190
Ten?

482
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,240
No,

483
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,630
this should be an unfinished "mi" character.

484
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,770
The commander said

485
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,710
only Mi Lan and Mrs. Jin came here today.

486
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,610
Mrs. Jin didn't dare to harm Grandma.

487
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,250
Could it be Mi Lan?

488
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:18,630
Shen,

489
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,430
what do you think of Mi Lan?

490
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,510
Mi Lan is the murderer.

491
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,910
Grandma must have discovered

492
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,350
something suspicious about Mi Lan.

493
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,000
But Mi Lan found out

494
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,950
and murdered Grandma.

495
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,270
Yun Hongshen fell into

496
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:42,290
deep remorse and self-blame.

497
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:45,270
He actually allowed such a dangerous person

498
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,430
to frequently appear around Grandma.

499
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,400
He got Grandma killed.

500
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:06,750
What?

501
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,870
Madam Yun has been killed?

502
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,370
How could this happen?

503
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,280
She was just a harmless old lady,

504
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,510
who had nothing to do with the outside world.

505
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,610
Who would want to kill her?

506
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,340
Just because she's Yun Hongshen's Grandma,

507
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,270
many people would want her dead.

508
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,630
It must be the Japanese who did it.

509
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,310
But why?

510
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,060
If they wanted the codebook,

511
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,940
they wouldn't have killed her.

512
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,750
Yun Hongshen will surely seek revenge.

513
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,470
No one knows

514
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,390
what he would do.

515
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,800
If they had a choice,

516
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,590
the Japanese wouldn't have gone this far.

517
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,310
Madam Yun must have found out some secret.

518
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,480
She's barely left the house recently.

519
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,030
What secret could she possibly know?

520
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:51,480
That doesn't mean others can't visit her.

521
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:52,830
Who would visit her?

522
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,050
What for?

523
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,510
What's wrong with you?

524
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:57,860
You're so flustered.

525
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,390
Is it because of Yun Hongshen?

526
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,190
Now is not the time to lose your composure.

527
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:06,930
If you really want to help him,

528
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,710
go find the killer.

529
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,270
I understand.

530
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:57,880
It's really her.

531
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,510
They've been here.

532
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,100
He must be very sad now.

533
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,360
Are you alright?

534
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:35,820
Get out of my way!

535
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,190
What are you going to do?

536
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,590
Kill her and avenge Grandma!

537
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,430
Do you know who the murderer is?

538
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,620
Tell me who she is.

539
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,010
I'll kill her for you.

540
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:55,770
You should stay here

541
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,780
and take a few more looks at your Grandma.

542
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,430
You'll

543
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,390
never see her again.

544
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,510
This is the last time

545
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,739
you'll ever feel the warmth on her.

546
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:12,940
From now on,

547
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,120
you can only remember

548
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,739
how warm her hands were,

549
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:21,270
and how it felt

550
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,159
when she hugged you.

551
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,320
Every look you take is one less you'll have.

552
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,100
Stay with her one last time.

553
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,480
I'll avenge

554
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,760
this for you.

555
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,210
This is my personal matter.

556
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,190
None of your business.

557
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,120
This is not just your personal matter.

558
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:57,890
The Chief said

559
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,530
your Grandma might have discovered

560
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,770
some important secret,

561
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:03,050
which is why she was killed.

562
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:05,990
If I find the killer,

563
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,310
I can uncover her secret

564
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:08,530
or the people behind it.

565
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,420
I bet

566
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:14,190
this must have something to do with the cipher key.

567
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,190
Maybe

568
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,350
it's also related to the real mole

569
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,820
in the station.

570
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,030
Right,

571
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,390
the cipher key.

572
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,660
Kunwu.

573
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,240
Mi Lan is likely my current

574
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:27,680
best lead to Kunwu.

575
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,790
She can't die yet.

576
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,760
Go back now.

577
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:49,760
Thank you.

578
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,110
Do you know Cong Hu?

579
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,350
Yes.

580
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,340
He's my bodyguard,

581
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,740
from the Northeast.

582
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,780
When the Japanese invaded,

583
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,080
he fled south

584
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,670
and has been to many places,

585
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,860
only came to Changsha this year.

586
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,370
I saw that he was skilled

587
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,640
and honest.

588
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,650
So I took him in.

589
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,910
Did you tell him about your conflict

590
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,290
with Madam Yun?

591
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,750
I mentioned it briefly,

592
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,030
but didn't say much.

593
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:37,400
You've been kind to him.

594
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:39,670
Would he kill her

595
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:40,660
to repay you

596
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,050
and get revenge?

597
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,350
If he really did that,

598
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,450
we'd have a blood feud with the Yun family.

599
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,200
What kind of repaying is that?

600
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,360
He definitely wouldn't do that.

601
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,580
Uncle Yang.

602
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,690
Can you still hold on?

603
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,440
I'm fine.

604
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,980
I'm just worried about my brother.

605
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:16,870
Qi.

606
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,100
Qi, are you alright?

607
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,960
You have to stay strong.

608
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,700
We can't leave Madam Yun like this.

609
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,950
We need to

610
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,510
properly arrange the following matters.

611
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:33,560
Uncle Yang,

612
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,190
why did this happen?

613
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:39,790
Why?

614
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,860
I feel...

615
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,020
I feel like I'm dreaming.

616
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,360
Dreaming.

617
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:50,790
Dreaming.

618
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:54,390
-Young Master.
-Qi!

619
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:55,660
Young Master, Young Master!

620
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:57,790
What are you doing?

621
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,400
It doesn't hurt.

622
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,400
Uncle Yang, it doesn't hurt.

623
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,250
This must be a dream, Uncle Yang.

624
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,180
Qi,

625
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,950
try to calm down!

626
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,230
You know,

627
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,100
Madam Yun loved you the most.

628
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,670
If your Grandma saw you like this,

629
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,480
how could she rest in peace?

630
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,970
If I had come back earlier,

631
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,890
would she still be alive?

632
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,470
If I had stayed at home,

633
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,010
not been so busy,

634
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,500
and watched over Grandma,

635
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,960
would Grandma still be alive?

636
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,340
It's my fault Grandma died.

637
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,910
It's my fault Grandma died.

638
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,480
It's my fault Grandma died.

639
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:44,650
Qi!

640
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,960
I need you to calm down!

641
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,240
Pull yourself together, okay?

642
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:55,580
Stop torturing yourself like this.

643
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,060
You know,

644
00:38:58,830 --> 00:38:59,950
your father is gone.

645
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,030
You need to take responsibility for this family.

646
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,140
But look at you now,

647
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,220
is this how you're taking responsibility?

648
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,780
I can't do it.

649
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,160
I can't do it, Uncle Yang.

650
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,740
Qi, you can do it.

651
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,440
Qi, you can do it.

652
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,110
Trust me.

653
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,370
-You can do it.
-I can't.

654
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:34,590
Uncle Yang, I can't do it.

655
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,020
How could this happen?

656
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,910
Granny was fine when I left.

657
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,560
No.

658
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,810
I need to see Granny.

659
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,440
Don't go there.

660
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:53,990
They're not in the mood for you right now.

661
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,440
What time did you go to the Yun's Residence?

662
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,020
And what time did you leave?

663
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:10,140
I don't remember the exact time.

664
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:12,610
It should have been shortly after I started work,

665
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,100
Jingyu called me.

666
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,080
When you take leave from the hospital,

667
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,880
don't you need to sign a leave slip

668
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:19,750
or something like that?

669
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:20,590
Yes,

670
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:21,780
she signed it afterwards.

671
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:34,740
How long did you stay at the Yun's Residence

672
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,110
and what time did you leave?

673
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:37,990
The exact time...

674
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,070
I didn't stay long.

675
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,160
There was a guest,

676
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:45,050
then I left.

677
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,250
I really can't

678
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,980
remember the exact time.

679
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,470
I didn't check the time.

680
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,350
She came back around 9:30.

681
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,870
The patient in bed 20 had surgery at 9:30.

682
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:57,260
When she was back,

683
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,360
the patient had just got in.

684
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,250
What kind of transportation did you take to and from?

685
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:05,310
Rickshaw.

686
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,870
The exact time you left the Yun's Residence

687
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:10,110
was 8:27 in the morning.

688
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,850
Haven't you noticed

689
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,370
that every time you go to the Yun's Residence,

690
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:14,810
there's always a car parked outside?

691
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,020
I have noticed.

692
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,030
We arrange for colleagues every day

693
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,300
to protect Madam Yun.

694
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,500
They'll record

695
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,360
the characteristics of everyone entering and leaving the Yun's Residence,

696
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,200
including precise time.

697
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,510
Then you knew it.

698
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:29,550
Why are you still asking me?

699
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,900
What I really want to ask is,

700
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:32,790
you left the Yun's Residence at 8:27,

701
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,910
subtracting the time it took to return,

702
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,370
which shouldn't exceed 20 minutes,

703
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,150
but there's a 40-minute time gap.

704
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,500
Where did you go and what did you do?

705
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,710
I got off the rickshaw.

706
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,440
Why?

707
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,500
You probably don't want to go to the NBIS again,

708
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,360
so I advise you to tell the truth.

709
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,950
Yun Hongqi gave me a brooch,

710
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,440
and I found it missing

711
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,700
when I got on the road,

712
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:08,290
so I got off and searched for it.

713
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:09,750
Finally, I found it.

714
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,240
Look,

715
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:19,510
this is it.

716
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,300
Which rickshaw

717
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,370
did you ride back from?

718
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,410
Do you remember?

719
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:34,270
I don't remember.

720
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,590
[Military Hospital]

721
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:40,810
Go and find

722
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:42,480
Mi Lan's former classmates and teachers

723
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,240
from nursing school.

724
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,530
Show them her current photo to confirm

725
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,640
if she's the same person.

726
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:47,680
If she is,

727
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,590
look into her past.

728
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,720
Find out if she had any unusual experiences

729
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:52,860
or connections with specific individuals.

730
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:53,830
Anyway,

731
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:54,760
the more detailed, the better.

732
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,100
You suspect she's the killer?

733
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,150
After what happened this time,

734
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:00,010
my previous suspicion is further confirmed.

735
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:01,120
This woman

736
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,920
is definitely not just a nurse.
