[Episode 38]

3
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,610
Everyone, look how clear this photo is.

4
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:51,350
You can even clearly see

5
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,850
the date on the newspaper in the background.

6
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,030
Yun Hongshen, you keep saying

7
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,910
that your father was killed by the Japanese.

8
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,690
Let me ask you,

9
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,460
who is the person in this photo?

10
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,750
And another question.

11
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,060
Why is this photo so clear?

12
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,550
Let me tell you.

13
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,750
Because this is a close-up shot.

14
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,710
The Japanese were sending you a message through it.

15
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,030
First, it was to let you know that your father is fine,

16
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,280
and second, it was to urge you

17
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,310
to hurry up and complete your task.

18
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,110
After receiving this photo,

19
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,460
you sped up your actions.

20
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,750
Within less than a day,

21
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,710
you found the cipher key

22
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,150
and the intelligence on the same day.

23
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,510
Don't you think all of this is too much of a coincidence?

24
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,410
From the very beginning, I've always felt that Yun Muzhi's death

25
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,990
wasn't that simple.

26
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,090
So,

27
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,180
I secretly did some investigation

28
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,740
and even went so far as to

29
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,720
activate my hidden mole

30
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,830
in the Japanese prison

31
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,440
in Shanghai.

32
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,950
He risked his life to take these three photos.

33
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,910
But the risk was worth it.

34
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,740
These photos confirmed my suspicions.

35
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,010
Yun Muzhi didn't die!

36
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,350
Impossible.

37
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,430
Yun Hongshen would never do such a thing.

38
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:37,930
He wouldn't?

39
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,350
Then tell me,

40
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,880
is that your father

41
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,940
in this photo?

42
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,230
The person in this photo

43
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,720
is blurry.

44
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,680
It's hard to make out.

45
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,040
Really?

46
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,200
I found that you two brothers are very alike.

47
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,810
You both can't recognize

48
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,670
your own biological father.

49
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,620
Let me tell you,

50
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,950
you should know him even if he were reduced to ashes!

51
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,130
Can't see clearly?

52
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,440
I'm sorry. I apologize.

53
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,660
I suddenly forgot.

54
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,200
You're not his biological son.

55
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,440
Calm down.

56
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,750
Calm down.

57
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,470
Chief Cheng and I go way back.

58
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,040
I am also very honored

59
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,190
to witness Chief Cheng

60
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:43,550
transform from a well-dressed beast

61
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,210
into a true villain...

62
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,310
who distorts the truth.

63
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,510
This is not a place for your insolence...

64
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,310
The Yun family will never be the Japanese's dogs!

65
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,700
Yun Hongqi, let me tell you.

66
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,440
Don't act out of line in our station.

67
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,740
With all this evidence before us,

68
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,090
do you have anything else to say?

69
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,470
If you still don't submit,

70
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,110
fine,

71
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,590
show me the evidence.

72
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,060
Weren't you just saying that you wanted evidence?

73
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,030
You're framing him.

74
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,110
Are you sure?

75
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,350
I'm sure you're framing him!

76
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,230
Are you sure?

77
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,150
I'm sure!

78
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,100
Hongqi.

79
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:15,770
Shut up!

80
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,950
If you had listened to me earlier, none of this would have happened!

81
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,980
What are you doing?

82
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,160
He is my brother.

83
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,070
This has nothing to do with him!

84
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,990
Yun Hongshen, let me tell you.

85
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,430
If you don't

86
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,740
confess honestly today,

87
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,750
your brother won't walk out of this door.

88
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,710
Yun Hongshen, remember this.

89
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,870
He can't do anything to me.

90
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,700
-Take him away!
-Don't admit to things you didn't do!

91
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:45,460
Fine!

92
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,230
I admit it all.

93
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,000
What you just said...

94
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,830
is the truth.

95
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,150
Say that again?

96
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,520
Hongqi.

97
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,520
I did lie to you.

98
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,430
Dad really is not dead.

99
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,140
Everything I did...

100
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,750
was to save him.

101
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,280
You bastard!

102
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,860
No, no, no.

103
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,610
You actually dared to be a traitor!

104
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,230
Young Master.

105
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,270
Calm down.

106
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,320
-Hongqi, don't worry about me.
-Young Master.

107
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,520
Please take care of things at home.

108
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,310
You fence-sitter.

109
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,510
Get off me!

110
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,280
You fence-sitter.

111
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,220
In private, you pretend to be on good terms with everyone.

112
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,690
Let me tell you.

113
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,030
I don't need national law.

114
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,550
I can kill you by the Yun family's house rules!

115
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,630
You bastard!

116
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,430
Let go of me!

117
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,520
Let go of me!

118
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,660
Let me kill him!

119
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,590
Wen Yeming, do you have anything else to say?

120
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,230
Chief.

121
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:46,720
No.

122
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,270
Guards,

123
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,909
lock him up.

124
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,440
Move.

125
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:09,790
Yes.

126
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:10,890
I understand.

127
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:14,750
Chief Ke,

128
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,470
the Commander said

129
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,070
that regarding Yun Hongshen's matter,

130
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,350
we will need you to put in extra effort.

131
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,070
Until everything is clarified,

132
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,260
Yun Hongshen must not die.

133
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,950
You can assure the Commander.

134
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,710
I will get to the bottom of this.

135
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,110
I'll take my leave then.

136
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,910
I think this intelligence is true.

137
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,590
Ke Jingping and Cheng Huize are veterans of the NBIS.

138
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,610
They've been tested over the years.

139
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,460
How could they be outdone by Yun Hongshen,

140
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,830
a young lad?

141
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,150
You take action secretly now.

142
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,540
Inform the forced march to arrive before the enemy

143
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:09,910
and set up an ambush.

144
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,550
This time, no matter what,

145
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,700
we can't let him escape.

146
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,210
Yes, sir.

147
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,920
Now that things have come to this, I won't hide it from you anymore.

148
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,540
Everything that happened today

149
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,930
was part of Hongshen's plan.

150
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,990
This was originally a losing game.

151
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,640
Hongshen could only use himself as bait

152
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,840
to turn the tables.

153
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,950
What are you saying?

154
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,010
Shen used himself as bait?

155
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,070
Doesn't that mean he's put his life on the line?

156
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,520
It's called "prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice."

157
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,880
Doesn't that still mean he's still putting his life on the line?

158
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,020
No way.

159
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,830
No, no, no.

160
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,510
Think of a way.

161
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,610
Think of a way!

162
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,110
Call your Organization.

163
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,370
Ask your Organization to think of a way!

164
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,910
Hongqi.

165
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,070
D-does he really have to risk his life,

166
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,870
prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice?

167
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,470
Okay.

168
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,910
Fine!

169
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,430
Secretary Wu.

170
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,830
Can I do it for him?

171
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,150
I'll sacrifice for him, okay?

172
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,150
Secretary Wu,

173
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,470
I beg you.

174
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,310
He is my only brother. Let me...

175
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,950
Let me do it for him, okay?

176
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,200
Please, Secretary Wu.

177
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,430
Let me...

178
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,550
-Let me be the bait for him.
-Hongqi.

179
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,550
What's wrong with you?

180
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,130
I've been explaining

181
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,530
and clarifying the situation to you.

182
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,990
Why are you so impatient?

183
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,140
He's prepared to make that sacrifice,

184
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,050
but we have absolute confidence in victory.

185
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,850
Absolute confidence in victory?

186
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:32,340
Yes,

187
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,590
absolute confidence in victory.

188
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,790
Can you just reassure me a little,

189
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,690
calm down, and let me finish explaining?

190
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,130
Okay?

191
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,260
Get up.

192
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:42,980
Sit down.

193
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,570
W-What can I do to help?

194
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,740
There's so much you can do.

195
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,910
Young Master.

196
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,170
Someone just threw this in.

197
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,350
It's Wen Yeming.

198
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,590
She wants to meet with me.

199
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,140
Are you the same kind of person as he is?

200
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,490
When we went to catch Zong Fang yesterday,

201
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,960
the pencil stub that Yun Hongshen threw

202
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,950
was picked up by you, right?

203
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:35,410
Yes.

204
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,020
If you were just the Young Master of the Yun family,

205
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,510
he wouldn't have entrusted you

206
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,270
with such an important matter.

207
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,570
Since you were there,

208
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,460
it means you're on the same side.

209
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,070
You don't have to be so wary of me.

210
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,120
He's already told me the truth—

211
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,360
he's a Communist.

212
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,420
The Chief is Kunwu.

213
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,170
Since I've come to you,

214
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,330
it means I've made my choice.

215
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,770
I'm not truly one of them.

216
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,420
I'm just helping them out.

217
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,390
Do you know his superior?

218
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,400
Secretary Wu was rescued.

219
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,340
Do you have any contact with him?

220
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,700
You don't have to ask that anymore.

221
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,390
Anyway,

222
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,060
we will stop at nothing to rescue Shen.

223
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,770
The Chief won't leave us much time.

224
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,230
Do you have any ideas about how to save them?

225
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,320
What's your idea?

226
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,470
You have to tell us.

227
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,530
Shen's friend said

228
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,550
that if you have made your choice,

229
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,360
you have to cooperate with our plan.

230
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,750
We need to know what you think

231
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,360
to improve our plan.

232
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,270
To prove that what Yun Hongshen

233
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,270
filmed in the hidden chamber really exists,

234
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,550
we need to find three key pieces of evidence:

235
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:49,930
the radio,

236
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,510
the painting,

237
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,670
and the death list.

238
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,970
The last two have already been destroyed,

239
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,760
but the radio should still be there.

240
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,450
Is it still in the NBIS?

241
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,580
Ke Jingping didn't move it outside?

242
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:01,830
No, he probably didn't.

243
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,780
At such a critical time,

244
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,340
he would definitely keep the most important things

245
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,760
close at hand.

246
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,170
He doesn't trust anyone.

247
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,840
Go get ready.

248
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,310
It's getting dark soon.

249
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:24,360
Yes.

252
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,430
I'm really sorry

253
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,610
to have put you at such great risk coming to meet like this.

254
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,070
It's a very urgent matter.

255
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,150
Let's sit down and talk.

00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,830
It's already this time.

257
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,890
Why isn't he back yet?

258
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,250
Where did he go?

259
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,280
You're finally back.

260
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:42,920
Be careful.

261
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,340
How is it?

262
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,050
How is it?

263
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,340
As soon as the Commander received

264
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,110
this intelligence,

265
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,570
he immediately called Zhu He

266
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:52,770
to ask for his opinion

267
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,270
on this intelligence.

268
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,100
What did Zhu He say?

269
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,470
Zhu He chose to believe Ke Jingping.

270
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,410
At a time like this,

271
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,800
he's still playing politics?

272
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,580
Zhu He's choice

273
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,170
wasn't made entirely out of politics.

274
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,080
You see,

275
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,140
compared to

276
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,630
a newcomer like Hongshen,

277
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,910
people are more willing to believe

278
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,880
those with seniority, like Ke Jingping

279
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,010
or Cheng Huize.

280
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:22,870
Besides,

281
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,880
Ke Jingping's trap was perfect this time;

282
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,700
both the witness and the evidence were in place.

283
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,420
Right?

284
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,560
So, we can't use Zhu He, right?

285
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,990
Not exactly.

286
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,560
Zhu He might say he trusts Ke Jingping,

287
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,060
but he could still be harboring doubts.

288
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,480
Besides, these people

289
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,740
often survive by constantly doubting others.

290
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,820
Hongshen has laid the groundwork before;

291
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,990
it should be useful now.

292
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,270
Guan Zhen?

293
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,750
How come it's him?

294
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:22,380
[Supervision Division]

295
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,070
The name on the compensation payment form

296
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,070
that Yun Hongshen left for Zhu He

297
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,590
is Guan Zhen.

298
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,520
He was the designer of Ke Jingping's hidden chamber

299
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,640
and died on the same day the chamber was completed.

300
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,610
Yun Hongshen investigating Guan Zhen

301
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,260
isn't surprising.

302
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,850
What really caught Zhu He's attention

303
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,620
was that, on the borrowing register 
for the compensation distribution record

304
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,530
of personnel who died in the line of duty,

305
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,720
there's also Ling Han's name.

306
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,380
There is no way that Ling Han took an interest

307
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,170
in Guan Zhen without a reason.

308
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,590
The only valuable thing about Guan Zhen

309
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,780
is that he built the hidden chamber for Ke Jingping.

[File Borrowing Register]

311
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,890
So why would Ling Han investigate that hidden chamber?

312
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,830
Of course, it's because he sensed that something was wrong

313
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,589
with the owner of the hidden chamber.

00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,619
Ke Jingping,

319
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,400
in order to give the Commander an explanation

320
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,830
and to prove the authenticity of this information,

321
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,510
he has to get a confession from Hongshen.

322
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,620
We do need to use this to our advantage.

323
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:39,670
How?

324
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,290
I've already told you.

325
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,340
Shen has already confessed verbally.

326
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,390
Isn't it very easy for Ke Jingping

327
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,860
to present a confession now?

328
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,080
Actually, that's exactly Ke Jingping's biggest problem.

329
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,260
Hongshen may admit it verbally,

330
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,260
but he would never easily give an official confession.

331
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,440
Ke Jingping knows this very well himself.

332
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,730
Wait a minute.

333
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,390
I didn't follow you.

334
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,760
Ke Jingping already can forge Ling Han's handwriting

335
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,100
and fabricated notes in the notebook.

336
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,430
What?

337
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,640
Why couldn't he forge a confession?

338
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,270
You see.

339
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,030
Didn't you publicly question him

340
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,710
when he forged notes in the notebook before?

341
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:19,410
Yes.

342
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,020
So, you're allowed to speak, but others aren't allowed to disagree?

343
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,190
You said these photos were taken by Ling Han.

344
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,310
Do you have any evidence?

345
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:28,950
Unless

346
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,190
Ling Han stands right in front of me

347
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,550
and tells me that he took these photos,

348
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,140
I'll not believe you.

349
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,670
And the words in the notebook.

350
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,680
Unless he says he wrote those words in the notebook,

351
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,430
I'll not believe it.

352
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,670
You're a big-time Chief.

353
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,670
Aren't you ashamed of

354
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,910
speaking and acting without evidence?

355
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,960
So, would he use the same trick again?

356
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,370
Now, he has only one option left,

357
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,820
and that's to make Hongshen confess on his own.

358
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,230
Don't we go back to square one?

359
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:55,990
I've already told you.

360
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,230
Shen has already confessed verbally.

361
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,590
He's confessed himself!

362
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,710
It's my fault for not making it clear.

363
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,670
Was Hongshen's confession earlier just a temporary measure?

364
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,270
I really...

365
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,290
Why didn't I realize that at that time?

366
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,910
In fact, Shen was buying time.

367
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,600
Would Ke Jingping think the same?

368
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,820
He definitely knows.

369
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,070
He's so cunning and experienced.

370
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,290
I get your point now.

371
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,450
You mean that now, Ke Jingping is

372
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,920
trying everything possible to prevent Shen from changing his story?

373
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,560
No matter who asks,

374
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,830
Shen has to admit

375
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,630
that he did it himself, right?

376
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,120
Now, Ke Jingping

377
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,600
can't use torture on Hongshen, right?

378
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,870
And he also can't threaten him

379
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,350
by using you or Wen Yeming either, can he?

380
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:58,000
What do you think he can do now?

381
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,030
Talk.

382
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,310
Talk to Shen.

383
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,800
He'll explain the situation

384
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,840
and make Hongshen voluntarily abandon the idea of retracting his confession.

385
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,190
Where will they have this conversation?

386
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,340
The hidden chamber.

387
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,890
Ke Jingping's hidden chamber.

388
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,220
Ke Jingping must believe

389
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,740
that no one would dare to plant a bug

390
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,160
right under his nose.

391
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,030
We've gotten the blueprint for that hidden chamber.

392
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,480
With it,

393
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,120
we can plant a bug.

394
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,010
There's a line marked on this blueprint—

395
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,300
a secret line.

396
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,670
It's the antenna path

397
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,140
for Ke Jingping's secret radio.

398
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,070
Hongqi.

399
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,830
That antenna path

400
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,540
is our last weapon.

401
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,210
Secretary Wu,

402
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,030
who will plant the bug?

403
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:27,790
Young Master,

404
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,690
everything is ready.

405
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,840
What's all this fluster and fuss about?

406
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,020
Isn't it just a power outage?

407
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,420
This is the meal for Yun Hongshen?

408
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:16,950
Yes.

409
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,790
Has anyone touched it?

410
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,030
It was too dark earlier.

411
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,050
I couldn't see anything at all.

412
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,110
But I've kept it in my hand the entire time,

413
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,270
never letting it out of my sight.

414
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,250
You came right after it fell to the ground.

415
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,090
Go.

416
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,900
Go get a new meal and take it to him.

417
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:29,420
Yes, sir.

418
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,090
Let's go.

419
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,630
That's right.

420
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,180
They indeed tried to tamper with the food.

421
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:41,750
But

422
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,790
I've already had someone send a new one.

423
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,300
What if they just wanted you to send a new one?

424
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,640
Wait.

425
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,590
I'll go with you.

426
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,490
Someone deliberately cut the power line to the electrical distribution room.

427
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,660
I advise you not to get your hopes up

428
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,190
because they won't succeed.

429
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,150
The Commander had already planned to

430
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,420
get your confession tonight.

431
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,740
I was going to come to you tomorrow,

432
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,370
but it seems someone couldn't wait until then.

433
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,070
Come with me to the office.

434
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,760
Not tonight. I'm tired.

435
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:46,410
I need to rest.

436
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,860
Do you think you have any say in this?

437
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,670
I said tomorrow, so it will be tomorrow.

438
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,480
I won't say a word tonight.

439
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,220
Fine.

440
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:56,540
You barely escaped with your life,

441
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,450
and now you're playing hero at night, huh?

442
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,020
What did you tell me earlier in the day?

443
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,560
You kept saying

444
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,080
that you had nothing to say

445
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,350
about Yun Hongshen's actions, right?

446
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:06,870
Yes.

447
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,410
Then why did you come to my office?

448
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:13,550
You won't say, right?

449
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,270
Fine, I'll say it for you.

450
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,750
On the surface, you seem to agree

451
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,470
that Yun Hongshen has defected,

452
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,950
but emotionally,

453
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,190
you can't accept it.

454
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,090
So, you and Yun Hongqi—

455
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,040
one of you went

456
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,350
to add something to his food,

457
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,950
while the other came to find something in my office.

458
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,110
What were you looking for?

459
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,940
Wasn't it to find what Yun Hongshen mentioned—

460
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,030
the secret radio

461
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,690
and that death list?

462
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,320
As long as you can find these things,

463
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,100
you can prove that Yun Hongshen was right

464
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,040
and that I, your teacher, was wrong, right?

465
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,610
For the past ten years,

466
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:42,270
I've always treated you as my only family.

467
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,380
Did I not treat you as my only family?

468
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,080
For the sake of the past ten years,

469
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,920
can you tell me the truth?

470
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,540
Is Mr. Yun still alive?

471
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,300
Yes! Yes! Yes!

472
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,480
Wen Yeming, you've really disappointed me.

473
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,450
How much hope did I place in you

474
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,880
over these years?

475
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,020
I hoped you would become

476
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,240
a true, real agent.

477
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,150
But look at yourself right now.

478
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,780
You're not the Wen Yeming

479
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:20,820
I've watched grow up since childhood.

480
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,120
You're no longer the teacher I used to respect.

481
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,390
Don't look at me like that.

482
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:29,930
I know what you're thinking.

483
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,440
Tomorrow.

484
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,380
Tomorrow, I'll give you the answer you want.

485
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,400
Yun Hongshen can't stay alive any longer.

486
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,270
He must be dealt with tomorrow.

487
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,660
You stay here and keep an eye on her.

488
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:56,300
Yes.

489
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,190
Deputy Chief Zhu,

490
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,840
do you want to know the truth?

491
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:32,710
Who are you?

492
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,620
On the roof, there's an extra wire

493
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,480
with a red mark on it.

494
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,810
If you want to hear

495
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,560
what Ke Jingping and the Second Young Master are saying,

496
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,060
let Director Xu think of a way.

497
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,230
You brought me here

498
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,600
just because there's no bug here.

499
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,680
Aren't you afraid others might say you have something to hide?

500
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:40,160
I'll record our entire conversation.

501
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,190
Fine.

502
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,550
Turn on the recorder.

503
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,710
I will tell everything truthfully.

504
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,080
No need to rush.

505
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,660
Do you know what you should be saying?

506
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,170
What do you want me to say?

507
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,060
Are you done?

508
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,930
Just a moment; almost there.

509
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:08,540
Hurry up.

510
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,730
Hurry up.

511
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,740
Deputy Chief, the setup is complete.

512
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,120
Get Director Gong for me.

513
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:25,460
Quick!

514
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,920
Say exactly what's written on this.

515
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:39,090
Do you think it's possible?

516
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,860
I do.

517
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,860
Yun Hongqi and Wen Yeming are now in my hands.

518
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,230
At this critical moment,

519
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,270
you've caught them.

520
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,960
Aren't you afraid of being criticized?

521
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,060
They came to save you, a Communist,

522
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,640
and then got caught by the people at the station.

523
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,110
This has nothing to do with me.

524
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,740
Even so,

525
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,470
you can't do anything to them.

526
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,600
If anything happens to them,

527
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,930
it'll only prove that you have a guilty conscience.

528
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,760
Okay, let's not talk about them.

529
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,330
Let's talk about your good comrade, Secretary Wu.

530
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,730
You must have been in frequent contact with him lately, right?

531
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,210
I believe that as long as I find him,

532
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,460
I can find your other comrades.

533
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:25,950
Maybe I'll even find

534
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,680
the person who transferred the gold reserves.

535
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,930
Commander, this is Zhu He.

536
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,510
The matter you asked me to investigate

537
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,680
is underway.

538
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,930
Would you like to hear it with us now?

539
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,010
Yes.

540
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,480
Tell me.

541
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,070
When did the Japanese turn you

542
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,570
and send you to infiltrate NBIS as a spy?

543
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,630
Ke Jingping.

544
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,679
We both know

545
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:15,770
that you're the real Japanese spy.

546
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,010
And you are Kunwu.

547
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,929
Do you know that what you're doing could get many people killed?

548
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,800
We are willing to sacrifice ourselves for the cause.

549
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:36,340
Because your scheme has already failed.

550
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,150
Do you think you have

551
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,810
anything left to fight against me?

552
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:49,639
Really?

553
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:52,239
Your 106th Division, which has departed from Jiangxi,

554
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,530
planning to make a detour and launch a surprise attack on Changsha,

555
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,530
will soon be surrounded by our Nationalist Army.

556
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,820
If you don't believe it,

557
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:03,990
you can call the Commander

558
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:04,800
and ask him

559
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,560
if his reserve forces

560
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,360
have been dispatched to Jiangxi.

561
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,440
This must seem strange to you.

562
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:19,850
Myna's information clearly indicates

563
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,720
that the 6th, 13th, and 33rd Divisions

564
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,970
would attack head-on,

565
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,150
while the 3rd Division would cross Yueyang Lake from the west

566
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:25,820
and secretly move south,

567
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,090
bypassing the Nationalist Army's defensive lines to attack Changsha.

568
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,450
How could Commander Xue have sent his reserve forces

569
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,860
eastward toward Jiangxi?

570
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,100
That's impossible, right?

571
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,320
Because I've changed the intelligence.

572
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,870
The intelligence I gave to the Commander said

573
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,760
that the 6th, 13th, and 33rd Divisions

574
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,200
would carry out the main attack,

575
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,320
and the 106th Division would secretly move

576
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,230
westward from Jiangxi

577
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,250
to bypass the defenses and attack Changsha.

578
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,270
That's impossible.

579
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,540
You didn't get the cipher key.

580
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,930
You couldn't have changed it.

581
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,190
I got the cipher key a long time ago.

582
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,130
Ling Han told me.

583
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,910
Before he died, he told me

584
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,740
that the cipher key was the "Flowers in the Mirror" from the 9th year of the Republic of China.

585
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,450
Release Yun Hongqi and Wen Yeming

586
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,580
now!

587
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,650
Fine, even if you have the key,

588
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,760
the codebook is still in my hands.

589
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,030
You still can't change it.

590
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:34,470
I could sneak in and take a picture of your radio station,

591
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,510
the death list,

592
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,320
and even the drawings you made yourself.

593
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:40,770
Why can't I change the code?

594
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,670
I'm not as cunning as you.

595
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,710
I can't guess how you'll eventually trap me.

596
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,840
But there's one thing I won't be wrong about.

597
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,630
If I expose you, claiming that the intelligence is false,

598
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,800
you'll use all your strength to prove that it's true.

599
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:13,190
So I might as well change the intelligence to the real one.

600
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:16,270
The more I deny it,

601
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,590
the harder you'll try to prove its authenticity.

602
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,350
So the real intelligence

603
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,870
was given to the Commander yourself.

604
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,750
If the intelligence that Xue received is the real one,

605
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,460
that proves I'm right.

606
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,570
You are the spy sent by the Japanese.

607
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,870
In the end, I still won.

608
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,540
Wrong.

609
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,370
Even if you falsely accuse me and I die,

610
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,270
your strategic deception plan

611
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,460
has already failed.

612
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:41,840
Your troops

613
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,020
will be surrounded by us and even exterminated.

614
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,380
Even if you're alive and well,

615
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,910
how will you explain it to Okamura Yasuji?

616
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,040
Hope there's a day to return;

617
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:56,600
I dare not resent Changsha.

618
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,690
To the Japanese,

619
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,730
you will be a traitor,

620
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,230
a sinner.

621
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,340
You'll never see...

622
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,730
your wife and children again.

623
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,740
So...

624
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,090
you're the one

625
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:24,600
who loses.

626
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,980
Don't talk to me about my family.

627
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,020
I'll kill you.

628
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,020
Chief.

629
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,480
I never thought...

630
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:26,310
that the spy would be you.

631
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,400
Take him away!

632
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,000
Wait a moment!

633
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,710
Yun Hongshen.

634
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,530
I didn't expect that, in the end,

635
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,840
it would still be you who defeated me.

636
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,780
Looks like I didn't misjudge you.

637
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,390
Yeming.

638
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,710
I've let you down.

639
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,030
Do you remember what I told you before?

640
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,180
When we become agents,

641
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:12,680
we must abandon our most basic human emotions.

642
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,270
But when you become

643
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,500
a good agent,

644
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:19,980
you're no longer a good person.

645
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,630
I have my own choice.

646
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,580
It's the first time I've realized

647
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:52,890
how beautiful Changsha is at night.

648
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:54,880
Of course.

649
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,250
It's worth protecting at all costs.

650
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,270
I heard

651
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:02,450
that your father left you with half of a photo.

652
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,440
Could I see it?

653
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,650
Perhaps

654
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,660
the other half is with me.

655
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:55,970
To victory in the war against Japan.

656
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:58,610
To victory in the war against Japan.
