You should thank Uncle Zhang, okay?

00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,350
this is exactly the time for men to serve our country.

193
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,710
Yes.

194
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,330
During the Battle of Shanghai,

195
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,220
I got injured here.

196
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,740
My eyes don't work well now.

197
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,480
I believe teaching is also a form of fighting.

198
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,630
There's a saying that goes:

199
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:53,910
"Those who can act, act.

200
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:54,880
Those who can speak, speak."

201
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,680
Like fireflies,

202
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:59,240
even in the darkness, they can emit a little light

203
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,110
and don't need to wait for a torch.

204
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:03,950
No wonder you're a teacher.

205
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,890
That was beautifully said.

206
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,030
With the children and ladies here,

207
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:08,880
it's not convenient.

208
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,550
Please take Captain Tang upstairs

209
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,100
to treat the wound.

210
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:13,870
Captain Tang?

211
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,160
Let's go.

212
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,090
-Brother.
-Captain.

213
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,050
Do you need my help?

214
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:19,950
-No.
-Uncle.

215
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:20,950
Take care of Zhe.

216
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:21,670
Alright.

217
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,200
Huang,

218
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,870
keep things under control.

219
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,520
Slowly.

220
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,380
-Uncle.
-Have a seat.

221
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:24,890
Here.

222
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,820
Sir,

223
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,130
we found a gun box,

224
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,080
but the gun is not in there.

225
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,010
We haven't found out whose it is yet.

226
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,700
Alright, I see.

227
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,270
You guys sit over there.

228
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,550
Please show your IDs.

229
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,830
Miss, what is your surname?

230
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:03,950
An Zhiyi.

231
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,430
Are you a local?

232
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,590
Yes.

233
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,470
My father passed away.

234
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,070
I came back from abroad for his funeral.

235
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,790
So, you're studying abroad.

236
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,430
In France,

237
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,400
at the Central School of Public Works.

238
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,480
Miss An, you don't talk much.

239
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,980
We are alumni.

240
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,350
I studied economics.

241
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,010
That's a real shame.

242
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,030
Miss An, please make yourself comfortable.

243
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:36,950
Hello.

244
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,350
Please show your IDs.

245
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,860
Are you back to visit your family?

246
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,340
Yes.

247
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,910
Tell me your address in Shanghai.

248
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,030
25 Beitang Road, Room 306.

249
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,790
Who is your contact?

250
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,220
Contact in where?

251
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:53,790
In Shanghai.

252
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,240
It's just me at home.

253
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,110
Oh, and her.

254
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,000
After I came back,

255
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,260
there has been no one at home.

256
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,540
What about your husband?

257
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,590
My husband is very busy.

258
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,900
I didn't ask if he's busy.

259
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,030
Quickly,

260
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,030
tell me his name and phone number.

261
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,260
Why are you asking this?

262
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,430
Let me tell you,

263
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,510
my husband is really busy with work.

264
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,790
He's never home.

265
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,710
There are so many people waiting to see him,

266
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,910
and he doesn't see any of them.

267
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,990
No matter how busy he is, you have to tell us.

268
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,300
If we can't verify

269
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,310
your personal information,

270
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,390
we can't let you go.

271
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,470
You're pregnant.

272
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,640
Don't make trouble for yourself.

273
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:23,640
Speak up.

274
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,180
Let me tell you,

275
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,470
you can't afford to offend me.

276
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,100
When my husband gets angry,

277
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,620
it's terrifying.

278
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,590
No matter how powerful your husband is, did he even marry you?

279
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,260
You're pregnant and were sent back to your hometown,

280
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,510
yet you still have the nerve to keep saying "my husband?"

281
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,950
Come on,

282
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,520
just answer what the officer asks.

283
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,270
Stop nagging.

284
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,020
You're wasting everyone's time.

285
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,670
Come on!

286
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,150
You're all bullying me!

287
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,150
Let me tell you,

288
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,330
I'm just a woman

289
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,550
who traveled all alone on a long boat ride.

290
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,650
I vomited the whole way, you know?

291
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,640
I couldn't eat or sleep well,

292
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,150
so I've got no strength left at all.

293
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,000
Are you a blockhead?

294
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,270
Watching your master being bullied,

295
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,310
you don't even dare to say a single word?

296
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,030
Miss,

297
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,270
before coming back,

298
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,490
did you prepare the medicine for your husband's skin?

299
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,740
How did you know my husband has...

300
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,630
My father was acquainted with your husband.

301
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,099
Previously, my father heard him mention it once.

302
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,109
Does Mr. Lin have a minor ailment?

303
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,420
Yes, yes, that's right.

304
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,060
But he doesn't let others talk about it.

305
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,270
See?

306
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,110
He knows my husband.

307
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,040
Let me tell you,

308
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,730
he's your superior.

309
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,590
Is your position higher than his?

310
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:37,700
Move on to the next person.

311
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,390
Yes.

312
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,960
Please show your ID.

313
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,130
Zhang.

314
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,320
Madam.

315
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,740
Arrest the person who honked the horn.

316
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:49,290
Yes.

317
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,310
Madam,

318
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,390
what does this mean?

319
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,130
Are they calling off the operation?

320
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,170
Do you think we're that lucky?

321
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,200
They've come to us.

322
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:46,600
Hello?

323
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,830
Is this Changsha Hotel?

324
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,830
I'm the guest in Room 501.

325
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:51,650
I'd like to check out.

326
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,230
Yes, and one more thing.

327
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:54,550
We'll be back in an hour

328
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,570
to complete the process.

329
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,350
The room must be ready by then.

330
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:00,630
Alright.

331
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,420
Hello?

332
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,430
Hello, is this Reporter Zhu?

333
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,380
This is Zhongshan Pier.

334
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,430
There was a shooting here.

335
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,380
The NBIS agents don't care about civilian lives.

336
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,390
Many people have died here.

337
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:32,840
Yes.

338
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,870
You must expose this incident.

339
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,260
Sir,

340
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,550
are you here to visit friends or family?

341
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,670
The situation in Changsha is very unsafe right now.

342
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,470
Sir. Sir.

343
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,790
Watch out!

344
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,690
Arrest him!

345
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:10,630
What are you doing?

346
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,430
Behave yourself!

347
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,930
No! No! No!

348
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,390
-What happened?
-I'm begging you.

349
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,750
-Please let my child go.
-Stop it!

350
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,060
Nobody move!

351
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,300
Move again and I'll shoot this child!

352
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,270
What do you want?

353
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,680
I want everyone to leave the ship!

354
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,800
I'm taking the ship!

355
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,840
What about the child?

356
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:25,950
When will you let her go?

357
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,320
Once you're all off the boat,

358
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,140
I'll throw her into the water.

359
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,450
Then you can fish her out.

360
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,040
No, no, please don't!

361
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,230
I'm begging you!

362
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,940
My child is only four years old.

363
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,430
She won't survive that!

364
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,230
Stop it!

365
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,390
How can I trust you?

366
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,530
What if you go back on your word?

367
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,020
If you want to save the child,

368
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,830
you have no choice but to trust me.

369
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,360
-Nobody move!
-I'm begging you.

370
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,430
Please let her go!

371
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,020
Stay where you are.

372
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,840
Don't come after me!

373
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:48,890
Step back!

374
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,090
Put your guns down!

375
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,260
Put your guns down!

376
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,080
Drop your weapons!

377
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,270
Or I'll shoot this child!

378
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,350
Drop your weapons!

379
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,520
Drop them!

380
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,190
Drop your weapons!

381
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,350
Hurry up!

382
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,660
Or I'll shoot this child!

383
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,560
Sir, are you alright?

384
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:24,260
Tong!

385
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,390
Thank you! Thank you, Officer!

386
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,130
It's okay.

387
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,580
Be careful!

388
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,340
Sir!

389
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:41,450
Sir!

390
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,320
What do you, a child, know?

391
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,290
How can you take up arms and rebel?

392
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,390
Sir!

393
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:51,640
Sir!

394
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:53,850
Hurry!

395
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,760
Call an ambulance!

396
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,960
There's no need to go to the hospital.

397
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,110
[The passenger has been killed]

398
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,690
Sir,

399
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,230
we've finished checking the luggage

400
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,330
of all the other passengers.

401
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:10,300
There's nothing suspicious.

402
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,430
Except for him.

403
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,450
He said that

404
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,080
only the Chief can check his luggage.

405
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,920
Otherwise, no one can touch it.

406
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:17,560
And he has this.

407
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:26,750
Do you want to die?

408
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,110
Do you know what will happen if you open this case?

409
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,060
Keep an eye on him.

410
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,070
Don't let him disrupt my work.

411
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,340
Let them check!

412
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,350
[Shi Changsheng, the special envoy of the Kuomintang NBIS]

413
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,220
You're courting death.

414
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,170
[To Chief Ke Jingping]

415
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,800
When I see Ke Jingping,

416
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,400
I'm going to ask him

417
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:51,320
how he has been training his subordinates.

418
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,850
They don't seem to follow any rules.

419
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,260
Check it!

420
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,260
Give me the records.

421
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,230
Yes, Sir.

422
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,570
Look.

423
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,500
Time is ticking away,

424
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,320
and the situation is getting more and more complicated,

425
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,110
but Mister is still nowhere to be found.

426
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,780
It's impossible

427
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,820
to take all these people back for questioning.

428
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,950
And Mister won't give him that much time.

429
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,940
The longer this drags on, the more unpredictable it'll become.

430
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,630
He must find Mister as soon as possible.

431
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,130
For Zong Fang,

432
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,660
the most important goal of tomorrow's operation

433
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,140
is to cover his escape from Changsha.

434
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,670
Zong Fang has now become a pawn

435
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,710
abandoned by the Japanese.

436
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,670
He must have received reliable information

437
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:48,550
that I'm planning to take action against him soon.

438
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,360
So he'll definitely take the chance to escape tomorrow.

439
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,310
Let's go!

440
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,350
Go!

441
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,710
Tell me what happened.

442
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,870
-We were walking on the street,
-Zhao!

443
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,150
and suddenly someone appeared...

444
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,000
There was an explosion over there.

445
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,030
Many people died.

446
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,770
But we captured two culprits alive.

447
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,990
One of them seems to be a leader.

448
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,520
Let's not worry about the situation over here for now.

449
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,270
We need to send those two people to the NBIS.

450
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:08,990
Alright.

451
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:09,790
I'll go and send them.

452
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,190
You stay here and protect the scene.

453
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:11,740
Okay.

454
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,070
I've been guarding here the whole time.

455
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,190
Don't be impulsive.

456
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,750
This must be a trap.

457
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:20,950
The last order we received

458
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,160
was to stay silent.

459
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,850
But what if he didn't have time to issue the order?

460
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,660
Chief,

461
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,700
all the Japanese spies ambushed in the street have been eliminated.

462
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,150
We had no casualties on our side.

463
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:08,660
You may leave.

464
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:09,130
Yes.

465
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,210
May I ask if there was a murder?

466
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,540
How many civilians were killed at the scene?

467
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,190
Were all the killers NBIS agents?

468
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,300
When will you make the case public

469
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,280
and give justice to the victims?

470
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,130
Everyone,

471
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,990
we were just conducting a routine inspection.

472
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,190
There was no murder.

473
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,820
The bloody facts are right in front of us,

474
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,900
and you still don't admit it.

475
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,310
We saw it when we arrived.

476
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,160
There were many bodies on that street.

477
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,220
How do you explain that?

478
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,300
They got what they deserved.

479
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,030
What they deserved?

480
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,070
He actually said those dead civilians deserved it.

481
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,580
He has no compassion at all.

482
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,870
-Let us in!
-Yes! Let us in!

483
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:00,230
Let us in!

484
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,820
Step back!

485
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:13,660
Chief.

486
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:16,890
Why are you here?

487
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,310
Director called and said

488
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,330
the special envoy he sent here has been detained.

489
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,630
The special envoy sent by Director?

490
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,670
Why didn't he tell me about this?

491
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,630
I don't know either.

492
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,750
It might be some secret operation

493
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,150
that he finds inconvenient for us to know.

494
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,080
Secret mission?

495
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:32,540
He's been detained,

496
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,560
and Director knew about it first.

497
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,380
Who told him?

498
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,430
There's something wrong with the special envoy.

499
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,300
Young man,

500
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,670
let me give you a piece of advice.

501
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,300
Don't wait until things

502
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,010
spiral out of control before you stop.

503
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,340
These people stay.

504
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,560
The rest can leave.

505
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,420
Yes.

506
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,020
Everyone, listen up.

507
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,540
Those whose names I call

508
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,500
can leave.

509
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:13,830

[Fuhua Passenger Ferry]

514
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,180
Where's Zong Fang?

515
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Why hasn't he returned yet?

516
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,780
His team has been completely wiped out.

517
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:10,290
He... He might...

518
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,580
Oh no.

519
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,810
Mister has been detained.

520
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,070
What does this mean?

521
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,550
Are you detaining me?

522
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,270
Well,

523
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,910
you've checked what you needed to check,

524
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,020
and you've checked what you shouldn't have.

525
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,770
And you're still not letting me go?

526
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,060
What does this mean?

527
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,180
You want to play games, right?

528
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,270
Fine.

529
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:45,690
I'd like to see

530
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,850
how you're going to carry on with this show.

531
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:48,840
I'll play along with you.

532
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,750
Officer,

533
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,630
don't you know who my husband is?

534
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,540
Why are you treating me like this?

535
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,200
If you keep giving me a hard time,

536
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,950
my husband is going to get mad.

537
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,350
Miss An, you're quite composed.

538
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:11,130
Would panicking help?

539
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:17,929
Are you a Shanghai local?

540
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,790
No.

541
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:25,489
There's one of our people on the ship.

542
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:27,370
You can contact her if necessary,

543
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:28,520
and she will help you.

544
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,040
You look somewhat familiar to me.

545
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:31,790
Have we met at a café

546
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,440
on Jessfield Road before?

547
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,630
Sir,

548
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:37,150
[I'm one of yours]

549
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,110
you've mistaken me for someone else.

550
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:37,989
I've never had coffee before.

551
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,550
No,

552
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,380
My stomach hurts.

553
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,670
I need to go to the hospital.

554
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:47,500
Stop pretending.

555
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,420
When you said you were in pain,

556
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,900
you were more worried about ruining your nails.

557
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,670
You call this pain?

558
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,900
I don't care.

559
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,560
I'm carrying a baby in me now.

560
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,690
If you scare me into something bad,

561
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,630
you won't be able to bear the consequences. I'm telling you.

562
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,300
This gentleman

563
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,170
holds a much higher position than your husband.

564
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,830
I dared to offend even him,

565
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,230
let alone you.

566
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:10,110
Really?

567
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,140
Why did Old Lin choose such a fool?

568
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:17,310
No wonder his wife, that shrew, kicked you out of Shanghai.

569
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:18,880
He said

570
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,750
I have my own advantages, alright?

571
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,100
You detained her?

572
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,710
With her foolishness,

573
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,420
is she really the person you're looking for?

574
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,220
She does have her advantages.

575
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:33,870
Miss An,

576
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:35,190
your father has just passed away,

577
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,390
and you rushed back from abroad

578
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:39,160
with only a few clothes in your suitcase.

579
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,890
Yet you had the time to fly to London

580
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,600
to buy a few new pieces from Miss Chloe's latest collection.

581
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:45,860
It's truly puzzling.

582
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,620
I bought them in Paris.

583
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,430
You probably don't know,

584
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:52,510
but Miss Chloe is French of British descent.

585
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,110
So when her clothes are sold in the UK,

586
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:58,620
they all have her personal signature embroidered on the back collar.

587
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,730
However, the clothes sold in Paris boutiques

588
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,230
don't have her signature.

589
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,060
But the clothes in your suitcase

590
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,770
do have Miss Chloe's signature.

591
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,070
How can you prove

592
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,720
that what you said is true?

593
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,500
Miss Chloe and I are friends.

594
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,090
I'm familiar with some of her personal habits.

595
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,450
You claimed to be a local from Changsha

596
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:19,390
and are studying in France.

597
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:22,610
But you speak without the slightest trace of a Changsha accent.

598
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,430
Of course,

599
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,540
you probably

600
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,270
have many explanations for this.

601
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:27,930
That's true.

602
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,590
Well, I'd like to ask,

603
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,240
what's with your posture?

604
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,980
My mother taught me since childhood

605
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,140
that one should

606
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,070
sit and walk properly.

607
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:37,620
Is there a problem with that?

608
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:38,950
This isn't just proper.

609
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,310
This is clearly a military-style posture.

610
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,830
You've received strict and formal training in the military.

611
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,310
Why would a top student from a prestigious French university

612
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,500
have undergone such training?

613
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,790
You are a good opponent.

614
00:36:58,730 --> 00:36:59,660
What a pity.

615
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:03,900
I see.

616
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,020
You're twin sisters.

617
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,740
Hurry up, hurry up!

618
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,060
What are you dawdling for?

619
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,210
Hurry up.

620
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,640
Hurry up!

621
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,610
It's the last box.

622
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:32,930
Everything's ready.

623
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,280
Where's the cipher key?

624
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,260
If I don't hand it over, I might have a chance to survive.

625
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,750
But if I do, I'll definitely die.

626
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,530
So why would I hand it over?

627
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,070
You're wrong.

628
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,100
Handing it over might actually give you a slim chance of survival.

629
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:03,630
Because all we want is the cipher key.

630
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,010
We're not interested in taking your life.

631
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,340
But the Japanese don't think so.

632
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,430
Whether you hand it over or not,

633
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:10,670
as long as they find out

634
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,820
we met here, you'll be dead.

635
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:36,790
Keep it.

636
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,290
Is her pregnancy real?

637
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,160
It's fake.

638
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,290
Ever since Mrs. Lin learned about her existence,

639
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,610
Mr. Lin hasn't gone to her place.

640
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,560
So she pretended to be pregnant,

641
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,390
hoping to win Mr. Lin back.

642
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:52,420
But Mrs. Lin is more capable than her.

643
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,900
She hasn't succeeded.

644
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,280
A few days ago,

645
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:57,340
using the excuse that Mr. Lin didn't celebrate her birthday with her,

646
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:58,280
she made a scene.

647
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,310
That infuriated Mrs. Lin.

648
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,290
She wanted to kill her.

649
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,540
Mr. Lin, considering her pregnancy,

650
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,750
couldn't bear to harm her.

651
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,520
So he asked me to accompany her back to her parent's home to give birth.

652
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:11,580
Does Mr. Lin know her true identity?

653
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,470
It's still uncertain.

654
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,920
How could he not know?

655
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:16,970
Think about it.

656
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,840
With this fake belly of mine,

657
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,510
how could I possibly fool such a sharp man?

658
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:43,680
We won't be able to get him alive.

659
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,470
The only option is to make sure Mister can't speak.

660
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,560
The list of dispatched personnel

661
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:53,160
must not fall into Yun Hongshen's hands.

662
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:54,940
What are you planning to do?

663
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,900
I still have people on that ship.

664
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,040
Killing her right under Yun Hongshen's nose?

665
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:01,830
Is that even possible?

666
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,990
He'll eventually have to send Mister away.

667
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,000
That will be our chance to act.

668
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:22,030
[Zhongshan Pier]

669
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,280
-Officer!
-It's the Officer's car.

670
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,200
Officer.

671
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:32,550
What gives you the right to lock us in here?

672
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,590
What gives you the right to lock us in here?

673
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,190
Let us leave!

674
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:34,930
Let us leave!

675
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,620
-Let us go!
-Let us leave, Officer!

676
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,230
Let us go!

677
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,100
Let us in!

678
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,290
Cigarettes!

679
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,950
Cigarettes!

680
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,020
Officer! Officer!

681
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,500
Officer! Officer!

682
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,130
Young man,

683
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,500
if I'm not mistaken,

684
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,340
you detained me here

685
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:51,150
to ensure my safety, right?

686
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:54,620
What's wrong?

687
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,670
There's someone over there.

688
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,200
Seems like a big shot.
