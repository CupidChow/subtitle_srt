00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,310
The bathroom on the first floor is out of order.
Use the one on the second floor.

193
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:55,990
Okay.

194
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,290
I didn't bring the stuff.

195
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,390
Unless I see my daughter,

196
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,540
I won't give it to you.

197
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:19,630
You don't seem to be in a position to make demands.

198
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,480
If that's the case,

199
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,600
then there's no point in talking.

200
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,370
Don't you want to save your daughter?

201
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,390
Sir,

202
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,420
it's almost time.

203
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,540
Is anyone in there?

204
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,370
Is anyone in there?

205
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,720
Fei? Fei!

206
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,390
There's a murder!

207
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,770
There's a murder!

208
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,480
Someone's dead!

209
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,610
Call the police now!

210
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,670
Fei is dead!

211
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,550
The customer in Room 1 is also dead!

212
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,030
Hongqi.

213
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:52,570
You stay here.

214
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:53,930
I'll go upstairs to check.

215
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:54,650
Be careful.

216
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,430
There's the scent of cigars.

217
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,870
The killer was smoking a Punch cigar.

218
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,590
Killing someone in broad daylight.

219
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,460
This is so terrifying.

220
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,670
A few days ago, I went to the temple to offer incense.

221
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,990
The old monk said I'd encounter a bloody disaster soon.

222
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,120
I didn't believe it.

223
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,230
But now it looks like it's true.

224
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,710
You should visit that old monk again

225
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,430
and ask him to help you ward off the bad luck.

226
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,230
Yes, yes, yes.

227
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,560
I should go there again.

228
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,030
How did I run into such an unfortunate thing?

229
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,190
Fei was really pitiful.

230
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,990
He hadn't even dated anyone yet.

231
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,030
He hadn't even dated?

232
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,600
That's truly unfortunate.

233
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,030
If you ask me,

234
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,330
I bet the customers in the room

235
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,270
had a conflict,

236
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,040
and Fei saw someone get killed,

237
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,310
so they killed Fei to silence him.

238
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,470
But

239
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,670
Room 1 only had one customer.

240
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,230
And after he went up,

241
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,770
no other customers went to the second floor.

242
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,870
One customer?

243
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,470
Could it be that another customer killed him?

244
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,110
That's unlikely too.

245
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,510
Room 2 was full of female customers,

246
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,390
all of whom are regulars.

247
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,830
There's no way they'd kill someone.

248
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,980
The other rooms were empty.

249
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,930
No one was there.

250
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,670
Shen,

251
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,430
that waitress just told me everything.

252
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,070
Only two private rooms upstairs were occupied.

253
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,910
There was only one person in Room 1,

254
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,710
while Room 2 was full of women.

255
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:05,670
Stop looking. Stop looking.

256
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,950
Are those two the young masters of the Yun family?

257
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:09,390
Quick,

258
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,230
let's call Officer Chen from the NBIS.

259
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,310
They're already gone.

260
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,310
Maybe you were mistaken.

261
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,960
Even if it was a mistake, we have to report it.

262
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,710
Don't you know that the NBIS is looking for them?

263
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,900
We can't afford to ignore it.

264
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,589
Let's go.

265
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,990
The men I sent went left after leaving the building,

266
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,319
chasing for two blocks,

267
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:25,470
but didn't find any trace of Yun Hongshen and Yun Hongqi.

268
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,930
Do we have any news on Myna?

269
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:27,510
Not yet.

270
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,349
We're still looking.

271
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,030
Is there no good news at all?

272
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:36,870
Yes,

273
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:37,590
it's me.

274
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,480
What?

275
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:43,080
You've found the two young masters of the Yun family?

276
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,030
We just found Myna,

277
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,290
and he's already dead.

278
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,950
All that effort wasted.

279
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,160
What terrible luck.

280
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,360
Myna is dead, but what about that intelligence?

281
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,890
He wouldn't have kept it on him the whole time.

282
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,790
Shengxing Hotel.

283
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:00,800
Let's go.

284
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,190
Sir, would you like to check in?

285
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:08,840
Boss,

286
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,870
we're friends of Mr. Mi in Room 302.

287
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,180
He's no longer staying here

288
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,510
and has asked us to pick up his belongings.

289
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,590
This is the room.

290
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,890
This place has really been thoroughly searched.

291
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,610
Could that intelligence

292
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,810
have been taken by that person just now?

293
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:26,910
Hongqi,

294
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:27,510
let's keep looking.

295
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,970
Maybe they didn't find it.

296
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,580
Check over there.

297
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,090
Unbelievable.

298
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:39,190
We're always one step behind.

299
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,680
What's the point of searching anymore?

300
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,850
Everything that should be here is here,

301
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,190
and even things that shouldn't be are lying around.

302
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:51,190
The intel must have been taken by that person just now.

303
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,110
What's this?

304
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,310
"To my dear father."

305
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,470
Who is it?

306
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,310
Mi Lan?

307
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,670
Mi Lan is Myna's daughter.

308
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,340
So, Mi Lan's father

309
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,900
went to the Military Hospital just to see her?

310
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,670
But he didn't dare to go in,

311
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,730
so he stayed for a while and then left.

312
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,310
It seems that way.

313
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,630
That's right.

314
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,900
It matches with what we heard from Huang.

315
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,830
Poor Mi Lan.

316
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,190
During the Wenxi fire,

317
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,850
she lost her other relatives.

318
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,350
Now,

319
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,360
she's lost her father too.

320
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,110
I really don't know if she can

321
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,790
handle this kind of blow.

322
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,270
Shen, I'm talking to you.

323
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,510
Can't you show a little compassion?

324
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,270
For me, compassion is a luxury.

325
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,350
I can't afford it.

326
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,790
Shen,

327
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,200
you've changed.

328
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,970
Why have you become like this?

329
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,310
You used to

330
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,260
go out of your way to save even a stray cat or dog

331
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,110
if they were sick.

332
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,050
Look at you now.

333
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,590
A young girl who has helped us multiple times,

334
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:15,130
yet you're doing everything you can to doubt her.

335
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,330
Is that appropriate?

336
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,150
You really have changed.

337
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,270
Yes.

338
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,440
I have changed.

339
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,570
I hate myself for not changing sooner.

340
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:29,640
I hate myself

341
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,540
for being so arrogant in the past.

342
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,810
It's my fault that Dad died.

343
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,160
If you were me...

344
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,370
would you still dare to trust others so easily?

345
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,350
I...

346
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,900
It's okay.

347
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,090
Let's keep looking.

348
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,100
Maybe

349
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,030
Myna's secret is

350
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,170
hidden in some nook and cranny,

351
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,980
and that secret wasn't taken away by that person.

352
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,350
Not here.

353
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,790
Nothing on the surface.

354
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,040
There's a box of candy here.

355
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,840
Perhaps Myna's intelligence

356
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,370
is inside this box of candy.

357
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,210
I don't think so.

358
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,820
For an expert like Myna,

359
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,300
he wouldn't put something so important

360
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,700
in such an obvious place.

361
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,560
Besides, the candy box is too conspicuous.

362
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,050
If he had carried it with him,

363
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,230
it wouldn't have been convenient.

364
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,180
So the intelligence will definitely not be

365
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,260
inside this box.

366
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,780
I don't think so.

367
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,610
Think about it.

368
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:34,690
If it's as you said,

369
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,420
he should have put it in plain sight.

370
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,060
Why would he put it in here?

371
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,820
Isn't that just extra trouble?

372
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,200
Hongqi.

373
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,670
Let's open it and take a look.

374
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,570
We can use this thing

375
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:45,690
to test Mi Lan.

376
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,190
That's not appropriate.

377
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,030
Stop testing her.

378
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,350
This was left to her by her father.

379
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,160
Let me see it.

380
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,230
No, no, no.

381
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,390
Let me see it.

382
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,890
It fell, didn't it?

383
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,390
Move aside.

384
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,190
Is this...

385
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,510
what you were talking about...

386
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,500
It's that, that...

387
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,430
that you were talking about,

388
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,520
isn't it?

389
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,230
That's right.

390
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:28,840
Let's go.

391
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,430
It's...

392
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:34,890
Shen.

393
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,110
Shen, Shen, Shen.

394
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,250
These things...

395
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,880
still need to be given to Mi Lan.

396
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,230
After all, they're the keepsakes that her father left for her.

397
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,160
When do you want to give them to her?

398
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,970
I haven't decided yet,

399
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,850
and I also don't even know how to tell her.

400
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:53,990
Hongqi,

401
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,070
we still need to keep hiding.

402
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,070
Carrying such a large suitcase is neither safe

403
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,000
nor convenient.

404
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,110
How about

405
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,150
we give it to Dao?

406
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:02,880
Sounds good.

407
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,690
Then, let's go.

408
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:29,650
Come with me.

409
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,170
Myna?

410
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,670
Although you drove away a bunch of secret agents,

411
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,960
there will certainly be a new batch to replace them.

412
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,110
This suitcase must not be seen by anyone else.

413
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,990
Put it in the trunk when you get home.

414
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,790
Got it.

415
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:47,710
Young Master,

416
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,630
Second Young Master,

417
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,960
is there anything else?

418
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,210
You've worked hard.

419
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,200
Head back now.

420
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:52,840
Okay,

421
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:53,670
I'm leaving.

422
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:54,860
Hongqi,

423
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,990
I'll go check if the glasses are fixed.

424
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,150
Does Mi Lan really like candy?

425
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,270
Otherwise,

426
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,550
Myna wouldn't have specifically brought candy back

427
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,870
from Shanghai for her.

428
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:17,410
[Yu's Optical Shop]

429
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:13,830
This way.

430
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:14,750
Thank you.

431
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:15,710
Take care.

432
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:30,010
[Fortune Candy Shop]

433
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,020
This is for Mi Lan, right?

434
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,230
What are we

435
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,480
going to do next?

436
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,770
Since you've bought candy for her,

437
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,010
why not send it to her?

438
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,400
And give her the glasses while you're at it.

439
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,190
Okay.

440
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:46,130
No.

441
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,580
The NBIS agents

442
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,360
must be lying in wait at the Military Hospital now.

443
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,050
We can't go there.

444
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,180
It's too dangerous.

445
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,050
Although Wen Yeming didn't see us

446
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,330
get into that car,

447
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,030
she might have guessed.

448
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,000
Most people would think

449
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,600
that once someone's left,

450
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,860
they wouldn't return.

451
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,070
So she definitely

452
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,550
won't guess that we're going back again.

453
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,880
There surely won't be any ambushes there.

454
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,070
Let's go.

455
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:22,660
It's you.

456
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,390
How dare you come back?

457
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,300
The NBIS is after you.

458
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,770
We still... still need to say goodbye to you.

459
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,970
We happen to have something to show you.

460
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:32,580
What is it?

461
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,330
Come with me.

462
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,110
Miss Mi Lan,

463
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:50,700
your glasses are ready.

464
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:55,780
Thank you.

465
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,590
Mi Lan.

466
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,560
Please, have a seat.

467
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,160
Sit.

468
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,800
You're very thoughtful

469
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,570
and kind-hearted too.

470
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,300
Your father must love you very much, right?

471
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,240
Although my dad isn't often around,

472
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,120
he's really good to me.

473
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,410
Ever since I was little,

474
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,700
he has never hit me

475
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,210
and has rarely scolded me.

476
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,230
Dad used to tell Mom,

477
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,400
"Girls,

478
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,440
should be pampered and cherished,

479
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,630
so they'll be loved when they grow up."

480
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:35,810
He's not around much?

481
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,120
My dad is a businessman,

482
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,860
so he's often away.

483
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,540
Since the war broke out two years ago,

484
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,140
it's become even harder to see him.

485
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,450
Now that the war's on,

486
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,210
letters don't come as frequently as they used to.

487
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,240
It's been a long time

488
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,300
since I received a letter from my dad.

489
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,080
What's your father's name?

490
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,800
What does he do for a living?

491
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,340
I can help you look for him.

492
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:01,690
Really?

493
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,070
That's great.

494
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,350
My dad's name is Mi Xingwei.

495
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,560
He's 48 years old

496
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,110
and does retail business in Shanghai.

497
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,710
Okay,

498
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,550
I've got it.

499
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,700
Once I find my dad,

500
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,130
I won't be afraid of anything anymore.

501
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,370
He will protect me.

502
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,430
Mi Lan.

503
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:21,960
You see,

504
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:24,830
Shanghai has now... fallen.

505
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,740
If something bad happens to your father...

506
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:28,830
That won't happen.

507
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,970
My dad is such a good person.

508
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,700
He will surely be blessed by the heavens.

509
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,340
Yes,

510
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,110
good people are blessed by the heavens.

511
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,500
I was talking nonsense.

512
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:41,230
But good people don't always have good luck.

513
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,830
Why do you say that?

514
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,920
Why curse my dad?

515
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:46,580
Mi Lan,

516
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,880
he was just talking nonsense too.

517
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,780
Don't take it personally.

518
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,180
That's just how he talks.

519
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,000
His words may not sound good, but he doesn't have bad intentions.

520
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,400
I didn't mean it that way.

521
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,360
I'm sorry.

522
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:01,800
Mi Lan,

523
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,670
look,

524
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,620
here's the candy we bought for you.

525
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:07,810
Thanks for looking after us these past few days.

526
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,410
Candy from Guanshengyuan?

527
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,300
Dad knows that I like candy.

528
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,630
Every time he comes back from a business trip,

529
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,030
he always brings me a box.

530
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,760
Where did you buy it?

531
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,680
We bought it from a candy shop.

532
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:37,170
The shops in Changsha have Guanshengyuan candy.

533
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,250
That means the transportation hasn't been completely cut off.

534
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,980
Dad could come back at any time.

535
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,290
That's great.

536
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,250
The war has started,

537
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,060
but

538
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,670
ordinary people still need to live their lives.

539
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,430
To live,

540
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,030
they'll inevitably need to buy things from department stores.

541
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,690
Dad is in the retail business.

542
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,910
This line of business can still continue.

543
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,150
Thinking about it this way,

544
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,750
Dad should be doing alright.

545
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:04,810
Thank you.

546
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,530
But what about you two?

547
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,140
What are you going to do next?

548
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,490
I'm guessing you can't go back home, right?

549
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:15,430
This hospital isn't safe for you either.

550
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,690
Where do you plan to go?

551
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,510
It's okay.

552
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,120
The world is vast.

553
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:21,640
We'll find our place somewhere.

554
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,120
You don't need to worry.

555
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,110
How about...

556
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,190
you stay at my place?

557
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,150
No, we can't.

558
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,970
You're a young lady, and we're two men.

559
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,700
It's not appropriate, not appropriate.

560
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,170
Just consider it

561
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,510
a thank-you gift for the candy you brought me.

562
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,970
But I'll say this upfront:

563
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,630
you can only sleep in the living room,

564
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,360
and the bedroom is off-limits.

565
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:53,730
How about it?

566
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,290
Have you two young masters made up your minds?

567
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,240
Well, thank you.

568
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,080
Thank you for having us.

569
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,090
Please come in.

570
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,900
My humble abode is simple,

571
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,630
nothing like your Yun Mansion.

572
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,280
Please make do with it.

573
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,280
No, no, not at all.

574
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,450
Having a place to stay at this time

575
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:21,670
is already very good.

576
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,470
Sorry for the disturbance.

577
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,430
Please, have a seat.

578
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:24,980
Okay.

579
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,400
Have you been living here all along?

580
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:33,530
No.

581
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:37,060
I used to live on Chayuan Lane.

582
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:41,430
Last year, a big fire burned down our house,

583
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,020
and my family was caught in this tragedy too.

584
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,350
So, I've moved here.

585
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,380
Mi Lan,

586
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,310
sorry.

587
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,920
We made you recall your painful memories.

588
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,930
It's okay.

589
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,120
Have a piece of candy.

590
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,250
Thank you.

591
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:10,780
Thanks.

592
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,000
My dad used to tell me,

593
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,010
"When you're feeling down,

594
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,490
just have a piece of candy,

595
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,890
and you'll feel better."

596
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,410
Give it a try.

597
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:23,950
Okay.

598
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,630
I'm much better.

599
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:41,670
Please make yourselves comfortable.

600
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,990
I'll go get two quilts for you.

601
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,790
Do you need any help with that?

602
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:46,510
Sure.

603
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,890
She went into the bedroom.

604
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,650
Why isn't there a single photo?

605
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,090
All of the family photos were burned in the fire.

606
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:19,820
But why doesn't she have any pictures of herself?

607
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:34,490
Mr. Yang,

608
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,580
you're finally here.

609
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,980
The Old Madam has been eagerly waiting for you.

610
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,110
Please, come in.

611
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,720
Mi Lan.

612
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,430
Let me do it.

613
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:54,830
I have more strength.

614
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,630
Thank you.

615
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:06,030
These two quilts haven't been used for a long time,

616
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,630
and the cotton filling has become a bit uneven.

617
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,239
Dad.

618
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,810
I've got the intelligence.

619
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,219
But...

620
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,120
I'll never have the chance

621
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,840
to fight alongside you anymore.

622
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,800
True foresight

623
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,860
cannot be sought from spirits and deities,

624
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,480
cannot be based on mimicking past events,

625
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,110
and cannot be verified through measurements alone,

626
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,500
but must be derived from understanding people.

627
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,590
No matter how splendid and dazzling the world before you appears,

628
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,710
don't forget,

629
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,270
this land before us

630
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,480
is our homeland.

631
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:12,070
Espionage work is tense,

632
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:12,970
thrilling,

633
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,210
and even tinged with a bloody romance.

634
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:17,190
But beneath that romantic veneer

635
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,150
lie deception,

636
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:18,950
conspiracy,

637
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:19,980
murder,

638
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,880
and betrayal.

639
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,160
Be cautious and careful when doing things,

640
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,710
rather than being reckless.

641
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:31,260
I know you're always prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice.

642
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,390
But sacrifice is not the hardest part.

643
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,440
The hardest part

644
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:37,090
is watching your comrades

645
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,820
sacrifice right in front of you.

646
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:43,880
I've never said these things

647
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,410
to you before.

648
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,320
But I've seen it all.

649
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,510
I know

650
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:49,830
your efforts

651
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,720
and determination.

652
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,910
I'm telling you this today because

653
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,670
I need you to stay alive.

654
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,810
From this telegram,

655
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,520
Yang Ziming realized

656
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:29,510
that the key person for the next phase of work in Changsha

657
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,980
was Kunwu.

658
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,510
This person had been lying low in Changsha for years,

659
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,550
remaining completely silent.

660
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,000
The fact that he was being activated now

661
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,060
surely meant there was a major conspiracy in the works.

662
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:53,830
Yang.

663
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:57,100
Based on all the information we have,

664
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,240
the person we're looking for

665
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,700
is in the NBIS in Changsha.

666
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,660
Qu Wenzhi's betrayal,

667
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,970
Yun Hongshen being hunted,

668
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:03,970
and Myna's death—

669
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:07,540
all of these must have been orchestrated by this person.

670
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,910
Even the sacrifice of Comrade Yun Muzhi

671
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,070
was highly likely

672
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,870
facilitated by this person.

673
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:14,690
This person must be eliminated.

674
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,110
I understand how you feel.

675
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,280
You treat Yun Hongshen like your own son

676
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:22,270
and don't want him to be in danger,

677
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,470
but he's already deep in it.

678
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,120
He's even gone further

679
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,910
than we imagined.

680
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:29,510
In our game

681
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,890
with this man,

682
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:33,560
someone must charge ahead.

683
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:35,880
Yun Hongshen

684
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,270
is the most suitable person for this.

685
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,810
Let me think it over.

686
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,450
Old Madam,

687
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,700
why haven't you turned on the lights?

688
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,010
Let me turn them on for you.

689
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:36,780
No need.

690
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,550
I've spent too long embroidering today.

691
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,920
My eyes are a bit sore.

692
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,380
The light would make it worse.

693
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,390
I told you to take a break,

694
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,810
but you wouldn't listen.

695
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,230
Jingyu,

696
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,650
you go ahead and have your meal.

697
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,960
I'm not hungry at all.

698
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,250
I'll go to bed early in a while.

699
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,240
Alright, then.

700
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,520
Call me if you get hungry.

701
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:03,450
Okay.

702
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,600
The stars are so beautiful tonight.

703
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,330
In the past, Shen and I

704
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,930
used to climb up to the roof to look at the stars.

705
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,990
Back then, Changsha was free from war

706
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:37,470
and gunpowder smoke.

707
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,270
The stars in the sky were clearer

708
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,210
and brighter than they are now.

709
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:46,500
We often fell asleep while stargazing

710
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:48,630
and then caught a cold.

711
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,480
Why didn't you ask him to come out with us?

712
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,180
I just saw that he was in a really bad mood.

713
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,450
He barely ate anything at dinner.

714
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,950
He can only

715
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:04,820
resolve his matters on his own.

716
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,460
Others can't help him,

717
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,810
even the family.

718
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,020
Then you still should have left him alone

719
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,340
in the room.

720
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,110
Being all by himself,

721
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,930
he might overthink things.

722
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,000
Forget it.

723
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,640
It's better to just let him rest by himself.

724
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,480
He's been in a bad mood lately,

725
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,680
feeling really down.

726
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,410
But in front of others, he still has to

727
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:27,270
pretend like everything's fine.

728
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,070
It pains me to see him like this.

729
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:31,070
I feel exhausted just watching him.

730
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,520
A shooting star!

731
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:52,450
What are you wishing for?

732
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,520
I wish...

733
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,280
I could switch places with him,

734
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,550
so I could bear his pain instead.

735
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:09,450
I didn't expect

736
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,270
you to be such a good big brother.

737
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,810
Are you envious?

738
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:17,590
A little.

739
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,200
When I was young, I really hoped

740
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,640
to have an older brother.

741
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,490
Instead, I have a younger brother.

742
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,490
That's why I really wished

743
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:29,490
I had an older brother to protect me,

744
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:31,170
especially

745
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:34,450
when I was scolded by my parents because of my brother.

746
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,590
But now,

747
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:39,420
I wish I could be scolded again because of my brother,

748
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,480
but I don't have that chance anymore.

749
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:51,340
Dad,

750
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,010
I've already crossed paths with Kunwu.

751
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,880
Someone got ahead of me.

752
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,920
They found Myna

753
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,980
and killed him.

754
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,710
The mastermind behind this is probably Kunwu.

755
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:06,550
I don’t want him pulling the strings.

756
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:09,310
I need to take the initiative

757
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:11,140
and make them show their flaws.

758
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,030
What should I do?

759
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,280
To be a perfect agent,

760
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:20,150
you must be more than just an executor of missions.

761
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:21,210
More importantly,

762
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:23,220
you need to be a strategist.

763
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:25,090
To achieve your goals,

764
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,760
you must control all the factors,

765
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,250
both known and unknown.

766
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,100
Because at this point,

767
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,140
your enemies

768
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,080
and allies

769
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,340
are all pieces in your game.

770
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:40,070
Right.

771
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,400
I need to set up a game.

772
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:46,670
I need to pull everyone

773
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:48,150
into my game.

774
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:52,970
[Flowers in the Mirror]

775
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,180
This is the cipher key.

776
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,480
There should also be a codebook.

777
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,290
I sent Kawashima back to that small inn again.

778
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,230
All of Myna's belongings are gone.

779
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,510
The innkeeper said

780
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:03,450
that the things were taken by two young people.
