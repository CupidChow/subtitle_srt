She's simply a fan of Miss Li, nothing more.

might have fallen into someone else's trap.

191
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,380
They wanted to lure and capture the assassin,

192
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,420
little did they know

193
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,620
that in others' eyes,

194
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,940
they are also

195
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,490
their prey for a long time.

196
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,570
Thinking about Wen Yeming

197
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,700
going alone to chase after the mysterious killer,

198
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,550
Yun Hongshen

199
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,370
couldn't help but feel anxious.

200
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,600
Hurry!

201
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,430
Catch Wen Yeming,

202
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,930
and you and Keiko can go home.

203
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:40,820
Are you alright?

204
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,790
What took you so long?

205
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,350
I'm sorry.

206
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,810
I was held up by something.

207
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,160
We heard gunshots from far away.

208
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:05,960
So it was you.

209
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,260
What's wrong?

210
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,050
Leader Wen,

211
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,200
you're injured.

212
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,520
Captain Tang,

213
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,810
arrest Li Miaohan now.

214
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,690
Call the station

215
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,490
to block all docks and stations.

216
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,450
Don't let Li Miaohan

217
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,850
or that assassin escape.

218
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,230
Do as he says.

219
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:20,970
Go!

220
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:22,750
Alright, alright.

221
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,310
Let's go.

222
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,040
Let's go.

223
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,440
Commander,

224
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,420
urgent telegram from Kunwu.

225
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,940
[Yun Hongshen has known the agents' dispatch plan. Please identify the leaks.]

226
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,510
Miss Kudo.

227
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:50,740
Doctor!

228
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,080
Doctor!

229
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,480
Someone is injured.

230
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,010
Quick, take her to surgery.

231
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,220
Dad!

232
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,890
[Supervision Division]

233
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,640
Next.

234
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:20,270
ID, please.

235
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,110
Wait a moment.

236
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,090
Next.

237
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:23,830
Go.

238
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:24,740
Thank you.

239
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,180
Yes.

240
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,710
I've executed Keiko.

241
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,350
Kawashima is missing.

242
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,990
I think Yun Hongshen's next plan

243
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,080
must be to get the cipher key

244
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,030
from Zong Fang.

245
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,430
Yes.

246
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,200
Who gave you permission to act on your own?

247
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,470
Who?

248
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,000
Speak up!

249
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
I'm sorry, Chief.

250
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,580
I was careless.

251
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,830
I'm willing to take full responsibility.

252
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,870
How are you going to take responsibility?

253
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:18,930
Li Miaohan is dead.

254
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,270
The assassin has disappeared.

255
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,790
Can you bring Li Miaohan back to life,

256
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,790
or can you find that assassin for me?

257
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,350
It was such an important operation.

258
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,470
But you didn't even apply or report it.

259
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,010
You think you're the only capable and skilled one

260
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,550
in the entire Hunan Station, huh?

261
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,610
If you're so capable,

262
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,740
go find the cipher key for me right now.

263
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,670
I promise it won't happen again.

264
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,930
What use is your worthless promise to me?

265
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:40,950
Tell me,

266
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:44,070
how are you going to make up for today's losses?

267
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:47,270
Speak up!

268
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,660
I've discovered a more valuable lead.

269
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,190
But I can't disclose it yet.

270
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:57,790
Fine.

271
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,990
Yun Hongshen, let me tell you this.

272
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,270
The next time I hear

273
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,830
the words "I can't disclose it,"

274
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,850
I want to see your results immediately.

275
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:07,910
Do you understand?

276
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:08,750
Also,

277
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,410
Hunan Station

278
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,410
is not a place for you to show off.

279
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,400
If you don't follow my rules,

280
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,950
you leave immediately.

281
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,600
I can still get the cipher key without you.

282
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:20,690
Is that clear?

283
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,610
Understood.

284
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,280
What's your opinion on this matter?

285
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,210
This afternoon,

286
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,120
Deputy Chief Zhu was out of my sight

287
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,430
for about half an hour.

288
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,700
You mean the surveillance on Li Miaohan

289
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,590
happened during this half-hour?

290
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,150
Regarding your speculation,

291
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,870
I neither confirm nor deny it.

292
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:53,490
I can only say that I don't have evidence yet.

293
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,940
Investigate quickly.

294
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,750
Clearly, this mole has gone mad.

295
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,240
He's risking exposure

296
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,550
just to kill those two.

297
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,230
It seems that what they were investigating

298
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,260
has touched a sensitive nerve.

299
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:04,020
Understood.

300
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,740
And what's the deal with this Zong Fang?

301
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,600
What role does he play in all this?

302
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,660
Don't worry about that.

303
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,520
I'll investigate it thoroughly.

304
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:30,470
Master,

305
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:31,230
how was it?

306
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,640
You didn't suffer in there, did you?

307
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,640
He wouldn't dare.

308
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,790
When I have the time,

309
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,930
I'll make Yun Hongqi pay.

310
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,260
Please, just calm down.

311
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:38,870
You all go ahead first.

312
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,610
Someone broke into your room last night.

313
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:45,890
Was anything stolen?

314
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,090
Nothing was taken,

315
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,320
but a page is missing.

316
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,270
The shipping record for July 2nd.

317
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,230
Extra! Extra!

318
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:57,930
Local socialite Li Miaohan mysteriously murdered late at night!

319
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,030
Extra! Extra!

320
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:04,950
Local socialite Li Miaohan mysteriously murdered late at night!

321
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,860
[Li Miaohan was killed late at night. A famous lady falls.]

322
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,510
There's no name of the shipper on this.

323
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,460
It's practically useless.

324
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,310
So we've been working for nothing?

325
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,670
Don't tell Shen yet.

326
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,060
We can't let this be for nothing.

327
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,910
We need to make it useful somehow.

328
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,750
Then, Young Master,

329
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,210
do you have any good ideas?

330
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:39,190
I was calm when facing him.

331
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,920
I wasn't afraid.

332
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,540
But whenever I think of

333
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,030
the person I'm looking for,

334
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,430
my whole body turns cold.

335
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,950
Shen has always been very brave.

336
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,760
Someone who can scare him

337
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,960
must be an extremely dangerous person.

338
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,510
We need to catch him as soon as possible.

339
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:55,390
This way, Shen

340
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,510
can get out of this situation.

341
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,140
Will this work?

342
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,260
If that person knows Zong Fang has been exposed,

343
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,060
he will definitely take action.

344
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:21,020
Then his true colors will be revealed.

345
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,460
Go find Huang for me.

346
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,720
Ask him to find an informant from the NBIS

347
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,670
and let that informant spread a message.

348
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:30,230
Alright.

349
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:36,350
Captain,

350
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,460
this is Liu.

351
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,430
When I cast my net,

352
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,920
it was quite heavy.

353
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,070
I was hoping for something good.

354
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:45,270
Thought today's catch would be decent.

355
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,510
Didn't expect it to be a dead body.

356
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,320
What bad luck.

357
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:54,750
When was the body

358
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,820
discovered?

359
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,880
[Taichang Restaurant]

360
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:02,650
Today,

361
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:04,960
that unfortunate guy fished out of the river

362
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,150
was Bai Qingkui's follower, Liu.

363
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,940
They're really bold,

364
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:10,370
daring to mess with Bai Qingkui's people.

365
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:11,830
Has the killer been found?

366
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:14,780
Come closer.

367
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,120
I heard

368
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,900
someone bribed Liu

369
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,650
to take Bai Qingkui's life.

370
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,860
But Bai Qingkui turned the tables and killed him.

371
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,500
Recently,

372
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,770
Bai Qingkui tried to kidnap the Old Madam of the Yun family.

373
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:27,980
Although he didn't succeed,

374
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,170
a grudge was formed.

375
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,490
The Yun family can't just let it go.

376
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,360
The Happy House was shut down for rectification.

377
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,130
It was the Eldest Young Master of the Yun family who pulled the strings.

378
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:37,990
Could Liu have been bribed by him?

379
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:41,280
It has nothing to do with the Eldest Young Master of the Yun family.

380
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,320
Bai Qingkui has done plenty of despicable things.

381
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,120
I heard

382
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,470
Bai Qingkui got dirt on an old client.

383
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,090
He pushed them too far.

384
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,520
Now they want to silence him.

385
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,100
Come on.

386
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:54,670
Come on.

387
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,020
Hello.

388
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,650
Don't say it over the phone.

389
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,780
I'll be right there.

390
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,560
Ling Han?

391
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:43,900
Just leave.

392
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,220
You can speak here.

393
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,260
If you feel this place isn't suitable,

394
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,190
I can also take you to the NBIS's interrogation room

395
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,190
for a little tour.

396
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,040
No.

397
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,870
I'm not going to the NBIS.

398
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:17,740
I'll talk.

399
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,290
What should I say?

400
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,580
Why did Bai Qingkui kill Liu?

401
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,850
Liu was disloyal.

402
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,020
He was bought off.

403
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,480
He wanted to kill Boss Bai.

404
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,880
Who bought him off?

405
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,300
I think it was...

406
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:31,880
Zong Fang.

407
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:32,690
Yes,

408
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,690
Zong Fang bought him off.

409
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,850
[Zong ships goods via waterway, July 2nd]

410
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:28,750
Hello.

411
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,090
Shen,

412
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:30,970
it's me.

413
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,370
I have something important to tell you.

414
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:34,170
Come out right now.

415
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:34,900
I'm outside.

416
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:35,780
Okay.

417
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:36,940
Give me two minutes.

418
00:29:59,430 --> 00:29:59,890
Hongqi.

419
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:03,530
Go ahead.

420
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,510
I've found that person.

421
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,040
Who?

422
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,230
The person you've been looking for.

423
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,360
How did you find him?

424
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,190
I've already got Bai Qingkui's ledger.

425
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,550
But that old fox is too cunning.

426
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,860
It only recorded the shipping times and prices.

427
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,720
There were no names of the owners.

428
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:20,100
Hongqi,

429
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,020
what have you done?

430
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:22,820
Nothing much.

431
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,570
I just added the character "Zong" to it.

432
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,080
And then?

433
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:27,970
Then,

434
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:31,100
I had NBIS informants spread a rumor.

435
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:31,810
It said that

436
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:32,860
this Bai Qingkui

437
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,330
had dirt on one of his old clients.

438
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,950
This old client, to protect himself,

439
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,750
had no choice but to silence him.

440
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,160
Ling Han went to Happy House.

441
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,610
He's probably already got

442
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,010
what he wanted.

443
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,170
I never thought

444
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,530
that person would be Ling Han.

445
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,530
No wonder when you were tailing him before,

446
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,970
you were targeted for assassination by the Japanese.

447
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:58,620
I heard this guy has made quite a few achievements.

448
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,410
He's really good at hiding.

449
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:01,140
He's hidden himself very well.

450
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,660
What's wrong with you?

451
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,190
After this is over,

452
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,360
do you have any plans?

453
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,420
Are you still going to stay with NBIS?

454
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,120
Who told you to do that?

455
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,570
Who gave you permission?

456
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,170
Who are you to act on your own?

457
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,030
I...

458
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,240
How am I acting on my own?

459
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,540
Isn't this all for you?

460
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,940
The sooner we expose this person,

461
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,470
the earlier you can get out.

462
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:27,070
Hongqi,

463
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,590
do you think you can fool Ling Han?

464
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,200
Do you know who he is?

465
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,470
Even Ke Jingping has to respect him.

466
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,810
You're no match for him when it comes to mind games.

467
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,770
If you don't want to get me killed,

468
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,180
don't meddle in this anymore.

469
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,140
I...

470
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:54,600
Hello, Chief.

471
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,800
This is Yun Hongshen.

472
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:56,700
I have some information

473
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,760
that I need to report to you in person.

474
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,650
Wait a moment.

475
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:02,710
Director Ling and I have important matters to discuss.

476
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:03,250
Okay.

477
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,550
It's too late.

478
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,120
Ling Han has already started to act.

479
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,090
Yun Hongshen knew

480
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,930
the only thing he could do now

481
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:16,510
was to find loopholes in Ling Han's actions.

482
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,880
Fortunately, he had already told Yun Hongqi to back off.

483
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,520
As long as he doesn't act rashly again,

484
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,760
he won't fall into Ling Han's trap.

485
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,450
July 2nd,

486
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,200
the day Qu Wenzhi defected.

487
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,510
Through this record,

488
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:31,280
it seems we can draw a conclusion.

489
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,610
Zong Fang is the person behind Li Miaohan.

490
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:34,860
In that case,

491
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,850
Zong Fang's rank in the Japanese spy network in Changsha

492
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:37,910
must be quite high.

493
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,860
It can even be said to be very high.

494
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,210
However, this character "Zong"

495
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,940
was clearly added afterwards.

496
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,840
It is possible that someone may have framed him.

497
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,270
It's that mole again, right?

498
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:47,740
Yes.

499
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:50,360
Our investigation is progressing step by step.

500
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,260
That mole must have sensed danger.

501
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,660
So he bribed Liu to assassinate Bai Qingkui

502
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,740
and then framed Zong Fang for it.

503
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,440
Of course,

504
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,380
the possibility that Zong Fang is a Japanese spy is still high.

505
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,580
Do you have any plans?

506
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,410
My plan is divided into two steps.

507
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,550
They will be carried out simultaneously.

508
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,540
We can verify two people separately.

509
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,070
Step one,

510
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,250
I will find Bai Qingkui's hiding place

511
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,330
and have someone secretly monitor him.

512
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,650
Since the assassination of Bai Qingkui failed,

513
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,330
the mole will definitely try again

514
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:18,190
to eliminate any future trouble.

515
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,050
Step two,

516
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,970
I will find a way to make Li Miaohan come back to life.

517
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:22,830
She's not dead.

518
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:23,960
She was revived.

519
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,290
I believe

520
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,620
Zong Fang

521
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:28,010
and her lover

522
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,580
will both be very interested in this news.

523
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,680
Very good.

524
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:32,940
Killing two birds with one stone.

525
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,600
Let's proceed with your plan.

526
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:35,660
Chief,

527
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,060
I have a request.

528
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:37,590
Go ahead.

529
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:38,930
For this operation,

530
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,990
I want to complete it independently.

531
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,980
Actually, there's no need for that.

532
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,010
We just need to let as few as people

533
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,370
know about this action.

534
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:47,800
You have to leave space

535
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,340
for the mole to take actions.

536
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,670
If we hide it from him,

537
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,240
how can he take actions?

538
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:55,210
Yeming

539
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,980
is still in the hospital.

540
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,730
Have Yun Hongshen assist you.

541
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,490
This operation is crucial.

542
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:02,210
We can't be careless.

543
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,550
I know Yun Hongshen

544
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,590
has some issues of his own,

545
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,179
but his abilities are still very strong.

546
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:12,969
As you know,

547
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:14,699
people with strong abilities

548
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,360
usually have a bit of a temper.

549
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,750
You should understand this.

550
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:21,850
I will obey the order.

551
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,830
The operation has two objectives.

552
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:33,230
First,

553
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,739
to verify Zong Fang's identity.

554
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:35,230
Second,

555
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:37,280
to lure and capture Li Miaohan's accomplices.

556
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,170
The entire operation is divided into three phases.

557
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:39,929
Phase one,

558
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,170
draw the snake out of its hole.

559
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:41,870
I will find a way

560
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,080
to spread the news that Li Miaohan is still alive.

561
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:44,920
Phase two,

562
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,880
I will personally go to a private clinic

563
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,830
to pick up a person

564
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,840

568

576

Ling Han's investigation has led to Bai Qingkui.

This fact makes Zhu He very anxious.

614
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,180
It's time to sever ties with Bai Qingkui.

But how to cut it off and when to cut it off

616
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,260
became a difficult problem.

Under the current circumstances,

if he acts rashly,

00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,930

But it's impossible for him to remain inactive.

that Ling Han is following so closely

640

while he himself was completely unaware.

641
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,540
Perhaps Ling Han has already

642
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,270
uncovered many of his secrets.

643
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,120
He can't hesitate any longer.
