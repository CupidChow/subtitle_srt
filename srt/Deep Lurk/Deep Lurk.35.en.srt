Go in.

The safe.

5
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:23,390
Open it.

6
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,230
Put the gun down.

7
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,440
Just give up.

8
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:36,020
You won't succeed.

9
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,630
Since I'm here today,

10
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,230
I have no intention of leaving here alive.

11
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,630
Yun Hongshen, shoot!

12
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,510
I order you to shoot her!

13
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,620
Shut up! Shut up!

14
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,950
They want to destroy the codebook

15
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,410
and make the information disappear completely!

16
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,350
I will never leave you the information!

17
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,660
Shoot! Don't mind me!

18
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,550
Shoot!

19
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,280
No one can stop us…

20
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:34,990
Chief.

21
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:35,910
Are you okay?

22
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,260
A bunch of trash!

23
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,829
Even if everyone in the station withdraws,

24
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:41,140
such a mistake is not allowed to happen!

25
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,700
How did that woman get in?

26
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,340
It's my fault, Chief.

27
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,350
Let me tell you.

28
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,030
If this woman blew up the codebook,

29
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,980
all of us would have to face the consequences!

30
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,190
Chief,

00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,030
have some water.

32
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,910
Put it there.

33
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,190
Didn't you go

34
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,350
to the "bank" today?

35
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,490
I felt something was wrong, so I came back.

36
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,149
What was wrong?

37
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,520
Ling Han was a smart lunatic.

38
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,150
At the last moment,

39
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,870
he might go for a risky move

40
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,590
and do something crazy.

41
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,630
I don't trust him.

42
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,830
Nor do I believe in coincidence.

43
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,510
Director Ji saw Mi Lan

44
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,270
near the "bank."

45
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,020
It was most probably arranged by someone.

46
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,940
So their real target is our station.

47
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,230
Yes.

48
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,350
I didn't expect

49
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,750
they would actually have the ability

50
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,530
to hide Mi Lan in the vehicle delivering the direction finder.

51
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,390
When Ling Han was alive,

52
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,110
he was the Director's favorite.

53
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,110
It was not impossible for him to tamper with it.

54
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,950
Today, they came

55
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,430
to the station to destroy the codebook,

56
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,030
That means

57
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,470
the "bank" is safe.

58
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,470
Where's Wen Yeming?

59
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,190
Where did she go?

60
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,080
Why hasn't she returned yet?

61
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,030
Hello?

62
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,650
What?

63
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,950

We found where they hid the radio.

67
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,909
Unfortunately, the radio has been transferred.

68
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,630
They ran away.

69
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,990
How could the radio be left behind?

70
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,030
Keep searching.

71
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:04,540
Yes.

72
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,670
It seems to be gunpowder.

73
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,390
The magnifier.

74
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,120
It is indeed gunpowder.

You...

76
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,330
Take these two pieces of clothes back to the station.

77
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,940

I'm a good citizen.

84
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,750
About what my daughter-in-law did,

85
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,910
I had no idea at all!

86
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,910
Do you know where Xu Zhaodi went?

87
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,550
Last night, she said

88
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,070
she was going to a distant cousin's place

89
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,320
to attend her wedding banquet,

90
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,990
so she asked me to check on this place.

91
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,670
During the time after she came back,

92
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,150
has she been in contact with anyone?

93
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,500
Or did anyone come to see her?

94
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,870
I don't…

95
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,030
I don't think so.

96

Yes.

100

The old shopboy stole from us.

101
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,950
I found out

102
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,430
and fired him.

103
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,870
This guy

104
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,150
has only been here for a few days.

Don't be nervous.

You just need to tell us clearly,

121
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,070
and we'll send you back.

122
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,030
Really?

123
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,950
I promise.

124
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:23,710
Okay.

125
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:24,920

126
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:25,910
Get more people

127
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,310
to take all the people who've seen this shopboy

128
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,350
back to the station.

129
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,710
Ask the portrait artist to draw a clear picture.

130
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,250
Yes.

131
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,870
Come with me, please.

132
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:33,419
Okay.

133
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,710
Where is Zong Fang?

134
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,230
What's his mission?

135
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,150
Where is he now?

136
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,040
The more you say,

137
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,790
the more likely you'll live.

138
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,950
My patience is limited.

139
00:08:59,310 --> 00:08:59,840
Say it.

140
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,310
What's wrong?

141
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,350
What's going on?

142
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:33,810
Director.

143
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,710
The portrait is out.

144
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,750
Yes, it's him.

145
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,860
That's strange.

146
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,470
Why is he covered by so much gunpowder?

147
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,350
Yun Hongshen was filled with regret and frustration.

148
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,950
Not only did he fail to catch Mi Lan alive,

149
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,970
but he also caused Wen Yeming's injury.

150
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,610
His first head-on battle with Kunwu

151
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,830
turned into a fiasco.

[In operation]

Yun Hongshen is cold inside.

154
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,130
The person in front of him

155
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,420
is too good at stabbing others' weaknesses.

156
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,510
He's also very calculating.

157
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,790
It's fine that he hasn't made a move,

158
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:13,240
but whenever he makes a move, it'll be fatal.

159
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,470
And he has no feelings.

160
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,470
Even Wen Yeming, who has been with him for ten years,

161
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,430
is nothing but a pawn

162
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,630
that can be abandoned at any time.

163
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,310
He's like a precise

164
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,470
killing machine without weaknesses.

165
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:28,980
Just thinking about

166
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,220
such an opponent

167
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,910
makes people fear.

168
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:42,470
Doctor.

169
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,120
How is she?

170
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,070
The bullet is removed.

171
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,390
The wound has been stitched up.

172
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,910
She'd better rest for a while.

173
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,070
Don't do strenuous exercise.

174
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,790
Otherwise, the wound wouldn't heal well,

175
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,550
which would affect the flexibility of the left hand.

176
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,790
Okay.

177
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,510
Thank you.

178
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,310
Yeming.

Chief.

180
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,780
The woman named Xu Zhaodi confessed.

181
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,230
But before the Deputy Chief finished the interrogation,

182
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,710
she died with blood coming from her eyes, ears, nostrils, and mouth.

183
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:06,870
You stay here.

184
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,750
I'll go back first.

185
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,110
I'm sorry.

186
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,410
I misjudged the situation.

187
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,750
I thought the bank was safe.

188
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,070
It's all my fault.

189
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,360
The original intention of both of us

190
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,670
was to prevent each other from being in danger.

191
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:29,990
Now,

192
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,720
I've got what I wanted.

193
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,310
It's all my fault.

194
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,380
You talk too much.

195
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,130
It makes my head ache.

196
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,930
Okay, I won't say it anymore.

197
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,360
[Emergency Room]

198
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:52,840
Chief.

199
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,230
Come and have a look.

200
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,670
She was poisoned by arsenic trioxide.

201
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,400
Her wig

202
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,380
and the cosmetics she used to disguise herself

203
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,310
were mixed with a lot of arsenic.

204
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,510
Before the torture,

205
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,390
arsenic was just seeping

206
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,790
into her body through her skin.

207
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,270
It was spreading slowly,

208
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,350
so she wouldn't die right away.

209
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,590
But after the torture,

210
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,510
she started bleeding.

211
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,960
After being splashed with water,

212
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,580
the remaining arsenic went into her mouth.

213
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,040
She died soon.

214
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,880
Ling Han, that rascal, still haunts us!

215
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,510
He's causing me trouble even when he's dead.

216
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,550
I've been looking forward to the direction finder for a long time.

217
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,990
I've written many reports to apply for it.

218
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,510
I pulled my strings everywhere.

219
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,750
When it was finally coming,

220
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,340
he squeezed Mi Lan in the vehicle!

221
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,710
Despicable!

222
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,120
What are you thinking?

223
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,570
Say something!

224
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:49,820
-Chief.
-Chief.

225
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:57,870
Deputy Chief.

226
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,510
Sit.

227
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,470
Let's begin.

228
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,560
Here.

229
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,950
Xu Zhaodi has confessed.

230
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,350
She is that "Mister."

231
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,510
The code of today's operation is "Breaking Jade."

232
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,950
It was arranged by Ling Han beforehand

233
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,030
and executed by Mi Lan.

234
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,070
The suspicious radio wave that appeared this morning

235
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,190
was indeed sent by her radio station.

236
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,650
Its purpose was to report to the superiors for the last time.

237
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,230
What does "for the last time" mean?

238
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,160
Xu Zhaodi and her gang were ready

239
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,630
to die together with us.

240
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,670
Die together.

241
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,350
Ridiculous.

242
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,550
She was not even afraid of death,

243
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,700
but she was afraid of torture?

244
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,190
Chief, I don't know about that.

245
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,600
Maybe people are all like this.

246
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,110
You may be willing to die

247
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,630
at the hands of the enemy.

248
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,790
But being killed by your own comrades

249
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,230
may make you full of resentment.

250
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,230
Since she was not dead, she wanted to live.

251
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,910
How did she die?

252
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,030
She was poisoned.

253
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,870
It must be her accomplice that poisoned her,

254
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,710
and she didn't know.

255
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,670
If she could continue,

256
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,430
we'd know Zong Fang's whereabouts and mission.

257
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,790
Zong Fang's mission…

258
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,350
Zong Fang…

259
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,630
If you have something to say, say it!

260
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,390
Chief, here's the thing.

261
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:14,750
This is...

262
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,070
the Japanese spy who went to the bank to execute the mission

263
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,350
with Xu Zhaodi today,

264
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,990
which was also her new employee.

265
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,830
These are two pieces of clothes I found at the warehouse of

266
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,190
Xu Zhaodi's cloth store, which is also where he lived.

267
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,630
He took them off

268
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,010
and still hadn't had a chance to wash them.

269
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,150
This is a picture of the different parts of his body.

270
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,070
His hair, ears,

271
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,240
and nails.

272
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,630
These are the shoes he wore today.

273
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,830
His clothes, shoes, hair, ears,

274
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,710
and nails

275
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,030
all have some explosives powder.

276
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:41,750
I went to check

277
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,350
other Japanese spies' bodies and clothes.

278
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,630
There was no such trace.

279
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,070
He's the only exception.

280
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,430
What does that mean?

281
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,430
I think

282
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:55,310
it should be related to Zong Fang's mission.

283
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,350
Because the only explanation is that he had handled

284
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,550
a lot of gunpowder.

285
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,870
But why did he have exposure to a large quantity of gunpowder?

286
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,210
And what is the use of all this gunpowder?

287
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,310
Keep investigating.

288
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,080
Also, keep searching for Zong Fang.

289
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,620
Okay.

290
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,150
Everyone,

291
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,540
this morning, the Commander called me

292
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,510
and pressured me to find the cipher key as soon as possible.

293
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,140
It's an urgent situation.

294
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,870
The sooner we find the cipher key,

295
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,950
the fewer soldiers

296
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,590
will be sacrificed on the battlefield.

297
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,440
Time is running out.

298
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,720
The situation is not optimistic.

299
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,120
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

300
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,390
Yes.

301
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:30,750
Chief,

302
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,790
should we call Yun Hongshen back?

303
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,990
In this situation,

304
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,890
he can't indulge in romance.

305
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,590
Give him some more time.

306
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,140
If he doesn't come back before work in the afternoon,

307
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,120
go and get him back.

308
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,720
Okay.

309
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,510
I don't think Ling Han

310
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,380
was truly in love wtih Wen Yeming.

311
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,470
In order to get the codebook,

312
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,830
he even tried to kill her.

313
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,380
That is not love.

314
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,110
He showed no mercy at all.

315
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,990
But Yun Hongshen

316
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,310
is truly in love with Wen Yeming.

317
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,500
When he heard that something had happened to Wen Yeming,

318
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,920
he didn't even feel like working.

319
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,069
It seems that

320
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,470
true love is indeed different from fake love.

321
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,270
Anything else?

322
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:21,810
No.

323
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:22,869
Me, either.

324
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:23,930
Let's go.

325
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,180
Here, have some water.

326
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:42,910
Enough?

327
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,130
Okay.

328
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,350
I didn't expect you to be so thoughtful

329
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,390
and so good at looking after people.

330
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,260
You don’t seem like yourself.

331
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,750
Let me find you a safe place to recuperate.

332
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,180
Okay?

333
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,320
Isn't it safe here?

334
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,350
There are so many people in the hospital.

335
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:05,790
It's not good for your recovery.

336
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,950
I'll find you a quiet place.

337
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,830
Take a good rest for a while.

338
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,120
Promise me.

339
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:14,990
What's wrong?

340
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,680
Is there something wrong?

341
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:20,850
Say something.

342
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,310
What exactly happened?

343
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,150
Let's talk about it later.

344
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,070
Tell me now.

345
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,020
I can take it.

346
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:28,720
No.

347
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:29,870
It's really nothing.

348
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,020
Is it safe to talk now?

349
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:38,880
Yes.

350
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,390
There's no bug in this room.

351
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,270
Tell me the truth.

352
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,290
What are you hiding from me?

353
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:50,950
Don't make excuses.

354
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,630
I want the truth.

355
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,510
Then, let's make a deal.

356
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,150
No matter what you hear,

357
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,790
don't get angry.

358
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,870
Don't get worked up, okay?

359
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,430
I'll try my best.

360
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,390
I've read the letter Kunwu wrote to his family.

361
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,930
He had a wife and children in Japan.

362
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,350
And then?

363
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,110
Ling Han liked you.

364
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,190
Do you know that?

365
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,480
Are you trying to say

366
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,430
that the fact that he liked me

367
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,500
and the fact that he had a wife and children in Japan

368
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,040
are contradictory?

369
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,000
So,

370
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,980
he might not be Kunwu.

371
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:29,880
Right?

372
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,080
Yes.

373
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,210
If he was not Kunwu,

374
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,670
the most likely person…

375
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,340
is…

376
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,630
I know.

377
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,380
I know you won't make wild guesses.

378
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,790
You must have your reasons.

379
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,030
What is it?

380
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,910
I learned through a reliable way that

381
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,560
Ling Han was not Japanese.

382
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,450
What reliable way?

383
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:00,810
Yang Ziming?

384
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,570
Your Organization told you through him?

385
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,920
Today is a good day.

386
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,630
The person I love

387
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:27,270
admitted that he was a Communist in front of me.

388
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,350
And he told me

389
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,310
that the person I treated as my older brother

390
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,990
and my teacher

391
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,590
was Kunwu;

392
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,950
he was my enemy.

393
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,670
If I knew this would happen,

394
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,670
I'd rather have that bullet

395
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,700
hit my heart

396
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,190
and end everything.

397
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:56,870
I don't believe it.

398
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,830
I don't believe it.

399
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,330
He can't be.

400
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,200
He can't be.

401
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,890
He can't be! He can't be!

402
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,410
He can't be…

403
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,320
Yeming,

404
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,040
calm down.

405
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,040
Calm down.

406
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,290
How can I calm down?

407
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:14,800
How can I calm down?

408
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,450
I trust him the most.

409
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,430
He saved me.

410
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:20,970
He provided for my schooling

411
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:21,960
and took me into the industry.

412
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,330
He taught me how to be a qualified agent.

413
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,050
Now, you want me to suspect him?

414
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,090
I can't.

415
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:28,850
I can't. I can't!

416
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,760
-Of course I can't!
-I understand.

417
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:31,690
I understand.

418
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:32,770
I know you can't do it.

419
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,600
I understand.

420
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,520
If someone tells me

421
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,280
that my father is a traitor,

422
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,510
I won't accept it, either.

423
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,510
I won't even believe it, right?

424
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:41,770
I understand.

425
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,240
But look at me.

426
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,450
Look at my eyes.

427
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:46,850
Look at me.

428
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,560
No matter how hard it is for us to accept it,

429
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,050
we should still face the reality.

430
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,570
Because it concerns

431
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,860
a city and countless innocent lives

432
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,450
We are not just ourselves.

433
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,410
We are also Chinese.

434
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,280
In less than a month,

435
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,160
I have lost two close family members.

436
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:24,800
I know…

437
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,860
how it feels to lose someone you care about.

438
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:31,740
If possible,

439
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,680
I'm willing to bear

440
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,930
all the pains myself.

441
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,390
But I know it's just a hope.

442
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,850
In this world, many things

443
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,750
cannot be controlled by our will.

444
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:55,440
I'm leaving.

445
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,000
I'll visit you tonight.

446
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,320
Director Qin of the Technical Investigation Division said

447
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,010
these things

448
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,290
were residues of an ointment to cure eczema.

449
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,200
The ointment hasn't coagulated for long.

450
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,640
It must have got on recently.

451
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,810
Does every store have this kind of ointment?

452
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:35,840
No.

453
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,650
Only a few big pharmacies have it.

454
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,330
Then, I don't think he bought it.

455
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,440
He must have stolen it.

456
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,210
Go check if any of the big pharmacies

457
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,240
have lost drugs recently.

458
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,040
Besides, in order to cover up,

459
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,520
he must have stolen some other medicines.

460
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,170
But these medicines are worthless.

461
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,040
It's not worth calling the police.

462
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,850
He must have stolen cotton balls,

463
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:51,850
iodine, and that sort of thing.

464
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:52,840
Go take a look.

465
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,030
Yes.

466
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,890
Zong Fang.

467
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,140
Where are you?

468
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:16,970
Come in.

469
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,050
Sit.

470
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:25,570
How is she?

471
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:28,890
Much better.

472
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,480
She's just a bit down.

473
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:33,330
Maybe it's because she's been too nervous recently.

474
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,810
That kid has been in a lot of trouble this year.

475
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,690
Sometimes, I want to go to the temple

476
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,210
to pray to Buddha for her.

477
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,240
Do you believe in that?

478
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:46,640
People like us…

479
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:49,220
Our hands are covered with blood.

480
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:50,850
Praying to Buddha

481
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,800
is just a psychological comfort.

482
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,010
Alright, let's not talk about this.

483
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,690
Xu Zhaodi has confessed,

484
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,650
but she didn't know Zong Fang's whereabouts

485
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,270
or Ling Han's plan.

486
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,570
The people we sent out

487
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,420
haven't found Zong Fang yet.

488
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,490
I want to hear your opinion now.

489
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,320
Now,

490
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,760
I have completely no idea.

491
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:15,840
You promised me

492
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,630
you'd find the cipher key in three days.

493
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:19,840
But now,

494
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,960
half of the time has passed.

495
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:23,730
I know.

496
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,570
But now,

497
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,760
I really can't figure out where Zong Fang is hiding

498
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,410
or what he wants to do next.

499
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,440
Aren't you good at reasoning?

500
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,980
I thought I knew Ling Han very well.

501
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,450
But now, I realize

502
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:39,720
I don't know him well enough.

503
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,970
He sent someone to snipe at Wen Yeming.

504
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,590
This is totally beyond my expectations.

505
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,590
That's why I'm confused now.

506
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,520
I'm hesitant to make any assumptions right now.

507
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,530
Think about it.

508
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,390
Think about it carefully.

509
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:56,890
Chief.

510
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,240
I would like to hear your opinion.

511
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,890
My opinion is simple.

512
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,120
Ling Han was a person who didn't give up easily.

513
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,760
What he did today by going to every expedient

514
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,270
has proved that.

515
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,450
He's dead.

516
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,140
How could he go to every expedient?

517
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,450
And his best assistant,

518
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:17,730
Mi Lan died, too.

519
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,140
Now, only Zong Fang is left.

520
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,670
Do you mean…

521
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,200
he might arrange

522
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,900
a crazier mission for Zong Fang

523
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,430
to get the codebook at all costs?

524
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,060
Isn't that reasoning?

525
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:33,930
This is reasoning.

526
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,060
This is a deduction.

527
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,970
Did you forget all that?

528
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,490
Yun Hongshen.

529
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,340
I want to tell you,

530
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,360
as an agent,

531
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,530
no matter when it is,

532
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,070
you can't forget your mission.

533
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,690
And you can't panic.

534
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,330
If you panic,

535
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,080
you won't hurt yourself

536
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,240
but many people.

537
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,610
I know what happened today is a big blow to you.

538
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,830
I really hope you can pull yourself together.

539
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,290
Otherwise, all of Wen Yeming's suffering will be in vain.

540
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,370
There was a moment that

541
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,480
Yun Hongshen also hoped that

542
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,300
the information the Organization got was not accurate.

543
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,910
He hoped that Ling Han was Kunwu

544
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:14,360
and that mentor in front of him,

545
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,460
who was tolerant and strict at the same time,

546
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:17,540
was really just the Chief working at the NBIS,

547
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,440
someone deserves to be respected and followed

548
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,830
by Wen Yeming.

549
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,000
But Yun Hongshen knew very well

550
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,540
that it was just an illusion.

551
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:31,370
I'm sorry, Chief.

552
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,880
I was thinking about something.

553
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,790
What were you thinking?

554
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:35,600
I was thinking about

555
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,810
how Ling Han would make a desperate move.

556
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,130
Have you figured it out?

557
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:44,650
I really don't understand the logic of a lunatic.

558
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,650
At the end of the day, the logic of a lunatic is simple.

559
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,880
He will do anything

560
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,230
and be carried to the extreme.

561
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:02,870
Hello, it's me.

562
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:07,760
What?

563
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:09,640
Chief!

564
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,400
I know what Zong Fang's mission is.

565
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,090
He wants to make a big explosion.

566
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,240
These two days,

567
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:15,200
the mine in the suburbs

568
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,690
and the fireworks factory in the west of the city

569
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,810
have lost about 20 kilograms of explosives.

570
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:19,690
And someone also bought

571
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,330
explosives and detonators on the black market.

572
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,950
But it's hard to keep track of that.

573
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,130
I think

574
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,900
Zong Fang has at least

575
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:28,610
30 kilograms of explosives.

576
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,550
Get all the agents outside the station back.

577
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,170
Now, the most important task for us

578
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,040
is to find these detonators and explosives.

579
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:34,940
And Zong Fang.

580
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,610
You're in charge of this mission.

581
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,750
Go and cooperate with him.

582
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:41,440
Yes.

583
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,350
Yes.

584
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,050
Go!

585
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,020
Okay.

586
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,690
The so-called large-scale explosion

587
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,010
should be a way for Ke Jingping to force himself

588
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,590
to find the cipher key as soon as possible.

589
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:00,720
If he doesn't go look for it,

590
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:03,210
the explosion will definitely happen.

591
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,090
Then, it will endanger

592
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,750
the lives of countless innocent people.

593
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,720
But if he goes to look for it

594
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,960
and finds it,

595
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,990
then it means the information

596
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,700
will be sent to Xue Yue

597
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,240
at the fastest speed.

598
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,230
To prove this is fake information,

599
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,360
he must prove that Ke Jingping is Kunwu.

600
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,290
But the problem is

601
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,320
Yun Hongshen has no evidence at all.

602
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,680
Why don't I believe it?

603
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,250
[Detailed Map of the Capital of Hunan Province and Its Surroundings]

604
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,840
Zong Fang is now wanted by us.

605
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,930
It's inconvenient for him to move around.

606
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:40,170
So the place he makes bombs

607
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,530
and stores the explosives

608
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:42,690
won't be too far from the city center.

609
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,370
It's probably close to his target.

610
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,210
He got so many explosives.

611
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,130
I don't think he wants to blow up the NBIS.

612
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:49,800
I guess

613
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,530
he wants to

614
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,580
cause panic in the city

615
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,850
and mess up the situation in Changsha.

616
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:56,610
And his main target

617
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:57,730
should be

618
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:58,650
banks,

619
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,390
schools, hospitals,

620
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,620
and the government departments, etc.

621
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:02,450
And these

622
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,100
will be the main direction of your investigation.

623
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:05,970
As for Zong Fang,

624
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:06,930
you can initiate a thorough search,

625
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,970
using the location of his last clothing item

626
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:09,910
as the center.

627
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,980
See if there are any other witnesses

628
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:15,050
or any buses or rickshaws.

629
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:15,760
Director Gong,

630
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,920
do you have anything else to add?

631
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,000
That's all?

632
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,880
Nothing else?

633
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,140
That's all for now.

634
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,390
Wait.

635
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,770
Weren't you thinking about

636
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,920
where Zong Fang would hide?

637
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:28,930
Then, what?

638
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,680
Didn't you figure it out?

639
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:31,670
No.

640
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,610
But Zong Fang has been exposed for so long,

641
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,010
and we couldn't find him.

642
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,670
This means he's very good at hiding.

643
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,660
However,

644
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,370
Deputy Chief Zhu

645
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,100
has asked Chen Dongping to check the pharmacies.

646
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:45,600
Then,

647
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,530
when she's back,

648
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,780
we might find some more useful clues.

649
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:50,690
So, you mean

650
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:52,320
the only thing we can do

651
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,410
is wait.

652
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:54,690
You can't say that.

653
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,520
We can split up.

654
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:57,560
On the one hand,

655
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,640
let them look for it.

656
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,560
If they can find a clue about the bomb

657
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,000
or Zong Fang,

658
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,680
it will be very helpful to us.

659
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:05,720
On the other hand,

660
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,570
let's continue to gather information here.

661
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,610
Maybe we can get some clues

662
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,330
that strongly suggest the right direction.

663
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,330
That's new.

664
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,210
I've never heard you say that.

665
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:16,430
It sounded pretty solid.

666
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,960
In fact, you didn't say anything substantial.

667
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,730
Looks like you're really not yourself.

668
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:22,960
Alright.

669
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,280
Do as Leader Yun says.

670
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,200
What are you waiting for? Hurry up.

671
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:27,660
Yes!

672
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,330
Yes.

673
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:29,670
Go.

674
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,090
Director Gong,

675
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,360
I need to go to the toilet.

676
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,170
I'll be going then.

677
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,100
Go now.

678
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,170
Don't get sick.

679
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,980
No wonder the Chief asked me to take charge of this operation.

680
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:42,570
Something is wrong with him.

681
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:44,530
No idea.

682
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,050
Why do I feel

683
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:48,190
you're not positive about this operation?

684
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:51,730
Liu Chao.

685
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,130
Sir.

686
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:53,740
Follow me.

687
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:54,490
What is it?

688
00:32:59,090 --> 00:32:59,670
Sir.

689
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,160
What is it?

690
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:01,990
Come in.

691
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,440
Find a chance to stay here later.

692
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,270
Keep an eye on Chen Dongping.

693
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,850
If she comes back to the station,

694
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,480
let me know immediately.

695
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:15,710
What?

696
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:17,720
I see.

697
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,560
Director.

698
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:24,110
Were you whispering here?

699
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,590
I know.

700
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,410
You were giving him a special favor

701
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:28,690
to instruct him.

702
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,010
As a superior, you can't be so biased.

703
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:32,890
Liu Chao.

704
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:33,730
Tell me.

705
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,530
What did you understand just now?

706
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,280
I didn't instruct him.

707
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,200
I wanted to ask him for a small favor.

708
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:41,700
Forget it.

709
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,110
Go back to work.

710
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:46,260
I'll get going then.

711
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,520
Director, I'm leaving.

712
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:50,690
Director,

713
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,370
if there's nothing else,

714
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,090
I'll be going then.

715
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:52,770
Okay.

716
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:54,130
Don't smoke too much.

717
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:03,160
Why were they hiding here if it's just a small favor to ask?

718
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:22,110
You're on the phone?

719
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,260
You go first. I'm fine.

720
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,270
-It's okay.
-I'll come back later.

721
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,800
I want to ask people in the archives room

722
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,570
to bring me the interrogation record of Xu Zhaodi.

723
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:30,810
Since you're here,

724
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,179
it's the same that I ask for your advice.

725
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,050
Please have a seat.

726
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,969
Let me get you a cup of tea.

727
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:34,690
Okay. Okay.

728
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,440
Thank you.

729
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:37,350
Hanging up the phone after two rings

730
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,050
is the secret code that Yun Hongshen and Yun Hongqi

731
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,440
made in advance.

732
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:41,920
It means that Yun Hongqi

733
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,860
should wait for him at the tea house near the NBIS.

734
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:45,570
Zong Fang can't be arrested just yet.

735
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,340
He must destroy Ke Jingping's plan.

736
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:49,929
Director.

737
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,530
Have some tea.

738
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,070
Thank you.

739
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:56,020
What brings you here?

740
00:34:56,489 --> 00:34:57,210
Nothing.

741
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,010
I was just passing by,

742
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:58,810
so I came to visit.

743
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,790
Aren't we partners now?

744
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,450
So, we need to get in touch with each other more.

745
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,050
It's good for both of us.

746
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,430
You're so thoughtful.

747
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:08,770
The tea smells so good.

748
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:11,700
You're indeed a noble son from a prestigious family.

749
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:13,300
This is too exquisite.

750
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,770
-Tea, peanuts.
-No.

751
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,660
I brought these from home.

752
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,800
If you like them,

753
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,580
I can bring some to you later.

754
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:20,210
No.

755
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:21,310
I was just saying.

756
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,480
How can I take your things?

757
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,080
No, no, no.

758
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,850
What you're saying feels a bit distant.

759
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:28,190
Good things should be given to those who understand them.

760
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,780
Look.

761
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,210
You are an expert in tea tasting.

762
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,690
The tea can only have its value recognized

763
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,940
when it's in your hands.

764
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,970
It's a deal.

765
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,330
You really know how to talk!

766
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:41,700
You're indeed the famous Second Young Master Yun, who's well-known in Shanghai.

767
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:44,120
Director, you flatter me.

768
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,050
I heard from the Chief

769
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,430
that Xu Zhaodi confessed.

770
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,030
What did she confess?

771
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:52,820
Don't mention it.

772
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,440
She said the code name of Mi Lan's mission this morning

773
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,480
is Breaking Jade.

774
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,710
Then, she died.

775
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,640
Actually, what she said was useless.

776
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,920
There was nothing useful.

777
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,490
How did she die?

778
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:04,410
Arsenic poisoning.

779
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,680
I think Mi Lan did it beforehand.

780
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,040
She didn't want her to live from the very beginning.

781
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,130
Didn't you search her house?

782
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:14,690
Besides the gunpowder,

783
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,960
did you find anything else?

784
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:17,410
No.

785
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,850
They all left.

786
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:21,890
This tea is really good.

787
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,120
It's quite expensive, isn't it?

788
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:24,990
If you like it,

789
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:25,720
drink more.

790
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,610
It's not bad.

791
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,450
Not bad.

792
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:33,320
At this time, Yun Hongshen was very sure

793
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,530
that Gong Shiyi was suspicious of him.

794
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:37,040
He's monitoring himself.

795
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,730
Under such close surveillance,

796
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,730
to spread the news

797
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,260
is too hard.

798
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,320
Leader Yun just borrowed a bunch of files from the archives room.

799
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,830
They are a lot and complicated,

800
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,430
like operation records,

801
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,730
the entry and exit of the station,

802
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:52,000
and call records,

803
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,480
some interrogation records, and evidence registration.

804
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:56,840
The strangest thing is

805
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,660
that he borrowed a ledger from the General Affairs Department.

806
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,030
Things recorded are things like office supplies usage

807
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,160
and how much fuel the cars have used.

808
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:07,060
What's the use of reading those things?

809
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,970
You know nothing.

810
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,250

811
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,440
and analyze it

812
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,570
can you find the key point.

813
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:16,800
No wonder the Chief said

814
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,180
Yun Hongshen is born to be a spy.

815
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,910
He's smart and broad-minded.

816
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:22,850
The key is when patience is needed,

817
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,370
he can be more patient than anyone else.

818
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,260
If he wants to do something bad,

819
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:27,410
no one can stop him.

820
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:28,860
Go.

821
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:31,370
Contact the men outside.

they find,

00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,080
don't tell Yun Hongshen.

825
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:35,720
Yes.

826
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,200
Yun Hongshen is trying to piece together

827
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,290
the details of Ling Han's life and work from a few days before he died,

828
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,390
including when he went to and off work every day,

829
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,640
where he had been,

830
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:51,210
where he ate,

831
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,860
how many times his car was refueled,

832
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,120
what things he bought,

833
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,570
what materials he read,

834

and so on.

835
00:37:58,290 --> 00:37:59,610
Because these details

836
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,200
were also the weapon used by Ke Jingping.

837
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:04,810
In Ke Jingping's design,

838
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:06,400
the operation in which Zong Fang creates an explosion

839
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,440
and makes the public panic

840
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:10,080
was planned by Ling Han.

841
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:13,080
And the details he's looking into

842
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:15,970
will very likely be dug out as evidence.

843
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,720
Meanwhile,

844
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,510
they can also help Yun Hongshen

845
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:22,320
to solve many key points in this case.

846
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:24,880
For example, where the bomb is hidden,

847
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,440
what the target is, etc.

848
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:29,210
Before he finds Zong Fang,

849
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,440
he wants to find the explosives first.

850

Hello?

851
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,870
Did you show him the photo?

00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:54,420
Okay.

853
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:56,170
Bring him back to the station now

854
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,010

862

Yes.

This morning at Hunan Bank,

873
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,960
the one who sniped at Wen Yeming was Zong Fang.

874
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,330
When he was retreating,

875
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,930
along the way, he took off his clothes

876
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,520

I found the same ointment.

00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,380
This ointment is for eczema.

880
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:19,690
And this ointment

881
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:22,690
can only be found in several big pharmacies.

He can't buy it.

883
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,040
So, he can only steal it.

884
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,510
And he can't steal one kind of medicine.

00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:03,000
