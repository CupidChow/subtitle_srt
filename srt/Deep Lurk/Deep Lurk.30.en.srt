[Episode 30]

3
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,230
As expected,

4
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,829
it wasn't just Ling Han at the scene yesterday.

5
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,710
Mi Lan and Zong Fang were here too.

6
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,190
I'm heading back now.

7
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,790
-Okay.
-I'll treat you to drinks sometime.

8
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,150
Don't forget!

9
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,750
I won't.

10
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,540
Alright, I'm off.

11
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,090
Leader Wen.

12
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,700
Mi Lan and Zong Fang have been found.

13
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,350
Young Master.

14
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,310
Young Master.

15
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,430
It's here.

16
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,710
Someone ordered ten days' worth of meals from Defengxuan Restaurant,

17
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,350
requesting two deliveries per day.

18
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,360
But

19
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,440
the delivery guy never saw the person inside.

20
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,550
Every time,

21
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,630
he just knocked twice,

22
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,400
left the food container, and walked away immediately.

23
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,640
This was specifically instructed by the person who placed the order.

24
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,390
The house was bought by Bai Qingkui's bodyguard,

25
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,079
Liu.

26
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,500
It went through several hands before that.

27
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,020
After the purchase, it remained vacant,

28
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,079
with no one living there.

29
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,829
Some time ago, Bai Qingkui moved in,

30
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,510
and rumor has it he died there.

31
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,030
Recently, someone else moved in.

32
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,829
But my men couldn't figure out who they are.

33
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:28,810
They didn't dare get too close

34
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,640
and never saw their faces.

35
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,750
Sorry, Young Master.

36
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,690
I didn't handle this well for you.

37
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:33,829
It's fine.

38
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,990
You've already done great

39
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,990
tracking them this far

40
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,190
without being discovered.

41
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,350
When you go back,

42
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,390
tell your men

43
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,230
to keep their mouths shut.

44
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,310
We can't afford any trouble.

45
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,030
Understood.

46
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,790
Young Master,

47
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,560
how about

48
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,950
the two of us stay and help you out?

49
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,300
The people inside

50
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,900
are extremely dangerous.

51
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,110
The two of you won't be of much help.

52
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,990
If they take you hostage,

53
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,079
I'll have to save you as well.

54
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,680
Alright, Rat, Gangzi.

55
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,180
Don't you trust my skills?

56
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,690
Let's go.

57
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,990
-Be careful, then.
-We're leaving.

58
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:08,910
Dao,

59
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,950
you should go too.

60
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,790
Young Master,

61
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,750
are you joking?

62
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,350
How can I leave at a time like this?

63
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,350
Enough.

64
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,870
This time, listen to me.

65
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,250
You're someone who does great things.

66
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,829
Your life is precious.

67
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,970
Besides,

00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,500
we still need you to take charge of saving Second Young Master.

00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,830
I'll cover the back door.

70
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,750
You knock on the front.

71
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,310
Take this dagger for self-defense.

72
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,300
Just hold them off until Wen Yeming arrives.

73
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,030
Don't risk your life.

74
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,130
Why are you talking so much?

75
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,010
Who is it?

76
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,950
I'm from Defengxuan Restaurant, delivering your meal.

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,770
The money you left outside earlier was too much.

78
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,030
I didn't dare take it.

79
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,470
Something is wrong.

80
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,510
It's Yun Hongqi.

81
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,320
Mi Lan!

82
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,670
This stab

83
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,470
is for my grandma.

84
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,070
Today,

85
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,150
I'll make you pay for your blood debts.

86
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,230
That stab earlier

87
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,840
was something I owed you.

88
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,350
From now on,

89
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,320
I won't give you another chance like that.

90
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,750
You said

91
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,830
you'd treat me well

92
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,720
and give me a home.

93
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,350
But now,

94
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,180
you're trying to kill me.

95
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,750
Your love

96
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,060
is just that much.

97
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:32,950
Are you okay?

98
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:33,710
I'm fine.

99
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,159
Yun Hongqi has been knocked out.

100
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,990
Go save him now.

101
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:36,929

[Nurses' Station]

103
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,980
You're way too impatient.

104
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,650
With just the two of you,

105
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,450
there's no way you could catch Mi Lan and Zong Fang.

106
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,750
At the very least, you should've waited for me to arrive before taking action.

107
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:04,830
Officer Wen,

108
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,030
it was my mistake.

109
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,910
I was afraid of delays causing complications.

110
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,310
I think you were simply eager for revenge.

111
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,020
Your original plan was probably

112
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,440
to capture Zong Fang alive and kill Mi Lan,

113
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,190
right?

114
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,110
I thought I could control myself.

115
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,070
I thought

116
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,150
I could look at the bigger picture

117
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,090
and wouldn't kill her when I saw her.

118
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,270
But when I saw her,

119
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,670
I thought of my grandma,

120
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,110
and I just couldn't control myself.

121
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,680
I really wanted to kill her with my own hands.

122
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,350
I wanted to...

123
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,620
I just couldn't control myself, do you understand?

124
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,650
With your level of skill,

125
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,130
you're no match for someone with professional training as a special agent.

126
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,390
You can't compete Mi Lan.

127
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,370
So what if I'm not?

128
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,820
You need to stay rational.

129
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,520
That's the only way to save Yun Hongshen.

130
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,700
How's Shen now?

131
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,830
We're all familiar with each other here,

132
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,940
so I hope our conversation can be direct and to the point.

133
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,830
And you know perfectly well

134
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,710
what kind of person I am.

135
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,230
When I was fifteen,

136
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,830
Uncle Yang gave me a watch

137
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,350
as a birthday gift.

138
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,590
I always kept it in

139
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,910
the left drawer of my desk.

140
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,750
So when Jingyu mentioned it,

141
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,790
I immediately knew Uncle Yang was looking for me.

142
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,450
That birthday happened to be celebrated at Xiaoxiang Restaurant,

143
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,960
so that's where we met.

144
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,310
What did he want?

145
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,470
He wanted me to leave Changsha to lay low for a while.

146
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,570
Why?

147
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,130
You already know, don't you?

148
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,780
Someone accused my father and me of being communists.

149
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,670
How do you explain this?

150
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,510
This must be something Ling Han prepared for me.

151
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,200
He wants to use this to cement his accusations that I'm a communist.

152
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,590
Did Jingyu

153
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,480
die at the location mentioned in this newspaper clipping?

154
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,750
What are you trying to say?

155
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,390
Ling Han,

156
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,260
it's you again.

157
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,590
Just wait.

158
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,650
I'll kill you for sure!

159
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,990
I don't want to hear this right now.

160
00:11:59,070 --> 00:11:59,790
I just want to know

161
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,610
what organization your father truly serves?

162
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:02,870
I think

163
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,060
you should ask Ling Han instead

164
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,680
which organization he's truly loyal to.

165
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,480
Sir.

166
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,050
Uncle Yang,

167
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,080
Jingyu was killed by Ling Han.

168
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:41,810
Come.

169
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,000
For all those young lives

170
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,150
like Jingyu's.

171
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,640
For their courage

172
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,320
and kindness.

173
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,830
Stop making futile efforts.

174
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,280
My plan has already been set in motion.

175
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,740
It's my mistake.

176
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,070
I should bear the consequences.

177
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,800
The issue with the gold reserves

178
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,470
involves too many people.

179
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,790
You don't understand the situation,

180
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,060
so you can't take on this responsibility.

181
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,380
Let's think of another way.

182
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,800
There's no time left.

183
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,800
Our cause needs someone to continue it.

184
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,070
Don't worry.

185
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,830
Our cause

186
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,710
will definitely be carried forward by others.

187
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,040
Chief Ke,

188
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,140
if I didn't mishear just now,

189
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,910
are you telling me

190
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,660
that they're denying it now?

191
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,790
In other words,

192
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,650
your investigation

193
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,870
has made no progress at all?

194
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,760
At present, we don't have strong evidence.

195
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,150
And given their special identities,

196
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,310
there are too many eyes on them.

197
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,980
It's not suitable to take extreme measures.

198
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,220
Then you might as well let them go,

199
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,700
apologize to them,

200
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,190
admit we made a mistake,

201
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,780
and say sorry.

202
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,640
Right now, it's undoubtedly putting the Director under immense pressure.

203
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,080
Ke Jingping, I'm telling you,

204
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:54,780
you must come up with something...

205
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,910
Some kind of excuse to get through this.

206
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,570
Understood.

207
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,780
Hello?

208
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,550
Why is it always someone looking for you?

209
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,180
Hello?

210
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,490
Chief.

211
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,130
There may be more to Yang Ziming's true identity than meets the eye.

212
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:24,720
Director Gong.

213
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,260
Minister Yang,

214
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,030
our Chief requests your presence.

215
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,200
I've checked your family's call records.

216
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,829
The morning before Zhang Xiancheng arrived in Changsha,

217
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:29,320
you received a phone call from Shanghai.

218
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,390
I'd like to know who called you

219
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,180
and what the conversation was about.

220
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,920
When I left Shanghai, it was in a hurry.

221
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,190
So,

222
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,490
I didn't have time to deal with my property in Shanghai.

223
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,290
I entrusted a real estate agent

224
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,240
to sell my house.

225
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,500
That call was from the agent,

226
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,920
and it was about the property.

227
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,350
A phone call

228
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,820
about a property at as early as 5 a.m.?

229
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,710
What kind of inconsiderate agent

230
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,710
would pass muster with someone

231
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,310
as discerning as you, Minister Yang?

232
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,420
The transfer order came unexpectedly.

233
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,420
In a rush,

234
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,120
I didn't have enough time

235
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,450
to carefully select a proper agent.

236
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,770
And wouldn't you know it,

237
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,390
on the very morning you took that call,

238
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,330
No. 76 captured a Communist liaison officer

239
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,990
who had infiltrated Shanghai from Northern Jiangsu

240
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,000
on a secret mission.

241
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,970
There was an exchange of gunfire,

242
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,210
and the liaison officer was killed on the spot.

243
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,050
However,

244
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,700
the contact tasked with meeting him survived

245
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,010
and defected.

246
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,380
According to this defector,

247
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,270
their mission to Shanghai

248
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,320
was to receive a shipment of gold.

249
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,460
The Communists are that capable?

250
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,880
Under the noses of the Japanese,

251
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,940
with both the NBIS and the CBIS watching,

252
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,030
they still managed to secure gold?

253
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:45,870
Yes.

254
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,280
At such a difficult time,

255
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,100
they were able to perform a sleight of hand

256
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,490
and fool the Japanese.

257
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,690
The person who pulled this off must be quite a genius.

258
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:55,950
Someone, perhaps,

259
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,900
like your friend Yun Muzhi.

260
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,030
Chief Ke,

261
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:02,090
you're confusing me with your words.

262
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,540
Who performed a sleight of hand?

263
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,070
And how is Muzhi

264
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,390
involved in this?

265
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,030
As far as I know,

266
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,760
the Bank of France handed over a shipment

267
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,790
of gold to the Japanese.

268
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,860
But when it reached Japan,

269
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,340
it had all turned into lead ingots.

270
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,920
Is that so?

271
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,200
Well, that's certainly satisfying to hear!

272
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,260
Why should we

273
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,150
let the Japanese take our gold?

274
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,310
You're right.

275
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,280
But on the other hand,

276
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,400
Minister Yang,

277
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,790
you approve of the sleight-of-hand with that gold, don't you?

278
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,350
Chief Ke,

279
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,100
that's not fair of you.

280
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,090
You're twisting the facts.

281
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,400
No matter how I answer, I'll be in the wrong,

282
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:47,580
won't I?

283
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,950
I'd like to ask,

284
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,150
if this question were directed at you, Chief Ke,

285
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:53,900
how would you answer it?

286
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,520
We have people within the CBIS as well.

287
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,200
Yang Ziming is very likely a CBIS operative.

288
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,340
Make it clear.

289
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,550
I have a subordinate,

290
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,340
an informant within the CBIS.

291
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,720
He's very clever.

292
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:15,950
I asked him to discreetly investigate,

293
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,770
and he told me

294
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,390
that Yang Ziming is most likely working for the CBIS.

295
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,660
What does that have to do with me?

296
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,070
Among the documents burned at Zhiya House,

297
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,940
one was restored by us.

298
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,720
It has already been deciphered.

299
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,640
Where are the people at Zhiya House?

300
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,580
It's too late for you

301
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,440
to ask me about them now.

302
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,050
That's fine. It doesn't matter.

303
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,350
After all, they're just minor players.

304
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,570
What I want to know is where the gold is.

305
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,390
I won't tell you.

306
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,140
Don't you realize

307
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,780
that's your only chance to save yourself?

308
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,790
Chief Ke,

309
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,760
I won't waste words.

310
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,970
You know better than I do

311
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,780
what happens when you betray your boss.

312
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,110
Since death is inevitable,

313
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,920
I might as well die with loyalty to my name.

314
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,160
At least that way,

315
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,110
I can protect my family.

316
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,150
Who is your boss?

317
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,520
Chen Lifu?

318
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:49,960
Xu Enzeng?

319
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:24,400
Uncle Yang,

320
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,090
what did our Chief talk to you about?

321
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,320
Nothing much,

322
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,990
just asking about the situation.

323
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,860
By the way,

324
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,270
has it been a long time

325
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,880
since you've heard me play the harmonica?

326
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,070
Today, I'll play for you.

327
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,410
Uncle Yang,

328
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,810
please don't. I don't want to hear it.

329
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,040
But I want to play.

330
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:42,450
-Uncle Yang...
-Please, just this once, indulge me.

331
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,640
This tune is suspicious.

332
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,800
You're transmitting information.

333
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:51,800
Don't move!

334
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:53,590
He's transmitting intelligence.

335
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,480
Quick, go after them!

336
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:55,570
Stop right there!

337
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,110
If any of you move,

338
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,180
I'll shoot him.

339
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,290
Don't shoot!

340
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,760
He won't kill me.

341
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,490
If you don't believe me,

342
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,540
you can try.

343
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,420
Uncle Yang.

344
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:29,190
The final step in Yang Ziming's entire plan

345
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,580
was to leave no witnesses.

346
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,780
The clues he threw out

347
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,670
are enough to make Ke Jingping suspicious.

348
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,940
But they can't be investigated further.

349
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,640
Neither Ke Jingping nor Dai Li

350
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,400
would ever confront Chen Lifu directly.

351
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,260
By dying under the guise of being with the CBIS,

352
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,710
Yun Hongshen and that shipment of gold are safe.

353
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,210
Shen,

354
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,440
what cannot be seen with the naked eye

355
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,640
can only be seen with insight.

356
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:06,910
Uncle Yang.

357
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:08,670
Uncle Yang.

358
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,660
And this insight...

359
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,370
Uncle Yang.

360
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:29,570
Uncle Yang.

361
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:33,540
Uncle Yang.

362
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,370
I'm sorry.

363
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,400
I'm sorry.

364
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,850
I'm sorry, Uncle Yang.

365
00:26:59,090 --> 00:26:59,890
Capture him alive!

366
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,630
According to Ms. Tong from the nursing school,

367
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,030
Mi Lan had a secret relationship

368
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,420
while in university.

369
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,430
A secret relationship?

370
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,630
Who was it with?

371
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,160
A male student from the Normal University.

372
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,500
He was secretly executed

373
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,530
for organizing and carrying out

374
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,680
an anti-government protest.

375
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,070
At the time, Mi Lan wanted to collect his body

376
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,640
despite all consequences.

377
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,070
Ms. Tong discovered this

378
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,030
and forcibly stopped her.

379
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,830
That's also how her relationship was exposed.

380
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,820
But because this was a sensitive matter,

381
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,190
the teacher, out of care for her,

382
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,780
kept it a secret.

383
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,620
That explains it.

384
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,620
Her defection to the Japanese

385
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:55,720
was fueled by hatred toward us

386
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,600
and she wanted revenge.

387
00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:59,880
Have you found the connection

388
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,970
between Mi Lan and Ling Han?

389
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,240
I took

390
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,470
this yesterday

391
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,320
at the factory where Yun Hongshen was captured.

392
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,800
Two pairs of footprints, one large and one small,

393
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,930
likely a man and a woman.

394
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,600
The shoe sizes match those of Zong Fang and Mi Lan.

395
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,670
I suspect

396
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,600
Mi Lan and Zong Fang were present at the scene.

397
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,230
If my assumption is correct,

398
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,570
then Ling Han is highly problematic.

399
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,640
Suspicion alone isn't enough to convict someone.

400
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,590
I also investigated Wei Xiaojun.

401
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,630
When Ling Han received the call,

402
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,640
Wei Xiaojun was accompanying his girlfriend to see a traditional Chinese doctor.

403
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,180
The person who followed Yun Hongshen and took the photos

404
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,300
couldn't possibly have been him.

405
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,560
Yet Ling Han claimed the photos were taken by Wei Xiaojun.

406
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,920
This only proves that Ling Han lied.

407
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:41,070
If you want to substantiate your hypothesis,

408
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,590
you need strong evidence.

409
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:43,810
Since there are doubts about him,

410
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,120
an investigation should be conducted.

411
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,710
Why hesitate?

412
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,170
I made it very clear just now.

413
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,620
Strong evidence is required.

414
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,330
But didn't the Director convict Yun Hongshen

415
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,640
based purely on suspicion?

416
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,030
Wen Yeming,

417
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,400
the Chief has already stated

418
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,950
that strong, conclusive evidence

419
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,900
is required for this case.

420
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,450
Ling Han is highly valued by the Director.

421
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:09,420
We must show due respect to the Director.

422
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,330
Some actions must be justified with clear reasons.

423
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,400
I don't yet have solid enough evidence.

424
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,890
But this afternoon,

425
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,370
I almost captured Mi Lan and Zong Fang.

426
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:25,760
If I had captured them,

427
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:26,840
many things would have become clearer.

428
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,550
Why didn't you report to the station

429
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,940
when you went to capture Mi Lan and Zong Fang?

430
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,310
The person who found them was Yun Hongqi.

431
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,500
He firmly believes Ling Han is suspicious

432
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:39,970
and doesn't trust our internal security, so...

433
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,060
So you took matters into your own hands,

434
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,790
disregarding the task I gave you,

435
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,550
and became Yun Hongqi's errand runner, right?

436
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,140
Hello?

437
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,260
Bring them back.

438
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,540
Yang Ziming is dead.

439
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:23,610
Stop holding out.

440
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:24,730
Admit everything.

441
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,030
What's the meaning

442
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:28,770
of this codebook?

443
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,070
I really don't know what it means.

444
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,990
Minister Yang has his own special code.

445
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:47,310
All the telegrams were decoded by him personally.

446
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,530
I was only responsible for sending them.

447
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,320
Where's the radio?

448
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,880
Did you hide it,

449
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,750
or did you let the people from Zhiya House take it?

450
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,580
There was indeed a radio

451
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:58,980
at the Zhiya House contact point.

452
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,680
When they evacuated, they took it with them.

453
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,290
Moreover,

454
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,070
that radio wasn't used for

455
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,470
Minister Yang's communications with higher-ups.

456
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,160
Even if someone

457
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,910
used the radio in Minister Yang's name,

458
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,870
there would be no reply from above.

459
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,120
Yang Ziming had a special communication channel?

460
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:17,770
Yes.

461
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,310
Tell me.

462
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,540
The Provincial Telecommunications Division.

463
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,100
The Provincial Telecommunications Division?

464
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,040
Yes.

465
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:29,320
Where did all the telegrams you handled go?

466
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:30,940
Chongqing.

467
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,220
The wartime capital.

468
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,230
The Economic and Trade Communications Agency.

469
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,650
They had people stationed near Yang Ziming's house.

470
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,830
When you were there,

471
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,340
they didn't dare to make any moves,

472
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,780
fearing you would see through their plot.

473
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:51,700
But once you left,

474
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,140
they signaled him.

475
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,800
I'm sorry. It was my negligence.

476
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,070
Forget it.

477
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,310
Their plan was well-designed.

478
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,340
You're not a deity.

479
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,060
Yang Ziming is dead.

480
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,250
This situation is even more troublesome.

481
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,940
We can't even bring up

482
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,160
his potential Communist ties.

483
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,250
If Chen Lifu finds out,

484
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,990
he'll accuse us of slander

485
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,150
and say we killed him.

486
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,990
And it involves the gold.

487
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,170
If this leaks,

488
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,420
it will be a huge scandal.

489
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,820
He really thought he had everything figured out.

490
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,710
No one knows for sure if he was from the CBIS.

491
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:33,040
What cannot be seen with the naked eye,

492
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:37,050
can only be seen with insight.

493
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,140
Uncle Yang.

494
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,160
And this insight...

495
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,710
Two telegrams have already been decoded.

496
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,510
Although the content is incomplete,

497
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:06,860
it's enough

498
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:09,160
to infer the full content from them.

499
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,310
The ones sent from Zhiya House should be,

500
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,060
"The secret has been leaked.

501
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,030
Personnel have already been sent to Shanghai.

502
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:14,200
We hope for full cooperation."

503
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,880
The document that Secretary Wu took is relatively complete.

504
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:19,450
The last word of the telegram should be "save."

505
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,420
If that's the case,

506
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,800
then Yang Ziming really was from the CBIS.

507
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,380
Chief,

508
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,120
Yang Ziming, that old fox, has played us all.

509
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,040
He clearly knew

510
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,430
that we suspected he and Yun Hongshen were Communists,

511
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:33,860
but he allowed this misunderstanding to continue,

512
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,220
misleading us to keep heading in the wrong direction.

513
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,900
He was delaying time.

514
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,190
The longer he delays,

515
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,680
the safer his package becomes.

516
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,230
So,

517
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,950
if that's the case,

518
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,430
the possibility of Yun Hongshen being a Communist suspect

519
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:49,090
is becoming smaller and smaller.

520
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,840
Not to mention Yang Ziming playing the harmonica to send messages,

521
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,000
but this whole situation

522
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:58,340
has many fundamental inconsistencies.

523
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,600
What do you mean?

524
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:00,790
Here,

525
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:03,110
this is the recording of Ling Han's interrogation.

526
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:04,210
You should listen to it.

527
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:08,090
The last words Zhang Xiancheng said before he died,

528
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,850
you all might have heard them,

529
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,350
or at least heard

530
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,710
one of the key words.

531
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,969
But because you weren't paying attention,

532
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,179
or were distracted by other information,

533
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,010
you mistakenly thought you didn't hear it.

534
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,570
Think carefully again,

535
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,460
even one word or one phrase could be important.

536
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,389
Director Ling,

537
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,909
I was a bit far away at that time,

538
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,150
and Zhang Xiancheng's voice

539
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,320
was really too low.

540
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:30,900
I...

541
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,000
I didn't hear it.

542
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:35,199
I didn't hear it either.

543
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,270
The voice was indeed quite faint.

544
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,010
So after Yun Hongshen heard Zhang Xiancheng's words,

545
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,250
what was his expression like?

546
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,870
A bit bewildered, right?

547
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:44,889
Yes.

548
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,360
I saw him freeze for a moment.

549
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,330
Chief, you also heard it, right?

550
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,290
Ling Han has been coaxing a confession,

551
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,150
but these two agents don't seem to understand

552
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:57,660
what he means.

553
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,240
Their feedback is all truthful.

554
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,850
Clearly, Yun Hongshen

555
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:04,390
didn't know what Zhang Xiancheng was saying.

556
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:05,990
If he had,

557
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,980
then the events would have unfolded like this,

558
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:10,610
Yun Hongshen would have actively reported to Yang Ziming,

559
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,600
rather than the other way around,

560
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,650
with Yang Ziming trying to reach him indirectly.

561
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,810
There's something I still don't understand.

562
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,790
Why did Zhang Xiancheng tell Yun Hongshen

563
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,880
such an important thing before he died?

564
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,140
Doesn't that prove Yun Hongshen also has issues?

565
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,970
This only proves

566
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,200
that Yun Hongshen has ties to the CBIS,

567
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,890
and nothing to do with the Communist Party.

568
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,160
I suspect

569
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:36,700
that Zhang Xiancheng knew he wouldn't survive,

570
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,120
but he had to pass on

571
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,120
the mission details for coming to Changsha.

572
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,080
So he chose Yun Hongshen, the person closest to Yang Ziming,

573
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,790
to act as a messenger.

574
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,550
Anyway, no matter what he said, Yun Hongshen wouldn't have understood,

575
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,000
but he could be certain

576
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,490
that once Yang Ziming knew the situation,

577
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,350
he would ask Yun Hongshen about it,

578
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,030
thus achieving his goal.

579
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,260
Chief,

580
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,180
based on all the current information,

581
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,440
it's highly likely that Yun Hongshen

582
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:01,070
was simply caught up in this by chance.

583
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:03,740
He has nothing to do with Zhang Xiancheng's mission in Changsha

584
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,210
or Yang Ziming.

585
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,770
And the notion of him being a Communist is completely unfounded.

586
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,700
The newspaper clipping found at the Yun family's house

587
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:14,220
was likely planted to frame him.

588
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,860
The death of Jingyu really makes this clear.

589
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,680
Young Master, please eat.

590
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,460
Young Master, don't worry.

591
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,390
We'll keep looking for the people for you.

592
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,100
But I'm worried

593
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:39,950
that after we startled them this time,

594
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:40,870
they won't

595
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,420
hide in Bai Qingkui's place anymore.

596
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,270
So,

597
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,570
we'll need to put in more effort.

598
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,860
As long as they haven't disappeared into thin air,

599
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,040
we'll definitely find them.

600
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,680
After all, this is still our Changsha territory.

601
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:53,230
Young Master.

602
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,950
Where do you think they might hide this time?

603
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,770
I have no clue at all.

604
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,190
Let's look further away.

605
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,890
Now they are surrounded on all sides.

606
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,430
Not only are we looking for them,

607
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:05,970
but the NBIS people are also looking for them.

608
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,300
They can't hide in the city.

609
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,750
The more remote

610
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,660
and unnoticed the place is,

611
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,210
the more suitable it is for them.

612
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:15,990
Let's try our luck.

613
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:17,250
-Alright.
-Alright.

614
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:18,550
Let's eat.

615
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:43,150
He's an incredible agent.

616
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,410
As an opponent, I really respect him.

617
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,930
I believe the package he swore to protect

618
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:48,960
was also for the anti-Japanese war effort.

619
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:52,860
He's a hero to this country.

620
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,750
He shouldn't have been treated this way.

621
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:59,010
But the only thing I can do for him is this.

622
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,690
Thank you.

623
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,090
He'll like

624
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,010
this place.

625
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,740
He likes scenic spots.

626
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,030
You're still too young.

627
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:16,390
Some things you're still too emotionally attached to.

628
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,270
You care that he's your relative,

629
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,660
and you can't bring yourself to report him,

630
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,200
so you've ended up in this situation.

631
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,780
But he's not like that to you.

632
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:27,520
No.

633
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,230
He wouldn't shoot me.

634
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,160
A person like him

635
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,630
is both terrifying

636
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,570
and admirable.

637
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,810
Tell me,

638
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,980
how did you get Ling Han to meet you?

639
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:56,690
He has an operative,

640
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:57,950
code name “Onitetsu.”

641
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,960
I found Ling Han through her.

642
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:01,250
Is this Onitetsu Mi Lan?

643
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:07,310
Yeming really went to great lengths for you.

644
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,070
She found out Mi Lan's real reason

645
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,660
for siding with the Japanese,

646
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,100
but she didn't uncover

647
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,440
the evidence of the connection between Mi Lan and Ling Han.

648
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,590
So my suspicion of you and Ling Han

649
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,410
is the same.

650
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,850
How can you prove what you're saying is true?

651
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,670
I will definitely prove it to you.

652
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:26,000
I will never let Ling Han go.

653
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,290
If you don't have evidence,

654
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,040
then it's just speculation.

655
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,900
Ling Han has also made significant contributions

656
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:36,480
to our KMT.

657
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,790
When you deal with a person like him,

658
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,480
if you don't have concrete evidence,

659
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,340
you'll only bring trouble upon yourself.

660
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,710
In our line of work,

661
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:45,890
we can't always rely on evidence.

662
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,800
Many times,

663
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:49,690
we have to rely on deduction.

664
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,720
That's why I said you are too young.

665
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:56,200
Yun Hongshen, I understand your abilities,

666
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,080
and I know your thoughts.

667
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,990
But this is no longer just your business.

668
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,410
It concerns the honor of the KMT's elites,

669
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:04,600
and it also concerns the safety

670
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,180
of our entire Hunan Station.

671
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,230
So now you must tell me everything

672
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,060
you know.

673
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:10,780
Then why do you suspect him?

674
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:14,160
You keep talking about evidence.

675
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,520
After all these years of handling cases,

676
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,730
have you always relied on evidence?

677
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,490
I really admire you,

678
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,180
but I want to tell you

679
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,870
that people like us,

680
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,150
when we're in the middle of the situation,

681
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,320
sometimes we don't see things as clearly.

682
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,450
Why have I been openly and covertly

683
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,520
protecting you?

684
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,680
It's to make you believe in me.

685
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,420
When I captured the Viscount,

686
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,720
I unexpectedly uncovered a family letter.

687
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,180
A Japanese spy with the code name Kunwu

688
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,240
had entrusted him to send it back to Japan.

689
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,510
Kunwu is in Changsha.

690
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,520
I suspect Ling Han is Kunwu.

691
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,090
He's been lurking in China

692
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,360
for at least ten years,

693
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,660
maybe even longer than Zhang Hua or Zong Fang.

694
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,570
Is there anything else besides this family letter?

695
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:01,800
No.

696
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,190
Can this family letter

697
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,320
prove that Ling Han is Kunwu?

698
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,290
No.

699
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:08,980
Recently, I have been investigating

700
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,140
Ling Han extensively.

701
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,060
I've found many suspicious points about him.

702
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,450
Ling Han is someone who acts very meticulously.

703
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,580
I just don't have evidence for now to prove

704
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:18,660
that Ling Han is Kunwu.

705
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,050
But I firmly believe Ling Han must be Kunwu.

706
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,200
Chief,

707
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:23,950
I suggest we arrest Ling Han immediately.

708
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:24,830
No.

709
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:25,390
Why not?

710
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:27,490
Ling Han was personally recommended by Director Dai,

711
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,320
and he holds him in high regard.

712
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,510
Just because of that,

713
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,230
we're going to let a Japanese spy

714
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:34,170
who has infiltrated so deeply

715
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,750
continue to stab at the heart of our organization?

716
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,300
The longer he remains undercover,

717
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,490
the more secrets he knows.

718
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,640
This will lead to increasingly severe consequences.

719
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,560
This matter is not as simple as you think.

720
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,790
If Ling Han is indeed Kunwu,

721
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:52,480
then Director Dai will inevitably be implicated.

722
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,810
At that point, the entire NBIS will be in turmoil.

723
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:57,530
Then what do you intend to do?

724
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,350
Are you saying

725
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:01,690
that to protect Director Dai,

726
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:03,830
we should allow Ling Han to maintain

727
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,950
his elite image for the KMT?

728
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:06,340
Don't talk nonsense with me.

729
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:08,610
You are fully aware of the stakes involved here.

730
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:23,510
You can investigate,

731
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,370
but don't make too much noise.

732
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,400
I will find a solution that addresses both sides

733
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,970
in the shortest possible time.

734
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:31,150
If Ling Han is indeed Kunwu,

735
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,140
I will not let him go.
