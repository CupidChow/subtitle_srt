[Deep Lurk]

00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,910
[Episode 16]

3
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,670
Don't you want to know

4
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,350
who killed Instructor Teng?

5
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,110
If you do,

6
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:51,630
cooperate with us.

7
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,860
The potassium cyanide on his dagger

8
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,530
was applied by you, wasn't it?

9
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,670
That's just your guess.

10
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,910
Without evidence,

11
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,910
it's pure slander.

12
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,570
When a person is cornered,

13
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,340
it's inevitable that they'll act out of desperation.

14
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,670
I can understand that

15
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,310
you are resorting to such measures

16
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,710
for self-preservation.

17
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,170
But I will never

18
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,230
let you get away with it.

19
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,940
Although you haven't admitted it,

20
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,470
you also haven't denied it.

21
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,250
You're just trying to trick me

22
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,390
to see whether I have evidence or not.

23
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,290
You can't possibly have any evidence.

24
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,890
Then why did you come to Teng Ping's dormitory?

25
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,560
What was in there was probably potassium cyanide.

26
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,480
You wanted to lead people

27
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,110
to think that Teng Ping

28
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,790
poisoned the dagger himself.

29
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,630
You really have a knack for

30
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,630
speaking off the cuff, I must say.

31
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,590
Three days ago,

32
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,390
Deputy Commander of Changsha City Defense, Jin Guoqiang,

33
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,830
was killed in a car accident

34
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,680
on his way back to the city.

35
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,130
The driver who caused the accident was a supply delivery driver

36
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,570
named Qian Dahai.

37
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,170
Now, are you going to say

38
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,070
that Qian Dahai had a drinking problem,

39
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,180
and yet he was tasked with delivering supplies to the base?

40
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:19,910
Look at that.

41
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,520
If you weren't so stubborn,

42
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,980
our conversation could go much smoother.

43
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,270
Don't ask me about Qian Dahai.

44
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:28,790
If you really want to know,

45
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,910
ask Ke Jingping.

46
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,670
You mean to say

47
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,490
Qian Dahai used to be under Chief Ke.

48
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,280
He was seriously injured during a mission,

49
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,390
while covering for Chief Ke.

50
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,790
That's why Chief Ke

51
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,710
used his connections to get him this job.

52
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:46,430
It seems you know everything there is to know.

53
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:49,850
But what does Qian Dahai have to do with today's incident?

54
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,730
Don't rush me.

55
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,660
Qian Dahai was supposed to leave the city that day to deliver goods.

56
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,710
He wasn't planning to drink,

57
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:59,640
but Teng Ping brought him a bottle of liquor.

58
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,250
Qian.

59
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:06,910
Instructor Teng.

60
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,960
Are you heading out?

61
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,690
I'm going out of town to deliver some goods later.

62
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,110
This is some good wine

63
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,370
from my hometown.

64
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:15,980
Try it.

65
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,390
Well...

66
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,610
This... this isn't appropriate.

67
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,060
What's wrong with that?

68
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,800
Look at all the nice things

69
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,830
you've brought me from outside.

70
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,200
-Take it.
-This...

71
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,350
Take it.

72
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,830
Don't be so polite,

73
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,909
or I'll get mad.

74
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,670
Well, alright then.

75
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,190
Thank you very much.

76
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:37,909
Take care.

77
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,510
Good wine.

78
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,110
Qian Dahai had a drinking problem.

79
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,570
Once he saw the alcohol, he couldn't resist.

80
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,080
He drank the whole bottle

81
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,800
on his way back to the city.

82
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,990
Although the bottle was taken away by someone else,

83
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,710
the autopsy report clearly stated

84
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,480
that his stomach was full of alcohol.

85
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,510
Did you see Teng Ping give Qian Dahai the wine?

86
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,730
Someone thought that by taking away the bottle,

87
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,390
they could cover up the truth.

88
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,190
But what Qian Dahai drank was Hengchang Maotai,

89
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,590
which has a very distinctive aroma.

90
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,530
And it was precisely this unique fragrance

91
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,590
that exposed the person who gave Qian Dahai the liquor—

92
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,580
it was Teng Ping.

93
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,350
Is that so?

94
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,350
Hengchang Maotai has very limited production

95
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,290
and is basically only sold in Maotai Town.

96
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,110
And Teng Ping

97
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,910
just so happens to be from there.

98
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,590
A few days ago,

99
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,950
his family sent him a whole case of it.

100
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,790
Even if Teng Ping gave the bottle to Qian Dahai,

101
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,840
how could he be sure

102
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,430
that Qian Dahai would

103
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,180
hit Jin Guoqiang before entering the city?

104
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,580
Because Qian Dahai wasn't the one driving—

105
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,630
it was you.

106
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,340
Instructor Zhang.

107
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,270
I need to run some errands in the city.

108
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,070
Give me a ride.

109
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,680
Hop in, hop in.

110
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,950
Why did you drink so much?

111
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,020
Can you even drive?

112
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,700
It's okay.

113
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,380
I'm fine.

114
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,040
Fine?

115
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,270
Let me drive instead.

116
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,000
You saw me driving as well?

117
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,150
Of course not.

118
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,460
However, the passenger seat had a strong smell of alcohol,

119
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,340
and Qian Dahai's right hand was injured.

120
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,640
Didn't you notice this detail?

121
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,210
When you crashed into Jin Guoqiang's car

122
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,760
and hastily moved Qian Dahai

123
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,230
back to the driver's seat,

124
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,630
you must've overlooked this minor detail.

125
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,540
Instructor Zhang,

126
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,810
how could you make such a rookie mistake?

127
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,390
When Wen Yeming and I arrived,

128
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:36,990
you suspected we were here

129
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,460
to investigate the unknown signal from that day.

130
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,190
You wanted to find a scapegoat.

131
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,789
And keeping Teng Ping alive

132
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:43,960
was too dangerous for you.

133
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,720
So,

134
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,450
you came up with this plan to kill him with another's hand.

135
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,680
Now, you'll say that

136
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,370
everything I've said is just slander against you, won't you?

137
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,390
But I was the eyewitness

138
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,390
who saw you applying the poison to the dagger that day.

139
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,830
Teng Ping had always secretly admired Wen Yeming.

140
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,090
When he saw the two of us

141
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,070
working so closely together,

142
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,400
jealousy consumed him.

143
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,860
You knew him well.

144
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,590
You knew he couldn't stand it

145
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,320
and would challenge me.

146
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,310
Once he lost,

147
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,780
he'd become enraged

148
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,800
and irrational,

149
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,890
perhaps even harboring a desire to kill me.

150
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,160
And once that murderous intent arose, there could only be two outcomes:

151
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,010
Either he dies,

152
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,180
allowing you to get rid of him using me as your pawn.

153
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,150
Or I die,

154
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,760
in which case people would naturally suspect Teng Ping.

155
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,670
No one would trust him anymore.

156
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,860
Right?

157
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,910
It's a pity though;

158
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,200
it's such a brilliant deduction,

159
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,430
yet no one else will hear it.

160
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,190
Is the murderer of Myna

161
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,430
hiding with you?

162
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,390
Who's your superior?

163
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,570
You've met them before, haven't you?

164
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,120
Aren't you a war hero?

165
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,750
Don't bother trying to get anything out of me.

166
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,670
With me,

167
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,230
you'll get nothing.

168
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,350
We finally managed to catch one alive,

169
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,680
and now he was shot dead.

170
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,260
Did you forget what I told you before we set out?

171
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,350
Didn't I specifically say

172
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,670
we needed him alive?

173
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,430
Yes, you did.

174
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,270
Then why did you kill him?

175
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,790
Why's he so mad?

176
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,550
This guy saw Zhang Hua

177
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,430
pointing a gun at Director Ling's head

178
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,230
and panicked.

179
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,070
Then he shot Zhang Hua dead.

180
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,570
So of course Director Ling got furious.

181
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,710
We'll deal with this later.

182
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,240
Yes, sir.

183
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:30,860
What a waste.

184
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,610
If we had kept Zhang Hua alive,

185
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,830
he might've been useful for breaking into

186
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,290
the Japanese spy network.

187
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,900
Dismissed!

188
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,560
All that effort for nothing.

189
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,670
Indeed, a pity.

190
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,570
Both Teng Ping and Zhang Hua

191
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,900
were excellent agents.

192
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,430
There's nothing to pity.

193
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,340
This is the fate of traitors.

194
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:50,660
Well,

195
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,400
you knew Teng Ping had a crush on you,

196
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,180
didn't you?

197
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,020
That's his business.

198
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,730
It has nothing to do with me.

199
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,200
You really don't act like a woman.

200
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,550
Most girls would feel a bit pleased,

201
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,640
maybe even flattered,

202
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,200
if they knew someone had a crush on them.

203
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,370
But you? You're always so stiff,

204
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,420
completely obsessed with your work.

205
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,780
Don't you have any other interests

206
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,670
or hobbies besides work?

207
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,590
This is me.

208
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,310
If it bothers you, then too bad—you'll just have to deal with it.

209
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,030
I'm not changing for anyone.

210
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,330
Fine.

211
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,430
But you know,

212
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,250
that ruthless streak of yours is actually pretty captivating.

213
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,910
After all, a poisonous flower is still a flower.

214
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,850
Here, Mom.

215
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:47,990
Take it slow.

216
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,220
Mom! Mom! Mom!

217
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:56,080
Mom.

218
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:56,620
Ma'am.

219
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,040
Mom.

220
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,040
What's wrong

221
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,060
with her?

222
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,060
Should we take her to the hospital?

223
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,700
It's her old condition acting up again.

224
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,360
I didn't expect it to flare up.

225
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:07,850
Mom,

226
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,960
lie down for a while.

227
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,620
I'll go get you some medicine.

228
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,580
Huang,

229
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,760
come with me.

230
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,380
Put on your police uniform.

231
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,540
Is this medicine fake?

232
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,630
My mother-in-law took it, but it hasn't helped at all.

233
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,590
She's been vomiting non-stop—

234
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,850
her face is all yellow.

235
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,270
Isn't that right, Huang?

236
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,950
Yeah, that's right.

237
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,300
Oh, Mrs. Tang,

238
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,910
you're wronging me here.

239
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,790
My medicine

240
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,250
is as genuine as gold!

241
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,320
I've told you before,

242
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,880
your mother-in-law's illness is rooted deep.

243
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,490
It's been with her for years.

244
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,580
There's no cure.

245
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,810
The medicine just keeps her going

246
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,330
for a couple more years.

247
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,030
Watch your mouth!

248
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,030
Are you saying we shouldn't treat her?

249
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,560
If your own mother got sick,

250
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,560
would you just let her wait to die?

251
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,230
I didn't mean that.

252
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,900
I always say,

253
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,100
your devotion is admirable.

254
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,220
Go and bring him in.

255
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,580
-Yes.
-It's unmatched in our entire area.

256
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,630
We just received those herbs.

257
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,990
For some reason, I can't seem to get the count right.

258
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,050
You check them out.

259
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,490
Alright.

260
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,580
You take care of things here.

261
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,040
I'll go take a look inside.

262
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,310
Mrs. Tang, have some tea.

263
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,470
Mrs. Tang.

264
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,630
He doesn't know how to talk properly.

265
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,160
Please don't take offense.

266
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,270
Madam.

267
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,150
Then tell me.

268
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,230
What should we do?

269
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,990
Don't worry, we'll resolve this for you.

270
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:36,650
Mrs. Jin,

271
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,580
do you have any instructions?

272
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,550
Is Captain Tang's mother

273
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,030
really that frail?

274
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,430
She's only hanging on because of the medicine.

275
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,470
Without it, she would've died long ago.

276
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,630
But honestly, staying alive like this

277
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,000
is just prolonging her suffering.

278
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,380
Then give her better medicine.

279
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,940
You mean...

280
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,790
Make sure she doesn't die.

281
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,930
But make her condition worse.

282
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,280
The sicker she looks, the better.

283
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,270
[Chief Office]

284
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,990
At this point,

285
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,869
it was clear that a massive spy network

286
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:26,550
had already infiltrated every corner of Changsha.

287
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,069
Aside from the operatives that had been identified,

288
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,030
who else was involved?

289
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,030
Where were they?

290
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,120
What information were they transmitting daily?

291
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,990
These were the urgent questions

292
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,390
that Ke Jingping needed to figure out next.

293
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,960
The person lurking in the shadows,

294
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,240
controlling this web,

295
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,550
and taking Myna's cipher key...

296
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,190
Who could they be?

297
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:04,110
Come in.

298
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,540
Where is he?

299
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,700
Dead.

300
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,010
Explain.

301
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,850
He pointed a gun at me

302
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,460
and was taken out by a sniper.

303
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,720
Didn't I tell your team to keep him alive?

304
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,280
I've already disciplined the shooter.

305
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,130
But ultimately, it's my negligence.

306
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,460
I'm willing to take full responsibility.

307
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:33,600
Chief,

308
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,780
given the circumstances,

309
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,180
the sniper had no choice.

310
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,380
Zhang Hua had gone completely rogue,

311
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,850
ready to take someone down with him.

312
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:39,970
If he hadn't fired,

313
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,920
Director Ling might have been in real danger.

314
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,780
Excuses are for the incompetent.

315
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,410
If you were more careful,

316
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,290
none of this would have happened.

317
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,440
Do you understand what this outcome means?

318
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,380
We gained nothing.

319
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,760
What I wanted wasn't a corpse—

320
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,640
I needed someone who could

321
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,770
help us tear open this Japanese spy network.

322
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,520
A dead Zhang Hua is worthless.

323
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,940
Since Myna returned to Changsha,

324
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,840
we've been spinning our wheels.

325
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,640
The only real progress we've made

326
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,970
is thanks to Yun Hongshen's solo efforts.

327
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,490
You two are the most capable people I have,

328
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,170
but right now,

329
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,210
you're both letting me down.

330
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:22,600
Hello?

331
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,880
Chief Ke,

332
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,210
is there still no progress?

333
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,240
We're still investigating.

334
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,560
Spare me the formalities.

335
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,600
I need a concrete timeline.

336
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,160
This situation is complex.

337
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,030
I can't give you an exact timeframe.

338
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,840
Do you have any idea how many soldiers are dying

339
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,440
on the frontlines every day?

340
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,600
You need to move faster—

341
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,330
get it done as soon as possible.

342
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,140
Chief,

343
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,250
don't worry.

344
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,040
It's not like we walked away empty-handed.

345
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,210
I dug into Zhang Hua's call logs

346
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,280
and found he received a suspicious call

347
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,000
on the day Jin Guoqiang was killed.

348
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,040
If the caller

349
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,250
is indeed his accomplice,

350
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,000
then we have a lead.

351
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,730
If we can get that person to talk,

352
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,320
it'll be a huge breakthrough

353
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,440
for our next move.

354
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,960
Sure, we'll investigate

355
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,810
but don't get your hopes up.

356
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,100
The moment Jin Guoqiang died,

357
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,400
whoever called Zhang Hua would've gone underground.

358
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,200
And now with Zhang Hua gone,

359
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,520
anyone connected to him will vanish too.

360
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,280
Like I said earlier,

361
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,990
we're stuck in place.

362
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,800
I've got an idea.

363
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:37,970
Go on.

364
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,850
Zhang Hua said I've met his superior.

365
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,350
Wasn't that just a smokescreen he released

366
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,210
to distract you

367
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,690
so he could grab you?

368
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,280
That's exactly what I thought at first.

369
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,760
But looking back,

370
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,810
there's more to it than that.

371
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,330
The whole "what's real is false, and what's false is real" thing.

372
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,300
While it was meant to be misleading,

373
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,750
he still revealed an important piece of intel.

374
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,270
It suggests that you might

375
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:05,120
actually know one of their operatives.

376
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,730
So,

377
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,480
if I just review all the people I've met recently,

378
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,980
narrow down the potential suspects,

379
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,280
and then investigate them one by one,

380
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,100
we might be able to make some progress.

381
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,430
Then get to it, quickly.

382
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,020
If you have any other leads,

383
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,130
you better share them now.

384
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,160
If your arrogance ends up

385
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,040
hindering our investigation,

386
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,180
you won't be able to handle the consequences.

387
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,600
Director Ling,

388
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,160
since I joined the base,

389
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,590
aside from sleeping and going to the bathroom,

390
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,190
all my actions have been open and transparent.

391
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,770
I was the one who searched Teng Ping's room,

392
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,170
but he's just a small fry,

393
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,520
not of much value.

394
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,810
As for Zhang Hua's room and office,

395
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:02,340
you and Wen Yeming already went through them.

396
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,760
I didn't touch anything.

397
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,640
I don't have more leads than you do,

398
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,990
so what do you want me to say?

399
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,510
I'm not talking about Zhang Hua.

400
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:13,960
What I want to know is the real reason

401
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,290
why you haven't handed over the codebook.

402
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,860
What if I refuse to tell you?

403
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,870
Are you going to have the Chief lock me up again?

404
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:20,310
Yes.

405
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,080
Because you don't want to be locked up.

406
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:23,840
There are things

407
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,440
you don't trust others

408
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,080
to handle for you, right?

409
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,460
Director Ling,

410
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:35,690
that's just how he is.

411
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:36,350
Wen Yeming, stay out of this.

412
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,090
I'm asking him.

413
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,890
-Stop arguing!
-Say something!

414
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,220
I allow you to have your own opinions,

415
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,620
but right now, focus on the bigger picture.

416
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,960
Yun Hongshen,

417
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,180
get me a list of the suspects as soon as possible.

418
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,840
I'll personally vet each one.

419
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:56,050
I'll also draft the entire operation plan myself.

420
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:56,600
Yes, sir.

421
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,400
Everything we discussed today

422
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,600
stays confidential.

423
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,330
Understood.

424
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,470
-Understood.
-Understood.

425
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,320
Today,

426
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,860
I received a tip-off call.

427
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,130
They said Li Miaohan

428
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,460
was fooling around with a married man

429
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,990
in her usual private room.

430
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,040
Captain,

431
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,160
we really got a report like that?

432
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,740
Strangely enough,

433
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,690
there were a bunch of tip-offs today.

434
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,020
I've recorded them all.

435
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,060
How I word them

436
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,690
is my business.

437
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,750
And even if someone

438
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,750
investigates these reports later,

439
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,780
as long as you and I keep silent,

440
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,130
no one will ever the truth

441
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,710
even if someone finds him.

442
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:35,640
Got it?

443
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,360
Understood, Captain.

444
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,820
I know where my loyalties lie.

445
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,550
I understand you're doing this for me.

446
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,680
If anyone ever asks,

447
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,380
I'll never sell you out.

448
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,520
Whoa, no need to be so dramatic.

449
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,240
I'm just warning you

450
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,520
to keep that mouth of yours in check,

451
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,440
especially after you've had a few drinks.

452
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,150
If the NBIS ever catches wind of this,

453
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:54,080
none of us will be able to get out of it.

454
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,610
Alright.

455
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,480
Got it, Captain.

456
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:09,150
[Changsha Hotel]

457
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,980
You guys need to be more careful in the future.

458
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,460
If you get reported again,

459
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:10,970
you won't get off so easily next time.

460
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:11,770
Yes, yes, yes.

461
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,800
Thank you.

462
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,490
The informant only said

463
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,680
that Li Miaohan often hangs out

464
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,490
in her private room with married men.

465
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,150
But they didn't give any specifics.

466
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,380
I'm curious—

467
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,750
who's it supposed to be?

468
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,490
That room is mainly for business meetings.

469
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,150
Whenever clients come,

470
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,630
there are attendants present.

471
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,800
There's no fooling around happening there.

472
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,280
Then she must've offended someone,

473
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,940
and now they're out to get her.

474
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,050
Maybe not here,

475
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,280
but she could've been doing something elsewhere.

476
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,020
It's no surprise someone would want to go after her.

477
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,270
We're just caught in the crossfire.

478
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:48,100
That's true.

479
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,020
So, who usually

480
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:50,980
visits her here?

481
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,570
I don't know all of them.

482
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,820
There's a director named Liu,

483
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,530
some producers, and occasionally

484
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,630
that Chamber of Commerce Chairman, Chairman Zong.

485
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,510
Chairman Zong?

486
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:04,990
Yes.

487
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:05,750
Zong Fang?

488
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,880
Yes, yes, yes.

489
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,650
Got it.

490
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:10,300
That's enough for now.

491
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:10,660
Alright.

492
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,340
Take care.

493
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,600
Grandma,

494
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,340
as long as the medicine works,

495
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,080
just let me know when you need more,

496
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,340
and I'll get it for you.

497
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,980
I can't keep letting you spend money on this.

498
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,010
Just tell Hongqi the names of the herbal doctors

499
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:29,660
and pharmacies where you get the calming medicine.

500
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:32,460
He can handle it from now on.

501
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,370
Alright.

502
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,090
Have some tea first.

503
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,220
Thank you, Grandma.

504
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:38,730
Mi Lan,

505
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,660
your injury looks better than yesterday.

506
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,260
The swelling's almost gone.

507
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,060
It was never a big deal, really.

508
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:46,850
You're just

509
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:47,760
making a fuss.

510
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:50,750
Miss Mi Lan,

511
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,220
it must be lonely for you

512
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,690
to be all by yourself.

513
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,750
Feel free to visit us more often.

514
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,200
I'd love to.

515
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,610
This place feels so much like home.

516
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,780
Well, it is a home.

517
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,770
And whenever you visit,

518
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:10,030
you can keep me company.

519
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,230
Don't be fooled by how Hongqi and Hongshen are always coming and going.

520
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,860
They're boys, after all—

521
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,830
there are some things I just can't talk to them about.

522
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,090
Of course.

523
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:21,890
As long as you don't mind,

524
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,220
I'll be happy to come by and chat with you.

525
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,630
Mind?

526
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,620
I'd be thrilled to have you over.

527
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,580
Grandma,

528
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,240
I'm back.

529
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,240
Shen is back.

530
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,370
Look at your energy—

531
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,510
you clearly didn't have a hard time.

532
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,490
I was just in training, not being tortured.

533
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,760
How could it have been hard?

534
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,960
Maybe no torture,

535
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,540
but I bet you were out there getting your hands dirty.

536
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,800
Look how messy you are!

537
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,260
Go on,

538
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,250
change your clothes.

539
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,240
Must've gotten dusty by accident.

540
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:50,740
Alright, Grandma,

541
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,850
I'll head upstairs to change.

542
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:52,820
Mi Lan, you just sit and relax.

543
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,350
Grandma,

544
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,840
I'll go help him change.

545
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,290
These two brothers—always teasing

546
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,140
and roughhousing the moment they see each other,

547
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,340
but deep down, they're close.

548
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,140
They're grown men

549
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,500
and still act like kids.

550
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,250
Come on, let's have some tea.

551
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,040
Hongqi,

552
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,970
why the sneaky look?

553
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,150
There's news

554
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,720
on Li Miaohan.

555
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:26,440
That fast?

556
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,580
Yeah. I've got a buddy named Gangzi

557
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,420
who's a small-time boss at Guangyi Rickshaw Company.

558
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,580
He's got quite a few men under him.

559
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,950
Guangyi Rickshaw Company

560
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,020
has different territories.

561
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,760
Gangzi's territory includes

562
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:44,600
the upscale spots Li Miaohan frequents.

563
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,970
He tracked

564
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,410
her recent secret meetups,

565
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,940
and I've got all the details in this notebook.

566
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,330
Plus, another friend of mine,

567
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,250
Rat,

568
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,140
who's an expert at digging up

569
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,710
rumors from the shadows,

570
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:04,560
gave me more info,

571
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,220
which I've also written down.

572
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:06,980
How's that?

573
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,660
Pretty detailed

574
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,430
thorough,

575
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,730
and useful, huh?

576
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,230
It's definitely detailed.

577
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,260
But honestly,

578
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,920
there's not a lot of valuable information here.

579
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,090
[Qu Wenzhi's Defection]

580
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:30,750
Hongqi,

581
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,130
you've been a great help this time!

582
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,200
I'm quite useful, aren't I?

583
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,370
Helped you just when you needed it,

584
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:45,950
huh?

585
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,410
Of course.

586
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,760
My big brother is a big shot in Changsha,

587
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,800
with connections everywhere.

588
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:52,000
Here,

589
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,750
give the big shot a back massage!

590
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:57,880
Cut the flattery.

591
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,310
Didn't you just say

592
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,860
there wasn't much useful info?

593
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,720
So why the sudden change of heart?

594
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:09,090
That bit about Li Miaohan having an affair

595
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,910
with Qu Wenzhi—that's crucial.

596
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,560
And her purchasing a huge amount of cigars

597
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,690
might seem innocent

598
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,970
since she's known as a socialite in Changsha,

599
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,640
but I'm more interested

600
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,020
in the man she's giving those cigars to.

601
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,020
This gives me

602
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,630
a reference point.

603
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,310
For what?

604
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,300
Li Miaohan

605
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,810
is directly linked to

606
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,540
several recent suspicious events.

607
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,770
Qu Wenzhi's defection,

608
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:35,880
Myna's murder,

609
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,640
Jin Guoqiang's car accident—

610
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,110
how could one person

611
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,860
be involved in so many incidents?

612
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:42,700
Unless

613
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,040
she herself is

614
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,940
part of these events.

615
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,860
I've known Li Miaohan for years,

616
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,120
but I never imagined

617
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,930
she could be working for the Japanese.

618
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,740
But she couldn't be

619
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,150
the one who killed Myna, right?

620
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,810
Didn't you say there were men's shoe prints

621
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:01,810
on the windowsill in the bathroom?

622
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,700
I've been trying to figure out

623
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,260
how Qu Wenzhi was turned,

624
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:10,990
but now it seems clear—

625
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,510
Li Miaohan was used to sway Qu Wenzhi.

626
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:17,300
As for Jin Guoqiang's car accident, there were two reasons behind it.

627
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:17,860
First,

628
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:18,770
it was a setup.

629
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,840
The Japanese

630
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,060
wanted to pin the blame on him,

631
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,350
making people believe

632
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,730
he was the one who killed Myna.

633
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:26,460
Second,

634
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,060
it was to divert suspicion away from Li Miaohan.

635
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,660
If she were exposed,

636
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,570
the person behind her would be in serious danger.

637
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:37,260
So the assassin we saw

638
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,820
at the Hongyun Tea House—

639
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,270
it wasn't the person you mentioned.

640
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,860
He was just an operative.

641
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:49,810
Right.

642
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,330
That killer is part of her network.

643
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,910
But who we're really after

644
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:56,900
is the one pulling the strings.

645
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,490
Hongqi, I'm not thirsty.

646
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,420
By the way, before you got back,

647
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,100
Huang had called me.

648
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,610
He mentioned that Li Miaohan

649
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,070
has a private room at the Changsha Hotel

650
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,770
that she uses for serious meetings.

651
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,090
A lot of influential people

652
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,060
frequent it,

653
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,310
some of whom were also

654
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:15,670
at that fundraising event that night.

655
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,010
Here's what I'm thinking.

656
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,580
If Li Miaohan was meeting these people

657
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:21,450
right under everyone's noses,

658
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,280
doesn't that mean

659
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,090
they're less likely to be involved?

660
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:27,150
We can probably rule them out, right?

661
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,220
Who are we talking about?

662
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:30,660
All familiar faces.

663
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,640
Remember that guy at the gala

664
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:36,420
who accused our father of being a traitor?

665
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:37,890
Xu Heng.

666
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,590
Seems like Yun Muzhi's sons have thick skin—

667
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,330
still showing their faces

668
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:44,130
after their old man's disgrace.

669
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,070
Yeah, that bastard.

670
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,060
He invested in a film company

671
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,140
and is now one of Li Miaohan's bosses.

672
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,600
Then there's Chairman Zong from the Changsha Chamber of Commerce;

673
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,310
he also has some personal connections with her,

674
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:59,080
so he's a frequent visitor to that private room.

675
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:02,970
Xu Heng's rise to prominence is recent,

676
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,430
so I don't know much about him.

677
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,710
But I've dealt with

678
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,060
Zong Fang before.

679
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:10,950
He's quite the social player—

680
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,280
not exactly reputable,

681
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,320
but not outright scandalous either.

682
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,380
Both of their names

683
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,840
showed up in this notebook.

684
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:19,890
The difference is that

685
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,590
she never brought them back to her place for the night.

686
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,280
So does that indirectly prove

687
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,780
that her relationship with these two

688
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,710
isn't that deep?

689
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:30,880
No.

690
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:32,680
Hongqi,

691
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,000
sometimes, the cleaner the relationship appears,

692
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,200
the more it's a cover.

693
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,560
We can't rule

694
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,050
these two out just yet.

695
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:43,450
Got it.

696
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,540
Young Masters,

697
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:46,640
dinner's ready!

698
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,240
Coming.

699
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,250
Let's go.

700
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:53,600
Here.

701
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,080
Mi Lan,

702
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,920
-you should eat more.
-Thank you, Grandma.

703
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,560
You know,

704
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,730
You're a bit too thin.

705
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:01,130
It's not good for girls to be so skinny.

706
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,970
Thank you, Grandma.

707
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:07,090
Jingyu,

708
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,560
if you're free after dinner,

709
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,960
how about

710
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,510
I treat you to a movie?

711
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,590
A movie?

712
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,180
The Head Nurse gave me two tickets,

713
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,280
and I don't have anyone to go with.

714
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,000
Would you join me?

715
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,090
I have some work to do later.

716
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:25,940
Why don't you ask Young Master to go with you?

717
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,430
He's free today.

718
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,090
Girls can be shy.

719
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,610
She'll feel

720
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,380
more comfortable if you go.

721
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,420
[Lily Cinema]

722
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:08,909
I'm so sorry.

723
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:10,909
I hope one day

724
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,620
you can also find your ideal partner.

725
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,489
Please don't go.

726
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:47,250
Thank you.

727
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,290
It's all fake—

728
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:52,929
they're just acting.

729
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,220
Movies are just for fun;

730
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,600
no need to take it so seriously.

731
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,780
But she acted so well.

732
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,270
It felt so real.

733
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,870
Actually, I used to really like her.

734
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:18,690
I even imagined

735
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,680
how nice it would be if I could

736
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,900
meet her in person and have a meal together.

737
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,830
That's not hard.

738
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,710
I can arrange it.

739
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,980
You two can have dinner,

740
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,310
and you can ask her yourself

741
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,970
what kind of man she likes.

742
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,130
Shen, are you alright?

743
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:45,960
Did you hurt yourself?

744
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,960
Hongqi, I'm fine.

745
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:48,830
Something urgent came up, and I need to go.

746
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:49,660
Can you take Miss Mi Lan home?

747
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,190
Alright.

748
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,320
I'm heading out now—don't worry.

749
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,200
Be careful.

750
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,260
-And come back early.
-Okay.

751
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:10,960
Who's there?

752
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,350
It's me.

753
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,770
What are you doing here?

754
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,120
I need to talk to you.

755
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:27,630
It's really important.

756
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,640
If you don't listen,

757
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,300
you'll definitely regret it.

758
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,570
Get to the point.

759
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,500
Say it and leave.

760
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,360
Do you actually have anything to say?

761
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,450
I've made two significant discoveries.

762
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,380
Spit it out.

763
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:14,940
I knew it—

764
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,630
only work catches your interest.

765
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,380
This is my first time visiting your place,

766
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,180
and you won't even offer me a drink.

767
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,310
How about offering me a glass of water?

768
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:24,680
Fine,

769
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,760
I'll get it myself.

770
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:46,090
First,

771
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,890
I've confirmed that Li Miaohan is a Japanese spy.

772
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:49,370
second,

773
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,720
the assassin who appeared at the Boya Tea House

774
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:55,030
is likely Li Miaohan's actual lover.

775
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,780
How did you figure out

776
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,680
their relationship?

777
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,970
I just watched a movie starring Li Miaohan.

778
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,150
There was a scene

779
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,500
where her lover betrays her.

780
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,200
As she watched him leave, she looked heartbroken.

781
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:11,620
That scene was acted so convincingly.

782
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,340
The way she looked at her lover in the film

783
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,780
reminded me of her expression

784
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,060
outside the Changsha Hotel that day.

785
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,320
When she looked at Jin Guoqiang,

786
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,850
there was no emotion at all—

787
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,480
it seemed so fake.

788
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,370
But when she looked at that assassin,

789
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,440
there were genuine feelings in her eyes.

790
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,240
That's right.

791
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,950
That makes sense now.

792
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,710
At the scene of Jin Guoqiang's car crash,

793
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:45,050
the person who killed him using shattered glass

794
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,110
was that assassin.

795
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,560
He could've used

796
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,880
a quicker method,

797
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,580
but he chose the most painful

798
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:57,390
and humiliating way.

799
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,040
He was venting his anger.

800
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,830
This confirms my theory with the Chief.

801
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,370
Zhang Hua knew I had met his accomplice,

802
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,490
so he tried to trap me into exposing myself.

803
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,690
The level of detail he knew

804
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,500
shows how deeply connected he is

805
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,480
with the mastermind.

806
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,950
Can you think about it?

807
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:37,880
About giving me a chance

808
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,900
to stay by your side?

809
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,800
Maybe I could protect you,

810
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,140
maybe even give you a home.

811
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,620
You don't have to envy others—

812
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,940
you can have that kind of love too.

813
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,560
You're someone

814
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,410
who deserves to be cherished.

815
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,760
Even if it's not me who gives you that love,

816
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,480
I'd still be happy for you.

817
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,850
Last night, when I was helping you,

818
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,610
I noticed your arm felt cold.

819
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,130
It's summer,

820
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,280
and last night wasn't that chilly.

821
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,840
Yet your arm was still cold.

822
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,610
This means your circulation is weak.

823
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:16,940
Ejiao is a good remedy.

824
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,080
It would be good for you.

825
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,250
As a spy,

826
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,330
you must never develop feelings,

827
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,480
especially during a mission.

828
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,720
Getting emotionally attached to your target

829
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,120
is dangerous.

830
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:42,490
It could harm

831
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,120
both you and him.

832
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,680
Kunwu's painting

833
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,140
was not just a set of instructions;

834
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:50,690
it was also a reminder

835
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:53,300
that I can't develop feelings for Hongqi.

836
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,110
I'll be careful.

837
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,310
I'll be careful.

838
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,010
Mi Lan?

839
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,580
What's wrong?

840
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:10,730
Yun Hongqi.

841
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,140
Don't waste your efforts.

842
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:14,970
There's no future for us.

843
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:21,390
Mi Lan.

844
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,600
Don't misunderstand.

845
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,100
I would never force you into anything.

846
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,620
But the way you're treating me

847
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,020
makes me feel troubled.

848
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,680
I never wanted

849
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,230
to become the mistress

850
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,630
of a prestigious family.

851
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,910
I come from a humble background, with little experience.

852
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:35,020
I don't want to be mocked

853
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,830
by your well-connected friends.

854
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:37,740
I have nothing in common

855
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,070
with other socialites;

856
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:41,050
I don't fit into your world.

857
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,430
Besides, you just said

858
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,640
my health is poor.

859
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,770
I might not be able to bear children.

860
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:49,730
I can't fulfill

861
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,690
the role of

862
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,990
a proper wife and mother.

863
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:53,470
Mi Lan,

864
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:55,630
none of that matters to me.

865
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:56,820
I only care about your well-being.

866
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,390
Everything else is irrelevant.

867
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,520
But it matters to me.

868
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,220
Living in that kind of environment

869
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,480
would drive me insane.

870
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,240
Besides, how long

871
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,990
would your feelings for me last?

872
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:10,070
Sooner or later,

873
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,100
you'll realize I'm not as good as you think.

874
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:16,420
I could be terrible,

875
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,400
and eventually, you'll lose interest.

876
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,220
If you weren't from the Yun family...

877
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,790
If you weren't Young Master Yun...

878
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,700
Zhang Hua is a dear friend of mine.
