[Episode 37]

00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,050
Hongqi.

4
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:57,310
You're back.

5
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,310
The outing Secretary Wu accompanied us on this afternoon

6
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,110
really wore him out.

7
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,910
He's been sleeping since we got back.

8
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,950
If you don't have anything urgent,

9
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,090
don't bother him.

10
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,160
Why are you looking at me like that?

11
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,930
Is there something on my face?

12
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,160
Hongqi.

13
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,380
Mi Lan is dead.

[Yun Residence]

15
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,460
Good.

16
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,790
Great!

17
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,780
Wonderful!

18
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,120
It's a pity she didn't die by my hand.

19
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,950
If Grandma knows,

20
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,430
she'll be able to rest in peace.

21
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:20,810
Hongqi,

22
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,270
when Mi Lan died,

23
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,850
she was wearing this the whole time.

24
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:44,910
Throw it away.

25
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,060
Grandma,

26
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,180
the person who caused your death is dead.

27
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,220
I know,

28
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,450
I still haven't fully repaid

29
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,710
the debt I owe you.

30
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,350
Don't worry.

31
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,200
From now on,

32
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,700
I'll live every day well.

33
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,950
I'll protect the Yun family

34
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,340
and take good care of Shen

35
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,310
to repay the debt I owe you.

36
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,909
I, Yun Hongqi, hereby swear:

37
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,790
From now on,

38
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,130
I will uphold the Yun family traditions,

39
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,290
be humble and diligent,

40
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,550
take care of my grandmother

41
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,820
and my younger brother,

42
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,790
and be a role model for the Yun family.

43
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,650
I'll never speak anything that would disgrace the Yun family,

44
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,430
never do anything that would dishonor the Yun family,

45
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,050
and shoulder the responsibility as the eldest grandson of the Yun family.

46
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,710
I'll never let personal feelings

47
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,430
disturb my judgment

48
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,850
and never make my grandmother angry.

49
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,070
I'll take care of my younger brother

50
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,190
and protect the Yun family with my life.

51
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,230
The blueprint Ling Han gave us

52
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,950
has really come in handy.

53
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,150
Whether we succeed or fail

54
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,780
is all up to you now.

55
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,990
It's only now that I realize

56
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,350
why he insisted that I give him a deadline

57
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,850
when Ling Han died.

58
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,390
When can you give me the cipher key?

59
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,800
Well...

60
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,430
I'm not sure.

61
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,550
Not sure?

62
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,480
Logically,

63
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,510
with Ling Han dead,

64
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,930
my chances of capturing Zong Fang should be higher,

65
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,159
and I should have felt more relieved,

66
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,480
even eager to capture him.

67
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,930
But instead, I was stalling.

68
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,250
Because

69
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,630
he had already confirmed that I suspected him.

70
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,000
That's why he launched

71
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,740
that crazy serial bombing case,

72
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,590
forcing you to find Zong Fang immediately.

73
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,390
Even if he was forcing me,

74
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,630
he needed a reason.

75
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,070
He knew that once I confirmed he was Kunwu,

76
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,590
I would take action immediately,

77
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,230
and it might mess up his plan.

78
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,190
He certainly wouldn't let me confirm it.

79
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,130
So,

80
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,780
he asked me to investigate the serial bombing case.

81
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,240
And after Zong Fang died,

82
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,680
he didn't force me to find the cipher key.

83
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,930
This actually made me hesitate.

84
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,180
If I hadn't found the hidden chamber,

85
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,620
I really wouldn't have been able to make up my mind.

86
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,760
I suddenly thought of a question.

87
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,470
Since Ke Jingping has already discovered

88
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,390
that you are suspecting him,

89
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,190
why doesn't he stop your investigation?

90
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,870
Because he's doing it on purpose.

91
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,880
Today, he kept me behind

92
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,870
and asked if I wanted to go to the hospital with him,

93
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,860
but I refused.

94
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,950
At that moment, he should have guessed

95
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,440
that I was plotting against him.

96
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,380
Not only did he not stop me,

97
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,140
he didn't even bother to clean up the place,

98
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,620
and just let me go in.

99
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,730
He laid everything out in front of you,

100
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,110
told you his plan,

101
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,460
and confirmed the suspicions in your mind.

102
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,050
What is his purpose?

103
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,170
He is trying to frustrate me.

104
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,220
He is trying to tell me

105
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,220
that even though I know his secret,

106
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,260
I can't do anything to him.

107
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,510
The factor you mentioned may be part of it,

108
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,730
but it is definitely not the whole purpose.

109
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:42,310
Although he has been having the upper hand,

110
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,060
he should

111
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,270
regard you

112
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,050
as a serious opponent.

113
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,630
He wouldn't underestimate you like that.

114
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:51,670
His purpose...

115
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,180
This purpose

116
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,650
will greatly assist

117
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,440
his next plan.

118
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,580
His next plan is...

119
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,090
to use you to find the cipher key.

120
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,610
But there is no clue in that hidden chamber

121
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,630
that can help me

122
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,830
find the cipher key.

123
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,540
Even if there were, I wouldn't be able to explain it in the future.

124
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,360
Anyone with common sense would guess

125
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,060
that there's something wrong

126
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,250
in the hidden chamber.

127
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,590
His purpose is certainly not this.

128
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,870
Anyway,

129
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,150
whatever it is,

130
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,590
it must be something that can lead to his ultimate goal

131
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,630
and complete his strategic deception.

132
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,710
Now, let's work backwards.

133
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,230
If, in that hidden chamber,

134
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:34,350
I had seen with my own eyes

135
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,880
the death list he made

136
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,110
and his drawings,

137
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:39,470
I could confirm that he is Kunwu,

138
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:40,260
and it would validate

139
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,070
my speculation about his strategic deception.

140
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,020
And then?

141
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,550
Then, you expose the truth to the public.

142
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,390
No.

143
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,550
If I expose the truth to the public,

144
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,550
it wouldn't be the truth anymore.

145
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,390
Once I leave,

146
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,160
he could destroy all the evidence

147
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,380
in the hidden chamber.

148
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,070
Then the photos I took

149
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,890
would be useless.

150
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:13,010
[The Hunting Operation will conclude tomorrow. Stay tuned]

151
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,750
Good.

152
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,900
Great.

153
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,580
Give my order.

154
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,390
Division 106 will depart immediately,

155
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,710
secretly cross the Hunan-Jiangxi border,

156
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,110
and launch a surprise attack on Changsha from the east.

157
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:28,810
Yes.

158
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,230
Hongshen,

159
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,060
go back and get some sleep.

160
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,780
Maybe when you wake up, you'll figure everything out.

161
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,600
I almost forgot again.

162
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,270
Here.

163
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,830
Comrade Yang asked me

164
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,280
to give this to you on the day

165
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,550
you officially join the Party.

166
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,630
I hid it before.

167
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,150
When I came back from Mi Lan's house today,

168
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,470
I brought it back.

169
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,300
Comrade Yang said that,

170
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,620
in his heart,

171
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,180
you were already the best lone hero.

172
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,910
He believed that Comrade Muzhi felt the same way.

173
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,990
They were both proud of you.

174
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,510
Yang also said that

175
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:17,240
he hoped you would finish

176
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,700
his and Comrade Muzhi's journey.

177
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,330
Yun Hongshen knows very well

178
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,200
that Ke Jingping is confident,

179
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,230
but not arrogant.

180
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,390
He can let the kite in his hands

181
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,630
fly a little further,

182
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,510
but he would never let it fly out of his sight.

183
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,530
So, at the latest, by tomorrow night,

184
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,210
Ke Jingping will start reeling in the string.

185
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,890
Yun Hongshen has already prepared to sacrifice himself.

186
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,870
He decided to do whatever it takes

187
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,310
to sabotage Ke Jingping's plan.

188
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:45,960
Dad,

189
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,070
how I wish

190
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,370
this had been handed to me by you.

191
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,370
[Military Hospital]

192
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,820
-Sir.
-Sir.

193
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,310
Leader Yun, you're here.

194
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,390
Go back

195
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,150
and get some rest.

196
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,150
I'm actually not tired.

197
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,070
Go inside now.

198
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,240
Our leader is waiting for you.

199
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,280
Wen,

200
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,750
you look in good spirits.

201
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,860
Have you missed me?

202
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,860
I...

203
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,530
brought you something to eat.

204
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:35,980
It's still warm.

205
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,180
Here.

206
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,030
I'm not very good at cooking.

207
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,800
Don't mind it.

208
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,770
I can do it myself.

209
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,540
I'm not a kid.

210
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,350
It's not appropriate for you to feed me.

211
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,660
Come on.

212
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,580
You need to give me a chance to prove myself.

213
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:53,430
Come on. Be good.

214
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,840
Otherwise, it'll get cold.

215
00:11:59,190 --> 00:11:59,990
Not bad.

216
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,500
Have another bite.

217
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,230
I also bought some other food.

218
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,470
Do you want to try some?

219
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,740
No.

220
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,580
By the way,

221
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,830
I

222
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,750
brought you something good.

223
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,390
This is something

224
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,310
my mom and grandma

225
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,320
got for me from the temple

226
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,790
when I was little.

227
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,030
It was because I was always getting sick

228
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,220
and not in good health.

229
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,830
Ever since I got this amulet,

230
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,290
I haven't been sick at all.

231
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,950
I'm giving this to you now

232
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,550
to bless you with safety throughout your life.

233
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,210
You should keep it for yourself.

234
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,980
I've already given it to you.

235
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,310
Take it.

236
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,320
It's from your boyfriend.

237
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:54,870
Bye.

238
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,660
He's already gone, and you're still looking?

239
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,020
Madam,

240
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,400
just wait a few more hours.

241
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,960
When Leader Yun gets off work,

242
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,180
he'll be able to come and see you.

243
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,470
Dongping,

244
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,430
do you know how to knit sweaters?

245
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:23,680
Yes.

246
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,530
Do you want to learn? I can teach you.

247
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,000
You really are different now.

248
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,860
Leader Yun is really something.

249
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,230
He melted you, an iceberg.

250
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,210
Who's an iceberg?

251
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,320
The cigarettes he smokes,

252
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,150
the matches

253
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,070
and pencils he uses,

254
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,210
can be bought anywhere on the streets.

255
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,630
There's no way to trace them.

256
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,040
And the papers and map he left behind

257
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,430
don't have any distinctive markings.

258
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,330
Anyway, I can't find any clues

259
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,350
related to the cipher key from these things.

260
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,630
What do you think, Yun Hongshen?

261
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,350
I think the cigarettes he smokes

262
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:08,790
could be one of

263
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,510
the clues we need to find the cipher key.

264
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,650
Zong Fang is on the run,

265
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,470
and he's carrying such an important mission.

266
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,120
So aside from some essentials,

267
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,590
he wouldn't have taken the risk

268
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,070
of exposing himself just to buy something

269
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:20,890
like cigarettes.

270
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:21,940
Wait a minute.

271
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,430
Let me jump in here.

272
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,660
He was exposed the day before yesterday,

273
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,440
but his accomplice wasn't.

274
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,330
Xu Zhaodi is very likely the one who bought him this pack of cigarettes.

275
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,900
Of course, Xu Zhaodi could help him buy them.

276
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,620
But considering Zong Fang's previous

277
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,500
social status and lifestyle,

278
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:38,950
she wouldn't have bought him cigarettes like this.

279
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,620
Because these cigarettes are very cheap

280
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,770
and are mostly consumed by the lowest-tier citizens.

281
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,190
So, he must have gotten them himself.

282
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,670
But didn't you say

283
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,760
he wouldn't buy them himself?

284
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,940
He certainly wouldn't buy them proactively.

285
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,350
But if he were in

286
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,340
a relatively safe situation,

287
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,630
he wouldn't refuse to take the pack of cigarettes.

288
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,550
I think I understand your point.

289
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,950
What you're saying is that

290
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,210
our people are looking for Zong Fang everywhere.

291
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:05,970
There's no place

292
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,200
that's relatively safe for him.

293
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,600
The kind of situation you mentioned is one where,

294
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,950
based on his needs for survival

295
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,120
or the task at hand,

296
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,530
he had to do something.

297
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,790
And while doing it, under the condition

298
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,890
that he wouldn't increase any risk,

299
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,370
he got that pack of cigarettes.

300
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,350
For example,

301
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,510
when he was stealing medicine in a pharmacy,

302
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,470
he might have seen a pack of cigarettes on the counter

303
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,700
and just taken it.

304
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:24,420
Yes.

305
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:25,910
He must have gotten it

306
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,700
during the process of completing the task.

307
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,120
You mean

308
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,510
he got this pack of cigarettes

309
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,470
while hiding the cipher key?

310
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,590
The place where he hid the cipher key

311
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,020
is a cigarette factory

312
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,590
or a cigarette shop?

313
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,120
No.

314
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,360
I'm sure it's not.

315
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,980
Before Zong Fang died, he said,

316
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,120
"You won't find it."

317
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,950
When he said this,

318
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,420
it reminded me of Zhang Hua.

319
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,910
Who is your contact?

320
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,840
You've met him before, haven't you?

321
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,470
What Zhang Hua said

322
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,250
contained real information,

323
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,130
which is that I really have seen his contact—

324
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,110
Zong Fang.

325
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,110
Before Zong Fang died, he said,

326
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:02,940
"You won't find it."

327
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,390
When he said the word "you,"

328
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,760
it seemed like he emphasized it particularly.

329
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,330
That "you" represented a certain emotion at the time.

330
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,310
He must have hated me a lot,

331
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,770
and since I asked about the cipher key,

332
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,110
he felt that the fact that I wouldn't find it

333
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,700
was a way of getting back at me.

334
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,030
So, "I won't find it"

335
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,740
is the key information in this sentence.

336
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:18,790
Yun Hongshen,

337
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,290
are you saying

338
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,830
that the place where he hid the cipher key

339
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,880
is a blind spot in your thinking?

340
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,150
No matter how hard you think,

341
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,270
you can't figure out where it could be,

342
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,670
so you can't find it, right?

343
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,250
Yes.

344
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,500
Currently, these are the two most crucial clues.

345
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,390
One is me,

346
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,390
and the other is that pack of cigarettes.

347
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,440
As long as we connect the two,

348
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,490
we might be able to find the cipher key.

349
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,160
[Investigation statistics Bureau]

350
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,470
A place I can't think of?

351
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,950
Where wouldn't I think to look?

352
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,070
Wen Yeming's house?

353
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,380
The Girls' School?

354
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:57,750
Mi Lan's house?

355
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,530
None of these seem right.

356
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,550
Where could it be?

357
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:03,900
Leader Yun.

358
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,829
Why are you back at work?

359
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,260
Didn't I tell you to go home and get some sleep?

360
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,310
I have something on my mind.

361
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,630
I can't sleep if I go back.

362
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,589
What is it?

363
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:17,790
It's about the rickshaw company.

364
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:19,829
I went to the rickshaw company.

365
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,349
The day Ling Han died,

366
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:22,430
didn't we intercept Mi Lan and Zong Fang

367
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,020
at the train station?

368
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,630
Later, Xu Zhaodi

369
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,869
saved them.

370
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:28,430
We found the rickshaw

371
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,110
they discarded in an alley

372
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,920
two streets away from the train station.

373
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,320
But there were no witnesses.

374
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,630
Leader Wen then asked me to check with the rickshaw company

375
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,010
to see if any rickshaw driver

376
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,920
had picked up passengers in that alley during that time.

377
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,390
The rickshaw company found the rickshaw driver?

378
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,170
Yes.

379
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,840
A rickshaw driver said that during that time,

380
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,990
near Mishi Street,

381
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,430
he gave a ride to a strange old man.

382
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,570
How was he strange?

383
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,190
He kept his face covered with a scarf

384
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,390
and didn't look up at him.

385
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,110
So, the rickshaw driver had quite an impression of him.

386
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,630
And then?

387
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,570
Where did he get off?

388
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,430
Xiangjun Road.

389
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,800
Xiangjun Road?

390
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,950
It's not close to Mi Lan's house.

391
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,020
So, that means

392
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,260
he hid the codebook first,

393
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,580
then went back to Mi Lan's house.

394
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,700
What place near Xiangjun Road

395
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,440
could he have gotten cigarettes from

396
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,480
and I can't think of?

397
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,300
Getting cigarettes happened

398
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,110
while he was hiding the cipher key.

399
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,020
He didn't buy them or steal them.

400
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,200
Did he rob someone?

401
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,110
No.

402
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,790
He had no reason to rob.

403
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,100
Unless he robbed a dead person.

404
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:34,750
Captain Tang,

405
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,470
go and check immediately

406
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,270
whether anyone died near Xiangjun Road

407
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,100
after 7:30 PM the day before yesterday.

408
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,430
Or if the dead person

409
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,840
lived near Xiangjun Road.

410
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,230
The dead person was a lower-class citizen.

411
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,850
Okay, thank you.

412
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,680
Leader Yun,

413
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,710
we are a family now.

414
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,170
Could you take me with you?

415
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,420
I alone would be fine.

416
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,760
But what if there's an ambush?

417
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,580
I can keep watch for you if I go.

418
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:59,550
Don't worry.

419
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,550
There won't be an ambush.

420
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:03,670
Go back.

421
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,930
I'll take you with me next time we have an operation.

422
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:07,910
Okay.

423
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,320
By the way,

424
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,730
after dinner, I dozed off for a bit.

425
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,020
But I couldn't sleep well.

426
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,230
I kept waking up,

427
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,120
having this strange feeling like someone was walking outside.

428
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,190
So the footsteps Secretary Wu mentioned were his.

429
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,860
He was right about me not being able to find it.

430
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,440
That's a place I really wouldn't think to look.

431
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,180
Hello?

432
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,020
Captain Tang,

433
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:35,550
go ahead.

434
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,760
Okay.

435
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:51,620
Hongqi,

436
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,640
will you be home later?

437
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:54,940
I forgot my keys

438
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:55,890
and need to go back home.

439
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,670
Stay at Hei's with peace of mind for now.

440
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,070
Come back after it's safe.

441
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,650
If anything unexpected happens,

442
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,300
you must tell me immediately.

443
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:07,990
Drive slowly.

444
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,790
Be careful.

445
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,410
Don't worry.

446
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,510
When Yun Hongshen goes to get the cipher key later,

447
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,660
go with him.

448
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,150
Later?

449
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,420
He can figure it out that quickly?

450
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,070
No way.

451
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,680
This isn't like

452
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,600
the serial bombing case.

453
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,830
Yun Hongshen was able to guess

454
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,790
the serial bombing case designed by Ling Han

455
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,910
because the fact that Ling Han went to the archive

456
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,350
was suspicious in itself.

457
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,950
If I had enough time,

458
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,030
I could have figured it out too.

459
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:38,090
But the cipher key is not like that.

460
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,640
First of all, there are no useful clues

461
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,540
to find the cipher key at all.

462
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,160
I don't think that pack of cigarettes counts.

463
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,510
Because no one knows where he went

464
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,990
from the day before yesterday to last night,

465
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,610
when we killed Ling Han.

466
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,990
There are too many possibilities for how he got that pack of cigarettes.

467
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,430
Also,

468
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,080
the situation Yun Hongshen mentioned was just a speculation.

469
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,500
It's possible that the pack of cigarettes was already with Zong Fang.

470
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,070
And most importantly,

471
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,790
the blind spot in thinking he mentioned.

472
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,000
Since it's a blind spot,

473
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,070
it means it's a place he wouldn't easily think of.

474
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,310
Could he suddenly step out

475
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,590
of his blind spot in thinking?

476
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,600
So it's not too harsh to say you're stupid.

477
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:10,870
This is where Yun Hongshen

478
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,520
is better than all of you.

479
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,030
Since he knows Zong Fang

480
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,670
used his blind spot in thinking,

481
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,510
he'll surely focus on this aspect.

482
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,200
Do you understand?

483
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,490
Come in.

484
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,460
Chief,

485
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,250
I know where the cipher key is hidden.

486
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,200
Where is it?

487
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,720
My house.

488
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,020
Your house?

489
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,060
That's a good place.

490
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,140
Not to mention you,

491
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,480
no one can guess it.

492
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,380
Shut up!

493
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,320
Are you sure?

494
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,410
I'm pretty sure.

495
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,290
Chen Dongping checked with the rickshaw company.

496
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,420
The night before last,

497
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,490
a rickshaw driver

498
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,170
picked up a passenger near the spot where Xu Zhaodi discarded the rickshaw,

499
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,830
which was near Mishi Street.

500
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,810
The passenger was Zong Fang.

501
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,750
He got off at Xiangjun Road.

502
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,080
It is very close to his house,

503
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,000
only a five-minute walk.

504
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,390
I already called Captain Tang to confirm.

505
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,590
The night before last,

506
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,560
a family on Xiangjun Road

507
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,680
had a son who died.

508
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,070
Normally, he works late until about 10 PM at most,

509
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,090
but that night,

510
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,520
he didn't go home.

511
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:08,670
The next morning,

512
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,230
a cleaner found his body

513
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,430
on Qiushui Road.

514
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,550
All his belongings,

515
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,950
including his coat, were missing.

516
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,950
In other words, when Zong Fang went to your house,

517
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,400
that person saw him,

518
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,420
so he killed him to silence him and took the pack of cigarettes.

519
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,460
That's right.

520
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,640
Yesterday, when I was searching Mi Lan's house,

521
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,010
I found a Chinese-style long shirt

522
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,030
in her wardrobe.

523
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,930
There's a wonton stall on the street

524
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,040
behind my house.

525
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,450
The owner usually opens the stall every day,

526
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,470
except when it's windy or raining.

527
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,800
I suspect

528
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,390
the victim must have spilled this wonton on Zong Fang

529
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,390
by accident

530
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,270
on his way home after working overtime.

531
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,950
That's when they saw each other.

532
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,160
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

533
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,110
I'm sorry.

534
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,750
He really did find a good hiding place for the cipher key.

535
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,110
Stop talking so much.

536
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,260
You two hurry up and go get the cipher key back.

537
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,930
I'll call the Commander right now

538
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,290
and ask him to send someone to get the intelligence.

539
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:00,990
Chief,

540
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,510
how about...

541
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,310
you make the call

542
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,230
after we get the cipher key back?

543
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,350
What if I guessed wrong?

544
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,570
It's rare to see you so lacking in confidence.

545
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:10,620
You should go soon.

546
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,110
The sooner this matter ends,

547
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,500
the sooner everyone can get a good sleep.

548
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,130
Yes.

549
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,050
Go now.

550
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:16,590
Let's go.

551
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,470
The Chief was right.

552
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,050
I've been sleepless over this for more than half a month.

553
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,830
If this keeps up, I'll die young.

554
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,230
Commander,

555
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,230
this is Ke Jingping.

556
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,830
You can send someone to get the intelligence now.

557
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:39,510
Young Master,

558
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,240
you didn't go out today?

559
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,450
Because Director Gong honored my humble abode with his presence.

560
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,630
How could I dare to go out?

561
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,150
Young Master, you're flattering me.

562
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,200
Your official task comes first.

563
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:50,820
Please.

564
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,790
Where do you think Zong Fang

565
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:59,680
would hide the cipher key?

566
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,550
Isn't my own room

567
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,040
the last place I would think of?

568
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,750
Searching your own room by yourself

569
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,850
does feel a bit odd, right?

570
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,750
No need to look in places where bugs could be planted easily.

571
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,040
People in our line of work

572
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,680
always do regular checks of their homes.

573
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,470
So, Zong Fang couldn't have hidden

574
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,990
the cipher key in a place like that.

575
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,650
That narrows it down quite a bit.

576
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,600
Let's begin.

577
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,590
This is a scrap of paper?

578
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,710
What did you find?

579
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:57,610
Madmen.

580
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,410
They're all mad!

581
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,020
Everyone on Ling Han's team is really bold.

582
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,930
They dared to leave it out in the open like this.

583
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,680
If one day you couldn't sleep

584
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,160
and picked up a book, it would be exposed.

585
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:08,630
Clearly,

586
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,350
I don't like reading.

587
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,310
I've read these books

588
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,700
when I was in my teens.

589
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,250
I suspect Mi Lan has secretly been here already.

590
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,470
Flowers in the Mirror?

591
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,300
Adjutant Chen.

592
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,230
Chief Ke.

593
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,410
The Commander sent me to get the intelligence.

594
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,920
The cipher key has been found.

595
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,290
It's on its way here.

596
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,140
What exactly is this cipher key?

597
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,180
Let's talk inside.

598
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:56,980
Please.

599
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,920
This is Myna's codebook.

600
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,280
All the intelligence is written in it.

601
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,710
Two catties of cucumber.

602
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,810
Eight taels of tomatoes.

603
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,700
What is all this nonsense?

604
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,430
These are encrypted.

605
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,270
But Yun Hongshen has cracked the code.

606
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,140
This is the cipher for the intelligence?

607
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,970
With it, you can decode the intelligence.

608
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:26,760
How?

609
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,140
That requires the cipher key.

610
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:31,010
The book you mentioned earlier?

611
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:31,950
That's right.

612
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,230
Look.

613
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:35,630
We need this.

614
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,560
In each group of six digits in the book,

615
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,870
the first two digits are the page number,

616
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,290
the middle two digits are the line number,

617
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,760
and the last two digits are the word number.

618
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,560
For example, 280513 in the center

619
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,060
means the 28th page,

620
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,680
the 5th line,

621
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,590
and the 13th word.

622
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:52,960
I see.

623
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,620
This method is both secure and simple.

624
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,090
If you don't know which book the cipher key is,

625
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,800
it's impossible to crack the code.

626
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:00,950
However,

627
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,320
if you have the cipher key,

628
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,560
anyone can decrypt it.

629
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,300
That's right.

630
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,320
When the cipher key arrives later,

631
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,590
you can decrypt it yourself.

632
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,510
Me?

633
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,490
Isn't it inappropriate?

634
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,700
No one is more appropriate to do it than you.

635
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,160
Chief Ke, you are indeed a cautious person.

636
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:17,520
Is this really necessary?

637
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,360
Of course it is.

638
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,590
There are still hidden dangers

639
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,900
within our station.

640
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:54,310
Chief.

641
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,180
We found the cipher key.

642
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,750
Give it to Adjutant Chen.

643
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,000
Good work, everyone.

644
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,830
On behalf of the soldiers at the front

645
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,690
and the people of Changsha,

646
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,310
I thank you all

647
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,680
for the sacrifices and efforts you've made for this intelligence.

648
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,210
Thank you.

649
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,030
Goodbye.

650
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:13,980
Wait.

651
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:20,860
Adjutant Chen.

652
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:27,850
This intelligence is fake.

653
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,470
What did you say?

654
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,560
Fake?

655
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,990
Weren't Myna's cipher key and codebook

656
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,590
brought back by you?

657
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:50,710
How could they be fake?

658
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,350
Yun Hongshen,

659
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,050
this is no joke.

660
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:04,810
We've all been fooled by him.

661
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,870
Ling Han is not Kunwu.

662
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:11,340
He is.

663
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,790
Yun Hongshen, are you out of your mind?

664
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,980
Do you know what you're talking about?

665
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:26,140
He was turned ten years ago.

666
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:27,750
The outstanding graduates from that year at Huangpu Military Academy

667
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,490
went to Japan for a short-term training program.

668
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,290
He was led astray by a Japanese female spy,

669
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,580
who is now his wife,

670
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,540
and became a lackey of the Japanese.

671
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:39,650
Are you done?

672
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:42,680
Okay.

673
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,640
Then let me ask you.

674
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,230
If I were the Japanese spy

675
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,310
like you said,

676
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,230
why didn't I

677
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,720
let Mi Lan take the codebook yesterday?

678
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,790
If she had taken the codebook yesterday,

679
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,690
it would already be in Japanese hands by now.

680
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,610
Why would I go through all this trouble?

681
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:56,590
Because your ultimate goal

682
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,470
is for Adjutant Chen to take this fake intelligence.

683
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,490
You personally orchestrated a strategic deception plan.

684
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,130
You released this fake intelligence,

685
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,850
creating an illusion that it is crucial.

686
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,110
After everyone believed it,

687
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:12,190
you let it fall into the hands of the NBIS.

688
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,640
On the one hand, you, as the station chief, will take the credit,

689
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,420
and on the other hand,

690
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,150
once this fake intelligence

691
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,520
is in the Commander's hands,

692
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,030
he will base his battle plans on it.

693
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,010
That way, our National Revolutionary Army

694
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,140
will fall right into the Japanese trap.

695
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:26,350
By then,

696
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,570
could Changsha even be defended?

697
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,560
Good story.

698
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,970
You've said so much. Do you have any evidence?

699
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,340
You treat every one of us as a pawn.

700
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,140
Qu Wenzhi, Myna, Zhang Hua,

701
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,240
Zong Fang, Ling Han,

702
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,670
and even me and Wen Yeming.

703
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,430
You are pulling the strings behind the scenes,

704
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,890
leading me into this mess,

705
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,590
just to use me

706
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,500
to get the fake intelligence from Myna

707
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,880
and hand it to the Commander,

708
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:04,220
right?

709
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,590
Where did you find these things?

710
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:13,889
The evidence is in your hidden chamber.

711
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,210
Dare you take us there to have a look?

712
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,320
Chief,

713
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,710
you have a hidden chamber?

714
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,159
Chief Ke,

715
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,310
then please take us to see it.

716
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,550
No problem.

717
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,250
Yun Hongshen, I'm telling you.

718
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,590
It's best to leave yourself an out when doing things,

719
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,440
or the consequences will be ugly.

720
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,190
I originally wanted to resolve this with you privately,

721
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,390
but you insisted on making it bigger

722
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,460
in front of Adjutant Chen.

723
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,420
I don't understand.

724
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,550
Between the photos Yun Hongshen just showed us

725
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,720
in the meeting room

726
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:16,890
and these,

727
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,500
which ones are real?

728
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,210
And the strategic deception—

729
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:23,100
who's deceiving whom?

730
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,070
What do you understand?

731
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,680
The photos are very clear.

732
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,960
The one who's doing the strategic deception is Yun Hongshen,

733
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,770
not me.

734
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:35,870
Adjutant Chen,

735
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,710
this isn't the place for talking.

736
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,500
Let's talk somewhere else.

737
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,270
Shen has been acting weird since early this morning.

738
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,180
Just now, he came back with someone,

739
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,120
all mysterious.

740
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:58,620
Something must have happened to him.

741
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:02,570
Young Master.

742
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,530
They are Second Young Master's colleagues.

743
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,960
Can't you take care of everything at once?

744
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,990
One group has just left, and now another one's here.

745
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,520
Do you think Yun's Residence is a market?

746
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,550
Our Chief is asking you to go to the station.

747
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,180
Wait.

748
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,030
What do you mean by "go to the station?"

749
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,210
What do you want to do?

750
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,100
Just tell us.

751
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,240
It's a secret.

752
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:22,870
It's a secret?

753
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,030
Then there's nothing to talk about.

754
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,360
Get out of Yun's Residence.

755
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,340
Dao.

756
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,340
I should go.

757
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:34,280
After all, Chief Ke is Shen's boss.

758
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,790
I have to give him some respect.

759
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,360
Young Master.

760
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:40,950
Secretary Wu.

761
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,270
Didn't the Chief tell you what happened?

762
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:53,810
No.

763
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,050
He just told you to go to the station now.

764
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,050
Hurry up.

765
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,640
Something must have happened to Yun Hongshen.

766
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,760
Write down everything you saw.

767
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,560
[Bureau of Investigation and Statistics]

768
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,410
Chief,

769
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,320
your guest has arrived.

770
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:50,840
You may leave.

771
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:04,790
Yun Hongshen,

772
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,840
you're the type who only learns when it's too late, aren't you?

773
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,310
Guards!

774
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,680
Let my guest in.

775
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,630
Chief Cheng?

776
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,100
Hello.

777
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,340
Hello, Chief Cheng.

778
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,560
Hello, Chief Ke.

779
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:27,400
Have a seat.

780
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,350
Okay.

781
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,670
I believe that among everyone present,

782
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,310
except for Deputy Chief Zhu and Wen Yeming,

783
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,270
who have met Chief Cheng,

784
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:45,680
the rest of you don't know him.

785
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,660
Let me introduce him.

786
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,230
This is

787
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,470
Chief Cheng Huize from the NBIS Shanghai Station.

788
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,470
Chief Cheng,

789
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,610
This is the adjutant to the Commander of the Ninth War Zone.

790
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,500
Nice to meet you.

791
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:04,760
I'm Cheng Huize,

792
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,070
Chief of Shanghai Station.

793
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:06,950
This time,

794
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,830
at the invitation of Chief Ke,

795
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,160
I specifically came to Changsha

796
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,520
to assist in the investigation of Yun Hongshen's treason.

797
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:19,510
This matter might seem puzzling to you.

798
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:21,910
Yun Hongshen betraying the country?

799
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,460
How could that be?

800
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,600
His father, Yun Muzhi, was killed by the Japanese.

801
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,340
How could he possibly work for the Japanese?

802
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:31,400
Is he an animal?

803
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,480
But in fact, he did.

804
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,650
How to explain that?

805
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,180
The only reasonable explanation

806
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:45,280
is that Yun Muzhi didn't die.

807
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:50,320
Of course.

808
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:51,750
Words alone are not enough to prove this.

809
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:57,920
Chief Ke.

810
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:09,320
In fact, through these photos,

811
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:11,030
we can prove that

812
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,070
on that day,

813
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,370
Yun Muzhi

814
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:16,790
was not shot dead at the entrance of Fusheng Tea House.

815
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:17,970
Of course,

816
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,080
Yun Hongshen and the other three

817
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,220
were captured by the Japanese.

818
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,140
Myna managed to escape

819
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:23,790
and fled Shanghai.

820
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,320
The news

821
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,720
then flowed out of Shanghai.

822
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:29,020
In order to recover their losses,

823
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,290
the Japanese found Yun Hongshen

824
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,930
and used Yun Muzhi's life as a bargaining chip

825
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:36,470
to make Yun Hongshen work for them.

826
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,130
That is the truth.

827
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,710
You've all seen it, right?

828
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:48,280
By the way, I have something else here.

829
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:01,950
Yun Hongshen,

830
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:05,230
this suitcase is the one you retrieved

831
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:07,140
from the pawnshop yesterday morning, right?

832
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,200
Answer me. Yes or no?

833
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:21,010
Yes.

834
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,090
So, what's inside it?

835
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:32,140
Is it something you can't say or just don't want to say?

836
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:34,950
Okay, I'll help you.

837
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,630
Everyone, look how clear this photo is.

838
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,430
You can even clearly see

839
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,860
the date on the newspaper.

840
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,090
Yun Hongshen, you claimed

841
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,990
that your father was killed by the Japanese.

842
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:00,750
Then let me ask you,

843
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:02,450
who is the person in this photo?
