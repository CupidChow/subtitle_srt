00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,820
[Episode 26]

3
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,270
Young man,

4
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,590
if I'm not mistaken,

5
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,509
you've detained me here

6
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,300
to ensure my safety, right?

7
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,750
What's wrong?

8
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:51,850
There's a man over there;

9
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,470
seems to be some big shot.

10
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,000
If you had disembarked first,

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,040
they would have immediately recognized

12
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,070
that you were that important figure.

13
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,090
They would target you to create chaos.

14
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,920
That way, they'd have a chance to rescue Mister

15
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,620
and protect their secrets.

16
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,270
Unfortunately, they failed anyway.

17
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,790
Whether it's to use you in exchange for Mister

18
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,630
or to seek revenge,

19
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,110
you are their primary target.

20
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,950
Comparatively,

21
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,660
it's safer for you to remain on the ship.

22
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,410
Unless they want to go down with you,

23
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,840
they won't harm Mister.

24
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,670
So,

25
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:23,690
you cooperated with me earlier,

26
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,100
letting the decoy get off the boat first

27
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,790
and luring the Japanese spies on shore to act.

28
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,630
That way, we could catch them all in one fell swoop.

29
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,950
Good.

30
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,550
Your thinking is clear and logical.

31
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:32,579
Well done.

32
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,430
However, I'm curious.

33
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,140
Who are you?

34
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,570
I am Yun Hongshen.

35
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:53,920
What's wrong with you?

36
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,190
Do you have an upset stomach?

37
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,850
My stomach hurts badly.

38
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,960
Sir,

39
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,570
could you let him use the restroom first?

40
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,910
We can't let him... here, right?

41
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,660
Why are you making such a fuss?

42
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,480
Come with me.

43
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,590
There's someone up there.

44
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,940
Protect the target!

45
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,560
Yes, sir.

46
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,400
He's dead.

47
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,060
What's Yun Hongshen's issue?

48
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,670
Just because someone has died?

49
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,750
Deputy Chief,

50
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,230
Leader Wen is upset.

51
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,500
Who would be happy when someone dies?

52
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,050
It's unreasonable.

53
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,980
Deputy Chief Zhu, that's the promising talent

54
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,750
that you and Chief Ke have trained.

55
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,520
Mr. Shi, you flatter me.

56
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,190
I dare not take credit.

57
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,960
It's all thanks to the Chief's eye for talent.

58
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,870
Now the outside is secure.

59
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:11,930
You can go out now.

60
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,820
Please, Mr. Shi.

61
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,480
As if you have nothing to fear.

62
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,090
Get out.

63
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,080
I'm not their target.

64
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,480
I wouldn't be in any danger.

65
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,640
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,260
I couldn't catch Zong Fang.

67
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,950
It's alright.

68
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:51,670
We'll surely think of other ways.

69
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,080
So, you have a weakness too.

70
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,900
Who is Mister?

71
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,360
I understand now.

72
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,980
You two are both Mister.

73
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,350
To be precise,

74
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,300
the two of you together are "Mister."

75
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,760
It seems

76
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,070
that one of them has the dispatch list,

77
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,770
while the other holds the contact code.

78
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:23,790
If either of you were missing,

79
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,710
the dispatch list wouldn't be complete.

80
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,590
Because you two are twins.

81
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,480
You two look exactly alike.

82
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,350
If you had openly boarded the same boat

83
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,630
while pretending not to know each other,

84
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,240
it would have definitely aroused suspicion.

85
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,830
So, you disguised yourself

86
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,900
as someone who has recently lost their father.

87
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,190
Because most people are very sensitive about matters of mourning,

88
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:44,150
they definitely wouldn't keep staring at you.

89
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,070
If you're exposed,

90
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,630
you can still confuse... them too,

91
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,750
because most people

92
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,150
wouldn't make the right judgment

93
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,760
when confronted with two identical people.

94
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:56,190
Unfortunately, I'm an exception.

95
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,730
You won't find it.

96
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,270
Such important stuff;

97
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,590
how could it possibly be

98
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,750
so easily found by others?

99
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:03,990
Unless...

100
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,590
we give you a hint.

101
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,260
No cleaning is needed here. Go away.

102
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:25,780
In my life,

103
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,170
I hate being threatened by others the most,

104
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,560
especially when they use the girl I love to threaten me.

105
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,820
Do you think you can bear the consequences of this?

106
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,470
Don't overestimate yourself.

107
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,740
You won't get anything.

108
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,310
Madam,

109
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,270
are you alright?

110
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:16,870
We're fine.

111
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,100
We weren't their target.

112
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,760
Go check and see

113
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,260
if there are any stragglers or loose ends.

114
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,120
Yes, sir.

115
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,800
We need to find the dispatch list.

116
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,310
It's something so important.

117
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,020
They wouldn't have kept it on them.

118
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,940
We must have overlooked

119
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,110
some critical detail.

120
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,910
How could they ensure the list

121
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,710
wouldn't be easily found,

122
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,100
or even if found, wouldn't be easily deciphered?

123
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:01,820
Unless

124
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,400
they themselves were the list.

125
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:25,780
Chief.

126
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,290
Chief.

127
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,590
How did they die?

128
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,030
They were silenced.

129
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,600
But we've got the list.

130
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,370
The two of them together were Mister.

131
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,070
If they were still alive,

132
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,570
we could have gotten more information.

133
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,710
I don't think the Japanese would have sent people

134
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,740
who knew core secrets to deliver the list.

135
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,430
So the only value these two Japanese spies had

136
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,160
was this list.

137
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,170
It's unlikely that they knew anything else.

138
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,490
If only you were always this quick-witted.

139
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,130
What do you mean?

140
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,860
You failed to recognize someone of importance when he was right in front of you.

141
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,130
You keep causing trouble for me.

142
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,030
Hello?

143
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,710
Minister Yang,

144
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,340
the furniture set you ordered

145
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,450
may not be ready for delivery this month.

146
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,110
One of our workers

147
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,300
suddenly fell ill and died.

148
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,900
We're really short-handed.

149
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,060
I'm afraid we'll have to trouble you to wait a bit longer.

150
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,280
We're really sorry about this,

151
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,130
Minister Yang.

152
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:23,990
Alright.

153
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,350
I'll wait a bit longer then.

154
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,170
What exactly happened at the dock?

155
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,950
After the Japanese fabricated

156
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,590
the so-called "Reserve Notes,"

157
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,190
Yun Muzhi and Yang Ziming

158
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,280
jointly planned a Gold Strike Operation.

159
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,150
The operation

160
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,220
was to transfer the Bank of France's gold reserves away

161
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,680
right under the Japanese's noses.

162
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,070
Hide it first

163
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,000
and then find another right opportunity

164
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,950
to transport it to the anti-Japanese base areas in the enemy rear.

165
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,520
Zhang Xiancheng was in charge of the Gold Strike Operation.

166
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,740
The phone call yesterday morning

167
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,290
was from him.

168
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,580
Mr. Yang,

169
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,170
I'm your real estate agent.

170
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,160
I'm returning to my hometown tomorrow to stay with relatives.

171
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,130
I'm afraid I'll have to leave your property in someone else's care.

172
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,790
Zhang Xiancheng delivered two messages during the call:

173
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:12,580
First,

174
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,590
something went wrong with the Gold Strike Operation,

175
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,410
and he had to evacuate immediately.

176
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,460
Second,

177
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,100
he would rush to Changsha

178
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,040
to report to Yang Ziming in person.

179
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,220
Watch out!

180
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,970
Unfortunately, he was killed before he could make contact.

181
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,850
This leaves Yang Ziming not only grieving

182
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,510
but also deeply worried.

183
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,140
What exactly went wrong with the Gold Strike Operation?

184
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,900
Why did the Organization know nothing about it?

185
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,030
Comrade Yang,

186
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,900
Comrade Zhang Xiancheng has been killed.

187
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,640
Du has already called me.

188
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,350
What should we do now?

189
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,960
Last night, we received a telegram from our superiors saying

190
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,470
that the recipient was unreachable

191
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,470
and asked us to investigate.

192
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,670
But only Comrade Zhang Xiancheng knew

193
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,460
what had exactly happened in Shanghai.

194
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,490
With his death,

195
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,110
all the real intelligence has essentially gone.

196
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:10,890
Not necessarily.

197
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:12,990
What do you mean?

198
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,630
When Comrade Zhang Xiancheng was killed,

199
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,570
was Nighthawk at the scene?

200
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,200
Yes,

201
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,350
he was there.

202
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:20,610
Good.

203
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,870
Tell me everything that happened at the scene,

204
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,810
exactly as it occurred.

205
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,310
Second Young Master,

206
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,470
may I leave now?

207
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,500
Where have you seen me before?

208
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,470
You probably don't know yet.

209
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,240
Qi and Zhou have safely returned home.

210
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,070
Are you going back to Shanghai?

211
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:49,790
Yes.

212
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,230
The NBIS has assigned me a new mission.

213
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,460
When are you leaving?

214
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,460
Right now.

215
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,840
Alright.

216
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,250
Take care of yourself and stay safe.

217
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,270
I will.

218
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,240
You too.

219
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,090
Goodbye.

220
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,240
Wait.

221
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,650
What's your name?

222
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,470
My name is Jin Hanfang.

223
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:14,870
Second Young Master,

224
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,080
thank you for remembering my name.

225
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:21,790
I'm leaving now.

226
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,930
Watching Jin Hanfang's figure disappear into the distance,

227
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,720
Yun Hongshen knew

228
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,700
that there were countless comrades like her,

229
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:40,140
silently fighting on hidden battlefronts.

230
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,320
Comrade Zhang Xiancheng

231
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,100
was an exceptionally outstanding comrade.

232
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,520
Indeed.

233
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,090
If it weren't for saving Yun Hongshen,

234
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,290
he wouldn't have sacrificed himself.

235
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,430
Not only that,

236
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,700
but before he died,

237
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,550
he must have left us some clues.

238
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,990
You mean

239
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,450
those words he said to Yun Hongshen?

240
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,030
Yes.

241
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,260
He participated in the operation to eliminate Viscount,

242
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,430
so he knew Hongshen.

243
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,760
Although he might not be certain of Hongshen's identity,

244
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,730
there's one thing he would believe—

245
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,650
Hongshen is trustworthy.

246
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,830
In other words,

247
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,200
he embedded the critical information

248
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,350
in what he said to Yun Hongshen.

249
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,980
Looks like I need to see Hongshen immediately.

250
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,460
Why put yourself through this?

251
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,810
After all, we've been acquainted for some time.

252
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,310
For Director Ji's sake,

253
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,630
I don't want to make things difficult for you.

254
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,160
Why not just come clean?

255
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,510
I...

256
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,760
I'll talk.

257
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:09,890
Move.

258
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,550
Search it.

259
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,090
Yes, sir.

260
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,380
Sit.

261
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,440
Wen Yeming, brief us on the situation.

262
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,290
Yes.

263
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,000
The whole matter

264
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,120
starts with Director Ji's fiancée.

265
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,850
As many colleagues probably know,

266
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,020
Director Ji got engaged over a month ago.

267
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,460
The woman in question worked as an operator at the telephone station.

268
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,450
She's 24 years old,

269
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,160
orphaned at a young age,

270
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,910
and raised by a distant relative.

271
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,230
Director Ji and his fiancée had a very close relationship

272
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,750
and originally planned to marry this summer.

273
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,440
However, starting this month,

274
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,510
Director Ji and his fiancée

275
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,819
have suddenly grown distant.

276
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,109
In the end, they stopped seeing each other altogether.

277
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,760
Director Ling noticed this unusual situation

278
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:23,190
and secretly investigated Director Ji's fiancée.

279
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:24,960
It's been confirmed that her real identity

280
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,770
was that of a radio operator for a Japanese spy network.

281
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:28,319
At noon today,

282
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,350
Director Gong carried out her arrest.

283
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:34,540
Yes.

284
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,580
We seized a radio transmitter at her place

285
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:38,620
along with some weapons.

286
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,910
We brought her back to the station for interrogation.

287
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,800
She confessed to being a Japanese spy.

288
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,650
After all, we've been acquainted for some time.

289
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,970
I don't want to make things difficult for you.

290
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,270
Why don't you just come clean?

291
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,230
I...

292
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,470
I'll talk.

293
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:57,950
Also, she gave up the names of her superior and accomplices.

294
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,630
Unfortunately, by the time we arrived,

295
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,350
her accomplices had already fled.

296
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,550
As for her superior,

297
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,310
she claimed it was Zong Fang.

298
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,610
She also disclosed a phone number.

299
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,010
We traced the number to an address,

300
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,530
but it was also abandoned.

301
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:16,720
Search it.

302
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,090
Wasn't Zong Fang killed during yesterday's pursuit?

303
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,630
He faked his death.

304
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,140
His aim was to escape our...

305
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,690
Wen Yeming, continue.

306
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,750
Director Ling further investigated and tracked

307
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,670
this radio operator.

308
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,550
Eventually, an enemy radio transmitter was discovered,

309
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,360
and we put it under surveillance.

310
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,500
Around 11:38 PM the night before last,

311
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:40,680
[The spy network was severely compromised. Please send personnel for replacement immediately.]

312
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,750
this radio transmitter sent a message.

313
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,040
The content was a request to their superiors

314
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,680
to send new personnel to Changsha for support.

315
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,190
Last night,

316
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,750
also around 11:38 PM,

317
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,590
we simultaneously intercepted

318
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,290
a reply from Zong Fang's superior.

319
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:52,300
[Tomorrow at 12:00 AM, Mister will arrive in Changsha. Prepare to receive him.]

320
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,640
The message stated that at noon today,

321
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,430
a liaison officer codenamed "Mister"

322
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,590
would arrive in Changsha

323
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,230
to deliver the list of dispatched personnel.

324
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,820
The Chief completely blocked the news

325
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,040
and personally oversaw today's operation.

326
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,140
Yun Hongshen and I were responsible for carrying it out.

327
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,480
The operation was extremely successful.

328
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,310
All Japanese spies who appeared at the train station,

329
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,910
a total of nineteen, were eliminated.

330
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,720
Mister and his accomplices were also all captured,

331
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,250
and we successfully obtained the list of dispatched personnel.

332
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,400
We lost two agents,

333
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,990
and three others

334
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,290
were slightly injured during the operation.

335
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,110
One minute ago,

336
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,100
our task force was fully in position.

337
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,750
The first batch of Japanese spies newly dispatched to Changsha

338
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,310
will soon also be captured by us.

339
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:54,770
Easy.

340
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,600
Be careful.

341
00:19:59,270 --> 00:19:59,940
Easy.

342
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,560
Sir,

343
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,360
let me help you.

344
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,280
At your age,

345
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,550
you're carrying such heavy luggage on a long journey.

346
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,580
We've spent half a lifetime away from home.

347
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,230
It's time to return to our roots.

348
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,560
We've worked hard to save these few possessions.

349
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:17,870
How could we not bring them?

350
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,110
What about your children?

351
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,300
Why aren't they coming back with you?

352
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,570
Our children have grown up and gone their own way.

353
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,760
They don't want to come back.

354
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,190
Welcome to Changsha.

355
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,650
Stop!

356
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,760
Get off.

357
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,140
We've arrived.

358
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:49,680
Everyone, hurry up.

359
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,510
Be quick about it.

360
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:54,230
Sir,

361
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,110
excuse me,

362
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:55,900
may I borrow a light?

363
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,460
This cigarette of yours—

364
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,870
it's called "Pirate" or something like that?

365
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:00,730
No,

366
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,950
you've got it wrong.

367
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,120
It should be called... "Bandit."

368
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,960
Pirate or bandit,

369
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,390
anyway,

370
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,660
they're all no good.

371
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,150
Hands up!

372
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,070
The only regret in today's operation is

373
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,510
that I couldn't catch Zong Fang.

374
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,520
He just wanted to use this opportunity to escape from Changsha.

375
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,890
I was so close to catching him.

376
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,590
Yun Hongshen, do you have anything to say?

377
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,940
Leader Wen's report was already very thorough.

378
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,150
I have nothing further to add.

379
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,430
You're quite bold.

380
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:40,030
You publicly humiliated the Director's special envoy.

381
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,470
How would you explain this?

382
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,030
Chief,

383
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,540
I believe that in the process of carrying out my mission,

384
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,280
even if the Director himself were to come,

385
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,130
I would still carry out my duties as required.

386
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,490
Sit down.

387
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,190
Young man,

388
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,920
do you think I should praise you

389
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,890
or reprimand you?

390
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,670
I believe our protocols

391
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:07,610
should apply equally to everyone.

392
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,910
We shouldn't make exceptions

393
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:10,660
based on someone's identity or status.

394
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,660
That's the first point.

395
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,400
Secondly, until we identified "Mister,"

396
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,930
everyone was a suspect.

397
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,110
Alright, speaking of "Mister,"

398
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:16,990
I have a question.

399
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,670
How did they die?

400
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,100
That was my oversight.

401
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,650
I failed to notice that there were still some stragglers on the boat.

402
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:24,870
Did I ask you?

403
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,770
The operation at the dock was Yun Hongshen's responsibility.

404
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,130
He should be held accountable

405
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,710
for this serious mistake.

406
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,130
Deputy Chief Zhu,

407
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,870
give him a demerit.

408
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:38,840
Yes.

409
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:42,820
Report.

410
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,550
Come in.

411
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:47,920
Chief,

412
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,100
all Japanese spies have been captured.

413
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,290
You may go.

414
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:50,920
Yes, sir.

415
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,720
Let me share some good news with everyone.

416
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,680
The newly dispatched Japanese spies to Changsha

417
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,350
have all been captured by us.

418
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,030
Everyone,

419
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,580
I don't buy into sayings like

420
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,610
"no operation is foolproof."

421
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,020
I only believe that during an operation,

422
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:23,010
as long as we are meticulous and thorough,

423
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,260
we will not fail.

424
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,190
I hope you will keep this in mind.

425
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:27,960
Yes, sir.

426
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,310
It now seems

427
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,850
that Director Ling may have indeed been set up.

428
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,440
Who would set him up?

429
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,200
It's hard to say.

430
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,540
Director Ling is a man who doesn't care about personal relationships.

431
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:53,920
He's offended plenty of people.

432
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,900
Just from that, there's no shortage of people

433
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,070
with motives against him.

434
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,010
But capability-wise,

435
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,620
there are only a few in our entire station

436
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,040
who would be able to set him up.

437
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,860
Cut the crap. How many exactly?

438
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,610
I think Yun Hongshen

439
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,010
is the most likely.

440
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:11,830
Reason.

441
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,210
Hasn't he always wanted to avenge Yun Muzhi?

442
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,460
This young man,

443
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,450
one mindset leads to liberation, while another leads to obsession.

444
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,040
It's still possible that his mind may have been

445
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:22,590
clouded by the obsession for revenge.

446
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,980
The obsession for revenge...

447
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:29,910
Director Ling,

448
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,130
you're free to go now.

449
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:00,670
Chief.

450
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,470
This operation was a great success.

451
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,910
We caught all the Japanese spies

452
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,060
hiding in Changsha.

453
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,830
The list of newly dispatched personnel

454
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,050
has also been obtained by us.

455
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:12,950
And then?

456
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:16,710
And then what?

457
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,830
You haven't dispelled your suspicions about me.

458
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,150
Although the Deputy Chief is also suspicious,

459
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,930
your primary suspect is still me.

460
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,480
So?

461
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,380
So I will continue to investigate

462
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,920
until I find evidence to prove my innocence.

463
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,070
I hope that the next time

464
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,510
we discuss this topic again,

465
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,880
what you give me is evidence,

466
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,070
not your speculation.

467
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,880
Sir.

468
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,830
What do you, a child, know?

469
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:55,740
How can you take up arms and rebel?

470
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,810
Why did he say that to me?

471
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,760
What are you thinking about?

472
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,870
You look so listless.

473
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,470
I'm thinking—

474
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,320
Isn't it part of the process

475
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,260
for someone who's just been reprimanded

476
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,770
to spend some time reflecting on their mistakes?

477
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,430
You'd better behave yourself.

478
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,710
The Chief is in a difficult position now.

479
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,600
Mr. Shi is a petty person.

480
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,630
You publicly embarrassed him.

481
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,990
He will definitely not let it go.

482
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,270
The Chief giving you a demerit

483
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,980
is to shut him up.

484
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,550
Here you go.

485
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:09,920
Okay.

486
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,570
Thank you.

487
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:20,200
[Music]

488
00:27:58,730 --> 00:27:59,410
Watch out!

489
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,520
Who exactly was he?

490
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,170
Why did he save me?

491
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,270
Hello?

492
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,100
Second Young Master, this is Jingyu.

493
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,340
What's the matter?

494
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,240
Did something happen at home?

495
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,020
No.

496
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,010
When you were in Shanghai,

497
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,700
did you order a pair of cufflinks?

498
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,680
Yes, I did.

499
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,220
Did they arrive?

500
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,290
Yes,

501
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,220
they've just arrived.

502
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,740
I've put them in your room,

503
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,490
in the left drawer of your desk.

504
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,650
Alright, I got it.

505
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:48,530
Jingyu,

506
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,270
I wasn't here today at all.

507
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,720
The cufflinks were delivered to the house.

508
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,530
Understood?

509
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,320
Understood.

510
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,860
In the left drawer of Yun Hongshen's desk,

511
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,290
there's a watch.

512
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,030
That was a birthday gift

513
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,320
that Yang Ziming gave to Yun Hongshen on his 15th birthday.

514
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,410
Combined with the cufflinks Jingyu mentioned,

515
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:21,170
it's clear that this call

516
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,170
was made at Yang Ziming's request.

517
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,350
That birthday

518
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,010
was celebrated at Xiaoxiang Restaurant.

519
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,480
Clearly, Yang Ziming's purpose in having Jingyu

520
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,890
make this call was to

521
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:33,480
arrange an immediate meeting at Xiaoxiang Restaurant.

522
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,030
What could be so urgent

523
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:38,200
that Yang Ziming couldn't even wait until after work

524
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,610
to see him?

525
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:04,430
Shen.

526
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:05,460
Quick, sit down.

527
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,100
Uncle Yang.

528
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:08,880
You weren't followed, were you?

529
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,490
No.

530
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,550
I parked the car far away.

531
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,550
You wanted to see me so urgently.

532
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,440
Did something happen?

533
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:16,050
What did Zhang Xiancheng say before he died?

534
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,810
Zhang Xiancheng was one of us?

535
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,620
Where's his luggage?

536
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:20,670
I have it.

537
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,110
I've already checked it thoroughly.

538
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,110
There's nothing suspicious.

539
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:25,610
What did he say before he died?

540
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:27,690
"What do you, a child, know?

541
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,620
How can you take up arms and rebel?"

542
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,310
It seemed like he had a lot more to say.

543
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,710
What do you, a child, know?

544
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,190
How can you take up arms and rebel?

545
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:36,850
Rebellion?

546
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,190
This is bad.

547
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,580
Is there something wrong?

548
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,310
Shen,

549
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,270
haven't you always wanted to know

550
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,390
about the gold reserves, right?

551
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,060
I'll tell you everything now.

552
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,150
So Zhang Xiancheng

553
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,370
was part of the gold reserves operation.

554
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:54,220
Yes.

555
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,600
He was in charge of the Gold Strike Operation.

556
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:18,830
Slow down, slow down.

557
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,330
-Shen?
-Dad.

558
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:53,710
Dad, what are you doing?

559
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,670
Those reserve notes are nothing but a pile of useless paper.

560
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:56,710
You deliberately sent me away

561
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:57,790
just to do this?

562
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,150
It's not your place

563
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,070
to interfere with my decisions.

564
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,150
I just want to know...

565
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,110
if what I did was right.

566
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,070
Of course, it was right.

567
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,590
Then you should tell me the truth.

568
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,430
The truth is

569
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,000
that Yun Muzhi, the president of the Bank of France,

570
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,080
died of a sudden heart attack tonight.

571
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,070
From now on,

572
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,110
he will have no more connections

573
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,020
with Frank and the Bank of France.

574
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,600
When things settle down,

575
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,110
we can come back.

576
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,070
By then, I will give you...

577
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,150
a perfect answer.

578
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,070
Yesterday morning,

579
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:31,180
Zhang Xiancheng called me from Shanghai.

580
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,290
Probably because the enemy had been watching too closely,

581
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,540
he couldn't say much.

582
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,210
He only mentioned two things:

583
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,260
first,

584
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,820
something went wrong with the Gold Strike Operation.

585
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:40,810
Second,

586
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,500
he was coming to Changsha.

587
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,490
Last night, the Organization sent a telegram

588
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,230
saying

589
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:49,410
that the comrade sent from Northern Jiangsu to handle the gold transfer had gone missing.

590
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:53,060
He didn't contact his superiors at the scheduled time.

591
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,510
Then, by combining these two pieces of information,

592
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,290
is it possible to conclude this:

593
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:58,390
yesterday morning,

594
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,070
the comrade from Northern Jiangsu

595
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,710
was sent to Shanghai to meet with Zhang Xiancheng,

596
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,860
but the meeting failed.

597
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,930
Then, this must have happened very suddenly.

598
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,910
Whether it's Zhang Xiancheng's phone call

599
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,550
or the telegram sent by the Organization,

600
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:09,680
the information obtained is very limited.

601
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:12,000
To sum up, something went wrong with the Gold Strike Operation.

602
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,710
So how did the operation go wrong?

603
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,990
Perhaps only Zhang Xiancheng would have the answer.

604
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,510
Zhang Xiancheng was a seasoned underground operative,

605
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,340
very experienced.

606
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,830
He must have left behind

607
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,630
important clues before he died.

608
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,790
What do you, a child, know? How can you take up arms and rebel?

609
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:27,360
Rebellion.

610
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,750
He was trying to tell us

611
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,990
that there was a traitor within the Gold Strike Operation team.

612
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:31,820
Yes.

613
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,150
If he were still alive,

614
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,930
he would have definitely helped us sort out

615
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,410
more information about the traitor.

616
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,670
What a pity.

617
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,900
Why would he tell me

618
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,720
such important information?

619
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,500
Could he have discovered my true identity?

620
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,170
He was originally my operative.

621
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,790
After I left Shanghai,

622
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:51,010
I handed his group over to Butler Xu.

623
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,710
He participated in the operation

624
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:54,950
to eliminate Viscount,

625
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,310
so he likely suspected

626
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,880
your identity.

627
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,190
His words

628
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,130
might contain another crucial piece of information.

629
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,130
Your father's true identity

630
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:11,370
might have been exposed.

631
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,620
Didn't you say

632
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,510
that very few people know

633
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:15,090
about my father's identity?

634
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,360
How could he be exposed?

635
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:18,350
If someone connects the gold reserves

636
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,270
with the task

637
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,989
that we sent our comrade from Northern Jiangsu

638
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:22,889
to complete in Shanghai,

639
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,199
your father would undoubtedly be exposed.

640
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,350
And next,

641
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,550
your identity and mine

642
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,780
will also be exposed sooner or later.

643
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:34,250
No,

644
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,380
I can't let you stay here any longer.

645
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,639
You must evacuate immediately.

646
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:40,060
I have a very safe escape route.

647
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,210
First, go to Huaihua.

648
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,710
Then, take a flight to Hong Kong.

649
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:43,840
Uncle Yang, what about you?

650
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,150
I can't leave yet.

651
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,780
Dai Li doesn't have any evidence against me,

652
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,670
so I can stall for some time.

653
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,590
Don't worry.

654
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,030
After you leave,

655
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,290
I'll make sure Hongqi

656
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,710
and the girl you love,

657
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:54,690
including Jingyu,

658
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,739
are all well taken care of.

659
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,830
I absolutely won't let anyone

660
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,900
cause them any trouble.

661
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,070
Uncle Yang,

662
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:01,990
maybe the situation isn't

663
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:03,200
as dire as we think.

664
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,390
Even if they really have someone

665
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,830
who can make this connection,

666
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,350
they'll still need time to verify it.

667
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,950
We need to prepare for the worst.

668
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,370
You must leave right now.

669
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,470
Go to Xinhe Pier immediately.

670
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,550
When you get there,

671
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,550
you'll find a boathouse.

672
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,270
Inside, there's a man named Hei.

673
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,150
Find him

674
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,110
and connect with him.

675
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:20,710
Hongqi is there recovering from his injuries.

676
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,080
When you see Hei, tell him

677
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,670
that you're going on a long trip,

678
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:24,860
but you're short on money.

679
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,890
Can you use wine to pay off your debt?

680
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,030
Then he'll reply

681
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:29,970
that he doesn't drink,

682
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,070
but he likes to smoke.

683
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,270
Then, you tell him,

684
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,200
you've stockpiled a lot of imported cigarettes,

685
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,510
but they're very strong,

686
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,470
and you're afraid he can't handle them.

687
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,110
After you've exchanged the code,

688
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,550
he'll take you to Huaihua.

689
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,610
Once you're in Huaihua,

690
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,150
someone will naturally reach out to you.

691
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,430
Uncle Yang, I can't leave.

692
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:44,790
Shen.

693
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:46,910
Chief Ke,

694
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,950
you're aware that Yun Muzhi handed over

695
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,630
the Bank of France's gold reserves

696
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,290
to the Japanese, right?

697
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,590
I know.

698
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,350
And I heard that when the Japanese

699
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,290
transported this gold back to Japan,

700
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,110
they opened the crates and found they were all filled with lead bars.

701
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:07,180
Yun Muzhi was responsible for this.

702
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,590
But right after

703
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,930
he had handed over the gold to the Japanese,

704
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,910
he died.

705
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:16,300
Don't you think that's too much of a coincidence?

706
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,850
Uncle Yang,

707
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,590
I still have a lot to do.

708
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,510
I haven't yet completed

709
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,350
the last task my father gave me.

710
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,950
I'm just one step away from exposing the mastermind

711
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,670
behind my father and grandmother's deaths.

712
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,300
I know.

713
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,320
The Organization

714
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,380
will assign someone else to complete these tasks.

715
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:34,980
You must leave now.

716
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,620
You're in great danger now.

717
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,330
Every extra minute you stay in Changsha

718
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,150
brings you one step closer to death.

719
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:40,660
But...

720
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,250
Shen!

721
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,810
I know you're not afraid of sacrifice,

722
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,260
but only by staying alive

723
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,420
can you complete more missions.

724
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,830
If Muzhi were still here,

725
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,690
he wouldn't want you to take such risks either.

726
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:51,460
But...

727
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,160
No buts.

728
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,510
For both official and personal reasons,

729
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:56,290
I must make sure you leave immediately.

730
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,140
Muzhi

731
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,270
and Old Madam Yun

732
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,430
were killed one after another.

733
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:00,890
I couldn't prevent either of them.

734
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,070
I can't stand by and watch

735
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:03,950
as you're captured.

736
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,160
When I left yesterday,

737
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,790
I received some news.

738
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,950
Just yesterday morning,

739
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,310
the traitors in No. 76

740
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:15,950
captured a Communist from Northern Jiangsu.

741
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,250
A liaison officer was supposed to meet him.

742
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:22,750
During the conflict, they killed the Communist.

743
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,360
The liaison officer betrayed their Party.

744
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,550
According to the liaison officer's confession,

745
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:30,190
this Communist from Northern Jiangsu

746
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,220
was going to receive a batch of important supplies in Shanghai.

747
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,430
Think about it, Chief Ke.

748
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,370
What supplies could be so important?

749
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,630
If we can prove that these supplies

750
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,430
are the gold reserves of the Bank of France,

751
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,320
then we can also confirm Yun Muzhi's identity.

752
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,260
Chief Ke,

753
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,270
you don't need to worry about Shanghai's affairs for now.

754
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,720
Your top priority

755
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:56,190
is to capture Yun Hongshen alive

756
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:58,280
and escort him to Chongqing.

757
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:03,580
Yun Hongshen had been following Yun Muzhi for two years.

758
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,960
He must be a Communist too.

759
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,260
Mr. Shi,

760
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,710
even if Yun Hongshen were a Communist,

761
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,670
he would still be just a small fry.

762
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:16,170
Is it really necessary to escort him to Chongqing?

763
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,300
He may be a small fry,

764
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:23,480
but the one behind him, Yang Ziming, is not.

765
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,420
Our goal here

766
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:28,800
is to flush out Yang Ziming behind him.

767
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,070
Let me ask you:

768
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,640
Does Zhou Qi like you?

769
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,030
How do you know that?

770
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:36,990
Stall him for me.

771
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,310
I need five minutes.

772
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,150
What are you going to do?

773
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,500
Stop asking questions.

774
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:41,830
Will you help me or not?

775
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,290
Okay.

776
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:48,190
Zhou,

777
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,030
come out with me for a moment.

778
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,110
I have something to tell you.

779
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:50,830
What for?

780
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,570
I'm working.

781
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,150
Just a few words.

782
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,400
It won't delay your work.

783
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,600
Are you coming out or not?

784
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,670
If not, I'm leaving.

785
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:00,930
No, no, no.

786
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,650
I'm coming.

787
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:05,590
Come here.

788
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,150
We're both standing here.

789
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,090
What could possibly happen?

790
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,160
Right.

791
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:17,630
I remember you telling me last time

792
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,670
that there's a new Western restaurant

793
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,340
on Deyang Road.

794
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,180
Is that true?

795
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,320
Why would I lie to you?

796
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,190
When do you have time?

797
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,000
I'll take you there for a meal.

798
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,510
Oh, by the way,

799
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,550
I've told my family

800
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:32,130
about us.

801
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:42,470
Why did you hide Yun Hongshen and Yun Hongqi

802
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,550
at your place?

803
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,630
They had nowhere to go,

804
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,790
so I let them stay with me.

805
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,620
When did you find out your father had died?

806
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:51,940
Yesterday.

807
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,620
Someone tried to kill Yun Hongshen and Yun Hongqi.

808
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,610
We escaped together.

809
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,810
It was Yun Hongqi who told me.

810
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:01,590
Did your father contact you after he returned to Changsha?

811
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:02,990
No.

812
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,320
When was the last time

813
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,660
you met your father?

814
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,720
Last year,

815
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:09,180
around March.

816
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,370
I don't remember the exact date.

817
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,450
Was she the one who called the newspaper office?

818
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:15,940
It should be,

819
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,150
but I can't be certain.

820
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,650
Hello, is this Reporter Zhu?

821
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,480
This is Zhongshan Pier.

822
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,590
There has been a shooting here.

823
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,180
The newspaper office was very noisy that day.

824
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,200
I couldn't hear clearly.

825
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,510
Moreover,

826
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,440
her voice...

827
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:33,830
wasn't this gentle.

828
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,110
It was a bit lower.

829
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,100
If you want to stay alive,

830
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:39,330
don't tell anyone

831
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:40,430
about our conversation.

832
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,590
If anyone asks, just say

833
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,510
I questioned you

834
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,820
about what happened at the dock.

835
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:51,670
Is that so?

836
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,030
As long as your father agrees,

837
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,000
I'll do anything.

838
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:55,350
Really.

839
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:00,070
Then, I'll set up a time with them

840
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:00,830
and then tell you.

841
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:01,610
I still have some things to attend to.

842
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,430
I'll get back to work now.

843
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:03,670
You go back to your work too.

844
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:04,450
I'm off.

845
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,310
Goodbye.

846
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,190
Bye-bye.

847
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:07,870
Bye-bye.

848
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:10,260
Mr. Shi,

849
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,510
you see,

850
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,720
if Yun Hongshen were truly a Communist,

851
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:14,870
why wouldn't he join their organization

852
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:16,070
outright?

853
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,680
With all the analysis you just made,

854
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:20,330
why would he come to Changsha and get involved in this mess?

855
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:26,350
Are you being too partial toward Yun Hongshen?

856
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:29,870
I think he's a talent.

857
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:31,110
In time,

858
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,870
he'll become a sharp sword for our Party and country.

859
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:33,440
Yes.

860
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,950
Like father, like son.

861
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,690
He is indeed a promising talent,

862
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:42,550
but you don't hold the sword.

863
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:44,070
The sword belongs to the Communist Party.

864
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:46,270
Think about it.

865
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:49,340
Aren't you afraid that one day this sword will turn against you and cut you down?

866
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,990
After all, it's just speculation. There's no evidence.

867
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,520
What a joke.

868
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,190
Who needs evidence for this kind of thing?

869
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,230
Do you think someone as cunning as Yun Muzhi

870
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:58,790
would leave behind any dirt

871
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:00,640
or proof for you to incriminate himself?

872
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,650
Mr. Shi,

873
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,250
now is a time of national crisis.

874
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,870
Moreover, Myna's codebook

875
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:14,220
is in Yun Hongshen's hands.

876
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,200
Could we consider making a special exception for this situation?

877
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:17,190
Chief Ke!

878
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:21,910
Chief Ke.

879
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,000
Do you know how dangerous your position is already?

880
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:29,460
If it weren't for your years of loyal service to the Director

881
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:32,790
and your distinguished contributions to the Party and country,

882
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,130
I could suspect you of being

883
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:36,910
an accomplice to Yun Muzhi and his son right now!

884
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:38,550
Mr. Shi,

885
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,440
you misunderstand me.

886
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,320
I just want to defend Changsha; that's all.

887
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,940
Defend Changsha?

888
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:44,950
The Chairman has issued explicit orders:

889
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,230
abandon Changsha,

890
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,190
retreat to Hengyang,

891
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,190
preserve our forces,

892
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,430
and prepare for a future counterattack!

893
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,510
But some people just insist on disobeying orders.

894
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,630
You should know

895
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,770
that, for a soldier, obedience to orders is their foremost duty!

896
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:58,070
That Xue dared to openly defy orders.

897
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:00,280
Then he is being disloyal to discipline,

898
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,860
disloyal to the Party and the nation,

899
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,610
and disloyal to the Chairman.
