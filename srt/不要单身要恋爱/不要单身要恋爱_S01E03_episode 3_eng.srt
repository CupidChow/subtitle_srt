1
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:05,204
An idol figurine breaking,

2
00:00:05,204 --> 00:00:07,404
is it worth crying that much about?

3
00:00:07,404 --> 00:00:09,009
To Bong Jooyi, that figurine

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,027
was basically Han Jungwoo himself.

5
00:00:11,027 --> 00:00:12,821
Do something.

6
00:00:17,582 --> 00:00:19,182
Bong Jooyi, I'm really sorry.

7
00:00:19,182 --> 00:00:20,776
I'll buy you an exact replacement.

8
00:00:20,806 --> 00:00:22,606
You can't!

9
00:00:22,631 --> 00:00:24,531
They sold those to the first 100 people,

10
00:00:24,531 --> 00:00:26,597
it's a limited edition item.

11
00:00:26,597 --> 00:00:30,321
Then, I'll fix it so you can't even tell that it broke.

12
00:00:37,683 --> 00:00:39,783
Oh! It worked!

13
00:00:49,736 --> 00:00:53,836
Oh... Wait... What's wrong with this?

14
00:00:55,314 --> 00:00:56,314
Stop it!

15
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,090
Just leave him alone!

16
00:01:01,045 --> 00:01:05,045
I can't get it off my mind.

17
00:01:07,344 --> 00:01:08,544
What the...?

18
00:01:08,544 --> 00:01:10,330
Why are you dressed up like that?

19
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:14,210
♫  Unfolding in front of the eyes, a bigger world  ♫

20
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:18,760
♫  It's all new, ttuttutturu, ttuttutturu, follow me  ♫

21
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,924
♫  Here in front of me is #you  ♫

22
00:01:22,924 --> 00:01:24,924
♪ Really, really yeah ♪

23
00:01:24,924 --> 00:01:28,021
♪ Everything is becoming perfect ♪

24
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:30,339
Genie, pause the music.

25
00:01:30,339 --> 00:01:32,430
   

26
00:01:34,404 --> 00:01:35,704
Seungbong,

27
00:01:35,704 --> 00:01:37,599
as an idol trainee,

28
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,814
want some advice from me?

29
00:01:38,814 --> 00:01:39,753
What, idol?

30
00:01:39,753 --> 00:01:42,238
You said you were going to be a movie director, and you changed again?

31
00:01:42,238 --> 00:01:44,799
Endlessly having new dreams,

32
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,367
that's what we get to do as youths!

33
00:01:48,367 --> 00:01:49,555
Genie...

34
00:01:49,555 --> 00:01:51,363
turn the music back on.

35
00:01:52,657 --> 00:01:54,782
You said you were going to find your dream after being discharged from the army.

36
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:57,982
How can you still be searching three years later?

37
00:01:57,982 --> 00:02:00,067
Us idols,

38
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:04,606
we are the hope and light of our fans' lives.

39
00:02:04,606 --> 00:02:05,549
You...

40
00:02:05,574 --> 00:02:08,174
have given Jooyi a scar that can't be erased.

41
00:02:08,174 --> 00:02:09,607
"Us idols"? Yeah, whatever...

42
00:02:09,607 --> 00:02:14,952
I'm putting everything on the line to become an idol.

43
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:17,737
You weren't like this when you were younger.

44
00:02:17,761 --> 00:02:19,834
You're getting weirder and weirder.

45
00:02:24,587 --> 00:02:25,887
Bong Jooyi,

46
00:02:25,887 --> 00:02:27,929
I got my cast off, see?

47
00:02:28,553 --> 00:02:31,553
Oh... Seung-ratulations, Cong-bong.

48
00:02:32,556 --> 00:02:35,356
You look tired, do you just want to take the day off today?

49
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:38,265
No, work is work.

50
00:02:40,402 --> 00:02:42,078
Would you like to place your order?

51
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,178
One iced Americano.

52
00:02:44,178 --> 00:02:45,783
Jungwoo, how about you?

53
00:02:45,783 --> 00:02:47,258
Jungwoo...

54
00:02:47,258 --> 00:02:49,652
I'll have a vanilla latte!

55
00:02:49,652 --> 00:02:50,946
One vanilla latte.

56
00:02:50,946 --> 00:02:52,746
Yes, thank you for your car...d!

57
00:02:53,844 --> 00:02:56,344
I'm sorry, thank you for your card.

58
00:03:12,382 --> 00:03:14,717
    
 What's so great about

59
00:03:14,717 --> 00:03:16,997
    
 the Han Jungwoo figurine?

60
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:17,681
   

61
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:18,306
   

62
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,431
   

63
00:03:20,431 --> 00:03:23,106
Wow, it's so hard to get.

64
00:03:23,978 --> 00:03:26,578
He doesn't look that different from me.

65
00:03:27,926 --> 00:03:29,026
Welcome.

66
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:30,475
Are you still open?

67
00:03:30,475 --> 00:03:32,974
We're closed but you can place an order.

68
00:03:32,974 --> 00:03:34,528
One iced Americano, please.

69
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,928
Yes, that will be 4,000 won.

70
00:03:39,675 --> 00:03:42,475
 Maybe it's because I've been staring at Han Jungwoo for so long. 

71
00:03:43,244 --> 00:03:45,344
 He kind of looks like him. 

72
00:03:48,234 --> 00:03:49,934
Thank you.

73
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,480
 N-No way! 

74
00:04:25,316 --> 00:04:27,016
Bong Jooyi!

75
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:27,875
What-What is it?

76
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,750
- Hey, hurry, hurry! 
 - What's wrong with you?

77
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,150
Oh, hurry and come downstairs.

78
00:04:32,795 --> 00:04:34,095
Hey, hurry, hurry!

79
00:04:34,095 --> 00:04:36,575
What is it?

80
00:04:37,988 --> 00:04:39,388
Don't freak out.

81
00:04:39,388 --> 00:04:41,021
It's not a figurine,

82
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:42,952
but the real Han Jungwoo.

83
00:04:53,972 --> 00:04:55,672
 W-Wait! 

84
00:04:55,672 --> 00:04:58,541
I told him you're his fan, okay?

85
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:18,139
What?

86
00:05:18,164 --> 00:05:19,664
- What's wrong with her? 
 - Oh!

87
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:22,189
Hey, help me out.

88
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,630
Hey!

89
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:28,426
She gets nervous just looking at any guy.

90
00:05:28,426 --> 00:05:30,307
Standing in front of the man she loves most in the world,

91
00:05:30,307 --> 00:05:31,356
it was bound to happen.

92
00:05:31,356 --> 00:05:33,153
But still, to faint?

93
00:05:33,153 --> 00:05:35,216
That's because...

94
00:05:35,216 --> 00:05:38,870
All-girls middle school, all-girls high school, and women's college.

95
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:41,691
That's the result of such a triple combo.

96
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:45,118
Even out of that group, she has a serious case of shyness around guys.

97
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:47,964
Shyness around guys?

98
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:50,975
But Bong Jooyi is living with guys right now?

99
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:53,029
That's why she stays in her room.

100
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:54,488
She signed a deal with you.

101
00:05:54,513 --> 00:05:56,814
She caused you to hurt your arm.

102
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:57,792
Knowing Bong Jooyi's personality,

103
00:05:57,817 --> 00:05:59,917
she wouldn't want to be a burden

104
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:02,044
so she's just enduring it.

105
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:05,159
 Where are you looking? 

106
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:07,306
 Oh? It's nothing. 

107
00:06:07,313 --> 00:06:08,613
 Right? 

108
00:06:09,821 --> 00:06:12,121
That was her just enduring it?

109
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:22,933
Ji Yeonseo.

110
00:06:22,951 --> 00:06:24,220
What?

111
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,745
Keep your hair tied up when you're at home.

112
00:06:25,745 --> 00:06:27,645
Your hair is long and falls out a lot.

113
00:06:27,707 --> 00:06:30,507
You asked me to play a ghost because of my long hair,

114
00:06:30,507 --> 00:06:31,879
and now you have a problem with it?

115
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:34,486
It's not a problem, it's a reasonable request to a tenant.

116
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,320
I don't want to?

117
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,841
I'm never going to tie it up for the rest of my life.

118
00:06:37,841 --> 00:06:40,290
Tying your hair up isn't easy.

119
00:06:40,327 --> 00:06:42,527
Cleaning isn't easy either.

120
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,826
But...

121
00:06:43,826 --> 00:06:46,661
once you tie your hair up, it leaves a mark.

122
00:06:46,661 --> 00:06:48,668
It's impossible to restore.

123
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:51,879
That's a pretty logical reason.

124
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:56,033
 What? Why is he on my side? 

125
00:06:56,073 --> 00:06:58,273
 Is he interested in me? 

126
00:06:58,273 --> 00:07:01,109
Joonwoo is quite a tidy person.

127
00:07:01,953 --> 00:07:02,953
Oh?

128
00:07:02,978 --> 00:07:04,878
These are the idols whose dance I was practicing?

129
00:07:04,903 --> 00:07:06,303
Oh?

130
00:07:06,303 --> 00:07:08,725
Are you good at dancing?

131
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,428
Wanna see?

132
00:07:19,195 --> 00:07:20,995
 Right now... 

133
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,440
 Is he appealing to me through dance? 

134
00:07:26,778 --> 00:07:27,978
Through dance,

135
00:07:27,978 --> 00:07:29,664
I like to express my feelings.

136
00:07:29,664 --> 00:07:32,679
Want to hear what I have to say?

137
00:07:33,824 --> 00:07:36,624
   
 Yeonseo, can you hear it? My heart? 

138
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:38,036
 I can hear it! 

139
00:07:38,036 --> 00:07:41,885
 I must like you! 

140
00:07:42,998 --> 00:07:44,898
 This guy, 

141
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:48,869
 I'm certain he likes me! 

142
00:07:52,490 --> 00:08:01,320


143
00:08:06,895 --> 00:08:08,195
Are you feeling better?

144
00:08:08,195 --> 00:08:09,927
Oh... Yes.

145
00:08:09,927 --> 00:08:11,678
Sorry about yesterday.

146
00:08:11,678 --> 00:08:13,469
It's fine.

147
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:15,459
What's that?

148
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:18,718
Something I make every month.

149
00:08:18,718 --> 00:08:20,364
About Han Jungwoo,

150
00:08:20,364 --> 00:08:21,969
he was filming something nearby.

151
00:08:21,994 --> 00:08:23,494
He'll be back next week to film again.

152
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:25,919
- Really? 
 - Amazing, right?

153
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:29,649
But I'll faint again.

154
00:08:30,695 --> 00:08:34,095
I'll just have to be satisfied with looking at him through photos.

155
00:08:34,095 --> 00:08:36,568
 She gets nervous just looking at any guy. 

156
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:38,496
 Standing in front of the man she loves most in the world, 

157
00:08:38,496 --> 00:08:39,931
 it was bound to happen. 

158
00:08:40,474 --> 00:08:41,874
Bong Jooyi!

159
00:08:41,874 --> 00:08:43,810
That's why I came up with something.

160
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,707
I'll help you.

161
00:08:46,165 --> 00:08:47,772
With what?

162
00:08:47,772 --> 00:08:49,172
   

163
00:08:49,197 --> 00:08:51,215
In order to interact with Jungwoo,

164
00:08:51,215 --> 00:08:53,215
we'll go through a week of training.

165
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:56,971
Also known as: "7-day Han Jungwoo Project."

166
00:08:58,508 --> 00:08:59,508
But, before then,

167
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:02,598
you'll have to get comfortable around guys.

168
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,520
That's why I prepared this.

169
00:09:07,937 --> 00:09:11,337
   

170
00:09:11,337 --> 00:09:13,116
   

171
00:09:13,116 --> 00:09:17,616
One, two, three...

172
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:19,737
Oh, you were so close.

173
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,570
You have to maintain eye contact for five seconds.

174
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:24,120
Does this really help?

175
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,464
I read up on psychology.

176
00:09:25,489 --> 00:09:29,089
If you repeatedly expose yourself to uncomfortable things, it gets better.

177
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:30,162
You can do it.

178
00:09:30,187 --> 00:09:32,587
It's all for Han Jungwoo.

179
00:09:33,176 --> 00:09:34,476
Okay!

180
00:09:34,476 --> 00:09:35,576
I'll try it again.

181
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:36,901
I have homework to do.

182
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:39,526
Hey, don't move.

183
00:09:41,636 --> 00:09:43,136
Good!

184
00:09:43,722 --> 00:09:44,822
One.

185
00:09:44,847 --> 00:09:45,947
Two.

186
00:09:45,947 --> 00:09:47,401
Three.

187
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:48,930
Four.

188
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,553
Five.

189
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,691
Okay.

190
00:09:52,691 --> 00:09:54,706
   

191
00:09:54,731 --> 00:09:56,531
   

192
00:09:56,556 --> 00:09:58,256
Good luck!

193
00:10:02,305 --> 00:10:05,105
Have some cookies on the house!

194
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,130
Yes!

195
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,261
   

196
00:10:10,261 --> 00:10:12,161
   

197
00:10:12,161 --> 00:10:13,745
Idol!

198
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:15,123
Crazy.

199
00:10:15,123 --> 00:10:16,485
Barber!

200
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:17,878
Conman?

201
00:10:17,878 --> 00:10:19,356
Fried dumplings!

202
00:10:19,356 --> 00:10:20,556
Fatsia!

203
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,970
Uh!

204
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,793
Argh!

205
00:10:26,351 --> 00:10:27,651
Yes!

206
00:10:27,651 --> 00:10:29,472
   

207
00:10:29,497 --> 00:10:30,797
   

208
00:10:30,822 --> 00:10:33,022
I think that will do for getting comfortable around guys.

209
00:10:33,022 --> 00:10:36,088
Now, it's time to practice meeting Han Jungwoo.

210
00:10:36,088 --> 00:10:37,961
Hey, play the role of Han Jungwoo.

211
00:10:38,564 --> 00:10:39,564
Hello.

212
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:42,589
I'm Han Jungwoo, the greatest idol star.

213
00:10:43,191 --> 00:10:45,291
I can't get into it at all.

214
00:10:48,469 --> 00:10:51,169
Hello, I'm Han Jungwoo.

215
00:10:51,656 --> 00:10:53,656
He... llo.

216
00:10:53,656 --> 00:10:56,925
I heard... you wanted to meet me.

217
00:10:58,754 --> 00:11:00,854
Try talking to him.

218
00:11:03,064 --> 00:11:05,464
Oh, I...

219
00:11:09,005 --> 00:11:11,505
 Oh, is it because I'm nervous again? 

220
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,530
Say you're a fan or ask to take a photo together.

221
00:11:16,654 --> 00:11:18,554
I have irritable bowel syndrome.

222
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:20,139
Irritable bowel...

223
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:21,668
What?

224
00:11:21,668 --> 00:11:24,603
I need to use the restroom!!!

225
00:11:27,798 --> 00:11:29,698
   

226
00:11:29,698 --> 00:11:33,116
Lastly, taking a selfie with Jungwoo.

227
00:11:39,229 --> 00:11:40,629
Bong Jooyi,

228
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:42,128
you said this is your one wish in life.

229
00:11:42,153 --> 00:11:43,954
How will you do it at this rate?

230
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:46,296
Oh, okay.

231
00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:50,189
Here I go.

232
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:52,907
One, two, three.

233
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,977
   

234
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,441
He should be here any minute.

235
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:08,708
Bong Jooyi,

236
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:10,633
are you shaking right now?

237
00:12:11,611 --> 00:12:12,611
No?

238
00:12:12,636 --> 00:12:14,436
I'm okay.

239
00:12:14,974 --> 00:12:17,174
You need to open the lid first.

240
00:12:17,857 --> 00:12:19,357
Oh...

241
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,900
   

242
00:12:39,023 --> 00:12:41,423
Hey, you can do it.

243
00:12:41,423 --> 00:12:43,332
We practiced.

244
00:12:43,977 --> 00:12:45,477
Eyes!

245
00:12:48,216 --> 00:12:49,816
Okay!

246
00:12:49,816 --> 00:12:51,732
You're good at it now.

247
00:12:59,524 --> 00:13:03,124
 What? She looks different when she smiles. 

248
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:20,110


249
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:27,038
Welcome!

250
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:29,314
Were you okay after you fainted last time?

251
00:13:29,314 --> 00:13:31,116
Oh, yes.

252
00:13:31,116 --> 00:13:33,071
I'm totally fine.

253
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:34,886
That's a relief.

254
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:38,259
One Americano, please.

255
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:40,211
Oh, yes!

256
00:13:40,816 --> 00:13:44,016
Excuse me,

257
00:13:44,026 --> 00:13:46,426
could we take a photo together...

258
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:49,004
Of course, we can take multiple photos.

259
00:13:56,391 --> 00:13:58,791
Thank you.

260
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,616
How is your TV show filming going?

261
00:14:01,616 --> 00:14:04,196
Filming wrapped up last week.

262
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:07,450
I heard you were coming today because of filming.

263
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,626
Oh, last week, your friend

264
00:14:09,626 --> 00:14:12,126
asked if I could come back one more time.

265
00:14:12,126 --> 00:14:14,829
He said his friend was a big fan.

266
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:16,254
Oh, really?

267
00:14:16,254 --> 00:14:17,374
Yes.

268
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,599
Your friend was so insistent,

269
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,324
so I couldn't not come.

270
00:14:20,324 --> 00:14:23,793
And the coffee here is pretty good.

271
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:26,896
Oh...

272
00:14:36,345 --> 00:14:37,970
This is insane, my goodness.

273
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,270
I'm so happy!!!

274
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:40,338
Amazing!

275
00:14:40,423 --> 00:14:41,723
He really is handsome though.

276
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:42,748
Oh!

277
00:14:42,773 --> 00:14:45,873
Hey, he looks 100 times better in person.

278
00:14:45,873 --> 00:14:47,519
I'm a successful fan...

279
00:14:47,581 --> 00:14:49,381
Woo Seungbong was feeling really bad.

280
00:14:49,406 --> 00:14:51,606
He definitely made it up to you.

281
00:14:55,075 --> 00:14:57,298
Oh! What's this?

282
00:14:57,298 --> 00:15:00,498
No, we were just practicing last time.

283
00:15:00,498 --> 00:15:03,947
You guys look pretty good together...

284
00:15:15,191 --> 00:15:16,791
 Here I go! 

285
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,358
 One, two, three. 

286
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:26,390
♫  Secretly looking at you  ♫

287
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:30,210
♫  I guess you got caught  ♫

288
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:34,160
♫  I keep thinking of you again  ♫

289
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,700
♫  I keep seeing you  ♫

290
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:42,480
♫  I'm so curious, I'm so very heartbroken  ♫

291
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,480
♫  Just thinking about it makes me flutter  ♫

292
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,980
   

293
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:01,680
