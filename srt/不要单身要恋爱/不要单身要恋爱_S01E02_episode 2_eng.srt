1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,213

2
00:00:03,213 --> 00:00:07,160
So, your misunderstanding that we're dating ended in me getting hurt like this?

3
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:10,226
I'm so sorry...

4
00:00:10,876 --> 00:00:14,736
Could I cancel the contract for the boarding house?

5
00:00:14,736 --> 00:00:16,788
Yeah, I have no choice since you signed it while drunk.

6
00:00:16,813 --> 00:00:18,750
But if you factor in my hospital bills

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,778
and somebody to fill in for me at the café,

8
00:00:20,778 --> 00:00:22,834
it's going to cost about this much.

9
00:00:26,077 --> 00:00:27,877
Huh?

10
00:00:28,952 --> 00:00:31,102
 Where am I going to get this money? 

11
00:00:31,127 --> 00:00:34,244
 I have no excuses, since this is all my fault 

12
00:00:34,824 --> 00:00:36,461
Umm...

13
00:00:36,486 --> 00:00:39,120
Do you need more tenants?

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,730
Yeah, we need more.

15
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,819
Can we...

16
00:00:45,827 --> 00:00:47,927
make a deal?

17
00:00:47,927 --> 00:00:49,618
A deal?

18
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,172
Hello, I'm Ji Yeonseo.

19
00:00:59,746 --> 00:01:02,766
I'm sorry that my friend caused you so much trouble.

20
00:01:02,766 --> 00:01:03,967
Oh, gosh...

21
00:01:03,967 --> 00:01:04,967
It's fine,

22
00:01:04,974 --> 00:01:06,572
since Jooyi brought you here

23
00:01:06,572 --> 00:01:08,891
and will be taking my shifts until my arms are all healed.

24
00:01:08,891 --> 00:01:10,591
Right?

25
00:01:11,152 --> 00:01:13,014
Isn't the landlady home?

26
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,961
Oh, my mom used to run this place,

27
00:01:14,961 --> 00:01:15,961
but due to certain circumstances.

28
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:18,239
I'm the substitute landlord.

29
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:22,516
Wow, young and rich!

30
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:24,423
Shush!

31
00:01:24,423 --> 00:01:26,401
Why don't we speak casually, as we're all the same age?

32
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:28,128
Yeah! Call me Yeonseo.

33
00:01:28,128 --> 00:01:29,239
I'm Woo Seungbong.

34
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:31,050
I run this "Sol House"

35
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,994
and there's a friend who helps me manage the place.

36
00:01:33,019 --> 00:01:34,133
Oh, he's here just in time.

37
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:35,833
Kang Joonwoo!

38
00:01:58,436 --> 00:02:00,208
And there's another guy named Ma Hoon,

39
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:02,567
but he's busy nowadays shooting a movie.

40
00:02:07,493 --> 00:02:09,128
Bong!

41
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:11,459
This place is awesome!

42
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:12,745
It's exactly what we've been looking for!

43
00:02:12,745 --> 00:02:14,435
Who cares if this place is awesome?

44
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:15,867
There are three guys living here.

45
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:18,156
I know, right? This is exactly what I've been looking for.

46
00:02:18,156 --> 00:02:21,448
I've always had this dream of sharing a house with guys!

47
00:02:21,448 --> 00:02:23,456
At least, you're happy here.

48
00:02:23,456 --> 00:02:24,662
Bong,

49
00:02:24,662 --> 00:02:26,670
maybe the heavens have led us here to this "love house"

50
00:02:26,695 --> 00:02:28,311
because they pitied us for going to a girl's middle school,

51
00:02:28,311 --> 00:02:31,275
girl's high school, and a women's university!

52
00:02:32,656 --> 00:02:34,930
What do you mean, "love house"?

53
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,637
As long as they're here,

54
00:02:36,662 --> 00:02:38,971
I'm gonna be stuck in this room.

55
00:02:43,619 --> 00:02:45,215
Oh, no!

56
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:47,698
Jungwoo's face is wrinkled!

57
00:02:47,822 --> 00:02:48,951
Bong!

58
00:02:48,976 --> 00:02:50,143
Stop liking celebrities

59
00:02:50,143 --> 00:02:52,240
and find somebody to like in real life!

60
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:06,328
He's so cool!!!

61
00:03:12,164 --> 00:03:13,397
What...?

62
00:03:13,422 --> 00:03:15,445
Why is everything so organized??

63
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:21,016
Oh, hi!

64
00:03:21,016 --> 00:03:22,820
You're Joonwoo, right?

65
00:03:22,845 --> 00:03:24,545
Hi.

66
00:03:24,545 --> 00:03:27,834
 He's definitely my type. 

67
00:03:31,742 --> 00:03:33,542
Hey...

68
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,834
Yeah?

69
00:03:34,834 --> 00:03:36,434
What?

70
00:03:37,446 --> 00:03:39,351
Never mind, it's nothing.

71
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:43,350
 What? Why is he hesitating? 

72
00:03:45,046 --> 00:03:48,050
 Does he like me already? 

73
00:03:51,843 --> 00:03:53,065
That Ji Yeonseo...

74
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:54,765
I don't like her.

75
00:03:54,765 --> 00:03:56,346
Yeah? Why?

76
00:03:56,371 --> 00:03:59,048
She scatters the stuff in the fridge

77
00:03:59,048 --> 00:04:00,359
and talks with the refrigerator door open.

78
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:01,742
That costs electricity.

79
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,828
Hey, did you call her out on that?

80
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,644
That beverages should be arranged so that their logos face the front

81
00:04:06,644 --> 00:04:08,867
and that she shouldn't open the fridge for more than 5 seconds?

82
00:04:08,867 --> 00:04:10,621
You told her that?

83
00:04:10,621 --> 00:04:11,656
I was going to, but then I held back.

84
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:13,658
Oh, you startled me.

85
00:04:13,658 --> 00:04:16,337
You were so fussy last time that the other tenant left!

86
00:04:16,337 --> 00:04:17,964
If she does that one more time, I'm going to tell her.

87
00:04:17,964 --> 00:04:20,313
Hey, don't you dare tell her that.

88
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,548
If you don't like what she does,

89
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:23,548
just do it for her. Okay?

90
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:25,804
I'm going down to the café now.

91
00:04:43,915 --> 00:04:45,144
She's at it again.

92
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:48,570
 If you don't like what she does, just do it for her, okay? 

93
00:04:52,288 --> 00:04:54,288
Hey.

94
00:04:55,154 --> 00:04:56,372
Yeah?

95
00:04:56,372 --> 00:04:57,752
I'll do the dishes.

96
00:04:57,777 --> 00:04:59,066
Why would you?

97
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:00,485
No, I'll do it.

98
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,043
I prefer doing them myself.

99
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:06,575
It's really fine with me.

100
00:05:06,575 --> 00:05:08,762
I'm not fine with it.

101
00:05:08,762 --> 00:05:10,678
 What's this? 

102
00:05:12,635 --> 00:05:16,032
 He's not fine with me getting my hands wet? 

103
00:05:21,032 --> 00:05:22,613
Two spoonfuls of this powder for the chocolate latte

104
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,512
and two spoonfuls of this powder for the green tea latte.

105
00:05:24,512 --> 00:05:26,051
Okay?

106
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:27,563
Oh, okay.

107
00:05:27,572 --> 00:05:30,372
It's not hard, so you'll remember it in no time.

108
00:05:31,712 --> 00:05:34,594
- What are you looking at? 
 - Huh? Nothing.

109
00:05:34,594 --> 00:05:37,007
 Ugh... this is so awkward! 

110
00:05:37,007 --> 00:05:39,568
- Hey, Bong Jooyi 
 - Yeah?

111
00:05:39,568 --> 00:05:41,858
I have a favor to ask.

112
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:43,642
What is it?

113
00:05:43,642 --> 00:05:45,306
Can I...

114
00:05:45,306 --> 00:05:47,663
see the orangutan one more time?

115
00:05:47,663 --> 00:05:48,713
Stop it!

116
00:05:48,713 --> 00:05:50,293
But that was so on point! Please, just one more time?

117
00:05:50,293 --> 00:05:51,732
Cut it out! What do you mean, orangutan?

118
00:05:51,732 --> 00:05:53,511
Please? Just one more time? Please?

119
00:05:53,511 --> 00:05:55,481
 How am I supposed to respond to that...? 

120
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:57,610
Please? Just once!

121
00:06:00,012 --> 00:06:01,497
- Genie! 
  - Yes 

122
00:06:01,497 --> 00:06:02,923
Show me the photobook.

123
00:06:02,923 --> 00:06:07,213
 Yes, I'll show you the photobook that has recently been added. 

124
00:06:11,483 --> 00:06:13,331
He's so cool!!!

125
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,084
So cool!

126
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:17,238
I think I'm going to get a boyfriend soon.

127
00:06:17,238 --> 00:06:18,844
Who is it this time?

128
00:06:18,869 --> 00:06:20,189
Kang Joonwoo.

129
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:23,423
You have like a hundred guys that almost ended up as your boyfriend.

130
00:06:23,423 --> 00:06:25,187
I'm 99% sure this time.

131
00:06:25,187 --> 00:06:26,363
Oh, out of 1,000%?

132
00:06:26,363 --> 00:06:27,763
Hey!

133
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,530
Hear me out!

134
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,565
He does my chores for me!

135
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,743
Your chores?

136
00:06:32,743 --> 00:06:34,043
Yeah!

137
00:06:34,043 --> 00:06:35,467
He doesn't do that for me.

138
00:06:35,467 --> 00:06:37,363
That's what I'm saying!

139
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:40,010
There's this signal going on here at the boarding house.

140
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,332
Don't you have anything going on with Woo Seungbong?

141
00:06:42,332 --> 00:06:43,285
No way...

142
00:06:43,285 --> 00:06:45,274
I'm so awkward around him.

143
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:47,163
Take a leaf from my book.

144
00:06:47,773 --> 00:06:49,067
Anyway,

145
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:50,770
to celebrate the first day of my fling with him,

146
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,232
why don't we have some beer?

147
00:06:52,232 --> 00:06:54,032
I'll go get them!

148
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:01,034
Hey!

149
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:15,639
How is working part-time for Hoon's movie going?

150
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,037
I'm going to quit next week.

151
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:18,395
The job's taxing, but it doesn't pay much.

152
00:07:18,395 --> 00:07:21,302
Hey, still, it's Hoon's movie. You can let that slide.

153
00:07:21,302 --> 00:07:22,335
I've never let anything slide,

154
00:07:22,343 --> 00:07:23,860
even if they're somebody I know.

155
00:07:23,868 --> 00:07:26,441
You can be so cold-hearted.

156
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:30,417
So, is everything going okay with the movie?

157
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:32,071
No.

158
00:07:32,071 --> 00:07:33,522
The girl who was supposed to come to the set tomorrow

159
00:07:33,522 --> 00:07:35,365
can't come because something suddenly came up.

160
00:07:35,365 --> 00:07:37,142
Oh, no, then what are you going to do?

161
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:39,072
I have to find somebody no matter what.

162
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,021
Why do you look so exhausted?

163
00:07:42,054 --> 00:07:43,492
You should cut down on your part-time hours!

164
00:07:43,492 --> 00:07:45,335
It's not because of my part-time job,

165
00:07:45,335 --> 00:07:46,450
it's Ji Yeonseo.

166
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,916
She's horrible at doing chores.

167
00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:52,225
Leave it to me.

168
00:07:52,225 --> 00:07:54,765
I'll tell her, so that you both

169
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,465
won't have to cross any lines.

170
00:07:57,714 --> 00:07:59,516
I think the line's already been crossed.

171
00:07:59,548 --> 00:08:02,279
 What? Cross the line with who? 

172
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:05,288
Hey, by the way, how about Yeonseo?

173
00:08:05,748 --> 00:08:06,963
What?

174
00:08:06,963 --> 00:08:07,965
 Are they talking about me? 

175
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:09,092
The girl you're looking for?

176
00:08:09,092 --> 00:08:11,212
Long hair, pale face.

177
00:08:11,212 --> 00:08:12,990
Come to think of it, you're right.

178
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,462
 So I was Joonwoo's ideal type! 

179
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:17,970
 It all makes sense now! 

180
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:18,926
Wow.

181
00:08:18,934 --> 00:08:20,402
She was right next to you!

182
00:08:20,427 --> 00:08:23,009
I should ask her if she has time.

183
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:25,548
But she might say no because it's all so sudden.

184
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:26,919
True,

185
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:28,893
but I can still ask her.

186
00:08:28,893 --> 00:08:30,652
 What the, Kang Joonwoo! 

187
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,958
 You're much more straightforward than I'd thought! 

188
00:08:38,249 --> 00:08:39,130
   

189
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,780
 Are you available tomorrow night? 

190
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,928
What...?

191
00:08:43,928 --> 00:08:46,588
He's definitely asking me out!

192
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:53,447
   
Yeah, I'm free.  What's up? 

193
00:08:53,447 --> 00:08:57,910
   

194
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,800
 (Text couldn't be sent) 

195
00:08:59,803 --> 00:09:01,840
Oh, the wi-fi isn't working again.

196
00:09:04,371 --> 00:09:06,559
Is he hesitating?

197
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,901
Okay.

198
00:09:08,901 --> 00:09:11,117
I'll make the advances then.

199
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:14,800
 Actually, I heard you guys talking earlier. 

200
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:20,499
   
 You don't have to hesitate... I'm free tomorrow! 

201
00:09:21,104 --> 00:09:22,884
So she heard about the part-time job?

202
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:26,774
   
 Then see you at 5:00 p.m. in front of Hankyung High School. 

203
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,371
Gosh!

204
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:32,171
He already had a place in mind, but still hesitated?

205
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,729
What should I wear tomorrow?

206
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:35,691
What if he confesses to me?

207
00:09:35,691 --> 00:09:38,068
What should I do?

208
00:09:45,161 --> 00:09:49,013
 Was this what "long hair and pale face" was all about? 

209
00:09:49,038 --> 00:09:50,650
The actor for the ghost lady is ready.

210
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,065
The shoot will begin.

211
00:09:52,065 --> 00:09:55,517
 Kang Joonwoo, are you messing with me? 

212
00:10:12,937 --> 00:10:16,025
You're here?

213
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,806
Cut! Okay!

214
00:10:17,806 --> 00:10:18,806
Okay.

215
00:10:18,831 --> 00:10:21,840
Wow, give it up for our ghost lady!

216
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,440
She's so pretty!

217
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,355
Wow, she's really good...

218
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:32,910
Oh, I almost sprained my neck.

219
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:36,234
Hello.

220
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:50,680


221
00:10:56,617 --> 00:10:59,129
I'm Ma Hoon.

222
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,996
 And there's another guy named Ma Hoon, 

223
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:04,425
 but he's busy nowadays shooting a movie. 

224
00:11:04,991 --> 00:11:07,693
Oh, so you were the movie director!

225
00:11:07,693 --> 00:11:09,052
Yeonseo, everything from your visuals,

226
00:11:09,077 --> 00:11:12,497
acting, and action... All three of them were perfect.

227
00:11:12,522 --> 00:11:15,317
Oh, stop it.

228
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,235
You're already a movie director?

229
00:11:17,235 --> 00:11:18,332
That's impressive.

230
00:11:18,332 --> 00:11:20,332
My dream is to become a great director like Bong Joonho,

231
00:11:20,357 --> 00:11:22,378
but I've still got a long way to go.

232
00:11:22,378 --> 00:11:24,296
 Director, can you take a look at this? 

233
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:25,421
Okay.

234
00:11:25,421 --> 00:11:28,512
Anyway, it's an honor to live in the same house as you.

235
00:11:28,512 --> 00:11:29,641
See you around.

236
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,769
You were great today!

237
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:34,198
You're also great!

238
00:11:41,462 --> 00:11:43,774
That guy Ma Hoon's pretty professional.

239
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:46,389
Oh, dang...

240
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,296
I talked to him for the first time looking like this?

241
00:11:49,596 --> 00:11:52,634
Darn you, Kang Joonwoo...

242
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,258
Huh? My bag...

243
00:11:55,258 --> 00:11:58,293
What? Where's my bag?

244
00:11:58,293 --> 00:12:01,092
My clothes and wallet were all there!

245
00:12:01,117 --> 00:12:03,071
Where did they go?

246
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:05,044
Dang...

247
00:12:06,481 --> 00:12:07,609
I asked people through the group chat.

248
00:12:07,609 --> 00:12:08,889
I'll tell you when they find them.

249
00:12:08,914 --> 00:12:10,531
Okay.

250
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:12,646
When is this over?

251
00:12:13,662 --> 00:12:16,130
It'll be over soon, so you can wait here.

252
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:18,263
I'll deduct 1,200 won from your pay

253
00:12:18,263 --> 00:12:20,287
and send you 48,800 won.

254
00:12:20,312 --> 00:12:21,894
Why deduct 1,200 won?

255
00:12:21,894 --> 00:12:23,436
Because I'll pay your bus fare later.

256
00:12:23,436 --> 00:12:24,436
What?

257
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:25,621
Pay my bus fare?

258
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:28,179
Who do you think I got in this mess for?

259
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:29,528
Who do I think... What?

260
00:12:29,528 --> 00:12:30,959
You said you wanted to do it.

261
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,029
Well, that's...!

262
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,291
Hey.

263
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,887
But shouldn't you be thanking me first?

264
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:39,626
Thanks, then.

265
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:46,180
Yeah, on my way.

266
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,037
I'm busy, so I have to go.

267
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:53,420
What happened to love signals at the boarding house?

268
00:12:53,445 --> 00:12:55,820
I can't believe that guy!

269
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,399
Oh, seriously!!

270
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:59,787
What am I going to do here, all alone?

271
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,199
 Good job, everyone. 

272
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:04,219
 - Thank you! 
 - Take care! 

273
00:13:06,507 --> 00:13:07,971
Joonwoo!

274
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:09,708
Want to hit the after-party?

275
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:10,860
We're going to have a barbecue.

276
00:13:10,885 --> 00:13:12,226
No.

277
00:13:12,226 --> 00:13:14,070
I have to return this and do my assignment.

278
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,783
Okay, thanks for today!

279
00:13:16,783 --> 00:13:18,488
Joonwoo, can you help out with things outside?

280
00:13:18,512 --> 00:13:20,290
Okay, I'm coming.

281
00:13:21,048 --> 00:13:23,754
- Yes? 
  - Hey, where's the survey? 

282
00:13:23,754 --> 00:13:25,537
Look at page 15 on the PowerPoint slides.

283
00:13:25,537 --> 00:13:27,591
 Yeah, send me the video file, too. 

284
00:13:27,591 --> 00:13:29,096
Do you need it right away?

285
00:13:29,096 --> 00:13:30,771
 I have to edit it right now. 

286
00:13:30,796 --> 00:13:32,171
I'll be going home soon, so...

287
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:35,457
Have all the staff left? Turning off the lights now!

288
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,604
Yes, I just got home after my part-time job.

289
00:13:39,604 --> 00:13:42,103
I'll send you the PowerPoint now.

290
00:13:42,103 --> 00:13:43,545
Okay.

291
00:13:44,763 --> 00:13:50,451
   
 Joonwoo, thanks for today. Say thanks to Yeonseo, too! 

292
00:13:50,461 --> 00:13:52,224
Oh, right.

293
00:13:52,224 --> 00:13:54,124
Ji Yeonseo.

294
00:14:04,514 --> 00:14:06,330
What time is it?

295
00:14:08,177 --> 00:14:10,850
Oh, I don't have my cell phone.

296
00:14:13,467 --> 00:14:15,124
What...?

297
00:14:15,685 --> 00:14:17,685
Why is it so dark in here?

298
00:14:24,886 --> 00:14:26,586
Oh, no way!

299
00:14:30,225 --> 00:14:32,194
Who's there?

300
00:14:39,528 --> 00:14:41,328
Geez!

301
00:14:41,328 --> 00:14:43,485
I have to borrow money...

302
00:14:43,485 --> 00:14:46,330
How am I going to get home?

303
00:14:47,092 --> 00:14:49,189
I'm going to kill Kang Joonwoo.

304
00:14:49,952 --> 00:14:53,351
 Kang Joonwoo is such a psycho! 

305
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:57,258
Oh, it feels so refreshing to be out in the living room.

306
00:15:07,868 --> 00:15:09,718
He's so cute!

307
00:15:10,632 --> 00:15:13,918
There's definitely something different about a limited edition figure.

308
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,800
My phone!

309
00:15:17,655 --> 00:15:19,340
Jungwoo,

310
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,971
please wait here for just a second!

311
00:15:36,664 --> 00:15:38,109
Huh?

312
00:15:38,134 --> 00:15:39,799
What's that?

313
00:16:10,745 --> 00:16:14,327
   

314
00:16:18,746 --> 00:16:20,279
    
 Is that broken idol figure

315
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,279
 something to cry so much about? 

316
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:24,437
 That's a limited edition itself for Bong Jooyi! 

317
00:16:24,437 --> 00:16:26,215
 Bong Jooyi, don't freak out. 

318
00:16:26,215 --> 00:16:28,115
 Not the figure, 

319
00:16:28,962 --> 00:16:30,962
 but the real limited edition... 

320
00:16:37,766 --> 00:16:42,471
