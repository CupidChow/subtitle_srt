1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,310


2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,280
   

3
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:17,550
Hey, Bong!

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,828
Once we live in a dorm,

5
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:21,212
I'll set you up on three dates a day.

6
00:00:21,218 --> 00:00:23,365
Forget about Seungbong.

7
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,234
I'm not moving out because of him.

8
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:26,401
And you know...

9
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,071
this place was far from the school so it's kind of good.

10
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:30,171
That's the spirit.

11
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,074
When we live in the dorm,

12
00:00:32,112 --> 00:00:34,217
we can sleep in until 10 minutes before our first class.

13
00:00:34,226 --> 00:00:35,426
Isn't that fire?

14
00:00:35,426 --> 00:00:37,536
Total fire.

15
00:00:37,536 --> 00:00:38,732
Right?

16
00:00:38,732 --> 00:00:40,707
So throw on a smile, Jooyi.

17
00:00:40,732 --> 00:00:43,393
I told you I'm fine, really.

18
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:54,737
 I didn't want to put any pressure on her, 

19
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,032
 so I couldn't even say that I liked her. 

20
00:01:04,529 --> 00:01:06,457
 Once you move out, 

21
00:01:07,376 --> 00:01:09,903
 can we still get along like this? 

22
00:01:11,593 --> 00:01:14,304
Ugh...  What do I do?

23
00:01:14,304 --> 00:01:16,476
Should I stop her?

24
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:18,830
How can I say that? I'm nothing to her.

25
00:01:18,855 --> 00:01:19,955
You tell me

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,431
Should I stop her?

27
00:01:21,431 --> 00:01:23,283
What? What did you say?

28
00:01:26,776 --> 00:01:28,280
If you keep kicking up such a fuss,

29
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,548
I'm going to move out, too.

30
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:31,758
Fine! Move on out.

31
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,926
Everyone can just go!

32
00:01:37,322 --> 00:01:38,422
What's this?

33
00:01:38,435 --> 00:01:39,795
   

34
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,518
Don't think too much,

35
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,553
just say it.

36
00:01:43,553 --> 00:01:46,889
You knew all along?

37
00:01:53,775 --> 00:01:55,791
   

38
00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:00,974
Telling her how I feel?

39
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,723
Saying that I like her?

40
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,250
How?

41
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,823
Seungbong, what are you up to?

42
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:13,291
Do you want me to show you something good?

43
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:14,629
Surprise!

44
00:02:14,654 --> 00:02:16,354
Let's go here.

45
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,626
   

46
00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:19,926
Couple massage?

47
00:02:19,926 --> 00:02:21,391
Why would I go there with you?

48
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,940
We went on our first date,

49
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,603
and this is going to be our second.

50
00:02:24,628 --> 00:02:25,687
What are you talking about?

51
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,846
I just did you a favor since you helped me out.

52
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:30,817
No way! You even bought a flower for me.

53
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,645
You said you wouldn't help me without the flower.

54
00:02:33,645 --> 00:02:34,880
It's okay, Seungbong.

55
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,984
You can be honest about your feelings for me.

56
00:02:36,984 --> 00:02:38,985
You don't have to make up a story like ordering figures

57
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,394
to go on a date with me.

58
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,437
What are you talking about?

59
00:02:43,437 --> 00:02:45,278
Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed?

60
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,241
Seungbong!

61
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:49,285
I know you like me.

62
00:02:49,285 --> 00:02:51,270
Not even the slightest.

63
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,972
What?

64
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,258
But I'm Ma Hoyoung.

65
00:02:55,284 --> 00:02:57,635
So what?

66
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,221
Just get lost.

67
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:02,407
Seungbong! Look at me!

68
00:03:02,407 --> 00:03:03,934
I'm Ma Hoyoung!

69
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:05,827
Are you out of your mind?

70
00:03:05,827 --> 00:03:06,911
Hey!

71
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:10,123
I am the super hot Ma Hoyoung!

72
00:03:12,524 --> 00:03:14,486
Seungbong! Look again!

73
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:18,748
Poor Jooyi, he was the first guy she ever liked,

74
00:03:24,156 --> 00:03:26,739
and he's messing around with another girl.

75
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,089
 Jooyi is down because of you, 

76
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:37,408
 and you two are being love birds? 

77
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:41,120
I really don't know what to do.

78
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,323
Can I just say I like her?

79
00:03:44,115 --> 00:03:45,967
Let's do it! Whatever!

80
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:49,104
No! It's not that easy!

81
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:52,466
Should I say it? Or not?

82
00:03:52,491 --> 00:03:53,900
 Jooyi is moving out, 

83
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,779
 but all that's in his head is how to tell Hoyoung how he feels. 

84
00:03:58,235 --> 00:04:01,550
Should I? It's driving me crazy!

85
00:04:03,918 --> 00:04:05,998
Are you going to tell someone about how you feel?

86
00:04:05,998 --> 00:04:07,470
What?

87
00:04:08,065 --> 00:04:10,041
I don't know what you are talking about.

88
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,185
I heard everything you just said.

89
00:04:12,198 --> 00:04:13,798
Who is it?

90
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,898
For... Forget about it.

91
00:04:16,898 --> 00:04:18,767
 He's really cheeky. 

92
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:20,918
 I seriously want to smack him. 

93
00:04:22,152 --> 00:04:24,631
 Huh? Wait a second. 

94
00:04:26,886 --> 00:04:28,409
Seungbong,

95
00:04:28,929 --> 00:04:32,063
 do you want to hear a sure bet on how to get a girl you like? 

96
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:33,173
There's something like that?

97
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:36,955
Jooyi and I are super into it.

98
00:04:36,955 --> 00:04:39,554
Whoever she is will love this, too.

99
00:04:40,234 --> 00:04:41,734
Jooyi, too?

100
00:04:43,047 --> 00:04:45,340
How does that work?

101
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,046
You want to know?

102
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,966
It goes like...

103
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,822
What the hell is this nonsense?

104
00:04:56,847 --> 00:04:58,373
Isn't it so cool it actually seems nonsensical?

105
00:04:58,373 --> 00:05:00,376
Girls like this kind of surprise?

106
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:02,593
Of course, they do!

107
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:03,720
Well, I mean...

108
00:05:03,745 --> 00:05:06,125
you can stay single for the rest of your life

109
00:05:06,136 --> 00:05:08,717
Do you and Jooyi really think...

110
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:11,318
this is cool?

111
00:05:11,318 --> 00:05:12,662
If you do it exactly this way,

112
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,481
she's going to fall in love with you.

113
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,961
Is that so?

114
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:22,497
Thanks for the tips!

115
00:05:22,497 --> 00:05:24,874
What are friends for?

116
00:05:30,366 --> 00:05:31,831
 Wu Seungbong, 

117
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:35,351
 I can't let you be happy with another girl. 

118
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:02,998
Dang it, it hurts.

119
00:06:05,623 --> 00:06:07,575
I need more practice.

120
00:06:20,392 --> 00:06:21,945
 Let's take another one. 

121
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,025
 One two three! 

122
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:26,127
 Jooyi, let me help you. 

123
00:06:26,127 --> 00:06:26,745
 With what? 

124
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,555
 Not bad! 

125
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:30,756
 Any other moves? 

126
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,303
 It's perfect! 

127
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:36,213
 I tried so many drinks that I almost lost my sense of taste. 

128
00:06:36,238 --> 00:06:37,618
 You are pretty serious about it, aren't you? 

129
00:06:37,618 --> 00:06:39,989
 Spending time with you is the best. 

130
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,301
 Come to think of it, 

131
00:06:42,793 --> 00:06:45,354
he was my first guy friend.

132
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,910
We never had lunch or dinner together.

133
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,782
Why is he sleeping on the couch?

134
00:07:31,986 --> 00:07:35,496
Jooyi? What are you doing here?

135
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:38,091
I just couldn't sleep.

136
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:41,519
It's pretty chilly here.

137
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,214
A bit...

138
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:44,887
How is your packing going?

139
00:07:44,887 --> 00:07:46,885
Okay.

140
00:07:46,885 --> 00:07:49,469
Haven't you gotten me a farewell gift or something?

141
00:07:50,122 --> 00:07:50,970
A gift?

142
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,134
You are the one moving out and leaving me here.

143
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,199
Seungbong.

144
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,539
Yeah?

145
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:03,099
Why don't we grab some lunch tomorrow?

146
00:08:03,882 --> 00:08:05,382
Sure.

147
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:07,509
Sounds good.

148
00:08:09,132 --> 00:08:12,543
 I guess tomorrow's the day. 

149
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:20,651
What is this?

150
00:08:20,651 --> 00:08:22,235
They are sneakers.

151
00:08:22,876 --> 00:08:24,444
So?

152
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,901
These are mine?

153
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:33,137
Wearing sneakers is better for your spine than high heals.

154
00:08:34,163 --> 00:08:35,863
Hold up.

155
00:08:35,863 --> 00:08:38,192
Why are you giving me these out of the blue?

156
00:08:38,192 --> 00:08:39,819
I heard you're moving out.

157
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,020
So?

158
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,298
When I heard that, I just wanted to get them for you.

159
00:08:44,298 --> 00:08:46,442
Is it a farewell gift?

160
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,936
You, Kang Joonwoo, bought me a gift?

161
00:08:50,749 --> 00:08:54,068
Your sneakers stink up the shoe closet.

162
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:56,527
Now you have a new pair, so throw away the stinky ones.

163
00:08:56,527 --> 00:08:58,496
What is going on, Joonwoo?

164
00:08:58,521 --> 00:09:00,214
What?

165
00:09:00,214 --> 00:09:03,793
Do... you like me?

166
00:09:04,986 --> 00:09:06,637
Your delusions never end, do they?

167
00:09:06,696 --> 00:09:08,857
Since when?

168
00:09:08,857 --> 00:09:10,581
Put on those shoes and go away.

169
00:09:10,606 --> 00:09:11,280
Tell me.

170
00:09:11,305 --> 00:09:13,511
Did you get so touched because I helped you with work?

171
00:09:13,535 --> 00:09:15,221
No, I did not.

172
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,740
I know you're lying.

173
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,333
Hey, that's my room!

174
00:09:19,334 --> 00:09:20,664
Are you trying to get into my room?

175
00:09:20,664 --> 00:09:22,669
You really ARE into me.

176
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,880
I just walked you to your room.

177
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:35,950


178
00:09:51,482 --> 00:09:52,882
Hey!

179
00:09:52,882 --> 00:09:54,066
What?

180
00:09:54,066 --> 00:09:55,920
I heard you and Jooyi are moving out.

181
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,015
You two go have fun here.

182
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:04,194
A certificate for couple massage?

183
00:10:04,194 --> 00:10:06,039
Why wouldn't you go with Seungbong?

184
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,339
Seungbong?

185
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:08,875
With him? Why?

186
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,145
There is something between you two.

187
00:10:11,145 --> 00:10:14,689
What a joke! Me and Seungbong?

188
00:10:14,689 --> 00:10:16,039
There's nothing between us.

189
00:10:16,064 --> 00:10:17,116
We're just friends!

190
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,993
What? "Just friends"?

191
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,095
You guys even went on a date.

192
00:10:22,095 --> 00:10:25,934
Oh, that! I helped him buy the Ha Jungwoo figure,

193
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,565
so he bought me lunch.

194
00:10:28,565 --> 00:10:31,523
The Great Ma Hoyoung with Seungbong?

195
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:34,133
You gotta be kidding me...

196
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:36,494
Seriously!

197
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,413
Ha Jungwoo figure?

198
00:10:40,285 --> 00:10:42,925
Han Jungwoo figure?

199
00:10:42,925 --> 00:10:45,492
The girl Seungbong has feelings for...

200
00:10:45,492 --> 00:10:47,159
Oh, dang it!

201
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:54,804
Why isn't Jooyi picking up?

202
00:10:59,674 --> 00:11:02,442
Seungbong asked me to watch a play together.

203
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:04,563
Why is nobody here?

204
00:11:06,526 --> 00:11:09,085
What is this flower road?

205
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,813
 Bong Jooyi! 

206
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,752
Seungbong?

207
00:11:38,724 --> 00:11:40,382
Jooyi,

208
00:11:42,288 --> 00:11:44,528
this is all for you.

209
00:11:45,355 --> 00:11:48,582
Jooyi! I'm coming to you.

210
00:11:49,739 --> 00:11:51,519
What are you doing?

211
00:11:54,736 --> 00:11:56,766
What the hell is going on?

212
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:59,318
I've been practicing it a lot.

213
00:12:00,495 --> 00:12:02,788
Am I doing all right?

214
00:12:04,499 --> 00:12:06,634
Are you nuts?

215
00:12:07,123 --> 00:12:08,645
Bong!

216
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,047
Joo!

217
00:12:10,072 --> 00:12:12,522
Yi!

218
00:12:24,006 --> 00:12:26,312
Wait!  What's wrong with this?

219
00:12:29,668 --> 00:12:31,701
Jooyi, I like y...

220
00:12:31,701 --> 00:12:33,886
Seungbong!

221
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:38,516
What is all this?

222
00:12:38,516 --> 00:12:40,393
Then, what about Hoyoung?

223
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:43,554
What? What about her?

224
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:47,121
Don't you like Hoyoung?

225
00:12:47,121 --> 00:12:49,651
You guys went on a date before.

226
00:12:49,651 --> 00:12:51,896
A date? Please..

227
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:53,898
She helped me order this,

228
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,284
so we had lunch, that's it.

229
00:12:56,284 --> 00:12:57,716
What?

230
00:12:59,804 --> 00:13:02,790
I couldn't get it out right earlier.

231
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,504
Jooyi,

232
00:13:11,307 --> 00:13:12,883
I like you.

233
00:13:16,646 --> 00:13:18,694
You like me?

234
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,548
Yes.

235
00:13:28,253 --> 00:13:30,576
Such a dummy.

236
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,914
I looked like an idiot earlier, didn't I?

237
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,533
I'm talking about myself.

238
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:39,180
Do you remember the day

239
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,521
I asked you that you were free?

240
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,758
I wanted to ask you out for a movie.

241
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,960
What?

242
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,463
I actually hate being in pictures,

243
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,758
but I took them because I could be a couple with you.

244
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,560
But why?

245
00:13:58,613 --> 00:14:01,524
Because I like you, too.

246
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:06,338
I felt like I was turning into an idiot the more I got into you.

247
00:14:06,338 --> 00:14:08,420
You're the same, too.

248
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:12,430
♫  I'll be floating in your sky  ♫

249
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:18,340
♫  It took a while.  When the morning is bright,  ♫

250
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:22,800
♫  We are at the same time  ♫

251
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,450
♫  Even twenty times a day  ♫

252
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:32,980
♫  we check out each other  ♫

253
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:41,800
♫  As much time as we wanted, we will be good  ♫

254
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,360
♫  I'm going to you  ♫

255
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,130
♫  The pure white color of the clouds...  ♫

256
00:14:49,153 --> 00:14:53,071
I'll show you better pogo stick skills after practicing it a little more.

257
00:14:53,071 --> 00:14:56,094
Hang on! Where did you get idea that I like pogo sticks?

258
00:14:56,149 --> 00:14:58,848
What? Yeonseo said you did.

259
00:14:58,848 --> 00:15:01,651
Listen to me, no one likes that.

260
00:15:01,676 --> 00:15:03,429
I knew something was off!

261
00:15:03,454 --> 00:15:07,197
She showed up out of nowhere and told me it's popular nowadays.

262
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,077
Why are we doing this?

263
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,024
I've got to leave for work.

264
00:15:13,024 --> 00:15:16,082
Hey, it's a historic moment.

265
00:15:16,107 --> 00:15:17,834
Now we have the first couple of Sol House,

266
00:15:17,859 --> 00:15:19,127
and we are not moving out.

267
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,003
What else?

268
00:15:21,028 --> 00:15:23,297
My James will take a long journey

269
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:26,033
to find another artist.

270
00:15:26,033 --> 00:15:29,019
Goodbye, James.

271
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:30,888
Why is he selling his camera?

272
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:34,124
He said he has a new dream now.

273
00:15:34,124 --> 00:15:37,612
So hot! Hurry up, I'm boiling.

274
00:15:37,612 --> 00:15:40,878
All right!  Everybody, strike a pose!

275
00:15:43,634 --> 00:15:45,085
Hang on.

276
00:15:45,085 --> 00:15:47,212
Jooyi and Seungbong!

277
00:15:47,964 --> 00:15:49,940
You are an official couple now.

278
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,209
Get closer like a real couple.

279
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:53,953
We're doing just fine!

280
00:15:53,978 --> 00:15:56,882
If you guys keep being awkward, I'll get in between you.

281
00:15:58,448 --> 00:15:59,704
 We've just turned 20 and 

282
00:15:59,729 --> 00:16:02,855
 we have more things to get used to than we are already used to. 

283
00:16:02,855 --> 00:16:04,628
 Everything is new and unfamiliar to us, 

284
00:16:04,653 --> 00:16:06,716
 so we make mistakes or we get into arguments. 

285
00:16:06,741 --> 00:16:09,751
Here we go!

286
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:11,929
 We all faced our new adventures head-on, 

287
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,756
 and shared our joys and sorrows. 

288
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,600
♫  What do I do?  ♫

289
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,650
♫  I ran away again, today.  Ooh, ooh  ♫

290
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,500
♫  What do I do?  ♫

291

♫  I'm stupid. What's this again?  Ooh, ooh  ♫

 Now, unlike before, 

298
00:17:03,394 --> 00:17:07,476
 I'm done being single and don't want to mingle.

Not yet, I'm sorry.

310
00:17:38,855 --> 00:17:41,010
I'm sorry, Director. I'll try one more time.
