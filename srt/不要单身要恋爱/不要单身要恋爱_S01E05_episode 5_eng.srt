1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:09,110


2
00:00:26,921 --> 00:00:29,079
Not a day goes by quietly in this house, huh?

3
00:00:29,104 --> 00:00:31,142
Yo, DJ! Yo, DJ!

4
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:32,512
Yo, DJ! Funk this party!

5
00:00:32,537 --> 00:00:33,725
Say, yeah!

6
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,991
Say, yeah!!

7
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:37,337
What is it this time?

8
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:38,861
His dream is to be a DJ now.

9
00:00:38,886 --> 00:00:41,351
Who changes his dreams as often as he changes his socks?

10
00:00:41,351 --> 00:00:42,653
Hey, Woo Seungbong!

11
00:00:42,653 --> 00:00:45,504
I mean... What I mean is...

12
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:47,703
I'm inviting you!

13
00:00:47,703 --> 00:00:49,452
to the club party tonight! Bang!

14
00:00:49,452 --> 00:00:50,571
What party?

15
00:00:50,604 --> 00:00:52,492
His DJing club at school is having a party.

16
00:00:52,517 --> 00:00:54,317
And he's inviting all of us.

17
00:00:55,746 --> 00:00:56,809
Genie!

18
00:00:56,834 --> 00:00:58,337
 Yes. 

19
00:00:58,962 --> 00:01:00,862
Turn up the volume.

20
00:01:02,111 --> 00:01:04,142
A one... a two...

21
00:01:04,175 --> 00:01:07,220
A one, two, three, four!

22
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,240
Jump!  Jump!

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,300
Jump! Jump!

24
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,580
Jump! Jump!

25
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:19,238
 Club? 

26
00:01:19,256 --> 00:01:21,008
I've never been to one.

27
00:01:21,033 --> 00:01:22,731
Why worry? You've got me!

28
00:01:22,756 --> 00:01:24,445
I'm worried because I've got you.

29
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:25,898
Whatever.

30
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,850
When going clubbing,

31
00:01:29,565 --> 00:01:31,561
it's all about heavy makeup.

32
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,461
Scalpel!

33
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:06,378
So, the face is pretty much done.

34
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,392
Now for the outfit... hmm?

35
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:22,014
What's keeping them so long?

36
00:02:22,749 --> 00:02:24,522
They're here.

37
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,522
Sorry for being late!

38
00:02:51,522 --> 00:02:53,622
Then you shouldn't have been late.

39
00:02:54,437 --> 00:02:56,674
What? Do I look weird?

40
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:58,332
Huh?

41
00:02:58,332 --> 00:02:59,713
No, you don't look weird.

42
00:02:59,738 --> 00:03:00,533
Then what?

43
00:03:00,564 --> 00:03:02,325
Well...

44
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:04,541
- Preâ€” 
 - Pretty, right?

45
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,972
I dolled her up.

46
00:03:05,997 --> 00:03:08,044
Bong Jooyi's going to rock this club tonight.

47
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:10,185
Shut up.

48
00:03:11,353 --> 00:03:12,590
What are you doing?

49
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,317
An assignment.

50
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:17,226
Wow, you're really something.

51
00:03:17,226 --> 00:03:19,194
Why did you come if you were going to be like this?

52
00:03:19,194 --> 00:03:21,197
Hey, Hoon ordered these for us.

53
00:03:21,197 --> 00:03:24,010
Kang Joonwoo can't hold his liquor, here's a non-alcoholic one.

54
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,121
So, Kang Joonwoo's a one-shot wonder?

55
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:29,167
He must kick up a real stink when drunk.

56
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:31,911
Ugh, that's so lame.

57
00:03:32,374 --> 00:03:34,397
I've never been drunk in my life.

58
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,399
Because I know my limit exactly.

59
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:38,379
Oh, yeah... Whatever.

60
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:41,739
Hey, wow, this song!

61
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:43,103
Let's go!

62
00:03:43,103 --> 00:03:43,982
Me too!

63
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:45,571
Hey, Bong Jooyi! Let's go!

64
00:03:45,571 --> 00:03:48,399
Huh... huh? Okay!

65
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:34,149
Hey, Bong Jooyi! Dance!

66
00:04:34,177 --> 00:04:36,557
Hey, I'll be over there in the back!

67
00:04:36,582 --> 00:04:38,072
What?

68
00:04:38,072 --> 00:04:39,893
What?

69
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,834
Oh, that almost killed me.

70
00:04:49,904 --> 00:04:51,704
What are you doing, all alone?

71
00:04:51,704 --> 00:04:52,665
What?

72
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,171
Oh! It's a bit boring in here, huh?

73
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:56,184
Do you want to leave this place together?

74
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:58,866
No! I'm here with a friend.

75
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:00,787
Then give me your number.

76
00:05:00,812 --> 00:05:03,717
No, my friend's waiting for me...

77
00:05:04,377 --> 00:05:06,277
But I don't see any friend around.

78
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:09,455
- Let's... 
 - Her friend's right here.

79
00:05:18,304 --> 00:05:19,652
What are you doing here alone?

80
00:05:19,677 --> 00:05:20,961
Is dancing boring?

81
00:05:20,986 --> 00:05:22,453
No, it's fun.

82
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:25,363
But these guys keep grinding.

83
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,488
Should I give you a tip?

84
00:05:28,488 --> 00:05:30,453
A tip?

85
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,003
Sir!

86
00:05:34,027 --> 00:05:36,254
Sir! You can't do this here.

87
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,479
Sir!

88
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:40,469
Sir! Sir!

89
00:05:54,282 --> 00:05:56,182
What are you doing?

90
00:05:56,182 --> 00:05:57,317
He must be working here.

91
00:05:57,342 --> 00:05:59,308
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

92
00:05:59,308 --> 00:06:01,309
Thank you.

93
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,161
Kang Joonwoo?

94
00:06:19,186 --> 00:06:21,217
What's he doing over there?

95
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,502
What? What's up with him?

96
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:36,361
Huh? Why are they dragging him away?

97
00:06:37,445 --> 00:06:38,983
Hey! Hold on!

98
00:06:39,008 --> 00:06:40,739
Hang on!

99
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:47,180
Hey! You said you've never been drunk in your life!

100
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,754
You're so heavy. Please stop driving for a sec.

101
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:51,819
What's he talking about?

102
00:07:00,197 --> 00:07:03,097
So he's still a clean freak even now?

103
00:07:11,655 --> 00:07:13,286
What?

104
00:07:13,286 --> 00:07:14,917
What?

105
00:07:22,184 --> 00:07:23,784
What's wrong with you?

106
00:07:36,106 --> 00:07:37,306
There.

107
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:39,317
Now, it's symmetrical.

108
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,820
Oh, geez... Wow!

109
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:50,171
Start driving again, please!

110
00:07:52,123 --> 00:07:54,823
Oh, what a nut case!

111
00:07:58,181 --> 00:08:00,681
What did you eat today? Ugh...

112
00:08:01,186 --> 00:08:02,986
Why is he so heavy?

113
00:08:06,098 --> 00:08:07,367
Hey, what are you doing?

114
00:08:07,392 --> 00:08:08,629
That's so hilarious.

115
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,970
If you dance like this, nobody will come near you.

116
00:08:09,995 --> 00:08:11,498
Try it!

117
00:08:19,422 --> 00:08:21,922
Oh, you're pretty good at this.

118
00:08:21,922 --> 00:08:23,253
Do you have anything else?

119
00:08:23,278 --> 00:08:24,951
Something else?

120
00:08:31,062 --> 00:08:32,108
Surprise!

121
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:33,219
Excuse me?

122
00:08:33,244 --> 00:08:35,117
It's me.

123
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,033
What? Ma Hoyoung?

124
00:08:41,115 --> 00:08:43,639
Hey, you should've hit me up if you were coming back to Korea!

125
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:44,999
I wanted this to be a surprise!

126
00:08:44,999 --> 00:08:46,586
You missed me, right?

127
00:08:46,586 --> 00:08:48,710
Why did you make this a surprise?

128
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,004
How long will you be staying this time?

129
00:08:50,004 --> 00:08:52,039
I'm not going back. I'm back for good.

130
00:08:52,085 --> 00:08:54,110
I got an internship at a fashion company.

131
00:08:54,135 --> 00:08:56,787
Oh, that's great! You've always wanted to do that.

132
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:58,567
Hey, Bong Jooyi Let me introduce you.

133
00:08:58,592 --> 00:08:59,924
This is Hoon's sister, Hoyoung.

134
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:01,350
Hi! I'm Ma Hoyoung.

135
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,375
What's your name?

136
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,100
I'm Bong Jooyi.

137
00:09:05,314 --> 00:09:07,370
Yo! Hoyoung! What's up?

138
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,072
Oh my god! Tommy!!

139
00:09:09,097 --> 00:09:10,197
Long time no see.

140
00:09:10,221 --> 00:09:12,330
It's been so long.

141
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,249
Did she grow up in the States?

142
00:09:15,274 --> 00:09:16,780
No, she only lived there for like three years.

143
00:09:16,805 --> 00:09:17,673
How are you?

144
00:09:17,698 --> 00:09:20,498
I'm fine, thank you, and you?

145
00:09:20,498 --> 00:09:21,304
Oh...?

146
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:23,971
Hey, guys! Let's hang out together!

147
00:09:23,971 --> 00:09:25,926
Tommy says we should hang out. Want to hit the floor?

148
00:09:25,926 --> 00:09:27,482
No, I'll stay here.

149
00:09:27,524 --> 00:09:30,224
Oh no... You're just going to sit around at a club?

150
00:09:30,228 --> 00:09:32,128
Jooyi, you're such a drag.

151
00:09:32,128 --> 00:09:34,564
Jooyi's totally a drag.

152
00:09:34,564 --> 00:09:36,486
 What is that? 

153
00:09:38,175 --> 00:09:40,175
I'll be staying here, too.

154
00:09:40,823 --> 00:09:42,258
But Hoon's going to be DJing soon!

155
00:09:42,283 --> 00:09:43,899
Let's go.

156
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:45,535
Oh, really?

157
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:48,261
Then I'll be back right after Hoon's DJing.

158
00:09:48,286 --> 00:09:49,386
Okay...

159
00:09:49,386 --> 00:09:51,286
Come on!

160
00:09:53,441 --> 00:09:55,041
What?

161
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,361
I'm a drag...?

162
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:25,154
Hey, cut it out.

163
00:10:31,334 --> 00:10:33,134
I'm going now.

164
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,424
Bong Jooyi?

165
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,760
Bong Jooyi... Wow!

166
00:11:03,861 --> 00:11:05,961
So you want to do this?

167
00:11:22,376 --> 00:11:24,676
Hey, you guys are so cool!!

168
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,102
Hey, Bong Jooyi!

169
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:48,132
Yo, DJ! Let's get it!

170
00:11:48,132 --> 00:11:50,298
Could you just stay still?

171
00:11:50,298 --> 00:11:51,875
Hey, Seungbong!

172
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,503
We haven't seen each other in a long while.

173
00:11:53,528 --> 00:11:54,709
Are you leaving already?

174
00:11:54,734 --> 00:11:56,177
She has to go home.

175
00:11:56,202 --> 00:11:57,106
You should go home, too.

176
00:11:57,131 --> 00:11:58,430
I'll get going. Bye.

177
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:04,394
Hey, get it together!

178
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:10,974
What? I'm a drag?

179
00:12:10,974 --> 00:12:12,297
Drag? What drag?

180
00:12:12,322 --> 00:12:14,262
Bong Jooyi's the funniest of them all.

181
00:12:14,262 --> 00:12:16,789
Then, why'd you hang out with your hot friend?

182
00:12:16,814 --> 00:12:19,234
Do you know how funny I am?

183
00:12:19,234 --> 00:12:20,895
What's with you tonight?

184
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,982
I did tell you to go but didn't know you actually would.

185
00:12:23,982 --> 00:12:25,416
Grinding and stuff, huh?

186
00:12:25,441 --> 00:12:27,550
Having the time of your life.

187
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,299
Hey, are you jealous?

188
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:31,410
Shut up!

189
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,436
Hey, that hurts!

190
00:12:34,939 --> 00:12:36,939
Bong Jooyi.

191
00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:38,106
What?

192
00:12:38,106 --> 00:12:39,709
You're super fun.

193
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:42,685
I have the most fun when I'm with you.

194
00:12:42,685 --> 00:12:44,639
Got it?

195
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:47,758
- Hey. 
 - Yeah?

196
00:12:47,783 --> 00:12:49,884
Where did you learn that dance?

197
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:52,128
You could be an idol.

198
00:12:52,128 --> 00:12:55,847
What? Me? An idol? No way!

199
00:12:59,804 --> 00:13:01,360
You awake?

200
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,882
What?

201
00:13:02,898 --> 00:13:04,598
Why are you here?

202
00:13:04,598 --> 00:13:06,194
Because I want to hang out with you.

203
00:13:06,194 --> 00:13:07,647
What?

204
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:10,149
Hang out with me.

205
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:12,961
Doing what?

206
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,175
 Bong Jooyi, 

207
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,171
 let's get some ramen. 

208
00:13:41,434 --> 00:13:44,234
 Bong Jooyi! 

209
00:13:44,234 --> 00:13:48,203
 ramen's ready!! 

210
00:13:49,873 --> 00:13:52,931
 Bong Jooyi! Your ramen's going to get soggy! 

211
00:13:55,947 --> 00:13:58,047
Why did I dream about that?

212
00:14:11,115 --> 00:14:12,915
Why aren't you eating ramen?

213
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,080
Eating ramen on an empty stomach isn't good for you.

214
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:18,569
Oh, whatever.

215
00:14:20,888 --> 00:14:22,343
You up now?

216
00:14:22,368 --> 00:14:23,121
Sit down.

217
00:14:23,146 --> 00:14:26,106
Huh? Yeah.

218
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,043
Do you remember what happened last night?

219
00:14:32,043 --> 00:14:33,326
Yeah.

220
00:14:33,326 --> 00:14:35,202
I'm sorry for kicking up such a stink.

221
00:14:35,202 --> 00:14:36,481
It's fine.

222
00:14:36,481 --> 00:14:39,470
My back hurts a bit, aches a bit, but it's fine.

223
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:42,739
Hey!

224
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:44,928
Aren't you going to say sorry?

225
00:14:46,006 --> 00:14:48,706
I'll pay off this debt in the near future.

226
00:14:48,706 --> 00:14:51,040
Make sure you do!

227
00:14:53,483 --> 00:14:55,283
Oh, that must be Hoon.

228
00:15:01,305 --> 00:15:03,105
Good morning!

229
00:15:03,105 --> 00:15:04,458
Huh?

230
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,512
I'm Ma Hoyoung.

231
00:15:09,122 --> 00:15:10,668
Why'd you speak down, when we've never met?

232
00:15:10,693 --> 00:15:12,140
We've met now!

233
00:15:12,574 --> 00:15:15,033
Ma Hoyoung, what brings you here this early?

234
00:15:15,058 --> 00:15:16,382
And what's with that luggage?

235
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,724
I heard you've got spare rooms.

236
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:19,800
Let's live together.

237
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,590
What?

238
00:15:50,362 --> 00:15:54,962
