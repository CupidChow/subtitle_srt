1
00:00:04,836 --> 00:00:06,536
Woo Seungbong,

2
00:00:06,536 --> 00:00:08,446
you have to shake out the wrinkles before hanging them.

3
00:00:08,513 --> 00:00:10,026
Okay!

4
00:00:10,026 --> 00:00:12,402
It's like you're turning into Kang Joonwoo.

5
00:00:16,325 --> 00:00:18,835
What's Hoyoung up to?

6
00:00:34,198 --> 00:00:37,298
Oh! Beautiful flowers!

7
00:00:37,298 --> 00:00:40,075
She's watering the garden.

8
00:00:40,075 --> 00:00:41,437
Oh...

9
00:00:41,437 --> 00:00:43,573
Thought she was doing a photoshoot or something.

10
00:00:43,573 --> 00:00:45,378
Life abroad messed her up.

11
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,755
Just ignore her.

12
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:50,251
So...

13
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:51,923
If you guys have known each other since you were kids,

14
00:00:51,923 --> 00:00:53,937
you must be really close.

15
00:00:53,937 --> 00:00:54,971
Yeah, we're close.

16
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,120
Our families know each other.

17
00:00:59,453 --> 00:01:02,853
Geez, that's going to damage the flowers!

18
00:01:02,853 --> 00:01:05,328
Hey, stop it! You're going to uproot all the flowers.

19
00:01:05,328 --> 00:01:06,671
What? No!

20
00:01:06,671 --> 00:01:07,974
I was doing it so well.

21
00:01:07,974 --> 00:01:09,474
Stop it! Let go!

22
00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:12,328
It's mine! Give it back!

23
00:01:16,378 --> 00:01:18,078
Hey, you should've hit me up if you were coming back to Korea!

24
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,245
 I wanted this to be a surprise! You missed me, right? 

25
00:01:20,282 --> 00:01:22,503
 Why would you make this a surprise? 

26
00:01:22,503 --> 00:01:23,820
Well...

27
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,889
They don't look like friends, they look like a couple.

28
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:34,819
 Friday, "chimaek" (fried chicken and beer) 

29
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:37,095
 Let's have chimaek when you're back in Korea. 

30
00:01:41,741 --> 00:01:43,341
Hey, Bong.

31
00:01:44,051 --> 00:01:45,851
Something is bothering you, right?

32
00:01:45,851 --> 00:01:47,884
No, there isn't.

33
00:01:50,536 --> 00:01:52,036
But...

34
00:01:52,043 --> 00:01:53,550
This isn't about me,

35
00:01:53,575 --> 00:01:55,510
but hear me out.

36
00:01:56,725 --> 00:01:58,470
So...

37
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,642
Your friend's friend's cousin's friend

38
00:02:01,642 --> 00:02:03,179
is sort of interested in a guy,

39
00:02:03,204 --> 00:02:05,955
but that guy has a super pretty, hot female friend.

40
00:02:05,955 --> 00:02:07,817
Did I get that right?

41
00:02:07,817 --> 00:02:09,757
Yeah, that's right.

42
00:02:09,782 --> 00:02:11,482
Who's that friend?

43
00:02:11,482 --> 00:02:13,472
Huh?

44
00:02:13,472 --> 00:02:15,920
Someone you don't know.

45
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,200
You have a friend that I don't know about?

46
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,031
Hey, that's not what's important here.

47
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:23,105
So what would you do about it?

48
00:02:23,105 --> 00:02:24,516
What would I do?

49
00:02:24,516 --> 00:02:27,167
Win back Woo Seungbong from Ma Hoyoung.

50
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:28,277
What?

51
00:02:28,277 --> 00:02:29,650
You knew this was about me?

52
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:30,683
Yeah.

53
00:02:30,697 --> 00:02:32,197
Recently, you've been looking at Woo Seungbong

54
00:02:32,222 --> 00:02:33,709
in a different way.

55
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:37,601
I can tell just by the look in your eyes. I can tell just by the look in your eyes, whether you want seasoned chicken or fried chicken.

56
00:02:37,653 --> 00:02:38,974
I'm a bit hurt.

57
00:02:39,003 --> 00:02:40,540
Sorry.

58
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,623
But I've never felt this way before.

59
00:02:43,623 --> 00:02:45,201
Girlfriend,

60
00:02:45,201 --> 00:02:47,078
just a while ago, you couldn't even look a guy straight in his eyes.

61
00:02:47,078 --> 00:02:49,769
But you're all grown up now.

62
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,191
So, are you going just sit there and watch?

63
00:02:52,216 --> 00:02:53,469
Then, what should I do?

64
00:02:53,494 --> 00:02:56,262
You have to appeal to Woo Seungbong!

65
00:02:56,262 --> 00:02:57,999
Spend time together so that he's closer to you...

66
00:02:57,999 --> 00:03:00,841
than he is with Ma Hoyoung!

67
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:05,834
This is my life companion for my career as a photographer.

68
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:07,268
James!

69
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:09,171
So this time, you're a photographer?

70
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,886
Last night, on a second-hand website,

71
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,072
I ran across James... and that's when I realized...

72
00:03:14,072 --> 00:03:16,901
Oh, I can't say no to

73
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:19,912
my destiny as a photographer.

74
00:03:19,912 --> 00:03:21,765
Isn't it time you said no already?

75
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,189
Oh, Seungbong, speaking of which.

76
00:03:24,189 --> 00:03:25,710
I thought of a good idea

77
00:03:25,735 --> 00:03:28,306
to promote the new menu at Sol Coffee.

78
00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:31,170
Promo pics to upload on social media?

79
00:03:31,195 --> 00:03:32,107
Sounds great!

80
00:03:32,132 --> 00:03:33,873
Right?

81
00:03:34,677 --> 00:03:36,777
We're going to be shooting with the "couple on a picnic" concept

82
00:03:36,777 --> 00:03:38,707
that's going to be perfect for the "sweet chocolate solaccino."

83
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:40,612
But we don't have money to get models.

84
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,009
Why would we need models?

85
00:03:42,034 --> 00:03:43,945
We have you, Seungbong!

86
00:03:46,197 --> 00:03:48,970
Well, that's true.

87
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,509
I'm better than most models.

88
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:53,233
But what about the female model?

89
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,718
That's why! I have her here!

90
00:03:55,718 --> 00:03:57,443
Me?

91
00:03:58,415 --> 00:04:00,515
Oh, I can't be a model...

92
00:04:00,515 --> 00:04:02,622
No, no!

93
00:04:02,622 --> 00:04:04,308
Hi, guys!

94
00:04:04,308 --> 00:04:06,502
Need a female model?

95
00:04:06,502 --> 00:04:08,480
Oh, right!

96
00:04:08,505 --> 00:04:09,989
You used to be a model for an online shopping mall, right?

97
00:04:10,014 --> 00:04:11,261
Yeah.

98
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:14,352
I'm a super hot model.

99
00:04:14,352 --> 00:04:16,443
I'll do it!

100
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,565
You?

101
00:04:18,565 --> 00:04:20,001
Yeah, so it's a couples shoot?

102
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:22,845
So I'm your girlfriend?

103
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:25,510
 Hoyoung's going to be the female model? 

104
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:35,560


105
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,580
 No! Absolutely not!!! 

106
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,937
Me too! I want to be a model, too!

107
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,953
But you didn't want to earlier.

108
00:04:53,978 --> 00:04:55,894
I didn't say I didn't want to.

109
00:04:55,894 --> 00:04:59,445
I used to be a model at Sunshine Kindergarten.

110
00:05:00,052 --> 00:05:04,352
We need one model but we have two applicants.

111
00:05:04,352 --> 00:05:05,366
Brother!

112
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,770
Why are you overthinking this?

113
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,902
I'm a super hot model!

114
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:15,217
If so!

115
00:05:15,217 --> 00:05:17,913
As the photographer, I'll select the main model of Sol Coffee

116
00:05:17,913 --> 00:05:19,335
in a fair manner.

117
00:05:19,335 --> 00:05:20,627
What's your criteria?

118
00:05:20,627 --> 00:05:22,860
Shhh! I have my own criteria.

119
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,275
But I can't tell you that.

120
00:05:25,275 --> 00:05:29,740
So, for the entire day tomorrow, I'll be observing your natural selves then decide.

121
00:05:36,225 --> 00:05:38,630
I can't be a model.

122
00:05:38,651 --> 00:05:39,679
I must be crazy.

123
00:05:39,704 --> 00:05:41,871
 This is just between you and me. 

124
00:05:44,313 --> 00:05:46,648
 In my opinion, if I were to select a model... 

125
00:05:46,673 --> 00:05:50,138
Hmm... first, the smile is important.

126
00:05:50,138 --> 00:05:51,536
How can I put this...

127
00:05:51,536 --> 00:05:55,318
A smile that makes you feel happy just by seeing it!

128
00:05:55,332 --> 00:05:56,342
Smile?

129
00:05:56,342 --> 00:05:58,882
I'm trying to wash the dishes and you're in the way. Please move over.

130
00:05:58,982 --> 00:06:00,754
And there's another one.

131
00:06:00,754 --> 00:06:02,559
Calm, relaxed vibes.

132
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:07,151
So I'm looking for somebody who, even amidst this busy modern society, can relax and take time to enjoy life!

133
00:06:07,151 --> 00:06:08,876
That's what I'm looking for.

134
00:06:08,876 --> 00:06:11,372
A smile and relaxed vibes?

135
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:12,867
Why would he look for that?

136
00:06:12,892 --> 00:06:14,892
I know, right?

137
00:06:14,892 --> 00:06:16,562
Oh, you scared me!

138
00:06:16,562 --> 00:06:19,197
Jooyi, why are you eavesdropping?

139
00:06:19,197 --> 00:06:21,025
You don't feel confident about being a model?

140
00:06:21,025 --> 00:06:22,050
What? What?

141
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,943
You were eavesdropping with me!

142
00:06:23,943 --> 00:06:26,366
I'm confident.

143
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:31,019
Let's pretend that we didn't overhear this and play fair, okay?

144
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,489
Oh... okay!

145
00:06:39,394 --> 00:06:40,394
Guys,

146
00:06:40,394 --> 00:06:42,437
I made us some snacks. Try them.

147
00:06:42,437 --> 00:06:43,321
Wow!

148
00:06:43,346 --> 00:06:44,882
Looks delicious!

149
00:06:44,882 --> 00:06:46,946
What's the yellow thing in the Spam?

150
00:06:46,946 --> 00:06:49,846
Oh, this is cheese.

151
00:06:49,846 --> 00:06:53,895
This one is SPAM Rich Cheese and it has cheese in it.

152
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:56,468
Cheese? That sounds delicious!

153
00:06:56,468 --> 00:06:57,736
What?

154
00:06:57,736 --> 00:06:59,976
What are you guys looking at?

155
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:11,210
Mmm... So amazing!

156
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:15,033
The cheese is so savory!!

157
00:07:15,739 --> 00:07:17,239
Is it that good?

158
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:22,306
Yes, and it brings a smile to my face!

159
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:27,631
 What happened to playing fair...? 

160
00:07:27,631 --> 00:07:29,963
Hey, your life in the States

161
00:07:29,963 --> 00:07:31,963
has really brightened you up!

162
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:39,993
 Oh, why did I think I could compete with her as a model? 

163
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,206
Jooyi, what's wrong?

164
00:07:42,206 --> 00:07:43,331
Don't you like it?

165
00:07:43,348 --> 00:07:45,631
Jooyi, what happened?

166
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:49,364
Oh, I'm fine!

167
00:07:49,364 --> 00:07:52,340
This Rich Cheese!

168
00:07:52,365 --> 00:07:54,565
Is really delicious!

169
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,442
Jooyi's smile is so radiant!

170
00:08:01,058 --> 00:08:03,458
Hey, Bong Jooyi!

171
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,367
What's up?

172
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:07,174
I dropped your cell phone

173
00:08:07,174 --> 00:08:08,402
and this is what happened...

174
00:08:08,402 --> 00:08:10,306
I'm really sorry.

175
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:14,501
It's fine...

176
00:08:14,526 --> 00:08:17,926
That can happen.

177
00:08:19,885 --> 00:08:21,485
It can?

178
00:08:21,485 --> 00:08:24,955
Hey, just be mad at me.

179
00:08:24,955 --> 00:08:27,591
Jooyi, you're such a positive person!

180
00:08:29,765 --> 00:08:32,565
I'm really fine.

181
00:08:35,727 --> 00:08:36,988
You should carry some of this, too!

182
00:08:37,013 --> 00:08:38,921
Okay!

183
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:41,466
Huh?

184
00:08:41,466 --> 00:08:43,358
What's Ma Hoyoung up to?

185
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,723
Hi, guys!

186
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:55,050


187
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,357
I'm sunbathing.

188
00:09:01,357 --> 00:09:03,194
Suntanning, you know?

189
00:09:03,194 --> 00:09:04,972
Why would you get a suntan in the yard?

190
00:09:04,972 --> 00:09:06,264
What problem?

191
00:09:06,264 --> 00:09:09,772
I'm enjoying a nice, leisurely suntan.

192
00:09:09,797 --> 00:09:11,297
Okay?

193
00:09:11,297 --> 00:09:14,993
Hoyoung's definitely living a life of leisure.

194
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:18,631
Wow... Ma Hoyoung...

195
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,783
Bong Jooyi? What's up with you?

196
00:09:22,783 --> 00:09:25,414
Oh, my room felt a bit stuffy,

197
00:09:25,414 --> 00:09:29,431
so I'm going to do my assignment here, leisurely.

198
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:31,342
You're doing your assignment there?

199
00:09:31,342 --> 00:09:34,140
Oh, I'm suddenly so sleepy.

200
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,265
Why don't I take a

201
00:09:36,265 --> 00:09:39,365
relaxing nap!

202
00:09:40,532 --> 00:09:42,200
Was there something wrong with breakfast today?

203
00:09:42,225 --> 00:09:44,425
Why are they acting so weird?

204
00:09:47,312 --> 00:09:49,278
Doing her assignment and pursuing relaxation at the same time...

205
00:09:49,303 --> 00:09:51,203
That's so cool!

206
00:09:55,004 --> 00:09:56,504
Oh, right!

207
00:09:56,504 --> 00:09:59,053
Hey, they said a typhoon was coming!

208
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,120
Oh, no! It's so cold!

209
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:05,145
I'm going inside now.

210
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,075
I'm fine here.

211
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:13,249
I love the cool breeze!

212
00:10:13,249 --> 00:10:15,717
What?

213
00:10:15,717 --> 00:10:19,233
Oh, I love it!

214
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,350
Are you guys crazy?

215
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,419
Hey, Hoon!!!

216
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,478
Pursuing leisure to the point that they won't submit to nature...

217
00:10:35,662 --> 00:10:38,923
I'm really touched by you two!

218
00:10:49,188 --> 00:10:51,488
   

219
00:11:00,784 --> 00:11:01,997
I was here first!

220
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,457
I held on to the doorknob first.

221
00:11:03,482 --> 00:11:05,814
I'll be out in five minutes.

222
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:09,881
I'll be out in three minutes and a half.

223
00:11:09,931 --> 00:11:11,531
Ouch!

224
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:13,067
Why does my back hurt so much?

225
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,460
My back hurts as if I dragged a drunk person home from the club!

226
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,677
Ow, my back!

227
00:11:22,634 --> 00:11:24,234
Go ahead.

228
00:11:24,298 --> 00:11:26,098
Thank you!!

229
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:30,355
Hey! Hey! Your nose is bleeding!

230
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:33,091
Hey, go ahead! Get in!

231
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,199
Hey, Woo Seungbong!

232
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,699
Kang Joonwoo has a nosebleed.

233
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:43,496
Again?

234
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:45,635
He must've been up all night doing his assignment after his shift.

235
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,706
What do you mean, again?

236
00:11:46,731 --> 00:11:47,881
Is he like that often?

237
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:50,941
Yeah, he has a lot of part-time jobs.

238
00:11:51,674 --> 00:11:52,974
Why?

239
00:11:52,974 --> 00:11:55,283
He doesn't even spend that much.

240
00:11:58,495 --> 00:12:01,395
Kang Joonwoo pays for his own bills and tuition.

241
00:12:01,395 --> 00:12:03,355
Oh, really?

242
00:12:04,483 --> 00:12:07,370
 Guys! I have a major announcement to make! 

243
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,417
 - Hurry up!!   
 - Okay

244
00:12:22,057 --> 00:12:24,757
My final choice is...!

245
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:29,143
Why are they so serious about this?

246
00:12:29,168 --> 00:12:31,957
Please...Please... Let it be Bong Jooyi

247
00:12:38,448 --> 00:12:40,448
Just hurry up and make the announcement!

248
00:12:40,448 --> 00:12:44,462
The model for Sol Coffee's 2020 promo pic is...!

249
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:57,060
Bong Jooyi!!!

250
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,571
Wow! Bong Jooyi!!! That's awesome!!

251
00:12:58,596 --> 00:12:59,898
Yay! I won!

252
00:12:59,898 --> 00:13:02,443
No way! This doesn't make sense!

253
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:08,547
Bong Jooyi, great job!

254
00:13:08,547 --> 00:13:10,267
Congrats, Jooyi!

255
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,040
   

256
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,420
   

257
00:13:18,427 --> 00:13:20,151
Guys,

258
00:13:20,151 --> 00:13:21,915
I told you that you two are a couple out on a picnic!

259
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,432
Sit closer together, more affectionately. Okay?

260
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,970
Oh, okay!

261
00:13:36,997 --> 00:13:38,297
You guys look like...

262
00:13:38,297 --> 00:13:41,256
two strangers in the same elevator.

263
00:13:41,256 --> 00:13:42,131
This isn't working.

264
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:44,630
Jooyi, lean against Seungbong's shoulder.

265
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,005
- Against his shoulder? 
 - Yeah!

266
00:13:47,005 --> 00:13:48,934
What do you mean, shoulder? That's too cringy.

267
00:13:48,967 --> 00:13:51,269
Then are you going to just sit there like strangers?

268
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:53,741
No, I'll do it!

269
00:14:01,403 --> 00:14:03,672
If you're going to do it, just do it.

270
00:14:05,396 --> 00:14:07,102
Oh, that's great!

271
00:14:07,102 --> 00:14:09,613
Now you look like a real couple!

272
00:14:09,613 --> 00:14:11,207
Say "kimchi!"

273
00:14:11,207 --> 00:14:12,402
Just a bit more.

274
00:14:12,427 --> 00:14:13,941
Yeah, now this is getting fun.

275
00:14:13,941 --> 00:14:15,934
Yeah, that's right! That's it, just a bit more!

276
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:19,267
Closer together!

277
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,320
♫  Even if I just rub my collar  ♫

278

♫  I remember all day  ♫

279

Yes!

 Guys! Choose the pic that looks the sweetest! 

286
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,710
♫  Just thinking about it makes me flutter  ♫

287
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:01,279
   

288
00:15:07,628 --> 00:15:11,128
 Hey, did you decide who's going to be the model later? 

289
00:15:13,931 --> 00:15:15,731
 I think that Hoyoung 

290
00:15:15,731 --> 00:15:17,768
 is appropriate for this shoot. 

291
00:15:17,768 --> 00:15:20,527
 Oh... really? 

292
00:15:22,553 --> 00:15:25,260
 But hey, I thought about it 

293
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,154
 and shouldn't a petite person be the model? 

294
00:15:28,183 --> 00:15:30,383
 Why? Models are usually tall. 

295
00:15:30,383 --> 00:15:32,379
 That's a stereotype! 

296
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:35,502
 Our café's motto is "Take the lowest place when serving guests." Right? 

297
00:15:35,527 --> 00:15:39,862
 But if both male and female models are tall that doesn't go with our café's motto! 

298
00:15:39,887 --> 00:15:41,529
 Oh! 

299
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:43,247
 Was our café's motto that? 

300
00:15:43,247 --> 00:15:44,916
 Yeah! Didn't you know? 

301
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:48,995
 And shouldn't the model be somebody with short hair? 

302
00:15:49,446 --> 00:15:51,946
 But isn't long hair easier to style? 

303
00:15:52,016 --> 00:15:54,016
 No! 

304
00:15:54,016 --> 00:15:56,649
 If the model has long hair... 

305
00:15:56,649 --> 00:15:58,346
 Right? 

306
00:15:58,346 --> 00:16:04,217
 What if... people with alopecia or those who want to cut their hair short feel hurt? 

307
00:16:08,805 --> 00:16:10,305
 That's true!!! 

308
00:16:10,305 --> 00:16:12,164
 Things could've gone really bad if you didn't tell me this. 

309
00:16:12,189 --> 00:16:13,892
 Thanks, Seungbong! 

310
00:16:13,892 --> 00:16:16,310
 It's nothing. 

311
00:16:23,293 --> 00:16:27,893
Jooyi... I wasn't sure at first...

312
00:16:27,893 --> 00:16:30,535
but you like Seungbong, right?

313
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,067
Keep beating the air...

314
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,389
because Seungbong is mine.

315
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:52,610

318

 Woo Seungbong, do you want to catch a movie with me? 

319
00:17:01,816 --> 00:17:03,631
 Isn't this your first time watching a movie with a guy friend? 

320
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:04,551
 I'm going to quit. 

321
00:17:04,576 --> 00:17:06,432
 It's hard keeping up with school while working part-tim.e 

322
00:17:06,457 --> 00:17:07,551
 Go on a date with me today. 

323
00:17:07,576 --> 00:17:08,488
 A date? 

324
00:17:08,512 --> 00:17:09,217
 What? 

325
00:17:09,242 --> 00:17:11,583
 Then what about Sol House? 

326
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,670
 We should probably leave, right? 

327
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:23,521
