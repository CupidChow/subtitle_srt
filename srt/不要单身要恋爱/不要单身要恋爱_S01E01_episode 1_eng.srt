1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,959
   
   

2
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:04,461
Crazy...

3
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:05,880
Is this really how co-ed school life is?

4
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:08,856
According to the web series, yeah. Is it not?

5
00:00:08,856 --> 00:00:11,077
  Is it you? Are you my girlfriend? 

6
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:14,003
- Ah, that's crazy! He's making my heart flutter! 
 - Yeah, yeah, me too...

7
00:00:14,003 --> 00:00:17,722
 We're friends who went to the same girl's middle and high schools and learned what romance is only through web series. 

8
00:00:17,722 --> 00:00:19,518
   
   

9
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,727
This one's an orangutan!

10
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:30,941
 We lived carefree in an all-girls environment, but there were side effects to not having any guys around us. 

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,200
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes?

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,949
Can I please ask for—

13
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:35,743
Oh...

14
00:00:36,368 --> 00:00:40,827
Sorry, I'm a senior in high school so I don't have time for dating. Sorry!

15
00:00:44,418 --> 00:00:46,419
What's wrong with her? I was asking her to vote on this!

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,000
   

17
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:52,905
 We would jump to conclusions when a guy came up to talk to us... 

18
00:00:52,926 --> 00:00:54,552
- Hello. 
 - Huh?

19
00:00:54,594 --> 00:00:58,511
- Could you please vote on your favorite travel destination? 
 - No, thanks.

20
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,632
All it takes is just one sticker on the place you'd like to visit. Please? Just one sticker...

21
00:01:02,685 --> 00:01:04,827
I... I like Korea!

22
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,022
 ...or act super shy and pathetic when a guy came up to talk to us. 

23
00:01:09,692 --> 00:01:11,568
 We became 20 years old... 

24
00:01:11,589 --> 00:01:12,840
Hey, bring it in!

25
00:01:12,861 --> 00:01:13,861
To Seohan Women's University!

26
00:01:13,862 --> 00:01:15,113
 To the Department of Korean Linguistics and Literature! 

27
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:21,357
 ...and achieved the triple combo of going to a girl's middle school, a girl's high school and a women's university. 

28
00:01:22,663 --> 00:01:24,538
We ran out of alcohol! We need more drinks!

29
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:26,282
   
   

30
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:28,416
Hey! How does this boarding house look?

31
00:01:28,418 --> 00:01:29,543
   

32
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,171
Looks good, right?

33
00:01:32,172 --> 00:01:34,338
Good? It's co-ed!

34
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,424
Hey...

35
00:01:35,425 --> 00:01:37,550
Our lives have literally been girls-only.

36
00:01:37,552 --> 00:01:39,469
Can't we at least share a house with guys? Huh?

37
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,263
No, we can't.

38
00:01:41,264 --> 00:01:43,014
Find a proper place.

39
00:01:43,014 --> 00:01:44,391
It's so stuffy living in a goshiwon. 
   (T/N: a small room with a bed, desk, and kitchenette: $15-20 a night) 

40
00:01:44,934 --> 00:01:46,126
You heartless b**ch.

41
00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:48,569
Huh? Hey, I have to go.

42
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,368
- Already? 
 - Yeah, it's time for the inter-college club orientation session.

43
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:53,816
I heard 70% of the members are guys.

44
00:01:53,817 --> 00:01:56,193
Ugh... That's so unsettling.

45
00:01:56,195 --> 00:01:58,362
Yeah, then make yourself at home here.

46
00:01:58,363 --> 00:01:59,780
I'm off. Bye!

47
00:01:59,781 --> 00:02:01,990
Bye! I'm off!

48
00:02:03,994 --> 00:02:07,186
 Drinking with an all-girls group is the best! 

49
00:02:14,262 --> 00:02:15,796
Huh? Hey, Kim Sooji!

50
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:18,070
Huh? Why are you here?

51
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:20,158
I'm here to have some drinks with my friends.

52
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:23,194
Hey, you want to drink with us?

53
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,780
Girls, this is my friend.  So what do you think? Do you want to let them join us?

54
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,610
 No... No... No way. 

55
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,935
Hello.

56
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,133
You're all okay with this, right?

57
00:02:38,173 --> 00:02:40,899
 Why are they joining us all of a sudden? This is so uncomfortable. 

58
00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:43,844
Let's clink glasses since it's still awkward!

59
00:02:43,865 --> 00:02:46,433
- Here, cheers! 
 - Cheers!

60
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:51,329
Oh, did you get your hair done?

61
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:52,581
Get your dirty hand off me.

62
00:02:52,582 --> 00:02:54,665
Nothing's going to change, even if you change your hairdo!

63
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:57,168
 How can she be so comfortable around a guy? 

64
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,711
I told you not to mess with me!

65
00:03:01,758 --> 00:03:04,049
Hi! I'm Woo Seungbong.

66
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:06,344
Oh, hi.

67
00:03:06,345 --> 00:03:08,579
Are you a good drinker? Do you want me to pour you a glass?

68
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:10,649
Thanks.

69
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,767
Hey, hang on...

70
00:03:23,945 --> 00:03:25,563
Oh, sorry!

71
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,782
 Ugh... This is so awkward. 

72
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,003
Okay, let's top you all off.

73
00:03:33,121 --> 00:03:34,688
Cheers, Jooyi!

74
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,242
This one's an orangutan!

75
00:03:48,511 --> 00:03:51,544
Oh, that's hilarious. That's a legit impression.

76
00:03:53,724 --> 00:03:55,808
Hey, I think I'm crying.

77
00:03:58,437 --> 00:03:59,771
Hey, are you okay?

78
00:04:00,647 --> 00:04:02,314
 Hey, are you okay? 

79
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:08,026
Hey, your hand is really big for a girl.

80
00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:09,465
Hey, get up now!

81
00:04:09,481 --> 00:04:10,948
 Hey, get up now! 

82
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,869
Hmm... It's so warm!

83
00:04:21,834 --> 00:04:24,293
   

84
00:04:31,093 --> 00:04:32,385
Hello...

85
00:04:32,386 --> 00:04:34,395
 Bong Jooyi! Where are you? 

86
00:04:35,264 --> 00:04:37,347
Where do you think I am? I'm in my goshiwon room.

87
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:41,351
 I hear you left the bar with a guy last night? 

88
00:04:41,353 --> 00:04:43,812
What are you talking about? Me, leave with a guy?

89
00:04:45,273 --> 00:04:46,691
Hold on a sec...

90
00:04:47,901 --> 00:04:49,451
 Are you up? 

91
00:04:49,861 --> 00:04:50,987
What's this...?

92
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:54,063
 Sending you this selfie! Good night! 

93
00:04:55,992 --> 00:04:57,659
What the? What's this?

94
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,620
 Hello? Hey, Bong Jooyi!!! 

95
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,329
 Hey! Bong Jooyi! 

96
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,165
What on earth did I do...?

97
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,258
 Hello? 

98
00:05:06,502 --> 00:05:07,885
 Hold on... 

99
00:05:08,963 --> 00:05:10,588
 The person next to me wasn't a girl? 

100
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:12,257
 If you're interested... 

101
00:05:12,258 --> 00:05:13,716
 If I'm interested...? 

102
00:05:13,717 --> 00:05:14,884
 Let's get out of here. 

103
00:05:14,885 --> 00:05:16,310
 Get out...? And go where? 

104
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,096
 We'll be seeing each other every day! 

105
00:05:20,098 --> 00:05:22,774
 Great! I would love that. 

106
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,977
 I really like you. 

107
00:05:24,978 --> 00:05:27,196
 What's there to like about me? 

108
00:05:29,816 --> 00:05:31,158
I'm screwed...

109
00:05:33,987 --> 00:05:39,371
So, you were drinking with a guy named Woo Seungbong then went to a coffee shop, just the two of you?

110
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:40,992
And took this selfie?

111
00:05:40,993 --> 00:05:43,452
I think yesterday's Jooyi did that.

112
00:05:43,454 --> 00:05:44,405
Hey!

113
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,389
- I got it. 
 - Got what?

114
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,922
- I think you decided to go out with him! 
 - Huh?

115
00:05:49,922 --> 00:05:51,232
Don't be crazy!

116
00:05:51,253 --> 00:05:55,346
Hey, you guys left together because "you were interested" and you said that you liked each other.

117
00:05:55,346 --> 00:05:57,382
 If you're interested, let's get out of here. 

118
00:05:57,384 --> 00:05:59,302
 I really like you. 

119
00:05:59,303 --> 00:06:01,296
Well, that's true...

120
00:06:01,972 --> 00:06:02,848
Hear me out.

121
00:06:02,872 --> 00:06:05,456
 We'll be seeing each other every day! 

122
00:06:05,475 --> 00:06:08,776
"We'll be seeing each other every day!" He said, "We." We!!

123
00:06:08,776 --> 00:06:11,229
There's no need to see each other every day unless you're dating.

124
00:06:11,231 --> 00:06:12,398
I'm 100% certain.

125
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,607
No...

126
00:06:13,608 --> 00:06:14,950
Probably not...

127
00:06:15,735 --> 00:06:17,627
Gosh... is that it?

128
00:06:17,654 --> 00:06:20,695
Oh, Bong Jooyi dating before I get to?

129
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:23,305
This is crazy! Seriously!

130
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,308
Dang, what on earth did I do last night? Seriously...

131
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:28,829
Hey, he was pretty cute in that selfie.

132
00:06:28,831 --> 00:06:30,831
Hey, you might as well just go out with him.

133
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,292
Date him, okay?

134
00:06:32,314 --> 00:06:33,436
Date him! Date him!

135
00:06:33,457 --> 00:06:35,633
Date who? Shut up!!

136
00:06:36,213 --> 00:06:37,747
Hey, he's texted you.

137
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:42,445
 We're still on for 5:00 p.m., right? 

138
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,800
This is huge! You're probably going on a date with him today!

139
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:51,199
Hey, don't read it... Don't! I told you not to read it!

140
00:06:53,354 --> 00:06:55,455
Why isn't she texting back?

141
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,024
That girl from last night?

142
00:06:57,025 --> 00:06:59,900
Yeah... or maybe she changed her mind?

143
00:07:05,074 --> 00:07:07,166
Oh!  What are you doing?

144
00:07:13,082 --> 00:07:15,715
Oh, I have to find a house...

145
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:18,118
Did you find a room?

146
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,754
Are you looking for a room?

147
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,149
There's a boarding house above our coffee shop.

148
00:07:22,174 --> 00:07:25,166
A boarding house? With room and board?

149
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:28,512
Yeah, they provide room and board...

150
00:07:28,513 --> 00:07:29,930
If you're interested, later we can—

151
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:32,290
- Let's go right now. 
 - Get out of here now?

152
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:35,976
Yup! I'm going there right now to sign my lease!

153
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:37,229
Oh, really?

154
00:07:37,981 --> 00:07:39,006
Yeah!

155
00:07:43,736 --> 00:07:45,696
Is it okay to sign your lease after just a look around the place?

156
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:48,309
Yup! It's fine. It's fine.

157
00:07:48,336 --> 00:07:51,253
Wow, I like your personality.

158
00:07:51,285 --> 00:07:53,911
But doesn't it bother you that this is a co-ed boarding house?

159
00:07:53,912 --> 00:07:56,063
Co-dinosaur...?

160
00:07:56,582 --> 00:07:58,623
I don't care, it's fine.

161
00:07:59,543 --> 00:08:00,860
Awesome!

162
00:08:02,296 --> 00:08:03,963
Your name is Bong Jooyi?

163
00:08:03,964 --> 00:08:05,964
I'm also a Bong. I'm Woo Seungbong.

164
00:08:05,966 --> 00:08:07,883
Really?

165
00:08:07,884 --> 00:08:09,926
We're both Bongs!

166
00:08:09,928 --> 00:08:11,512
Let's be friends.

167
00:08:11,513 --> 00:08:13,431
Yeah, let's be friends!

168
00:08:13,431 --> 00:08:16,015
Great! Love it!

169
00:08:16,017 --> 00:08:17,517
Let's take a selfie.

170
00:08:17,518 --> 00:08:18,685
Now?

171
00:08:18,686 --> 00:08:21,312
But we'll be seeing each other every day anyway!

172
00:08:21,355 --> 00:08:24,423
This is to celebrate our first day as friends!

173
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,749
Here I come!

174
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,441
Hey, be careful. What's with you?

175
00:08:34,994 --> 00:08:37,328
Cheeeeeeese!

176
00:08:40,164 --> 00:08:42,540
I'm sure she would've woken up by now...

177
00:08:42,542 --> 00:08:44,834
Maybe she's going to cancel her contract because she's found a better place.

178
00:08:44,836 --> 00:08:48,012
No way! It's already well into the semester so nobody new is going to come.

179
00:08:48,548 --> 00:08:51,798
Hey, don't you think our place is pretty great?

180
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:54,260
It isn't that great, if you consider the location or the rent.

181
00:08:54,262 --> 00:08:57,054
You're really going to say that when you don't even pay the rent?

182
00:08:57,056 --> 00:09:00,774
Instead, I take care of this boarding house and do all the cleaning. I think I'm the one losing out here.

183
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:03,102
Fine, you jerk...

184
00:09:05,106 --> 00:09:07,098
Why isn't she texting back?

185
00:09:08,317 --> 00:09:10,068
Oh, she's texted back!

186
00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:12,069
 Where should I meet you? 

187
00:09:12,071 --> 00:09:14,954
If she says she's going to break the lease,

188
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,091
I'm going to make her stay no matter what.

189
00:09:23,915 --> 00:09:27,783
 Yeah, I can't date just anybody even if I was really drunk. 

190
00:09:29,713 --> 00:09:31,855
 I'll somehow smooth this over and leave. 

191
00:09:48,272 --> 00:09:50,364
Did you make it home safe last night?

192
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:52,233
Uh... yeah...

193
00:09:53,819 --> 00:09:57,686
 Why does she keep avoiding eye contact? Is she really about to cancel her lease? 

194
00:09:58,782 --> 00:10:02,311
 Why is he staring at me like that? This is so overwhelming... 

195
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:05,661
Umm... I was too drunk last night...

196
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:11,560
 Should I say we should break up? 

197
00:10:11,628 --> 00:10:14,503
 She's obviously going to say that she wants to cancel the contract. 

198
00:10:16,999 --> 00:10:20,417
You're not trying to say that we should forget about what happened, are you?

199
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:24,612
I'm really sorry. Can we just forget about what happened?

200
00:10:26,267 --> 00:10:27,984
I don't think we can.

201
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,811
 Gosh... he won't break up with me? 

202
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,856
 No, I have to fill the vacancies... 

203
00:10:34,924 --> 00:10:38,633
Hey, you can't back out like this, not after getting me so hyped up!

204
00:10:38,654 --> 00:10:41,238
But how can I... not on the first day I saw...

205
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:43,210
Last night, you said you didn't need to see it in detail.

206
00:10:43,217 --> 00:10:45,719
The moment you saw it, you said it was good enough, had good proportions...

207
00:10:45,786 --> 00:10:47,369
You said okay right away!

208
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,321
 Are you crazy, Bong Jooyi? You told a guy that he had "good proportions"? 

209
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,900
 Last night, she said that the room had great proportions as soon as she saw it... 

210
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:57,944
Sorry! I think I was crazy last night.

211
00:10:58,631 --> 00:11:00,298
Please, can you just forget about it?

212
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:04,367
 What should I do? Would she change her mind once she sees the room again? 

213
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:08,837
Then, for the last time... Would you please take another look?

214
00:11:08,849 --> 00:11:10,433
At what?

215
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:16,584
For the last time, take a look at this house.

216
00:11:17,232 --> 00:11:19,566
Why... Why would I take a look at your house?

217
00:11:19,568 --> 00:11:22,277
This house is one of the biggest in the neighborhood.

218
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:25,046
It has a huge living room and the rooms are huge, too.

219
00:11:25,073 --> 00:11:27,591
 Why is he bragging about his house? 

220
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,813
No! I don't think I need to look at it! I have to go!

221
00:11:41,047 --> 00:11:42,672
Hey, just take another look around!

222
00:11:42,673 --> 00:11:44,341
Why would I look around your house?

223
00:11:44,342 --> 00:11:46,559
I'm telling you, this house is really great!

224
00:11:47,303 --> 00:11:49,011
What's wrong with you?

225
00:12:13,328 --> 00:12:17,062
- What's wrong? 
 - Oh, I don't know. That tenant suddenly pushed me.

226
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,233
She's the tenant?

227
00:12:21,002 --> 00:12:22,986
I'm a tenant?

228
00:12:23,754 --> 00:12:25,289
My arm!

229
00:12:25,298 --> 00:12:27,323
I think I broke my arm!

230
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,035
My arm! My arm!

231
00:12:33,806 --> 00:12:37,098
 (Stay tuned for a sneak peek of the next episode!) 

232
00:12:41,521 --> 00:12:43,230
 Isn't the landlady home? 

233
00:12:43,231 --> 00:12:44,523
 I'm the substitute landlord. 

234
00:12:44,524 --> 00:12:45,941
 Hey, by the way, what do you think of Yeonseo? 

235
00:12:45,946 --> 00:12:47,614
 My name is Ji Yeonseo. 

236
00:12:47,652 --> 00:12:50,445
 She's the type of girl you're looking for, with long hair and a pale face. 

237
00:12:50,466 --> 00:12:53,346
 Oh, I love it here. 

238
00:12:53,382 --> 00:12:56,288
 Can we... make a deal? 

239
00:12:56,319 --> 00:12:57,785
 A deal? 

240
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:03,140
credit

241
00:13:03,143 --> 00:13:05,293
