1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,918
Joonwoo, do you want to go to the audition together?

2
00:00:03,939 --> 00:00:05,462
I'm auditioning to become an actor.

3
00:00:05,462 --> 00:00:06,900
Actor?

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,081
Last week, you said that you wanted to become an idol.

5
00:00:09,081 --> 00:00:10,782
You know I went on a blind date, right?

6
00:00:10,782 --> 00:00:12,854
She can read people's future by physiognomy.

7
00:00:12,854 --> 00:00:16,388
She said that I have a face of an actor.

8
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:19,832
I will do everything I can to become an actor.

9
00:00:19,832 --> 00:00:21,770
I'm glad you'll do whatever you can,

10
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:23,188
but don't pull me into it.

11
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:25,967
But I don't have a manager,

12
00:00:25,967 --> 00:00:26,984
so I don't have anyone to take me there.

13
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:27,651
I'm not going.

14
00:00:27,651 --> 00:00:30,004
If you go with me, I'll treat you to a great dinner.

15
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,588
It's my turn to mop today, I can't go.

16
00:00:32,588 --> 00:00:35,221
Then will you help me practice my lines?

17
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:36,776
No, I can't. I have to do my project.

18
00:00:36,776 --> 00:00:38,310
Jeez.

19
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:44,380


20
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:50,444
To be or not to be, that is the question.

21
00:00:50,444 --> 00:00:53,257
Oh, my! Isn't this a line from "Hamlet"?

22
00:00:53,257 --> 00:00:54,550
Yes, it is.

23
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,903
I can't seem to concentrate, practicing by myself.

24
00:00:56,903 --> 00:01:00,165
 Is he saying that he can concentrate when I'm around? 

25
00:01:00,165 --> 00:01:01,676
What is your role?

26
00:01:01,684 --> 00:01:02,768
Is it a musical?

27
00:01:02,768 --> 00:01:06,628
I'm auditioning to become a show host on a home shopping program.

28
00:01:08,983 --> 00:01:12,108
Back ribs, to be or not to be,

29
00:01:12,111 --> 00:01:13,820
that is the question.

30
00:01:13,821 --> 00:01:15,465
How much should you buy?

31
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:17,524
That is the question.

32
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:19,392
Oh?

33
00:01:20,227 --> 00:01:23,411
What's it like at an audition?

34
00:01:23,413 --> 00:01:24,247
Huh?

35
00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:25,931
If you're curious, do you want to go with me?

36
00:01:25,931 --> 00:01:28,635
 Is he making an excuse 

37
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:30,137
 to go on a date with me? 

38
00:01:30,137 --> 00:01:32,678
If you go with me, I'll treat you to dinner at a famous restaurant.

39
00:01:32,678 --> 00:01:33,974
 It's 100%. 

40
00:01:33,974 --> 00:01:37,918
 Hoon definitely has an interest in me. 

41
00:01:38,694 --> 00:01:41,694
Let me check my schedule.

42
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:45,168
I happen to be free today.

43
00:01:45,168 --> 00:01:46,836
Let me get ready, I'll be right back.

44
00:01:46,836 --> 00:01:48,195
All right.

45
00:01:56,653 --> 00:01:58,379
What happened? What's the matter?

46
00:01:58,872 --> 00:01:59,823
Oh, my.

47
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:00,636
My teeth.

48
00:02:00,657 --> 00:02:02,224
Are you okay?

49
00:02:02,224 --> 00:02:03,492
What do I do?

50
00:02:03,493 --> 00:02:05,769
I don't have teeth.

51
00:02:07,372 --> 00:02:08,290
What are you doing?

52
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,821
Are you in elementary school?

53
00:02:09,821 --> 00:02:11,818
Whoa, Bong Jooyi! Now you're hitting me?

54
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:13,669
You couldn't even look into a man's eyes.

55
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,937
You act just like my girlfriends from high school.

56
00:02:24,397 --> 00:02:26,439
You've become much more relaxed.

57
00:02:27,191 --> 00:02:28,084
Bong Jooyi,

58
00:02:28,084 --> 00:02:30,060
taste this.

59
00:02:31,362 --> 00:02:32,521
What is it?

60
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,400
How is it?

61
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,753
It's delicious!

62
00:02:39,778 --> 00:02:40,654
What is it?

63
00:02:40,696 --> 00:02:42,572
It's the new menu, "chocolate solaccino."

64
00:02:42,572 --> 00:02:43,739
Is there anything that should be changed?

65
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,800
Well...

66
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,792
It's a bit sweet.

67
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,694
This chocolate is very unique.

68
00:02:48,694 --> 00:02:49,871
Right?

69
00:02:49,913 --> 00:02:52,080
I shaved it myself with a knife.

70
00:02:52,082 --> 00:02:53,582
Oh, really?

71
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,466
Yes.

72
00:02:56,085 --> 00:02:58,169
Is it too sweet?

73
00:03:00,573 --> 00:03:03,508
Did you get hurt making this?

74
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,036
I suppose.

75
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:10,872
Welcome!  What would you like to order?

76
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:15,176
 I thought he was just a jokester, 

77
00:03:15,176 --> 00:03:17,371
 but I guess he's quite earnest. 

78
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:24,388
Huh?

79
00:03:24,388 --> 00:03:26,971
Didn't you go to the audition with Hoon?

80
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,318
I almost went.

81
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:32,826
But because of that brat Kang Joonwoo!

82
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:35,630
What about Joonwoo?

83
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,008
Hey, listen.

84
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,817
Kang Joonwoo is really crazy!

85
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,155
Ready to go Yeonseo?

86
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,588
 We were vibing along great. 

87
00:03:44,588 --> 00:03:45,224
Where are you going?

88
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:47,384
 But just then Kang Joonwoo happened to appear. 

89
00:03:47,385 --> 00:03:48,843
I'm going somewhere with Hoon.

90
00:03:48,844 --> 00:03:51,528
But you're in charge of vacuuming today.

91
00:03:51,528 --> 00:03:52,680
Oh...

92
00:03:52,681 --> 00:03:54,398
I'll do it when I get back.

93
00:03:54,398 --> 00:03:57,125
I can only mop after you vacuum.

94
00:03:57,125 --> 00:04:00,270
Then I'll also mop when I get back.

95
00:04:00,272 --> 00:04:01,315
Why would you do that?

96
00:04:01,315 --> 00:04:02,121
What?

97
00:04:02,163 --> 00:04:04,122
I don't want someone else to do my job.

98
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:05,317
Then do it tomorrow.

99
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:06,698
Then mopping will be done tomorrow, too.

100
00:04:07,287 --> 00:04:09,671
Never in my life have I ever put a thing off to the next day.

101
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:10,495
Hey!

102
00:04:10,495 --> 00:04:11,970
What are you talking about?

103
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,367
Oh, is that so?

104
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:15,915
Yeonseo, I'll take you to an audition next time.

105
00:04:15,915 --> 00:04:17,204
What?

106
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:18,497
Yes, hello?

107
00:04:18,498 --> 00:04:20,523
But I'm done getting ready.

108
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:26,475
Then, did you vacuum with this dress on?

109
00:04:26,505 --> 00:04:27,631
Yes!

110
00:04:27,631 --> 00:04:30,649
Because of him, I vacuumed with full makeup on!

111
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:32,161
Oh, my...

112
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:33,896
With your temper, how did you endure it?

113
00:04:33,896 --> 00:04:36,888
It's like talking to a wall with him.

114
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,558
He's so annoying!

115
00:04:46,992 --> 00:04:49,334
Please be careful not to drop crumbs.

116
00:04:49,686 --> 00:04:51,070
I didn't!

117
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,613
Don't pick a fight with me.

118
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:04,599
Did you do well on your audition?

119
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:06,501
No, I wasn't cast.

120
00:05:06,502 --> 00:05:08,253
It's okay.

121
00:05:08,254 --> 00:05:11,779
You're good, so you'll get cast soon.

122
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,299
Thank you.

123
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,393
Jeez...

124
00:05:14,393 --> 00:05:17,044
But being an actor isn't easy as I expected.

125
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:20,257
Song Kangho used to be an unknown actor, too.

126
00:05:20,257 --> 00:05:22,891
But now, he went to the Cannes Film Festival in Germany.

127
00:05:22,893 --> 00:05:25,085
It's in France, not Germany.

128
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:28,919
I knew that!

129
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,065
I just got a little confused.

130
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:31,134
That...

131
00:05:31,134 --> 00:05:32,968
It's where they give out the palm tree trophy.

132
00:05:32,968 --> 00:05:34,716
It's not a palm tree trophy.

133
00:05:34,741 --> 00:05:36,221
It's called Palm d'Or.

134
00:05:40,084 --> 00:05:42,035
That's what I meant!

135
00:05:42,035 --> 00:05:45,595
I'm sure she was just confused.

136
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,898
If you confuse two things, it's likely that she doesn't know.

137
00:05:52,997 --> 00:05:54,890
Hey!

138
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,351
Let's have a few words.

139
00:06:03,065 --> 00:06:05,082
Hey, Kang Joonwoo!

140
00:06:05,082 --> 00:06:07,581
Do you know that you have no flexibility at all?

141
00:06:07,602 --> 00:06:08,712
In what areas?

142
00:06:08,712 --> 00:06:11,020
Do you have to criticize me in front of others like that?

143
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,637
I can't criticize you in the back of others.

144
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:13,732
Hey!

145
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:14,983
Would you like it if I criticized you

146
00:06:14,984 --> 00:06:16,193
in front of others when you make mistakes?

147
00:06:16,193 --> 00:06:19,011
If I don't know something, I don't talk about it.

148
00:06:22,642 --> 00:06:26,475
And earlier, if I had somewhere to go, couldn't I have vacuumed later?

149
00:06:26,475 --> 00:06:28,121
Cleaning up in the morning was also something you were supposed to do.

150
00:06:28,122 --> 00:06:30,305
There are things called priorities!

151
00:06:30,305 --> 00:06:32,484
I was going on a date with Hoon.

152
00:06:32,484 --> 00:06:34,335
That's probably your misunderstanding.

153
00:06:34,336 --> 00:06:36,695
Hoon went on a blind date recently.

154
00:06:36,695 --> 00:06:38,647
Can I go now?

155
00:06:38,647 --> 00:06:40,399
Hey, wait a minute.

156
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,617
He went on a blind date?

157
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:45,288
Stop lying! That doesn't make sense.

158
00:06:45,288 --> 00:06:48,106
Hoon going on a date with you, is what doesn't make sense.

159
00:06:48,106 --> 00:06:50,067
You're not Hoon's style.

160
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:50,928
What?

161
00:06:50,928 --> 00:06:51,603
Hey!

162
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:52,579
Not his style?

163
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,544
What kind of style is that?

164
00:06:54,544 --> 00:06:57,414
The kind of style that misunderstands others and then gets mad about it.

165
00:06:57,414 --> 00:06:59,659
Even now you're getting angry because you've been cut out.

166
00:07:03,744 --> 00:07:04,928
Cut out?

167
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:05,616
Cut out!?

168
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:06,409
Hey!

169
00:07:06,431 --> 00:07:08,519
Isn't it natural for me to get angry when you say things like that?

170
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:12,253
I've never gotten angry for tedious reasons.

171
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,582
If you have nothing more to say, I'm going to go.

172
00:07:20,597 --> 00:07:22,956
He's never been angry before?

173
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:24,775
Fine, okay.

174
00:07:24,775 --> 00:07:29,327
I'll make you angry for the most tedious reason.

175
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:50,160


176
00:07:53,329 --> 00:07:55,662
He's going to school wearing that?

177
00:07:55,664 --> 00:07:57,840
He's so hard-headed.

178
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:03,228
The main character is the criminal and everyone dies.

179
00:08:03,228 --> 00:08:04,197
I see.

180
00:08:04,197 --> 00:08:05,182
The main character is the criminal.

181
00:08:05,182 --> 00:08:06,216
Everyone dies.

182
00:08:06,258 --> 00:08:07,134
They all die!

183
00:08:07,134 --> 00:08:08,826
Hey!

184
00:08:12,555 --> 00:08:14,415
   

185
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,110
   

186
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:42,926
I'm so mad!

187
00:08:42,926 --> 00:08:45,351
That brat is not human.

188
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:46,548
Forget about it.

189
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,072
You're the one getting stressed out.

190
00:08:48,072 --> 00:08:49,516
Hey!

191
00:08:49,516 --> 00:08:51,383
You'd better not get close to Kang Joonwoo!

192
00:08:51,384 --> 00:08:53,218
Okay, okay.

193
00:08:53,219 --> 00:08:55,179
So what are you planning to do next?

194
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,621
Nothing!

195
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:58,181
It's annoying me.

196
00:08:58,182 --> 00:08:59,433
That brat.

197
00:08:59,434 --> 00:09:01,384
Jeez!

198
00:09:02,145 --> 00:09:03,679
I'm so annoyed.

199
00:09:10,369 --> 00:09:11,429
Knock before you enter.

200
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:13,321
It's just me.

201
00:09:13,706 --> 00:09:16,981
That toothbrush is really difficult to get used to.

202
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:19,578
Regular toothbrushes lack detergency. 
  (T/N: Detergency is the process of cleaning without solvents) 

203
00:09:19,578 --> 00:09:21,603
Do you have mysophobia in your mouth, too?

204
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,414
Bong Jooyi said that Yeonseo gave up.

205
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:27,041
She didn't bother me in the first place.

206
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,200
You are something else Kang Joonwoo.

207
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,416
Kang Joonwoo, that brat!

208
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,425
The more I think about it, the more it upsets me.

209
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:46,611
I should just stay away from him.

210
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:50,299
Huh?

211
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:53,693
What is this?

212
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:55,594
We had one of these?

213
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:58,698
   

214
00:10:15,219 --> 00:10:15,949
What...

215
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,416
What are you doing right now?

216
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,217
Were you home?

217
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,260
What does it look like?

218
00:10:20,261 --> 00:10:22,803
I'm exfoliating.

219
00:10:26,267 --> 00:10:28,101
Why are you using that to exfoliate?

220
00:10:28,101 --> 00:10:31,386
Then, should you brush your teeth with a foot file?

221
00:10:34,408 --> 00:10:36,517
How long has it been since you used that to do that?

222
00:10:36,517 --> 00:10:37,944
This?

223
00:10:37,944 --> 00:10:39,321
About...

224
00:10:39,321 --> 00:10:40,297
three days or something?

225
00:10:40,297 --> 00:10:41,989
What?

226
00:10:43,617 --> 00:10:45,376
Three days?

227
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:52,375
Hey...

228
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:54,400
What's the matter?

229
00:11:08,037 --> 00:11:09,621
Why are you using my toothbrush to clean your feet?

230
00:11:09,642 --> 00:11:12,152
...to clean your feet?

231
00:11:12,711 --> 00:11:13,811
Ji Yeonseo!

232
00:11:13,812 --> 00:11:15,805
I'm not going to let this pass Ji Yeonseo!

233
00:11:19,443 --> 00:11:22,485
So you used this to exfoliate your feet?

234
00:11:22,487 --> 00:11:24,621
Oh my god!

235
00:11:24,621 --> 00:11:29,774
This is the big edition toothbrush that was made manually with fine bristles.

236
00:11:29,774 --> 00:11:32,639
It took six months to make it because it's custom made.

237
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:35,298
What kind of toothbrush is this big?

238
00:11:35,298 --> 00:11:37,575
Does this look like a toothbrush to you?

239
00:11:38,211 --> 00:11:40,363
Now that I look at it, it does look similar.

240
00:11:40,363 --> 00:11:42,163
This is driving me crazy.

241
00:11:42,163 --> 00:11:44,832
I did everything and it didn't work.

242
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,179
Why are there so many projects?

243
00:11:50,181 --> 00:11:52,648
Does he think that I only take his class?

244
00:11:56,946 --> 00:11:59,105
Joonwoo's getting angry about something like that?

245
00:11:59,106 --> 00:12:00,982
I've never seen him like this before either.

246
00:12:00,983 --> 00:12:02,817
I thought he had never been angry in his whole life?

247
00:12:02,818 --> 00:12:05,610
Why am I breathing so loudly?

248
00:12:06,254 --> 00:12:08,113
It's so annoying!

249
00:12:08,114 --> 00:12:09,349
Why is my voice like this?

250
00:12:09,349 --> 00:12:10,158
Jeez!

251
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:12,516
I dropped my pen!

252
00:12:12,979 --> 00:12:14,304
I can't reach it!

253
00:12:14,344 --> 00:12:17,094
Why is my arm so short?

254
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,685
Why is the weather so nice?

255
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,669
I'm so annoyed! I'm annoyed!

256
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:26,199
 Joonwoo, who has never been angry in his whole life, 

257
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:28,091
 got angry at everything. 

258
00:12:28,092 --> 00:12:29,551
 It took him three days to calm down. 

259
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,400
 I'm breathing so loudly! 

260
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,320
   

261
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:39,976
Woo Seungbong, what are you doing? We're closed for the day.

262
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:40,963
Huh?

263
00:12:40,963 --> 00:12:43,238
I'm developing a new menu.

264
00:12:43,238 --> 00:12:44,633
I'm glad you're here.

265
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:45,925
Try this.

266
00:12:53,892 --> 00:12:55,742
It's perfect.

267
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:56,444
Really?

268
00:12:56,465 --> 00:12:57,258
Yes.

269
00:12:57,258 --> 00:13:00,121
I drank so much of it, that I lost my taste buds.

270
00:13:00,121 --> 00:13:01,989
You're really trying hard.

271
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:05,031
I thought you were just doing this for your mom.

272
00:13:05,758 --> 00:13:07,232
I have to do my best.

273
00:13:07,232 --> 00:13:10,515
I didn't go to school because I wanted to run this place.

274
00:13:11,183 --> 00:13:15,271
How did you end up taking over this place?

275
00:13:15,271 --> 00:13:18,707
When my brother went to study abroad, my mom wanted me to go, too.

276
00:13:18,707 --> 00:13:20,241
But I told her that I wanted to stay.

277
00:13:20,241 --> 00:13:21,193
Why?

278
00:13:21,193 --> 00:13:22,762
Isn't it nice to go abroad?

279
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:26,113
I can't speak a word of English,

280
00:13:26,113 --> 00:13:28,825
and we lived here since before my dad died.

281
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:30,567
It would be a shame to sell it.

282
00:13:31,094 --> 00:13:32,778
Oh...

283
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,464
Don't get sentimental.

284
00:13:34,489 --> 00:13:35,489
It's not something to pity.

285
00:13:35,489 --> 00:13:37,104
I don't think it's pitiful.

286
00:13:37,104 --> 00:13:40,360
It's great to be the owner of a cafe when you're only 20 years old.

287
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,104
Right?

288
00:13:42,554 --> 00:13:45,629
I think I'm pretty great, too.

289
00:13:47,818 --> 00:13:49,335
Whatever...

290
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,304
Does your mustache grow at night?

291
00:14:00,304 --> 00:14:02,139
What are you talking about?

292
00:14:06,253 --> 00:14:07,403
What are you doing?

293
00:14:07,403 --> 00:14:09,463
What?

294
00:14:10,006 --> 00:14:12,731
Wipe off that mustache.

295
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:16,460
I'm really smart.

296
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,220
What's with Woo Seungbong?

297
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,340
♫  What do I do?  ♫

298
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:25,230
♫  Im such a fool, what is this?  ♫

299
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:30,050
♫  Without even knowing, I was looking at you  ♫

300
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:33,970
♫  What do I do? I think you caught me  ♫

301
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,500
♫  I keep thinking of you  ♫

302
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:37,611
   
 Tonight, we'll have a club party! 

303
00:14:37,632 --> 00:14:39,256
 I'm inviting you! 

304
00:14:39,259 --> 00:14:39,968
 Club? 

305
00:14:39,968 --> 00:14:41,302
 I've never been to one 

306
00:14:41,323 --> 00:14:42,411
 Isn't dancing fun? 

307
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:43,508
 Surprise! 

308
00:14:43,513 --> 00:14:44,120
 I'm Ma Hoyoung. 

309
00:14:44,162 --> 00:14:44,996
 What are you doing here? 

310
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,130
 I wanted to play with you. Let's play together. 

311
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,020
♫  Just thinking about you makes my heart flutter  ♫

312
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,560
♫  I miss you again today  ♫

313
00:14:52,564 --> 00:14:54,823
