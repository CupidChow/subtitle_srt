1
00:00:00,395 --> 00:00:02,970
Seungbong, do you want to watch a movie with me?

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,015
I totally didn't buy these tickets.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,489
I got them for free.

4
00:00:07,647 --> 00:00:09,442
So awkward.

5
00:00:11,028 --> 00:00:14,372
Hey, there isn't much to do. Do you want to go see a movie together?

6
00:00:14,372 --> 00:00:16,225
Stop acting chill.

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,560
Then, what am I supposed to say?

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,519
By the way,

9
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,865
isn't this your first time watching a movie with a guy friend?

10
00:00:21,865 --> 00:00:24,341
He is the first EVER guy friend in my life.

11
00:00:24,341 --> 00:00:26,082
Oh, my dear Bong Jooyi.

12
00:00:26,145 --> 00:00:28,119
It's like you're taking your first steps.

13
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:30,329
You're all grown up.

14
00:00:31,872 --> 00:00:34,810
Right. I have to go on a blind date.

15
00:00:34,892 --> 00:00:35,892
Okay, bye.

16
00:00:35,917 --> 00:00:37,804
But one more thing...

17
00:00:38,597 --> 00:00:41,691
Do you think he wants to go to a movie with me?

18
00:00:41,691 --> 00:00:43,045
Obviously.

19
00:00:43,045 --> 00:00:45,866
That Seungbong, he's totally into you.

20
00:00:45,866 --> 00:00:47,791
So have fun with the movie!

21
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:49,474
I'm off!

22
00:00:53,883 --> 00:00:56,047
Not sure about "totally."

23
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:04,200


24
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,850
♫  What do I do?  ♫

25
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,450
♫  I ran away again today  ♫

26
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,390
♫  Ooh  ♫

27
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,580
♫  Secretly looking at you  ♫

28
00:01:18,582 --> 00:01:20,832
Ooh, this color looks nice

29
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:23,753
♫  I guess you got caught  ♫

30
00:01:23,753 --> 00:01:27,620
    
 ♫  I keep thinking of you again  ♫

31
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,210
♫  I keep seeing you  ♫

32
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:36,090
♫  I'm so curious. I'm so very heartbroken  ♫

33
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,148
Yes! I got this.

34
00:01:46,785 --> 00:01:49,784
Jooyi's expression is so funny.

35
00:01:52,755 --> 00:01:57,099
 The female model is cute. Do you know her social media handles? 

36
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,378
She's cute?

37
00:02:00,378 --> 00:02:02,263
What is this guy?

38
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:05,340
 One comment deleted. 

39
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,518
What a joke. Thinking he can call her cute.

40
00:02:13,058 --> 00:02:15,443
Oh, isn't this...?

41
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:20,057
 That is like a real Han Jungwoo for Jooyi. 

42
00:02:20,082 --> 00:02:24,360
Awesome! She's going to love it.

43
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:32,394
All right. See you there then.

44
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,113
Bye.

45
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:36,698
  No way! Don't even think about it! 

46
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:37,898
 I've already made up my mind. 

47
00:02:37,898 --> 00:02:40,243
 Joonwoo, think it over. 

48
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,594
What's going on?

49
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,138
Yes, I'm quitting.

50
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:44,839
I'm Kang Joonwoo.

51
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:47,734
It's just too much working and studying at the same time.

52
00:02:48,394 --> 00:02:51,254
I have to visit in person?

53
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,714
Okay, I'll be there next week then.

54
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,865
 What? Kang Joonwoo... 

55
00:02:54,865 --> 00:02:56,803
 Is Joonwoo quitting school? 

56
00:02:56,828 --> 00:02:59,596
All right, thanks.

57
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,148
Do you really have to quit?

58
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:06,143
You are still too young to give up on learning.

59
00:03:06,143 --> 00:03:08,105
I'm busy enough just with work.

60
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,940
It's even hard to make a living.

61
00:03:09,965 --> 00:03:12,625
I understand you are going through a tough time,

62
00:03:12,631 --> 00:03:15,554
but don't you think you should pursue your dreams at your age?

63
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:18,303
Making money is more important than my dreams right now.

64
00:03:19,488 --> 00:03:20,867
 He works a lot. 

65
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:21,996
 He's not even a big spender? 

66
00:03:22,021 --> 00:03:25,076
 Joonwoo covers his living expenses and tuition all by himself. 

67
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:31,352
He'll stop going to school because of money?

68
00:03:31,352 --> 00:03:34,338
The time and the money he's spent so far will go to waste.

69
00:03:34,338 --> 00:03:36,271
 Any girls up for a shift today? 

70
00:03:36,296 --> 00:03:38,368
 My partner blew it. 

71
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,610
 Don't you need boys? 

72
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:41,430
 I have plans today :( 

73
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:42,722
 Should I dress up like a girl? 

74
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:44,991
 Joonwoo! Cheer up 

75
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,377
I have plans, too.

76
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:53,115
 I can't do it alone. I need one more person right now. 

77
00:03:53,145 --> 00:03:55,071
Why can't he do it alone?

78
00:03:55,071 --> 00:03:58,287
 Making money is more important than my dreams. 

79
00:04:02,187 --> 00:04:05,603
Yes, I'm on my way.

80
00:04:05,632 --> 00:04:07,522
Yeah, I'd love pasta.

81
00:04:07,522 --> 00:04:10,867
I'd love it but...

82
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,375
I'm so sorry.

83
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,481
Something urgent just came up, I don't think I can make it.

84
00:04:17,756 --> 00:04:20,209
Can you translate the English on this page?

85
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,421
Is this why you called me to your room? Because of this?

86
00:04:23,421 --> 00:04:26,332
Yes. So what is it saying?

87
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:30,361
Import for deposit?

88
00:04:30,361 --> 00:04:31,648
What should I click?

89
00:04:31,673 --> 00:04:34,357
K-Pop Han Jungwoo goods?

90
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,199
Why are you trying to buy this?

91
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,819
Because I have to.

92
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,446
So, are you going to help me or not?

93
00:04:39,477 --> 00:04:40,906
What would you offer me if I help you?

94
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:43,308
Can't you just do it for me?

95
00:04:43,308 --> 00:04:44,893
Nope!

96
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:48,797
And I'm pretty sure it'll be sold out soon since it's a limited model.

97
00:04:48,797 --> 00:04:50,673
Seriously?

98
00:04:50,673 --> 00:04:52,901
I will do anything you want.

99
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,026
Can we please hurry?

100
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:54,957
Are you sure?

101
00:04:54,982 --> 00:04:56,370
Yeah.

102
00:04:56,992 --> 00:04:58,965
Then... let's hang out.

103
00:04:59,005 --> 00:05:01,467
Let's go on a date today!

104
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,469
Going on a date?

105
00:05:02,528 --> 00:05:05,272
Yes, there's something I've been craving.

106
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:07,521
I'll help you when we get back.

107
00:05:07,565 --> 00:05:09,250
Buying you lunch?

108
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,852
All right, deal!

109
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,845
You better keep your word.

110
00:05:15,051 --> 00:05:17,115
   

111
00:05:22,514 --> 00:05:24,999
Seungbong, do you want to see a movie today?

112
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:27,358
Are you up for a movie?

113
00:05:27,383 --> 00:05:29,971
Gosh, how should I put this?

114
00:05:30,655 --> 00:05:31,604
Oh, god.

115
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:33,174
You scared me.

116
00:05:33,174 --> 00:05:35,309
What are you doing here?

117
00:05:35,388 --> 00:05:37,279
What are you up to today?

118
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:38,505
You must be going to Sol Coffee.

119
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,090
Actually... I, um...

120
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:42,625
We have plans today.

121
00:05:42,662 --> 00:05:45,929
Oh, were you guys in his room together?

122
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,265
Yep! Seungbong needed help with a K-pop—

123
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,725
What's wrong with you?

124
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,478
We've still got something to finish up. See you later!

125
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,910
   

126
00:05:57,469 --> 00:05:59,196
What was that?

127
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,286
Why can't he even tell me?

128
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,199
How am I supposed to wear this?

129
00:06:09,224 --> 00:06:10,528
It's a hot dog.

130
00:06:10,528 --> 00:06:13,672
I'm a hot dog and you're ketchup.

131
00:06:16,151 --> 00:06:17,252
I mean...

132
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,629
You should've told me what this was about!

133
00:06:19,654 --> 00:06:20,887
I can't do this.

134
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:23,808
If you don't do it, I can't do this either.

135
00:06:23,831 --> 00:06:25,903
My face will be all over the place in that costume.

136
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:29,188
Nope, it's not going to happen!

137
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:31,578
Seriously, you expect me to wear this?

138
00:06:34,786 --> 00:06:36,479
Yes, Seungbong.

139
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,665
Yeah, I made up my mind.

140
00:06:39,683 --> 00:06:42,363
 Is that about quitting school? 

141
00:06:42,363 --> 00:06:44,871
Nothing is going to change it.

142
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,881
I'm just going to take this.

143
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:54,539
Everyone is working so hard to convince him.

144
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,891
Why is he so obsessed with money?

145
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:01,370
  I told you I'm quitting. 

146
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,014
Reconsider it.

147
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:09,045
Are you seriously going to stop working out at the gym?

148
00:07:09,926 --> 00:07:11,781
  Like I said, nothing will change my mind. 

149
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:15,838
You said you wanted to get in shape like Chris Hemsworth.

150
00:07:15,838 --> 00:07:18,696
  That doesn't really matter right now. 

151
00:07:19,194 --> 00:07:21,608
I get lazy if you're not around to spot me, man.

152
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,152
  I've got to get back to work. Bye. 

153
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:25,845
You are so cold.

154
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,811
Okay, bye.

155
00:07:29,344 --> 00:07:30,627
He said the same thing to me.

156
00:07:30,652 --> 00:07:33,135
It didn't work even though I tried.

157
00:07:33,135 --> 00:07:35,113
He was serious about getting fit.

158
00:07:35,113 --> 00:07:37,156
How can he give up his dreams so easily?

159
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,859
That's rich, coming from you.

160
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:42,654
I'm off.

161
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:43,779
Where are you going?

162
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:45,298
I've got something to do with Hoyoung.

163
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,333
Take a good care of the cafe.

164
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,883
They have plans?

165
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:54,056
Seungbong and my little sister?

166
00:07:59,198 --> 00:08:00,522
What took you so long?

167
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,148
Are you slacking off?

168
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,927
You said you can't do this.

169
00:08:06,565 --> 00:08:08,766
You said you can't do this without me.

170
00:08:08,766 --> 00:08:10,522
Hurry up and get ready.

171
00:08:11,878 --> 00:08:13,692
All right, that's great!

172
00:08:13,717 --> 00:08:15,829
One more time! Good, smile!

173
00:08:15,854 --> 00:08:17,163
Ketchup, you are doing a great job!

174
00:08:17,188 --> 00:08:18,650
Once again, awesome!

175
00:08:18,675 --> 00:08:19,682
Two of you smile!

176
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,626
Hot dog, your smile is great!

177
00:08:21,651 --> 00:08:23,652
Is he smiling?

178
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:29,725
Wow, capitalism can make you smile.

179
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,379
You never smiled at me like that.

180
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,142
Then pay me.

181
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:43,313
 You really can do anything for money. 

182
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:45,550
 Fine, if that's what it takes! 

183
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:47,574
Let's keep going! Amazing!

184
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:49,879
One more! Now give me a smile!

185
00:08:49,888 --> 00:08:51,781
That's beautiful! Gorgeous!

186
00:08:51,806 --> 00:08:52,418
Good!

187
00:08:52,443 --> 00:08:54,726
Ketchup is doing great! Hot dog is doing awesome!

188
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:57,642
Everything is perfect! I love that smile!

189
00:08:57,669 --> 00:08:58,555
All right! One more!

190
00:08:58,574 --> 00:08:59,721
Fantastic!

191
00:08:59,721 --> 00:09:03,084
That's lovely! Merry Christmas!

192
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:06,279
Let's try other poses too, okay?

193
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,340
Hey, hop on!

194
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,075
All right.

195
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:13,178
That's so good!

196
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:16,389
Merry Christmas!

197
00:09:16,408 --> 00:09:19,155
That's nice!

198
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:22,350
Now you guys are supposed to be a couple, so how about holding hands?

199
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,820
♫  How could this be love, baby  ♫

200
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,080
♫  I keep thinking of you again  ♫

201
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,220
♫  I keep seeing you  ♫

202
00:09:32,222 --> 00:09:33,448
That looks amazing!

203
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,250
Nice! You're a great match!

204
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:39,057
How about holding hands and facing each other this time?

205
00:09:41,517 --> 00:09:43,716
Give us a big smile!

206
00:09:46,391 --> 00:09:47,591
Hey.

207
00:09:47,591 --> 00:09:49,129
Where is your capitalistic smile?

208
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:50,947
Why aren't you smiling?

209
00:09:52,305 --> 00:09:54,652
Your hands are sweaty.

210
00:09:54,652 --> 00:09:57,430
Damn it! So are yours!

211
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,800
Here we go!

212
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,100
♫  I miss you again today  ♫

213
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,600
♫  It's getting better today  ♫

214
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,370
♫  I'm so curious, I'm so excited  ♫

215
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:15,300
♫  I'm trembling just thinking about it  ♫

216
00:10:15,306 --> 00:10:17,275
Here's your pay from the shoot.

217
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:19,518
Forget it, just take it.

218
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:21,762
Why would I take your money?

219
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,640
Hey!

220
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,560
You could have just told us you needed help.

221
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,294
Help with what?

222
00:10:30,294 --> 00:10:33,220
The thing you were talking about over the phone with Seungbong earlier.

223
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,066
Ah!

224
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:38,362
Why would you guys help me with that?

225
00:10:39,017 --> 00:10:41,015
Because we'll be able to help you if you ask us.

226
00:10:41,062 --> 00:10:42,851
We are a family living in the same house.

227
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:45,328
Not family, house mates.

228
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,095
Fine! As a house mate, I'm telling you.

229
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,215
If we sell Seungbong's game console, Jooyi's Airpods,

230
00:10:50,215 --> 00:10:53,552
and my iPad you could pay for one more semester.

231
00:10:54,471 --> 00:10:57,265
It's 30,000 won per month. Why would you want to sell your iPad?

232
00:10:57,265 --> 00:11:00,017
30,000 won is kind of big money...

233
00:11:01,436 --> 00:11:03,221
What? "30,000 won"?

234
00:11:04,904 --> 00:11:07,056
What's 30,000 won?

235
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:08,085
The gym.

236
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,152
It's 30,000 won per month.

237
00:11:10,152 --> 00:11:11,854
The gym?

238
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:15,651
Weren't you quitting school?

239
00:11:15,651 --> 00:11:18,460
Why would I stop going to school?

240
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,148
What?

241
00:11:20,757 --> 00:11:22,100
Damn it!

242
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,658
I thought you were quitting school because of money,

243
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,976
so I even called off a blind date.

244
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,812
Why do you always misread situations?

245
00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:29,647
Seriously!

246
00:11:29,672 --> 00:11:31,907
Forget it! Don't talk to me!

247
00:11:39,382 --> 00:11:41,484
These are comfier than I thought

248
00:11:41,484 --> 00:11:43,628
Why did you have these with you?

249
00:11:43,628 --> 00:11:45,550
I just wanted to wash the costume before I wear it next week.

250
00:11:45,575 --> 00:11:46,681
It's kind of gross.

251
00:11:46,731 --> 00:11:47,624
Anyways,

252
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:49,250
go easy with work.

253
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:52,628
You always get nosebleeds, that's why I misunderstand things.

254
00:11:53,363 --> 00:11:56,073
Have you always been the nosy type?

255
00:11:57,015 --> 00:11:58,676
I'm not being nosy.

256
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,436
I have a warm heart.

257
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:03,548
I can't believe you were going to sell your iPad.

258
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,350
They weren't empty words.

259
00:12:07,183 --> 00:12:08,502
What do you mean?

260
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:11,619
I heard you cover living expenses and the tuition all alone.

261
00:12:12,453 --> 00:12:14,575
When it becomes a real problem, let me know.

262
00:12:14,575 --> 00:12:16,777
I will show you what being nosy is.

263
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,834
Gosh, I'm famished.

264
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:26,220
Do you feel like tteokbokki?

265
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:29,799
Never mind.

266
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,190
Should we?

267
00:12:31,195 --> 00:12:32,395
Seriously?

268
00:12:32,395 --> 00:12:33,828
It's on you.

269
00:12:33,828 --> 00:12:35,404
Sure.

270
00:12:35,404 --> 00:12:37,531
What happened to you, Joonwoo?

271
00:12:37,531 --> 00:12:40,893
You were so impressed by me today, weren't you?

272
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:43,378
Nevermind, I take it back.

273
00:12:43,378 --> 00:12:46,365
What? No! Let's go!

274
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:47,961
Forget about what I said, will you?

275
00:12:49,961 --> 00:12:52,580
Kidding~!

276
00:12:53,047 --> 00:12:54,765
Is it really on you?

277
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:56,684
I'm going to eat a lot today.

278
00:12:56,684 --> 00:12:59,341
I will have tteokbokki, udon,

279
00:12:59,382 --> 00:13:01,522
and seaweed rolls, too.

280
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:14,952
I can't believe they're still out.

281
00:13:16,539 --> 00:13:17,584
Seungbong!

282
00:13:17,609 --> 00:13:19,681
I need to go to the washroom first!

283
00:13:19,705 --> 00:13:20,705
Jooyi,

284
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,195
what are you doing now?

285
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,954
I was reading.

286
00:13:26,043 --> 00:13:27,281
What is that flower?

287
00:13:27,332 --> 00:13:28,278
This?

288
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:30,259
Seungbong gave it to me.

289
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:31,659
Did he?

290
00:13:33,732 --> 00:13:36,492
You two seem so close.

291
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,055
Jooyi,

292
00:13:38,055 --> 00:13:41,763
we actually went on a date today.

293
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,877
Not just as friends.

294
00:13:45,266 --> 00:13:48,310
Um... Yeah?

295
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,749
Yeah.

296
00:13:49,749 --> 00:13:52,457
I thought you should know that.

297
00:13:53,272 --> 00:13:55,604
Me? Why?

298
00:13:56,552 --> 00:13:59,279
I know you like Seungbong.

299
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,576
What?

300
00:14:03,313 --> 00:14:05,570
 Hoyoung, come on! 

301
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,437
I should go.

302
00:14:19,477 --> 00:14:20,439
 We are pretty close. 

303
00:14:20,464 --> 00:14:21,654
 Our families know each other. 

304
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:23,671
 We have plans today. 

305
00:14:24,425 --> 00:14:25,581
 Well... 

306
00:14:25,581 --> 00:14:28,184
I guess I went too far.

307
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,137
Are you all right?

308
00:14:33,754 --> 00:14:35,939
Couldn't see the movie today?

309
00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:38,690
The movie isn't the problem.

310
00:14:42,093 --> 00:14:43,728
Hello.

311
00:14:43,728 --> 00:14:45,268
Yes.

312
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:53,993
Okay, we'll call you back.

313
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,535
Bye.

314
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,189
Who was that?

315
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,574
It was the dorm.

316
00:15:00,574 --> 00:15:02,601
We're off the wait list.

317
00:15:02,626 --> 00:15:04,060
Seriously?

318
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,588
But we have to move in next month.

319
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:10,459
Then...

320
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:12,508
What about Sol House?

321
00:15:13,395 --> 00:15:15,333
We've have to go, right?

322
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:26,660
♫  Are you having a good dream?  When you wake up  ♫

323
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,720
♫  I'll be floating in your sky  ♫

324
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,750
♫  It took a while.  When the morning is bright,  ♫

325
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,650
♫  We are at the same time  ♫

326
00:15:39,653 --> 00:15:44,463
