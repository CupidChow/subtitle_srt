1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:05,940
No... No... No!

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,130
No! No! No! No!

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,400
Bloody hell!

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,070
Moka, I thought you were in Hong Kong.

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,840
- I was in London.
- Huh?

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,400
I was in London, not Hong Kong.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,500
I've just come back. Dad got transferred back.

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,050
You haven't changed!

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,620
This is Kamomebata Noriko.

10
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,090
Moka!

11
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,480
Moka. She's my childhood friend.

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,630
You use the kanji for "best" and "cute" for Moka.

13
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,290
I mean,  I can't have things

14
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,710
like Hong Kong and Noriko in my life!

15
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,470
This is Yasuraoka Hanabi.

16
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,590
She's my girlfriend.

17
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,010
You're lying!

18
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:56,910
I'm not!

19
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,330
You are!

20
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,570
You just saw us! Why would we do that if we weren't dating?

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,520
Really?

22
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,540
I didn't get the sense you were dating.

23
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,660
Anyway,

24
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,610
I bet you fell for his looks, just like the other girls.

25
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,910
Huh?

26
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:22,260
Was it his future prospects? He is very clever after all.

27
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,070
Mugi... I think I'll go home first.

28
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,620
You haven't seen each other for a while.

29
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,620
I'll let you borrow him for a while.

30
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,590
What is with her?! I don't like her!!

31
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,610
So, when should we do it?

32
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,350
I'm free any time.

33
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,170
You promised me!

34
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,490
You promised that you would take me on a date when I got back.

35
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,830
Okay, it will have to be a weekend though.

36
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,260
- Really?
- Sure.

37
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,630
Results!

38
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,960
I love you, Mugi!

39
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,110
My first date with you...

40
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:25,550
To be honest, I've never been attracted to straightforward girls like her.

41
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,570
Does that make me scum?

42
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:40,960
[Scum's Wish]
[Episode 8]

43
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,070
- What is with her?
- Huh?

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,980
That Lolita type girl.

45
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,530
- Ah, you mean Moka?
- Yeah.

46
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,460
She's a princess in a dream world,

47
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,500
Huh?

48
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,960
And I'm her prince.

49
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,930
You guys  look like a real prince and princess!

50
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,430
A princess? Really? I love you, Mugi!

51
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,120
From that day,

52
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,060
I became her beloved prince,

53
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,660
and she started to follow me

54
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,290
around like an imprinted chick.

55
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,800
She became someone

56
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,170
that I couldn't abandon.

57
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:30,320
I haven't really seen her

58
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,890
since she moved to Hong Kong with her parents.

59
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,550
Why don't you turn her down?

60
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,590
Huh?

61
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,450
It's not like you view her as a girlfriend.

62
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,080
It's kinder to reject her advances.

63
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,980
Yeah...

64
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,450
You find her cute, don't you?

65
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,530
Yeah.

66
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,900
Oww! What?

67
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,960
You've been itching for a fight, but are you trying to be possessive?

68
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,760
What? I am your girlfriend after all.

69
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,510
Really?

70
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:17,000
Subtitles and Timing brought to you
by the Forbidden Love Team @Viki.com

71
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,720
Why are you here?

72
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,000
I have a date with Mugi.

73
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,140
Are you listening?

74
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,660
It's not a date; he's just taking you out for the day,

75
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,950
Miss Moka,

76
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,340
sorry, Noriko.

77
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,950
What's with you? You don't even like Mugi!

78
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,080
How would you know?

79
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,390
I do.

80
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,660
I wouldn't be as calm if the shoe was on the other foot.

81
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,070
I mean, the person I like would be going on a date with another girl.

82
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,740
Our relationship isn't that superficial.

83
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,220
Wait up!

84
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,200
Don't date him if you're not serious!

85
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,330
I only love Mugi!

86
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,900
I'm not going to let you have him!

87
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,290
Mugi!

88
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,220
Sorry to keep you waiting.

89
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,910
Is this the right one?

90
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,780
You bought the tickets?

91
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,180
Thanks.

92
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,820
Let's go.

93
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:49,220
Are you sure about this?

94
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,520
Are you sure you want to watch what I like?

95
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,850
- You might not find it interesting.
- You want to see it, don't you?

96
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,600
Let's go.

97
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,510
Come on! I'm going to go without you!

98
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,900
Wait for me!

99
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,790
I only turned around.

100
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:24,330
Hanabi, did you pierce your ears?

101
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,140
No, I'm wearing clip-ons.

102
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,020
You haven't pierced your ears?

103
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,680
I'm scared of the pain.

104
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,400
That's turning me on!

105
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,740
What do you mean?

106
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,390
You've been too busy with that.

107
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,870
Only joking. I wouldn't look at it.

108
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,980
You're being bold today.

109
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,550
I said I'm sorry!

110
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,630
Hey! Let's go to a hotel so I can apologize.

111
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,850
I'm not going!

112
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,350
Okay, we'll go to a hotel as a reward.

113
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,190
Let's just go to a hotel!

114
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,460
Hotel!

115
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,740
You keep on about going to a hotel,

116
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,980
but Is your head only full of sex?

117
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,090
Yeah, it is.

118
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,560
I really want to sleep with you.

119
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,740
I mean, I'm a guy! What's wrong with that?

120
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,320
That's not even a reason.

121
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,670
It is! Don't underestimate the libido.

122
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:38,290
I want to do it with you, right now!

123
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,610
What are you talking about?

124
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,230
If you keep me dangling...

125
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,920
Hold on.

126
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,220
Hello?

127
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,530
What the hell?  He said we could take it slow!

128
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:58,780
Sorry! Someone else is looking for me.

129
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,530
Who?

130
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,500
- Someone who will let me sleep with her.
- Huh?

131
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,140
See you later!

132
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,050
Hold on!

133
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,030
There aren't many people here.

134
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,330
So it seems.

135
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,170
[I've loved you forever.

136
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,330
I didn't know that having love come true would make me this happy.

137
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:24,260
I didn't know that having love come true would make me this happy.

138
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:28,970
I've never experienced that kind of happiness.

139
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:34,580
I have never been able to touch the person that I really wanted to.

140
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,540
That was quite interesting.

141
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:19,230
Yeah, I was glad that it had a happy ending.

142
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,720
I'm so happy

143
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,790
that you said that it was interesting.

144
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,980
Huh?

145
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:31,140
I mean, it would have been terrible if you hadn't liked it.

146
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,040
That would have been down to the film being bad.

147
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,330
You don't have to worry about stuff like that.

148
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,010
Let's go and get something to eat.

149
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,030
Okay!

150
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,400
It's not like I've  made any effort.

151
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,430
I wonder why

152
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,790
I stopped him.

153
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,370
What is it? Are you going to let me do it?

154
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:21,570
No, but...

155
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,230
I'll see you later!

156
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,010
So pathetic...

157
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,970
I was holding on pathetically,

158
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,930
but he still left me for his friend with benefits.

159
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,890
You really wanted it,

160
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:41,310
but you couldn't get it.

161
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,120
You couldn't get his affection.

162
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:50,150
The only thing he felt for you was desire.

163
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,590
Well, it seemed to be enough to excite you.

164
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,980
That's right...

165
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,080
I don't even

166
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,500
know the difference any more.

167
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,570
Why?

168
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:26,720
