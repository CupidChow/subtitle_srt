1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,600
Isn't it March already?

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,600
It's cold enough to be winter!

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,400
What's the deal with this wind?

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,100
It's the first wind of spring.

5
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,900
There's no way he would be here...

6
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,070
It's graduation season now.

7
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,450
I feel like I'm being left behind.

[Scum's Wish]
[Final Episode]

9
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,200
Please! There's no one else I can ask.

10
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,800
So you want me to...

11
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,190
Be a member of the committee for sending off the graduates.

12
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,000
- Person-in-charge...
- Oh!

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,200
But you don't need to do anything! You just need to show up.

14
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Please? Can you please do me this favor?

15
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,200
I think it's been a while...

16
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,100
since I've talked to someone like this...

17
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,400
Sure.

18
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,800
Really?

19
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,000
You're a great help! Thank you!

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,500
Okay, so you'll need to read these.

21
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,400
First, fill this out.

22
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,600
Then this, and this!

23
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,800
Please and thanks!

24
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,600
Oh, right! We'll have a briefing with the members from other  classes tomorrow,

25
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,200
so make sure you're free after school.

26
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,800
Oh, can you also go shopping with me today?

27
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,200
Thanks. See you later!

28
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,300
Hey, wait!

29
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,300
I'm tired...

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
- Narumi!
- Hana-chan!

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,700
What's wrong?

32
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Don't tell me...

33
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,600
That's right. He came to drop this off.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,400
But it sure is sudden, doing it over spring break!

35
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,400
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,500
I won't be able to diet in time!

37
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,440
Either way, you were probably forced to do it.

38
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,800
Wow! How did you know?

39
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,000
Of course, I know!

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,800
After all, you're the same as always.

41
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,400
Will you come to the ceremony?

42
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,200
Of course.

43
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,200
Okay, please take one and pass it back.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,600
Hey, hey! Pass this back.

45
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,300
Awaya! Everyone's here already.

46
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,300
No way.

47
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,000
- Here.
- Thanks.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,400
Okay, committee members, thanks for your time.

49
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,000
We'll split into groups and each group will have tasks to complete.

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,600
First, the two rows near the hallway will be group one.

51
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,700
And the two near the windows will be group two.

52
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,600
- I oppose.
- What?

53
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,200
Don't "what" me!

54
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,900
They broke up?!

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,400
Why did you have to say it?

56
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,400
I didn't.

57
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,400
Yes, you did!

58
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,000
It's fine. We can be in group 2.

59
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,000
Let's start.

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,800
Mugi-kun, such an adult!

61
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,400
Don't you feel like he's changed a bit?

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,800
I'd like to further split the duties amongst us group two members. Any objections?

63
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,500
Someone in charge of the sign board and the flowers, huh?

64
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,600
I'm getting married.

65
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,800
He knows, too. Doesn't he?

66
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Hey, do you still remember?

67
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,900
The agreement we once made.

68
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,400
Rule 1: We won't fall in love with each other.

69
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,000
Rule 2: If either of us realizes our love,

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,500
our relationship will end.

71
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,600
Rule 3: We will fulfill each other's physical needs,

72
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,600
at any given time.

73
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,800
Now that our hearts have been broken,

74
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,600
that agreement is already...

75
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,000
- Okay, we'll be in charge of the sign board, then.
- Okay.

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,400
We'll be in charge of the flowers, then.

77
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:35,210
- Oh? Would you have preferred to be in the signboard group, Yasuraoka-san?
- Huh?

78
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,000
It's manual labor, though.

79
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,200
Manual labor?

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,300
No, no, no, impossible! I don't take in enough calories!

81
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,400
In that case, us boys will be in charge of the signboard.

82
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Okay, thanks.

83
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,100
Okay.

84
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,000
Now that we've had our hearts broken,

85
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:05,090
that agreement is now invalid. Right?

86
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,800
In that case...

87
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,900
"Can we make a  new promise?"

88
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,800
It was crazy! It was really crazy!

89
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,600
Good morning Yasuraoka-san!

90
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,600
- Good morning!
- See you later!

91
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,000
Good morning.

92
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,000
I came again...

93
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,000
Being alone is calming.

94
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,100
I can see all sorts of things when I'm alone.

95
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,470
That's right.

96
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,040
After all...

97
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,030
I was alone to begin with.

[As if he were Narumi...]

how much I loved you!

130
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,750
I kept on making mistakes.

131
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Do you regret it?

132
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,290
I don't know.

133
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,240
It's just that...

134
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,040
Then why

135
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,400
did we make that promise

136
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,000
that day?

137
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,100
Why did we

138
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,010
"even meet?"

139

Sorry. I feel bad that

00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,000
I didn't show up that day.

144
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,000
Just so you know, Akane-san has changed.

145
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,800
Yeah, yeah.

146
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,950
- That's why--
- I know.

147
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,200
She's the one that Narumi chose in the end, after all.

148
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,240
I was wrong.

149
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,180
That's exactly...

150
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,400
how much

151
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,300

It's okay now.

153
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,900

Mugi,

155
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,720
you did your best. Didn't you?

156
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,600
You too...

157
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,700
Did you know?

158
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,700
They're getting married over spring break.

159
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,400
I heard from the guys in class.

160
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,900
What should I wear to the ceremony?

161
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,200
Oh, but before that, we have that...

162

- It's so tiring.
- Yeah.

164
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,000
It doesn't fit our personalities at all.

165
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,800
Seriously! I was dragged into it by Misato-san.

166
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,300
Misato?

167
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,000
The one in our group.

168
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,900
- Oh, her?
- Yeah.

neither of us

Maybe we could have had a future like this.

This is what I learned from Mugi.

341
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,020
I learned it because I met him.

342
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:58,190
That's why I'm going to keep on searching.

343
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,210
That's why,

344
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,000
I'll keep on living.

345
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Yasuraoka!

346
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Sorry to keep you waiting!

347
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,200
We were waiting for ages!

348
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,600
Where shall we go?

349
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,400
Karaoke!

350
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,200
That sounds great!

351
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,900
Let's sing our hearts out!

352
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,100
