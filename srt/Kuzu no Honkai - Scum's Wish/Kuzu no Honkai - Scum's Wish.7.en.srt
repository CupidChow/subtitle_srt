It's because you're my one and only friend.

170
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,680
I want to see more.

171
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,600
I'm embarrassed.

172
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,800
Show me your face.

173
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,200
Ebato,

174
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:39,050
do you have something that you want to tell me?

175
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,830
Not really.

176
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,240
That's all right then.

177
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,910
You know that Hanabi is popular,

178
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,200
so I wouldn't rest on my laurels.

179
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,200
She knows something.

180
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,700
Is Hanabi two-timing me?

181
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,060
Shall we go to a hotel?

182
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,800
Why?

183
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:20,000
Did I get it wrong? I thought you wanted to.

184
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,200
Why?

185
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,800
But you're so responsive.

186
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:28,250
I wonder if you're really a virgin.

187
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,400
I'm joking. I'll be very gentle.

188
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,800
That's not the problem.

189
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,900
Then what is?

190
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,800
It's a matter of feelings.

191
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,500
Feelings?

192
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,200
If your body feels good,

193
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,500
then the feelings will come naturally.

194
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,890
I don't want to!

195
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,500
Really?

196
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,480
All we have to do is make you feel good.

197
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,300
I'm scared that I'll do something stupid

198
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,400
if you make me feel good.

199
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,900
Being stupid isn't a bad thing.

200
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,740
I don't think that there's anyone in this world

201
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,600
who can always be serious.

202
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,900
Oh no,  I'm getting carried away!

203
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,000
"What would"

204
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,880
"she do?"

205
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:04,410
If it was me?

206
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:08,220
I would just do it.

207
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,200
Why are you hesitating?

208
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:19,110
You think he'll get bored if you're not a virgin.

209
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,600
That means that is

210
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,800
your only value.

211
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,400
I told you that it's my first time!

212
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,200
What's wrong?

213
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,900
I think I'm still scared.

214
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,090
Oh, you would be. I'm sorry!

215
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:04,270
It's a disaster if someone like me gets carried away.

216
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,400
I don't mind acting.

217
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,800
He just has to be besotted by the fake me.

218
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,190
There's nothing as stimulating

219
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,400
as the attention from men.

220
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,140
How stupid is it to rely on other people

221
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,900
for your own self-worth?

222
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,800
But...

223
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,070
it's stupid to think

224
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,100
that your world would end if they

225
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:46,920
rejected you,

226
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,900
but love makes you

227
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,480
feel that way.

228
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,600
I don't know what it's like

229
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,220
to kiss the person that you love.

230
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,800
See you later!

231
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,600
This many messages?

232
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,300
[Can we meet now?]

233
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,840
Is this what it feels like to be wanted?

234
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,060
Sorry to keep you waiting.

235
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,000
Let's go.

236
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,200
Her kisses feel the same.

237
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,000
You did it with someone else, didn't you?

238
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,400
You did, too. Didn't you?

239
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It feels good when I touch Mugi.

240
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,700
If your body feels good,

241
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,400
then the feelings will come naturally.

242
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
That might be true.

243
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,000
I haven't been able

244
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,000
to think of Mugi

245
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,600
as a substitute for Narumi.

246
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,800
Do you want to come to my house?

247
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,010
Don't you need to call back?

248
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:25,870
No, it's not important.

249
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,500
I think I like it when she's like this.

250
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,200
No... No... No!

251
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,800
No! No! No! No!

252
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:58,500
