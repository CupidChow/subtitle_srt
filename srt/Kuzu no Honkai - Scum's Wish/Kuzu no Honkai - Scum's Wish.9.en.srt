She threw them all at me.

172
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:23,650
That's why I could love her so much.

173
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:28,790
You will never like me.

174
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:36,690
Why would you say something like that?

175
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,020
I'm not lying.

176
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,520
I've always liked you.

177
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,810
We can help each other when we are lonely.

178
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:13,570
The memories...

179
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,210
They are all so trivial.

180
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:19,530
I like your hair short. It suits you.

181
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:23,050
I've always cherished them.

182
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,720
They are my treasure.

183
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:29,670
I can't wait for April to come.

184
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:34,960
Congratulations! Your dream has come true.

185
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,700
I knew it would.

186
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,830
Because... you worked so hard.

187
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,400
Thank you.

188
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,490
We are at school.

189
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,320
It's fine. Just for today.

190
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,330
Narumi... If you remember

191
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:01,770
even one of these memories...

192
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,560
I thought I could keep going.

193
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,980
Because there is no one better

194
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,430
than you in this world.

195
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,770
Hana, let's go to your house because it's cold.

196
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:47,320
Or we could go to my place.

197
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,100
Narumi!

198
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:56,230
Do you know what the important talk is that I wanted to have?

199
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,340
It's about your future, right?

200
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,570
No, it's not.

201
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,390
I have no idea then.

202
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,880
That's what I like about you.

203
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,070
You are making fun of me.

204
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,010
I liked you.

205
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,200
What?

206
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:28,570
It's the past tense. I liked you.

207
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,560
No.

208
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,980
I still like you.

209
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,850
That's the important thing I wanted to tell you.

210
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,610
Since when?

211
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,400
Always.

212
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,920
I've always...

213
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,510
always...

214
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,990
for a long time...

215
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:30,960
Even though he had no idea until now,

216
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:37,710
he becomes sincere right away. I like that.

217
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:43,170
I like that he sympathizes with the opponent's feelings.

218
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,490
I like his voice.

219
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:49,220
I like his face and how he talks.

220
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,950
I like that, at crucial moments...

221
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,440
Hana...

222
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,740
...he takes me in like this.

223
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,170
I like you.

224
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,990
I know.

225
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,340
You are looking at someone else.

226
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:45,600
I know that.

227
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,800
I know...

228
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:03,940
This is the first and the last time

229
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:09,180
that I'll be held by him.

230
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,770
This way,

231
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,840
the one-sided love I had for a long time

232
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:24,200
ended.

233
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:09,430
Keep warm and rest well.

234
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,140
I will.

235
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:18,260
I'm happy that he cares for me.

236
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,310
Even if it's not romantic.

237
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:26,030
Then, goodnight.

238
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,190
Goodnight.

239
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,610
It's okay.

240
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,490
I'm okay.

241
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,700
Now, I can move forward.

242
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,440
[19:58, December 28th, Wednesday]

243
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,460
Then, I'll see you here at eight.

244
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,890
I can do it.

245
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,400
I can change.

246
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,600
Because I'm not alone.

247
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:06,220
I'm telling you, I know.

248
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,000
What do you know?

249
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,830
I know you are a mean girl who likes men like a whore,

250
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:14,480
and a bitch who has a twisted love for yourself.

251
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,640
You can't love anyone, but you want to be loved by everyone.

252
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,020
It doesn't matter who it is. It can be me.

253
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,130
Or it doesn't have to be me.

254
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,220
Then, why did you come with me?

255
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,200
I never believe

256
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,900
that you can like anyone.

257
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:17,330
But...

258
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,320
that's why I want to be the first.

259
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,360
I want to change you.

260
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:37,430
I thought I decided not to leave her alone anymore.

261
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,720
Mugi.

262
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,420
Mugi...

263
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:17,020
As I thought, your fingers are...

264
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,760
More...

265
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:26,260
More, what?

266
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,870
[22:01, December 28th, Wednesday]
