You can't be passive!

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,630
You have to change things yourself.

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,020
I understand the logic,

9
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,280
but you have to partition time to see it passing.

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,540
It just passes by otherwise.

The thing that I want the most

18
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:26,300
is someone who will take me away from my mundane life.

00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,530
No, so I thought...

25
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:56,790
To be honest, we don't really know each other well.

26

It was only fun in the beginning...

I think that the amount of reading that a student does

"How does it feel"

173
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,210
"to toy with someone's feelings?"

174
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,620
I wonder

175
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:58,310
if it actually feels good.

176
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,880
Yes,

177
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,320
it does.

178
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,390
In that case,

179
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:14,120
maybe I should make those who are enamored with you

180
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,930
into mine.

181
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:21,340
If I make Mugi and Narumi mine...

182
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,810
Will you be all right if you end up hurting someone?

183
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,760
I know.

184
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,570
I know that

185
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,140
I'm only thinking about myself.

186
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,790
But I wonder...

187
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,630
Why can't I stop myself?

188
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,420
I want to beat her!

189
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,470
If I don't,

190
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,530
I'm going to end up feeling empty!

191
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:21,580
Everyone feels empty.

192
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,560
You can't force people's feelings

193
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,990
and there is no way that it would feel satisfying.

194
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,590
Shut up!

195
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,570
Shut up!

196
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,420
Shut up!

197
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,940
I know that I'm the miserable one.

198
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:55,200
I know that I'm the needy one.

199
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,390
But...

200
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,040
But...

201
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,050
Mugi!

202
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,420
Hi.

203
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,670
Let's date.

204
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,950
I think we should date.

205
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,350
That's it.

206
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,690
The thing that I want the most

207
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:45,210
is all the affection

208
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,600
that is directed at her!

209
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:57,970
