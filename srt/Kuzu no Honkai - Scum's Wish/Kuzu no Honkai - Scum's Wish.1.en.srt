1
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,000
What's the matter?

2
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,220
You can't hold it back anymore?

3
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,500
"Unrequited love"

4
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,400
"Painful love"

5
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,800
"One-sided love"

6
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,880
Are they...

7
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,300
"as beautiful as they are said to be?"

8
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,800
Hana...

9
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,140
"I don't think so."

[Scum's Wish]
[Episode 1]

12
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,400
I, Yasuraoka Hanabi, and

13
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,200
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

14
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,100
Awaya Mugi are...

15
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,200
dating.

16
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
Oh, look!

17
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,400
- What?
- They are leaving together again!

18
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,800
They are so in love.

19
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,400
They look so good together.

20
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm jealous. I want a boyfriend like Mugi, too.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,400
What about your senior?

22
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,600
A couple that everybody envies.

23
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,800
Can I have a sip?

24
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,400
We got the test result back today, right? What was your score?

25
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,600
Not good. What about you?

26
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,800
I got 95 points.

27
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,000
What?  You just wanted to show off.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,300
Here.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,900
I don't want him to know about us.

30
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,800
But we don't hide it at school.

31
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,400
I know, but...

32
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,400
I guess girls are complicated.

33
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,600
Yeah.

34
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,800
Congrats, Hana!

35
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,600
"You got a boyfriend! But I wish you had told me sooner.

36
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,800
I feel a little sad."

37
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,100
You don't sound like him at all.

38
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,600
This is the guy who lives in the neighborhood, and we grew up together like a sister and brother.

39
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,600
He is Kanai Kanai.

40
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,440
I really envy you

41
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,700
for having a mother.

42
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,200
But you used to go fishing with your father.

43
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,700
I don't have a father, so I envied you for that.

44
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,130
I see.

45
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,300
Then, it's like this.

46
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,600
We both have something that we envy each other for.

47
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,400
So, when we are lonely,

48
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,500
- we can help each other.
- Yeah.

49
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,900
Narumi is a liar.

50
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,800
But...

51
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,200
Mugi would never betray me.

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,700
Ms. Minagawa.

53
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,000
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,400
It was so cold this morning, wasn't it?

55
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,200
- Yes, it was.
- It was warm until a little while ago.

56
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,400
I don't have a father and he doesn't have a mother.

57
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,000
Hello.

58
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,400
You are late! Let's eat now.

59
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,800
Sorry.

60
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,200
All right then, here you go finally.

61
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,800
There is a difference in age between us.

62
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,000
But since we were neighbors, we were close.

63
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,400
What are you doing?

64
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,800
It's good.

65
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,400
That childhood friend...

66
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,400
came to our school as a Japanese teacher.

67
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,200
It was 6 months ago.

68
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,500
My name is Kanai Narumi.

69
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,800
I was genuinely happy with the thought that I was going to see him every day.

70
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,800
I'm looking forward to working here.

71
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,800
There is one more new teacher who came with Mr. Kanai.

72
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,200
Ms. Akane Minagawa, who will teach music.

73
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,600
I'm Akane Minagawa.

74
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,200
I'd like to have fun while learning music with you.

75
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,800
I'm looking forward to it.

76
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,000
On that day, I felt it.

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,400
That I could not be a child anymore.

78
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,400
We are the only new teachers, so let's help each other.

79
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Yes. Let's do so.

80
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,990
I had been looking at only him,

81
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,400
so I noticed it before he did.

82
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,000
The face I had never seen before.

83
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,400
He was...

84
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,600
falling in love.

85
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,200
I think I was lacking experience.

86
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,600
Sorry.

87
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,800
You are Yasuraoka from Class C, right?

88
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,900
Are you hurt?

89
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,500
Are you okay?

90
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,800
Thank you, Mugi.

91
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,800
You are at school, Teacher.

92
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Awaya... I called you by your surname again...

93
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:17,200
I thought a woman like her would never go out with Narumi.

94
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,810
I wasn't taking the situation seriously.

95
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,800
After the summer holiday,

96
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,400
they were already like that...

97
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:52,000
I talked to Mugi from a different class

98
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,700
for the first time then.

99
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,510
Do you know who she likes?

100
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,300
I do.

101
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,450
You just noticed me today?

102
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,100
That took long.

103
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,600
Then, you knew about me?

104
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,700
You were in my sight even when I wasn't looking.

105
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,000
Right.

106
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,400
Ms. Minagawa was Mugi's tutor until two years ago.

107
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,000
She doesn't see Mugi as a man at all.

108
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,700
So, the situation was exactly the same as mine.

109
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:53,420
Whenever I came here, there was Mugi.

110
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,340
We were not the ones to give up easily at all.

111
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,800
And the deeper our feelings got,

112
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,500
the more apathetic we became.

113
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,700
I hate it!

114
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:30,200
Why does he like a woman like her? I'm definitely prettier!

115
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,600
Don't speak badly of Akane.

116
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,800
Guys like those kinds of women who look like announcers.

117
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,200
- Don't speak badly of her, I said.
- No way.

118
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,900
I hate it! It's so annoying.

119
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,900
She's not listening to me.

120
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm starting to hate school, too.

121
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,400
Then, are you going to give up?

122
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,500
I'm never giving up.

123
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,800
But...

124
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,500
But?

125
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,400
At first...

126
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I was just fooling around.

127
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,900
That took me by surprise.

128
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,200
What? Are you lonely?

129
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,150
What about you?

130
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,680
Aren't you lonely?

131
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,200
I am, a little bit.

132
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,800
You know,

133
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,710
your boobs are touching me.

134
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,390
At that time, probably,

135
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,430
we were thinking about the same thing.

136
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:54,000
I would never forget it. Mugi said...

137
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,800
"How about you pretending I'm Narumi."

138
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,800
You look nothing

139
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,400
like Narumi.

140
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,400
You are too picky.

141
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,100
I'm quite good looking, too.

142
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,400
Are you saying you are going to play him for me?

143
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,300
No. That's not it.

144
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
First of all,

145
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,200
Mugi doesn't have any feelings for me at all.

146
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,600
Whether I look at him as Mugi or someone else,

147
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,200
it doesn't matter.

148
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,900
I'm in place

149
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,800
of Ms. Minagawa.

150
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,000
Close your eyes.

151
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,050
If I'm going to do this,

152
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,200
I should do it all the way.

153
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,600
Oh, no.

154
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,300
When I think it's Narumi,

155
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,300
my head feels hot.

156
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,600
My fingertips are cold.

157
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,900
They feel tingly.

158
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,700
I've wanted him to do this for a long time.

159
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,200
That is the truth.

160
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,000
Kissing...

161
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It was my first time.

162
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,600
You are kidding.

163
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,800
No, I'm not.

164
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,100
How was it?

165
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,500
It felt good.

166
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,400
One more time?

167
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,900
It's okay.

168
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,730
This hand is Narumi's hand.

169
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,600
Things that Narumi does not do.

170
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,800
Things that he would not do.

171
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,630
Can I touch you?

172
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,400
Things I want to do.

173
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,910
He is Narumi.

174
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,400
I have to remember him.

175
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,350
A lot of memories.

176
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,300
A lot of them...

177
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,200
A lot...

178
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,000
A lot about him...

179
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,600
Narumi...

180
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,200
Ms. Minagawa!

181
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,200
Stay still for a moment.

182
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,300
There is a bug on you.

183
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,400
It's all right now. It's gone.

184
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,800
I'm relieved. Thank you.

185
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,560
Do you want to stop?

186
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,400
I mean... I'm not going to do it anymore today.

187
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,300
But in the future,

188
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,200
do you not want to do stuff like this anymore?

189
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,030
How about you pretend I'm Narumi.

190
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,000
At first,

191
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,200
I was just fooling around.

192
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,600
Hey.

193
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
You look terrible.

194
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,400
Shut up.

195
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,600
Only, I couldn't be without it anymore.

196
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,170
I thought you were mad.

197
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,600
Why?

198
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,000
It was better than I expected.

199
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,400
I'm going to kill you.

200
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,400
A human body is warm.

201
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,630
A lot warmer than the heart.

202
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,270
It exists there for sure.

203
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,700
It fulfills my heart.

204
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,060
I recognize my share for the first time when I'm touched.

205
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,600
If I don't confirm it that way,

206
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,800
I will lose it right away.

207
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,400
I forget it right away.

208
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,020
That's why we touch each other.

209
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,100
This is how

210
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,900
we started dating.

211
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,300
Narumi...

212
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
We saw each other's...

213

When you are finished with your reports,

216
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,600
collect them and bring them to the Japanese prep room.

217
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,000
That's all for today.

218
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,400
That's tiring.

219
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,800
You should come to pick them up.

220
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,200
I have a lot of stuff to do, too.

221
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,400
Then, please do as I asked.

Thanks, Hana.

229

Ah, Yasuraoka.

230
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,800
There's no one here, so you don't have to correct yourself.

231
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,200
It's just to draw the line.

232
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,800
While saying so, I might make a mistake again.

233
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,790
You know what?

234
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,300
You are the only one to call me "Hana,"

235
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,800
Narumi...

236
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,800
She's really good, right?

237
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,020
I can hear it all the time.

238
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,600
Then, I'm going to go.

239
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,800
Thanks.

240
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,400
The happiest thing that ever happened in my life was

241
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,000
meeting you.

242
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,600
The most unfortunate thing is...

243
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:07,570
not to be with you.

244
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,100
It's an outright tragedy.

245
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,000
What's the matter?

246
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,200
You can't hold it back anymore?

247
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,600
"Unrequited love."

248

Even though I'm seeking only the warmth,

there is something I can't give up on.

If being alone makes me lonely,

it's alright to lean on someone.
