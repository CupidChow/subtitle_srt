1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,520
I'm going to go and confess.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,250
I'll meet you here at 8:00.

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,040
What's happening with the person that you like?

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,420
Then, why don't you date me?

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,280
Akane, I love you.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,330
Narumi, I loved you.

7
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,890
My long one-sided love has finally ended.

8
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,620
I know you're a total bitch!

9
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,190
Then, why did you follow me?

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,920
I want to be the one that changes you.

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,410
That night, Mugi didn't show up.

It's so cold!

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,370
I think we picked the wrong season to come here.

16
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:07,890
Etch-chan...

17
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,180
It's okay, there's nobody here.

18
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,570
Let's go!

19
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:20,730
A few days ago...

20
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,270
Mugi finally answered

21
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,760
the next day with one word, "Sorry."

22
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,380
What the hell? I don't believe it!

23
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:45,060
Did he succeed?

24
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,940
Idiot!

25
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,350
Of course, he's being taken for a fool!

26
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,420
There's no way that woman would be serious...

[Let's go on a trip to Karuizawa.]

28
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:19,670
In the future,

29
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,790
I will never be able to

30
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,170
hold hands or date Narumi.

31
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,460
Not ever.

32
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,980
"It's final."

33
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,260
"It's definite."

34
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,780
"It's clear"

35
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,950
that my heart has been broken.

36
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,830
That's why I decided
[Let's.]

37
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,320
to come on this

38
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,940
trip to ease my heartbreak.

39
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,650
Wow, I can't believe you have a villa!

40
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,270
It's not ours. It belongs to my relatives.

41
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,270
Hanabi, we're going to have the place to ourselves.

42
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,610
Come in! It's a bit old fashioned, but...

43
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,620
Welcome!

44
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,300
- Oh, so you're her cousin!
- Yeah.

45
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,220
- You guys seem similar.
- We don't!

46
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,820
Hanabi, you can go for a bath first.

47
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,680
I need to talk to him.

48
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,760
Okay.

49
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,370
You're too close.

50
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,750
Way too close.

51
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,080
How did you know I was coming here?

52
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,940
I rang your house.

53
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,290
I was looking forward to being alone with her.

54
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,530
This was my chance.

55
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,830
She broke up with her boyfriend and she's had her heart broken.

56
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,020
Were you planning to use this trip to try and get together?

57
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,950
That's not right, is it?

58
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:44,080
You know that, right?

59
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:50,440
You know that there is no way that she'll ever love you.

60
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,950
You just wanted to have some nice memories with her.

61
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,730
Shut up!

62
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,390
What's wrong with that?

63
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,290
What's wrong with wanting to have a nice ending?

64
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,430
I wanted you to have a nice ending,

65
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,370
but you're not that  strong.

66
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,860
Are you?

67
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,920
That's what I think anyway.

68
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,590
Don't you dare come into my room!

69
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,730
You've finished in the bath?

70
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,470
Yeah.

71
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,780
It was lovely. Why don't you go in next?

72
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,000
Are you okay?

73
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,290
Yeah.

74
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,600
It's okay.

75
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,360
Leave it to me.

76
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,140
Let me do this.

77
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,020
Your body feels so hot!

78
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,370
That's because I'm just out of the bath.

79
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,270
You smell good.

80
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,350
Do-Do I?

81
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,830
How does it feel?

82
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,950
It feels...

83
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,860
so good.

84
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,080
Say it!

85
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,290
Miss...

86
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:05,330
Ever since that day, Akane comes to visit me at home.

87
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,930
I know that she's playing me.

88
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,850
I know, but...

89
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,560
Here you go.

90
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,490
Let's go!

91
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,090
Look! A duck!

92
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,950
1... 2...

93
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,690
I felt like I had seen past her defenses.

94
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,180
I saw past all those

95
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,630
defenses that she built around her.

96
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,410
In that space,

97
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,280
beat a fragile heart

98
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,850
that could be broken

99
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:31,830
with one touch.

100
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,600
You're up early.

101
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,990
Can I ask

102
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,000
who it is you love?

103
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,540
Huh?

104
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:18,530
Just tell me.

105
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,020
Right now,

106
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,970
I don't have a clue.

107
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:39,330
Should I be clearer?

108
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,830
At least decide how you feel about Sanae.

109
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,580
I don't care about the rest.

110
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,320
She's not a substitute for someone else.

111
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,440
Hanabi!

112
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,730
Thank god!

113
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,550
I wondered where you had gone to.

114
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,460
I went for a walk

115
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,990
over to that lake.

116
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,970
Oh, okay.

117
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,130
- Let's go over there!
- Okay!

118
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:49,640
Hanabi! I bought you a drink.

119
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,500
Thanks.

120
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:01,470
It's been a while since I've seen her enjoy herself.

121
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,690
Is it good?

122
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,980
Yeah, it is.

123
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,050
I'm glad.

124
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,430
She's not a substitute for someone else.

125
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,410
I know that.

126
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:19,420
Of course, I know that.

127
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:23,230
I know, but...

128
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,180
Hanabi?

129
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,930
"Possessiveness?"

130
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,260
"Guilt?"

131
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,050
"Taking advantage?"

132
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,940
No, this feeling...

133
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:05,410
Please, don't define

134
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,090
this feeling for now.

135
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,090
I'm such a boring woman.

136
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,360
No, you're not!

137
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,380
You're not boring. It's more like

138
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,790
you're so openly calculating

139
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,730
that ordinary women can't compete with you.

140
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:35,860
You're so selfish, it's almost like you tolerate me.

141
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:40,600
There are times where I wonder if every move is calculated.

142
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,120
That's what I like about you. I find it very attractive.

143
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,830
So, that's what you like.

144
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,160
You're not angry?

145
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,030
Why?

146
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:04,020
Did you say anything that should anger me?

147
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,400
No...

148
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:11,830
It's rare for her to say anything.

149
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,630
Maybe she feels something for me.

150
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:26,240
Umm... Do you want to go somewhere next Saturday?

151
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,590
We can go wherever you like.

152
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,780
Sorry,

153
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,580
that's Mr.Kanai's day.

154
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,360
Oh.

155
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,300
Sanae, I'm going for a bath.

156
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,720
Okay.

157
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,790
Do you want to play, too?

158
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,160
No! I died again!

159
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,880
You're so bad at this game!

160
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,470
You're better than I thought.

161
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:49,540
I always used to play this at Narumi's house when I was younger.

162
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm all right.

163
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,140
Really?

164
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,150
Really.

165
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,750
So, it was Mr.Kanai

166
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,550
that you've loved for so long.

167
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,920
He completely turned me down.

168
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:25,340
I feel free now.

169
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,640
You did well.

170
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,470
You just went for it.

171
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,710
No matter what I do...

172
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,520
Never mind.

173
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:14,150
- Etch-chan, I have to tell you...
- Hanabi!

174
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:22,440
I'm sorry to have dragged you into this.

175
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,740
Thank you.

176
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,230
Sorry, I really pushed you.

177
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,430
You're too nice.

178
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,900
I had fun

179
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,150
and I was happy,

180
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,890
- so let's...
- That's not it!

181
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:53,360
I'm the one who pushed you! I'm the one who was selfish!

182
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,630
It's all my fault!

183
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:57,000
Let's just leave it.

184
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:14,650
I'm going to give up chasing you.

185
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,780
I had already decided before this trip.

186
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,610
If you were rejected,

187
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:29,570
but you still didn't see me in that way,

188
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,000
then I would step away from you.

189
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,450
I've put you in another room.

190
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:51,090
Let's go home separately tomorrow.

191
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,800
Goodnight.

192
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,020
Etch-chan, listen to me!

193
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,760
I wanted to say something to you.

194
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,610
Please...

195
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,460
Please keep on being my friend!

196
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,310
Please be my friend.

197
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,300
You must be joking!

198
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,760
What the hell are you thinking?

199
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:58,380
Do you know how cruel you're being?

200
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,780
There's no way

201
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,830
that I can be your friend now!

202
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,990
You have no idea

203
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,450
how much

204
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:26,100
I love you!

205
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,140
My weakness that day,

206
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,100
my mistakes,

207
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,700
hurt you that much.

208
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,690
You said that nobody needs to know

209
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:57,500
what is in your heart.

210
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,000
That's why I want to be alone!

211
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,390
That's the same thing as being alone!

212
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,250
Leave me alone!

213
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,920
Just go away!

214
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:13,520
I'm not going to give up.

215
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,830
Even if we keep our relationship...

216
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,060
Leave me alone.

217
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,670
...her defenses

218
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,750
will still be up.

219
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,970
This time,

220
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,180
I want to know!

221
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,720
I want to

222
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:45,260
know about you!

223
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:52,480
I know that I'm being cruel,

224
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,510
but closing off your heart

225
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,180
is not the answer!

226
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:06,170
I don't want you to be alone.

227
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,930
I don't want that.

228
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,740
You need to be with someone.

229
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,970
I'll wait for you.

230
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:25,640
I'll wait for you.

231
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,980
I'll wait until you get there,

232
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,990
as long as it takes.

233
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,080
I'll wait for as long as it takes!

234
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,090
So please,

235
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,700
stay as my friend.

236
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,560
Etch-chan...

237
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,390
I'm going now.

238
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,530
What is it?

239
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,820
Your parents will be home soon.

240
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:25,660
Please don't go to him next week.

241
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:32,900
I thought we had an understanding.

242
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,690
Why?

243
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,590
Are you jealous?

244
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:54,660
How was it when you imagined what we would be doing?

245
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:58,600
Why would you ask me that?

246
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,730
I hated it! You know that!

247
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,120
This woman...

248
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,330
How is it that no one has ever tried to harm her?

249
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,330
Seriously...

250
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,740
She really pisses me off!

251
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,790
Did I make you angry?

252
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,230
You're still pretty when you're angry.

253
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:35,190
I know it now.

254
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:39,400
The reason why I instinctively,

255
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,550
overwhelmingly, and completely can't win with her

256
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,840
is because I'm intimidated by her.

257
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,870
I don't want to be hated by the person I love,

258
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,010
to be hated by her.

259
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,730
But it's not the same for her.

260
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:02,330
She doesn't love anybody.

261
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,300
She's not even concerned

262
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,720
about the affections that she's gained.

263
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:17,020
If it breaks, she gets another, over and over.

264
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:21,390
Why did I think that

265
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,970
I could change the heart of a person like that?

266
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,320
Do you hate me now?

267
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:43,990
I think... I hate you now.

268
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:51,440
What if I said that?

269
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:57,460
Awww, but I like you.

270
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:04,430
I'm such an idiot.

271
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:13,070
Ahh, but I love her.

272
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:18,550
She  doesn't refuse what's an offer, but she won't chase you if you leave.

273
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:22,590
It's such a lonely existence.

274
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,490
I'm such an idiot.

275
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,960
Etch-chan's parting words to me were

276
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,550
"I don't know when it will happen."

277
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:47,180
"I'm going to try my best to forget you,

278
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:51,180
even though I still have feelings for you,

279
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:58,130
but I'm going to try."

280
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:11,010
