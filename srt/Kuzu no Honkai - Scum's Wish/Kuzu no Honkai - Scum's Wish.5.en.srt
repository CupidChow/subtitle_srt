00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,100
I like you.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I really like you.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The tears won't come...

4
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,200
That's right.

5
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,000
Of course, they won't. After all, I have no right to cry!

6
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,270
He did his best to confess.

7
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,250
He did his best.

8
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,430
I wonder if they'll date...

9
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,200
I didn't want to hear it... I didn't want to hear it.

10
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,400
I know, but...

11
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,600
I didn't want to hear it!

12
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,820
In that case...

13
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,990
Why didn't you say anything?

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Even though you've always been together.

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,800
Because...

16
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,160
we've always been together.

17
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,660
I didn't want to.

18
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,500
I was scared!

19
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,000
Scared... that he would leave me.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,800
You're an idiot.

21
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,520
He was taken from you because you're like that.

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,800
I know Mugi will be upset...

24
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,000
So there's no real reason for me to tell him, right?

25
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,700
After all...

26
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,600
I just want Mugi to comfort me.

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,600
I like you.

28
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,900
You're not going to Awaya's house today, huh?

29
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,400
Etch-chan!

30
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,300
Why are you here?

31
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,800
Were you following me?

32
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,600
Yes, I followed you.

33
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,690
Was I wrong to?

34
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,600
Not really.

35
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,400
Hey...

36
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,280
I don't know...

37
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,340
How meaningful doing something like this would be...

38
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,000
But...

39
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,500
forgive me...

40
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,000
Is that okay?

41
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,900
I can't understand

42
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,800
how you feel for me, though.

43
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,040
Regardless, it's fine.

44
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,810
It's okay.

45
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,800
There's no way that could be fine. "I knew that."

46
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,200
"I knew, but..."

47
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,140
Do you

48
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,700
take pity on me?

49
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,500
Lie to me.

50
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,220
Don't worry about it.

51
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,700

How many years has it been?

About 3 years.

59
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,100
No way! That long?

60
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,200
I see.

61
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
It's been a while.

62
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
What?

63
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,900
This habit. Apparently, it's a sign of being sexually frustrated.

64
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,360
Maybe!

65
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,200
I remember how her skin was so translucent.

66
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,040
She was lonely.

67
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
She wasn't so innocent.

68
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,790
Oh yeah, that person... Ms. Akane?

69
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,000
She's teaching at your high school now?

70
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,000
Well, yeah.

71
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,400
Don't tell me you're still smitten with her?

72
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:01,240
You idiot. Get your head together!

73
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,600
Isn't Ms. Akane a bitch?

74
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,800
What are you saying?

75
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
You haven't noticed?

76
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,600
See?

77
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,200
He must be her university professor.

78
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,600
Hurry up!

79
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,800
Mugi, you're still such a kid.

80
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,300
It's so good!

81
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,400
Once I started seeing her in that way,

82
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,700
it was like the world had turned on its head.

83
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,200
Mugi-chan, you had some stuck on you.

84
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,200
But somehow,

85
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,800
I became her victim...

86
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Time and time again...

87
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,400
Mugi, you need to start looking for someone else.

88
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
I know.

89
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,000
You're going to waste your youth!

90
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,080
I'm headed this way, so bye!

91
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,600
If she hadn't told me...

92
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,800
How would things have turned out?

93
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,200
Is your heart racing?

94
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,890
It is...

95
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Of course, it is.

96
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,900
Because I'm a girl?

97
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,600
No.

98
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,810
Because...

99
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,800
you're my friend.

100
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,200
Even friends do things like this.

101
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,870
After all, you do it with Awaya, too. Right?

102
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,030
If you don't like it, then say so.

103
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,400
I won't.

104
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,700
Why not?

105
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,900
Because...

106
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,220
I like Etch-chan.

107
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,060
In that case...

108
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,410
Make sure to think of me as him.

109
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,640
I like you.

110
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,500
I've always... always liked you!

111
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,600

00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,530
Tell me what you want me to do.

120
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
No...

121
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,200
I'll stop if you don't say anything.

122
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
Is it okay if I stop?

123
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,800
You're more responsive when it feels good, huh?

124
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,200
No...

125
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,300
When you... touch me,

126
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,400
it...

127
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,300
it...

128
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,600
"It..."?

129
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,230
It feels good.

130
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,400
That's because...

131
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,900
I...

132
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:08,170
like you. That's why.

133
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,800
I'm the one

134
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,700
making you feel good.

135
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,600
Because I'm touching someone I like...

136
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,800
You can feel it.

137
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,550
That's what liking someone does.

138
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,500
But...

139
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,000
But I--

140
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,200
I said it was okay!

141
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:41,380
I'm going to make you feel so good,

142
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,200
so you won't have to think of things like that.

143
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:48,170
I want to be the one to satisfy you.

144
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,600
I was thoroughly...

145
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,100
satisfied by Etch-chan.

146
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,600
I ended up in an even colder place...

147
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
Alone.

148
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,800
You can't go back to being friends anymore, can you?

149
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,200
- Because Etch-chan said she likes me!
- Oh, I see!

150
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,950
So this is all Etch-chan's fault!

151
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,700
Today was the first time that

152
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,600
you took advantage of someone else's affections for you.

153
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,800
You're no different than that woman, scum!

154
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,840
Congratulations.

155
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,200
Good morning!

156
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,800
Good morning.

157
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,260
Good morning, Yasuraoka.

158
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,800
Good... morning...

159
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,400
We ended up meeting while buying breakfast.

160
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
See you later.

161
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,200
She already knows

162
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,600
how I feel about him.

163
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,600
She's rubbing my face in it.

164
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,600
That feeling of victory over another woman.

165
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,000
What is it?

166
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,000
Who are you mad about this time?

167
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,200
Awaya-kun? Mr. Kanai?

168
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,900
So it's true...

169
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,410
You knew about Mugi's feelings, too.  Didn't you?

170
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,940
It's been years, hasn't it?

171
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,600
You knew, but you still treat him like that. Isn't that  cruel?

172
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,400
I don't really get it.

173
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,600
I guess since it's impossible for him to date the person he adores,

174
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,800
he's settling for a handy classmate.

175
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,600
I suppose that makes me the one that they both love.

176
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,000
Does it feel that good to be loved by someone you don't even like?

177
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,700
What? Why not?

178
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,400
There's nothing that feels as good as

179
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,700
the attention that men give me.

180
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,900
You think so, too. Don't you?

181
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,000
Akane-san is already a total bitch.

182
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,200
Naturally attractive to males.

183
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,000
To the point where she can't live without them.

184
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,000
Thank you.

185
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,170
In some ways...

186
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,000
she might be a weak, pitiful person.

187
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,200
I can't be bothered.

188
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,500
It's those stairs.

189
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,600
[Ladies Room]
Oh, finally! The stairs!

190
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,010
Are you going to skip class?

191
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,800
No.

192
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,200
I don't know.

193
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,100
It's not that you don't know...

194
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,000
you need to skip class,

195
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,100
don't you?

196
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,700
Right?

197
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,600
Etch-chan...

198
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,200
It feels good...

199
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,500
Etch-chan...

200
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,900
Etch-chan...

201
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,600
Etch-chan...

202
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,100
Mugi!

203
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,200
I didn't think you'd come just because I asked.

204
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,600
Why not?

205
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
Shall we get something to eat?

206
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,400
That'll just waste our time, so let's just go to a hotel. Okay?

207
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Huh?

208
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,060
So big!

209
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,200
Please choose the room you would like.

210
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,500
That's why you called me, right?

211
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,900
It's fine. I'm partially responsible, too.

212
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Um, well... Responsible or not...

213
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,000
You want to do it, right?

214
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,800
Is this the room you want?

215
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,800
Thank you very much.

216
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,410
Why did you contact me? You have others, too. Right?

217
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,000
No matter the reason, I was kind of happy.

218
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,200
You've never instigated it before.

219
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,070
Let's go.

220
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,000
I know...

221
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,900
If I stay as his little sister, I'll be able to stay by his side forever.

222
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,400
Always near him...

223
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:14,100
Always... and forever... for eternity.

224
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,600
Together...

225
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,380
Until the end of time.

226
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,300
Even one day, when someone...

227
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,500
who makes him happy appears...

228
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,600
Forever...

229
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,000
Good morning, Hanabi.

230
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,230
What a bad dream.

231
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,820
What's wrong?

232
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,670
Good morning...

233
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,400
Etch-chan.

234
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,000
Good morning.

235
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,800
Good morning...

236
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,000
Hey.

237
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,700
Awaya!

238
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,010
Mugi and I

239
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,540
were really close at one point,

240
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,350
but now we're strangers all over again.

241
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,000
In the end, I didn't tell him that Narumi confessed.

242
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,400
Hanabi!

243
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,300
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

244
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,700
Here, you forgot this.

245
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,000
Thanks.

246
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,800
I suppose

247
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,600
I could settle for Etch-chan.

248
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,400
Hey,

249
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,800
shall we have lunch together today? It's been a while.

250
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,860
Sure.

251
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:26,020
If it's just going to make me feel lonelier,

252
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,840
then I don't need Mugi anymore.

253
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,410
You know how I'm in the advanced prep class?

254
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,000
Apparently the amount of homework they're giving us is going to skyrocket.

255
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,200
That's horrible.

256
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,450
It's already bad enough now.

257
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,300
I no longer

258
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,600
need Mugi.

259
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,100
Mugi...

260
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,070
You did it with someone else.

261
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,030
Didn't you?

262
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,490
You did, too.

263
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,170
Didn't you?

264
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,200
I can tell.

265
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,440
Because...

266
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,300
Say it.

267
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,500
It's probably

268
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,000
what I'm thinking, too.

269
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,400
You've become

270
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,200
really responsive.

271
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,400
I'm sorry.

272
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,800
I don't want to feel this way,

273
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,800
but for some reason...

274
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,530
I don't know why,

275
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,900
but it feels really good!

276
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,000
Me, too.

277
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,000
Mugi and I are quite similar.

278
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,400
We're both alike.

279
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,800
"in being absolutely worthless."

280
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,090
