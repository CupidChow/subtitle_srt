If I think about it, I was in junior high school.

Is that what you wanted to hear?

171
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:36,150
What's wrong? Did something happen?

172
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,950
Not really.

173
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,790
Okay, then I'll enjoy this.

174
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,940
This looks good.

175
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,460
It tastes good.

176
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,270
Really?

177
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,180
Yeah, it's really good!

178
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,450
Then do it for me.

179
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,720
Pretend.

180
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,400
Pretend?

181
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:32,820
This is delicious, Hana.

182
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,520
Do it again.

183
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,760
Will you make it again?

184
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,090
Once more.

185
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,610
Thanks, Hana.

186
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:58,350
I've been eating instant noodles every day, so I'm so grateful.

187
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,170
That's not it.

188
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,900
Huh?

189
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,820
I've been eating convenience food every day, so I'm so grateful.

190
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,180
That's not it!

191
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,390
It's the memorial day for a very special person of his.

192
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,510
That's why...

193
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,250
That's why I made it for him.

194
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,600
I made all of his favorites.

195
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:01,600
It's really tasty.

196
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,170
Full marks.

197
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,500
Narumi...

198
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,760
Narumi...

199
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,960
Narumi...

200
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:06,000
[Kanei]

201
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:57,240
Come in! Oh, Ms. Minagawa!

202
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,050
Mr. Kanai, may I have lunch with you?

203
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,470
Sure!

204
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,560
I know I turned you down yesterday.

205
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,820
Sit down.

206
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,920
Mr. Kanai, let's eat together.

207
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,310
Sorry, I knew that's what you meant.

208
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,630
Did you get lunch from the convenience store again?

209
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,960
Yes, I'm a bit embarrassed to admit.

210
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,940
You need to eat properly!

211
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,760
You mentioned before that you liked them.

212
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:39,580
Did I get it wrong?

213
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,340
No! My mother used to...

214
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,520
She's not with us anymore.

215
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,350
I see.

216
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,990
Let me try this.

217
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,320
Did it taste bad?

218
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,760
It's very tasty!

219
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,020
I'm glad.

220
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,350
It's really nice.

221
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,440
She's still here.

222
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:17,800
I'm sure your mother is still looking over you.

223
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,350
Umm...

224
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:31,030
Ms. Minagawa, are you free after school?

225
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,600
"Here we go."

226
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,030
I only need a few minutes.

227
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:48,860
I thought we could talk over a cup of tea.

228
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:56,400
I'm sorry. I have some work to do after school.

229
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,000
Then, we'll do it another time.

230
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,150
No...

231
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,350
"That's not good enough."

232
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,760
If you like...

233
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,590
Yasuraoka,

234
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:24,580
could you gather the printouts and bring them to the music room?

235
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,400
Why are you asking me?

236
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,220
I heard that you were on duty today.

237
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,330
Oh, Mr. Kanai! I didn't notice you there.

238
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:05,950
Sorry, I sort of got drawn in.

239
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:14,320
I wanted to talk to you.

240
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:19,760
It's not yet time, Mr. Kanai.

241
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,470
It's so warm today.

242
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,140
Yes, it is.

243
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,200
The main character hasn't arrived yet.

244
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:37,190
I think it might rain tonight.

245
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,350
Really?

246
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,580
Yes.

247
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:52,320
You'll see.

248
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,970
Just a little bit longer.

249
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,210
3... Now! Do it now!

250
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:11,710
What did you want to talk to me about?

251
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,400
Umm...

252
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,760
I like you.

253
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:35,220
I really like you.

254
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,250
This is it!

255
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,850
This is what I always wanted to see!

256
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:52,770
I wanted to see your face as I exploited your feelings for him..

257
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:22,940
