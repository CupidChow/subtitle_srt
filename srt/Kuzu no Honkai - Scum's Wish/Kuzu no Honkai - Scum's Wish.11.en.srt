1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,400
This is Mr. Kanai's day.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,000
I can't remember how many times we've gone out together.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,200
It's been going on for a while.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,000
Is this what you like?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,800
Coming to the aquarium.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,100
Yes.

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:23,160
Well, actually, I thought you might like it.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,600
I do.

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,800
That's great.

10
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,440
I don't understand.

11
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,870
Umm..

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,200
It's Saturday, isn't it?

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,300
Yes, it is.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,800
Oh, never mind.

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,200
Other men would have made a move by now.

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,400
Oh! The penguin show is starting in 3 minutes.

17
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,200
Let's go.

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,000
Why haven't we been to a hotel since that first time?

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,800
We've slept together, haven't we?

20
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:15,000
That first time was almost as if I had been the aggressor,

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,600
but every date since has been pretty tame.

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,400
Anyway,

23
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,800
"what is with this situation where"

24
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,000
"I'm the needy one?"

25
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,860
I don't understand.

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,000
Ms. Minagawa,

27
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,240
this is for you.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,200
I thought you might like jellyfish.

29
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,900
It was cute, so I bought it for you.

30
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,300
Thank you.

31
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,400
Shall we?

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yasuraoka, sorry...

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,900
I don't want this guy anymore.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,600
Hey!

35
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,400
It's Akane! What a coincidence!

36
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,800
Who is she?

37
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,500
Oh, you have another new guy.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You really like men, don't you?

39
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:43,390
I'll tell you this because you seem like a decent guy.

40
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,600
Huh?

41
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,000
She's a total bitch who loves men.

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,200
You should be careful.

43
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,000
What? Is she your ex?

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,600
No, nothing like that.

45
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,700
What then?

46
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,000
Mr. Kanai...

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yes?

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,800
- He was telling the truth.
- Huh?

49
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,400
I'm a total bitch.

50
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,400
My standards aren't high, I'll sleep with anyone.

51
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,200
I'm not the pure and innocent woman that you seem to think I am.

52
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,300
I'm sure you're wondering why.

53
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,400
I think that

54
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,600
I just like men.

55
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,800
That's why I couldn't stop, even if you asked me to.

56
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,200
If I go all out like this, I doubt he'll try to pursue me.

57
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,600
Anyway, I think this concludes our dates.

58
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,000
Right, that's me.

59
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,000
You don't have to stop.

60
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,630
You don't have to stop.

61
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,400
What do you mean?

62
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,400
It means exactly what I'm saying.

63
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,700
More importantly,

64
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:29,060
is this really our last date?

65
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,000
I don't understand.

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,200
I don't understand what he's saying.

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,200
Why can't I

68
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,800
"shake his hand off?"

69
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:54,000

by the Forbidden Love Team @Viki.com

71
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,200
I've always been the one to leave.

72
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,770
Hey...

73
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,000
How long will you keep on doing the same thing over and over?

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,700
But this is all that I know.

75
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,720
Did something happen?

76
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:00,080
I think this is the first time you've asked to see me.

77
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,200
Nothing's wrong. Can't I ask to see you?

78
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,500
No,

79
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,640
it's absolutely

80
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,930
fine with me.

81
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,210
Hey,

82
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,400
does it bother you when I sleep with other guys?

83
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,600
Huh? Why are you suddenly asking that?

84
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,200
I thought I would ask.

85
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,300
I don't like it.

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,600
Why?

87
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,230
I get jealous.

88
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,980
I'm possessive.

89
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,160
I see.

90
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,400
Don't you feel that way?

91
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,400
Hmm...

92
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I might get put out if someone who might

93
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,700
fall for me has another girl.

94
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,800
Well, that has never happened before, so...

95
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,200
She might just be

96
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,800
more childish than I thought.

97
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,400
But I find that attractive, too.

98
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,500
I'm going to change Akane.

99
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,200
Sorry.

100
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,000
If you really want to change someone,

101
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,800
then you have to change first.

102
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,300
Yeah, I guess you're right.

103
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,800
It took you long enough to realize that.

104
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,600
Right, I'm off.

105
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,290
Change is scary.

106
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Mugi, your parents will be home soon.

107
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,100
I'm cunning and cowardly, such scum.

108
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,000
Even so...

109
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,000
I like you.

110
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,300
There were people who loved me.

111
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,500
I really need to change.

112
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,200
What are you doing? I need to go home.

113
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,200
Akane,

114
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,200
I want to go on a date with you.

115
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,200
A date?

116
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,170
I'm going to show you that I'm serious.

117
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,390
I won't hold back anymore.

118
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,800
I know I'm not mature enough.

119
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,500
I might pretend that I can keep things separate, but I can't.

120
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,030
I'm a mess.

121
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,200
But...

122
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,800
that's because

123
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,100
I love you,

124
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,800
so...

125
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,700
Where do you want to go?

126
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,880
You know, for the date.

127
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,520
I'm a complete idiot.

128
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,420
It takes so little to make me ecstatic.

129
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's the cold season, so make sure you wash your hands and gargle.

130
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,200
It's been a while since we were in class.

131
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,800
I think the reason it feels uncomfortable

132
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,200
isn't because it's a new term.

133
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,900
Bye!

134
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,400
I loved you. Past tense.

135
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,600
Leave me alone! Go away!

136
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,400
It still hurts. It still stings.

137
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,890
I suppose it can't be helped.

138
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,000
Did Yasuraoka and Mugi...

139
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,800
Do you think so, too?

140
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,200
What?

141
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You know, like, broke up.

142
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,800
- Really? They seemed so close!
- Shh! She'll hear you!

143
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,900
You know...

144
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,800
This feels like we're having an affair.

145
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,600
What?

146
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,200
I'm not married yet!

147
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm only joking.

148
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,200
The condition that  I set for our date.

149
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,700
Is this our last date?

150
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,000
- I'll go away with you for a night.
- Okay.

151
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,000
One night?

152
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,200
Shall we go in?

153
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I don't understand.

154
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,600
- You don't have to stop.
- Huh?

155
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,800
You don't have to stop.

156
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,800
What was that reaction?

157
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,200
I don't like it. I get jealous.

158
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,600
I'm possessive.

159
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,800
That's the normal response, isn't it?

160
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,600
I know I'm not mature enough.

161
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,000
I might pretend that I can keep things separate, but I can't.

162
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm a mess.

163
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,400
I don't think that

164
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,500
I have that passion.

165
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,710
I suppose it's not really my personality.

166
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,600
Even if someone crosses the line,

167
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,600
I'm neither happy nor sad.

168
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,800
It feels like I'm watching the men who want me

169
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,500
and the me that needs them to want me from behind the glass.

170
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,200
Hmm, then why do you keep on doing that?

171
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,580
Because...

172
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,400
This is all I know.

173
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,400
This is the only way to be independent.

174
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,400
You're back.

175
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,200
It was a lovely bath.

176
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,200
Right, I'm going to get you to explain yourself.

177
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,000
At least have a drink with me.

178
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,600
I really can't drink anymore.

179
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,000
You really can't drink at all!

180
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,400
Yeah.

181
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Mr. Kanai.

182
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,200
Yes?

183
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,600
What did you mean?

184
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,400
What are you talking about?

185
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,800
You know...

186
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,380
When you said I didn't have to stop liking other men.

187
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,200
Why don't you remember?

188
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,200
As I said before, it means exactly what I said.

189
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,200
That's what I don't understand!

190
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,400
You enjoy it, don't you? So you don't have to stop.

191
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:44,400
It's not that simple!

192
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,500
Isn't it?

193
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,600
Sure,

194
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,800
I like being a total bitch,

195
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,500
but I want to know what you think.

196
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:00,560
What I think?

197
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,100
Umm...

198
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,800
Hold on...

199
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,400
Why do I care what he says?

200
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,600
I want you to dislike it!

201
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,200
What am I saying?

202
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,500
Will you hate me if I don't dislike it?

203
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,700
Yes, I will.

204
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,700
I see.

205
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:41,450
I'll still like you, even if that happens.

206
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:48,200
I'll still love you.

207
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,800
It can't be true...

208
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,800
How could you love someone even if they hate you?

209
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,300
Loving someone unconditionally...

210
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,100
I can't understand it.

211
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,600
I don't understand it.

212
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,900
Why?

213
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,900
Why?

214
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,200
Why?

215
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,500
I don't get it.

216
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,700
Why...

217
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,410
Why do you love someone like me?

218
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,800
It's difficult to explain why I love you.

219
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,420
I just...

220
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,200
want the person I love

221
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,200
to live happily.

222
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,360
Is that all?

223
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,800
That's all.

224
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,200
How can that be enough?

225
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,400
Is that enough for you?

226
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,890
Would you be satisfied with that?

227
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:47,060
There is no limit to desire.

228
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,000
Once you experience it,

229
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
you can't stop.

230
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,740
I'm scared that I won't be able to stop myself.

231
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:04,280
I worry that I will hurt the person who is dear to me.

232
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,800
I can live with that.

233
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,700
Even if I get hurt,

234
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,000
I want

235
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,300
to be wanted by you.

236
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,840
If I'm hurt by a special person,

237
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,600
then it will make me stronger.

238
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:29,290
I had it as well,

239
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:38,360
that uncontrollable passion.

240
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,000
[Hana, can we talk later?]

241
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,000
[Akane]
[Mugi, is tomorrow at 11:00 okay?]

242
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,200
I think I've heard

243
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,800
Akane's true feelings once.

244
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:20,200
I want to die without anybody remembering me.

245
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,000
Then, why are you trying to be a teacher?

246
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,000
You would be remembered by a lot of students.

247
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's the other way around.

248
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,400
If I'm a teacher,

249
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,400
then they'll only remember me as just another teacher.

250
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,800
She needs to identify with something

251
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,500
in order to feel secure.

252
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,000
A teacher. A woman...

253
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,700
But I think that she really

254
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,200
wants to break free from those restrictions.

255
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,500
That's why I will... No matter how long it takes...

256
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,200
Good morning, Mugi.

257
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,000
You're early.

258
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,420
Really?

259
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,200
Shall we go there?

260
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,000
Why are we going to the aquarium?

261
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,300
Oh, I thought you might like it.

262
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,100
Huh?

263
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,640
Never mind.

264
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,600
You know what?

265
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,400
I don't really like the aquarium.

266
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,700
Sorry about that.

267
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,000
Shall we go?

268
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,200
Okay.

269
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,030
I don't want to watch the person I love,

270
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:24,600
change at the hands of someone else.

271
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,000
I love being in high places.

272
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,700
It makes me feel free.

273
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,800
I'll set you free.

274
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:50,850
Mugi...

275
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,010
Yes?

276
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,500
I...

277
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,600
I'm going to get married!

278
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,190
I've decided.

279
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,000
Narumi...

280
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,910
Good morning.

281
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,200
I have such a hangover.

282
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,900
You're not going to say you don't remember last night, are you?

283
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,200
Of course not.

284
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,100
Is it all right

285
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,840
if I call you Akane?

286
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,800
Sure.

287
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,700
Akane...

288
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,900
Yes?

289
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,810
Marry me.

290
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,470
Okay.

291
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,600
You know that I'll probably have affairs, right?

292
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,100
Are you sure?

293
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:47,560
Yes!

294
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,000
- I just said that I would have affairs!
- Yes!

295
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,200
Yes!  Yes!

296
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,860
Ouch.

297
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,400
I'm still a calculating woman,

298
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:16,250
and these feelings might be an illusion.

299
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,300
That's why I want to be sure,

300
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,400
however long it takes.

301
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,600
I want to

302
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,880
try new things...

303
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:42,230
things that I've never tried before.

304
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:51,250
Do you think that you can change?

305
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,400
People can change.

306
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,110
They just need

307
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,990
that one irreplaceable someone,

308
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:13,250
their destiny.

309
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,540
I...

310
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,240
I'm going to get married.

311
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,400
I wanted to tell you first.

312
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,200
I see.

313
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,800
That's nice.

314
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,000
It's quite sudden.

315
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,560
I still can't believe it.

316
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I'm marrying...

317
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,800
Ms. Minagawa, I know.

318
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:58,240
How did you know?

319
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,700
It was as plain as day.

320
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,600
Really?

321
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,500
Congratulations.

322
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,800
I'm happy for you.

323
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,000
Thanks.

324
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,200
You can go now.

325
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,400
You know,

326
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,100
I really liked your face.

327
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,840
Do you think I'm horrible?

328
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,660
I do,

329
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,190
but I'm the same.

330
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,200
You're too kind.

331
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,800
Bye.

332
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,790
I always

333
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:33,070
wanted to change you.

334
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:38,400
That was my mistake.

335
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,100
"The weak,"

336
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,600
"cunning,"

337
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,400
"person who had to be a woman."

338
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,000
"That's the person that I loved."

339
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,660
That person has already disappeared.

340
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,900
Akane!

341
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,030
Do you remember you said

342
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,500
