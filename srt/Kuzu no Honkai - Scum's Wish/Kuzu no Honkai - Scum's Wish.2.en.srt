Your hairstyle?

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,200
Yeah, I was wondering whether I should grow it out.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,800
What do you think?

4
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,030
I guess any style that suits you would be fine.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,400
Oh, but...

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,400
I like your hair when it's shorter. It suits you better.

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,200
Okay, that's it for today.

8
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,200
- Can you explain this?
- I didn't understand this.

"Those feelings you have when you like someone"

10

"You can't give up, even if you want to."

12

Sorry. Did that hurt?

17
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,700
Did you get jealous because I was reading an erotic comic?

18
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,200
Huh? Why would you say that?

19
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,200
It doesn't matter.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,800
I'm going to go shopping with my friends before I go home.

You have friends?

22

I do! Etch-chan.

Yeah, that's right.

Are you friends?

27

Yeah, she's the only person I consider to be a friend.

28
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,300
She's started coming to my classroom quite often recently.

29
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,000
I wonder why?

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,600
By any chance, are you thinking she's interested in you?

31
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,400
She's more mature than you, so you're definitely not her type!

32

- You poor thing!
- Whatever!

We don't talk about anything important.

They were really cute.

What do you use to treat your hair?

46
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,700
I don't use anything in particular.

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,600

Why so suddenly?

There's no meaningful reason.

Okay, then. I'm in!

92
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,400
We even came up with some simple rules for our contract.

Rule 1: We won't fall for each other.

Rule 2: The relationship ends once either of us fulfills our love.

Rule 3: We will satisfy each other's physical needs at any given time.

I can see how you would think that,

but we haven't had sex.

99
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
We probably won't anyway.

I wanted to borrow a book.

110
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,600
You had recommended a new book during class.

111
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,200
Oh... I don't have it to hand. Can it wait?

Hana,

113
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,600
you did really well in your homework.

114
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Your modern interpretation was well written.

115
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,800
Keep it up for your mid-term exams.

116
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,000
Do you notice anything different?

117
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,280
Oh, it's Yasuraoka.

118
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,000
Come in!

119
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,600
Hello!

120
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,200
Ms. Minagawa!

121
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I see Yasuraoka is here, too.

122
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What's wrong?

123
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,200
Here. You left this in the staff room.

124
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,600
It's full of sticky tabs, so I figured it might be yours.

125
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,200
Thank you very much.

126
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,800
I also brought this back. It was very interesting.

127
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,600
Could you lend me more of this author's books if you have them?

128
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,800
Of course!

129
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,400
I thought it might be a bit difficult to follow since it was recommended by a Japanese teacher,

130
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,800
but it was really easy to read.

131
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,300
Wasn't it? I'm glad you enjoyed it.

132
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,000
Yasuraoka, here you go.

133
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,800
It's okay.

134
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,000
- I'll be on my way.
- Oh, okay.

135
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,600
Go home safely!

136

141
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,800
You've really observed her well.

142
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,600
Have you ever thought about giving up?

143
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,500
I mean, there are younger, better-looking guys around.

144
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400
I'm not talking about me though!

145

Narumi is good looking!

146
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,500
I mean... You should know where I'm coming from.

147
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,000
It's the same for you, isn't it?

148
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,100
It's not a question of giving up

149
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,600
or not giving up.

150
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,480
Once you fall in love,

151
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,000
it has to be that person.

152
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,520
I understand.

153
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,100
I sometimes wonder

154
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,800
why I fell for her.

155
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,200
But it hasn't been all bad,

156
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,200
so I can't wish I had never met her.

157
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:42,280
I think that makes it even more unfortunate.

158
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,400
Why so sudden?

159
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,600
Is it okay so long as it's not sudden?

160
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,200
Give me your tongue.

161
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,400
This is part of the contract.

162
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,200
Undress yourself,

163
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,800
Hana...

164
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
We will satisfy each other's physical needs

165
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
at any given time.

166
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,200
Mugi...

167
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,000
That's not my name.

168
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,800

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,300
[Did it fulfill your imagination?]

171
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,400
[Yeah. What about you?]

172
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,000
[Me too.]

173
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,980
We're both very similar.

174
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,800
[Kenno High School]

175
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,200
Hanabi, let's go home together!

176
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I can't choose!

177
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,600
I'm telling you, Senior is the better choice.

178
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,200
But Hiro is better looking!

179
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,000
Senior has already gained a recommendation, so he's the better option if you consider the future.

180
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,800
I know, but...

181
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,000
Hiro has a wandering eye.

182
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
If you're going to say that, then Senior sounds so boring. He's definitely a virgin.

183
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,400
- Which one should I go for?
- It's not like you like any of them.

184
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,000
Don't say that!

185
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,200
- Etch-chan, do you have anyone that you like?
- Huh?

186
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,800
Oh, you do!

187
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,900
Can I ask...

188
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:59,400
You don't like them because of the way they look,

189
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,500
do you?

190
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,700
Well, their ability is also part of the  attraction,

191
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,000
but I don't like them

192
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
because they are capable

193
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,200
or because it will benefit me.

194
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,000
Etch-chan!

195
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,500
When you like someone...

196
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
well...

197
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,200
You can't help it...

198
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,900
It's kind of earnest...

199
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,800
I'm not explaining it well,

200
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,200
but it's like that, isn't it?

201
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,400
I think so, too.

202
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,000
Really?

203
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yasuraoka! Your boyfriend is here for you.

204
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,500
- Hurry up!
- Okay.

205
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,700
Sorry about this.

206
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,000
I can't go home with you.

207
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,600
I know we were in the middle of something.

208
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,100
It's okay.

209
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,340
Hey!

210
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,070
Do you want to sleep over at my house tomorrow?

211
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,100
What do you think about an all-night girly-talk session?

212
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,400
- Okay!
- Really?

213
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,600
That's great! I'll see you tomorrow.

214
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,700
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye!

215
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,200
- Thanks.
- Bye!

216
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,200
Bye!

217
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,000
Thanks for waiting.

218
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,000
Mugi is so handsome!

219
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,800
He is!

220
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,700
Have you already forgotten what you were talking about?

221
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,200
Ecth-chan! I was waiting for you! Come in!

222
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm coming in.

223
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,100
Sorry to keep you waiting.

224
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
It's okay. Is that the one you bought the last time?

225
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,400
Yeah, it is! It's a great color, isn't it?

226
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,000
- Do you want to use it as well?
- No, I'm fine.

227
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,300
Only girls notice stuff like this.

228
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,200
Your room is really tidy!

229
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,400
I scrubbed the whole place.

230
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,500
It's the first time I've had a girl over.

231
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,600
A girl?

232
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,800
Actually,I think it's the first time

233
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,500
someone has stayed over since I was in elementary school.

234
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,000
I see.

235
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,800
I didn't have many friends,

236
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,400
and you're the only

237
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,300
girl that I can talk to.

238
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,300
Why?

239
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,800
I don't know. I think it's because I like you.

240
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,700
I had planned to talk all night.

241
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,400
I was so excited last night

242
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,400
that I couldn't sleep.

243
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,400
That was a mistake.

244
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,790
I apologize in advance if I'm restless in my sleep.

245
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,100
That's fine.

246
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,700
You should come to my house next.

247
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,420
I have something that I wanted to ask you.

248
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,500
What is it?

249
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,000
I wonder...

250
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,660
What type of person do you like?

251
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800
I wonder who it is.

252
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,200
Could he be in the same class as Mugi?

253
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,700
Do I know him?

254
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,900
Tell me!

255
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,070

Hanabi...

257
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,200
You don't really like Awaya that much,

258
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,600
do you?

259
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,600
Why?

260
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,600
Why do you pretend you like him?

261
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,000
At least tell me that much.

262
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,000
What are you talking about?

263
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,350
I know.

264
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,400
I've been watching you.

265
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,900
I've always been watching you.

266
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,200
That's why I know.

"Those feelings you have when you like someone"

268
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:35,990
are earnest and confusing.

269
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,400
You can't give up, even if you try.

270
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,000
That's just how it is.

271
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,800
Hanabi...

272
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,400
I like you.
