Why?

Why do you pretend you like him?

I have someone that I love,

but he's never

15
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,110
going to fall for me.

16

That's why I'm dating Mugi.

17
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,540
Are you disappointed in me?

18
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,990
Why can't it be me?

19

If that's the case, why can't it be me?!

20
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,710
I could be that person.

21
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,600
I want you to use me.

22
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,000
This reminded me of something.

23
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,350
I was wondering if you had an answer for me.

24
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,750
Answer?

25
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,350
I confessed my feelings to you.

Oh,

27
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,030
I'm sorry.

You made me wait for a week.

32
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,810
You're annoying me.

33
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,270
There's nothing as annoying as having to deal with

34

affection from people I'm not interested in.

35
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,580
I wonder how I was able to say such things.

36
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,240

You really helped me out there.

Let's go!

47
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,080
I'm sitting the exam for the same school.

Huh?

49
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:13,930
You don't have to put on a brave face. I'm sure you were scared.

50
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:22,560
Oh, I only have this but, here.

Let's go!

52
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,610
That was my first love.

53
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,900
Up until then, I always thought that I hated boys,

54
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,710
or that I wasn't interested in love.

55
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:55,300

H-How did you get in here?

- That bit is the same as you girls.
- Huh?

82
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,390
I'm sure it hurts if you touch yourself too hard.

I-I don't know! I've never touched myself before.

You don't have to get defensive. That's what all the girls say anyway.

That's not her brother, is it?

138
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,070

I think I should help you relieve that tension.

Hmm.

I don't know. I'm sure everything will be okay.

You're so naive! It was so late.

I was wearing your clothes.

166
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,990
Most people would assume that we were dating.

I wonder what her game is?

I mean, it's strange if you think about it.

169

Why would she go after Narumi if she has another guy?

Oh, about that...

171
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:46,780
I think he's one of her tutoring students like me.

172
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:54,120
I thought about it last night, and I remembered that I had seen him before.

173
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,090
He was buying study aids at the bookshop with her.

174
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,700
So what?

175
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,480
So what?

176
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,230
So, he must have been asking her for advice yesterday.

177
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,760
Really?

178
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,970
Are you being serious?

179
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,100
Of course, he wasn't!

180
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,820
Those two are sleeping together!

181
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,920
How would you know that?

182
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,900
How can you not notice?

183
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,480
You just have to look at that woman to know!

184
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,610
You don't know anything about her!

185
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,120
They say love is blind,

186
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,860
but how can he not notice?

187
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Why doesn't he feel the same as me?

188
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,550
I suppose

189
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,880
we have the same goal,

190
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,220
we're in the same situation,

191
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,450
and we had a brief connection.

192
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:22,380
So, I fooled myself into thinking we understood each other.

193
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,100
He loves that woman.

194
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,670
He's a man, and we're strangers.

195
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:50,430
That's it for homeroom. Be careful on your way home!

196
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,920
What's wrong, Yasuraoka?

197
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,840
- Narumi...
- Yeah.

198
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,530
We're at school, so it's not Narumi.

199
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,820
Narumi, what do you...

200
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,980
Never mind.

201
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:25,760
You should be careful, too.

202
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:35,110
I was always looking for a reason.

203
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:38,670
If Narumi fell in love with someone...

204
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:42,010
if that was the person he wanted, then...

205
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,590
But this isn't it.

206
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,060
This isn't it at all.

207
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,710
It's definitely not!

208
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,330
- Bye, Miss.
- Bye!

209
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:55,200
Bye!

210
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,130
Yasuraoka? What's wrong?

211
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:08,750
Miss, is the man you were with yesterday your boyfriend?

212
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,460
No, he's my friend.

213
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:23,440
Then, why did you ask us to keep it a secret?

214
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,710
Huh?

215
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,760
If you're just friends, then it shouldn't matter.

216
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,940
I didn't want any strange rumors to spread around the school.

217
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,170
That's why I said that.

218
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:42,340
At school?

219
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:47,000
It wasn't because you didn't want a certain someone to find out?

220
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,200
There was only one disadvantage

221
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,200
to both of us,

222
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,500
if our secrets were to be known.

223
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:04,320
Yasuraoka?

224
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,980
If she wants to silence me,

225
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,180
then she must know

226
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:15,430
that I love Narumi.

227
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:23,120
What's wrong? You're acting odd.

228
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:28,730
Ms. Minagawa! The meeting is about to start.

229
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:32,070
Sorry! I have a meeting at 4:00.

230
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:35,350
I'll see you later. Be careful on your way home.

231
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,970
That's when I realized,

232
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:52,620
the woman that Mugi loved

233
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:56,170
was wearing the same clothes as the night before,

234
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:00,370
and her hair

235
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:06,340
smelled faintly of cigarette smoke.

236
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:29,950
