MORIOKA SHINKANSEN ROLLING STOCK CENTER
AOMORI BRANCH

3
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,875
This is a train car.
Feel free to walk the corridor.

4
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:22,625
Welcome to the Aomori
Rolling Stock Center.

5
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:27,750
This is where we temporarily store
the Tohoku-Shinkansen train cars.

6
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:33,541
The first bullet train launched in 1964
and traveled from Tokyo to Osaka.

7
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:36,166
At the time, it was
the world's fastest train.

8
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,541
People called it
"the dream super express."

9
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:43,875
The E5 series travels
at a maximum speed of 320 km/h.

10
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:48,333
It's the latest model and reaches
Tokyo from Hokkaido in four hours.

11
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:52,291
These here are the coupling
and uncoupling components.

12
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,791
-Whoa!
-Awesome!

13
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:58,083
This is the same model
you'll be riding in.

14
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:00,208
Watch your step.

15
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:03,958
Okay, does anyone have questions
for Mr. Takaichi?

16
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,708
This way, please.

17
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:10,291
Excuse me. Why did you become a conductor?

18
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,208
Why not a driver?

19
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:13,291
-Good point.
-Yeah.

20
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:16,041
All sorts of people ride the bullet train.

21
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:20,500
Of course, there are students
on field trips like you.

22
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,041
But in a few years,

23
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,166
some of you might even

24
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,333
ride the bullet train
to attend a friend's wedding.

25
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:29,750
-Yeah, Aoi's.
-For sure.

26
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:34,125
There may also be families traveling
or people returning from a business trip.

27
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:38,625
Though each of us has
our own private reasons for boarding,

28
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:41,250
we're all heading the same direction.

29
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,041
And yet, we're strangers again on arrival.

30
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:49,250
Isn't there something romantic
about seeing all those people off?

31
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,833
I don't get it, but it sounds deep.

32
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:56,083
-Let's take a group photo!
-Oh, cool.

33
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,833
-Get in line everyone!
-Ready?

34
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:01,791
Okay, say cheese!

35
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:16,041
SHIN-AOMORI STATION
AOMORI CITY, AOMORI PREFECTURE

36
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,791
-Mr. Takaichi! Good afternoon.
-Oh, hi.

37
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,416
I'll be riding with you today.

38
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,125
Yeah? Make yourself at home.

39
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,958
How was the rolling stock center tour?

40
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,625
An old man like me only bores those kids.

41
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,541
Then why not let a youngster like me try?

42
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:33,333
"Ensuring that each
of our precious passengers

43
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,708
reaches their destination safely."

44
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,041
"That's my ultimate mission!"

45
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,125
How's that?

46
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,708
That's nothing to joke about.

47
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,416
No more chit-chat.

48
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,083
Sorry.

49
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,666
Then again, maybe you're right.

50
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,000
What?

51
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,333
I'll mention you to the district manager.

52
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,375
Thank you, sir!

53
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,583
I'm not the one who decides though.

54
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:16,291
Hayabusa No. 60, bound for Tokyo,
will depart at 3:17 p.m. on Platform 14.

55
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:22,041
It will stop at the following
stations before arriving at Tokyo Station.

56
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,958
Hachinohe, Morioka,
Sendai, Omiya, and Ueno.

57
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:30,250
The red safety barrier will open
once the train has arrived.

58
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:34,125
Please wait until the train
comes to a full stop.

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,875
Thank you for your patience.

60
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:57,166
Hayabusa No. 60 has arrived on Platform 14
and will depart at 3:17 p.m.

61
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,208
The doors are opening.

62
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,916
Side light, on.

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,416
All aboard, everybody!

64
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,291
This train will stop at Sendai, Omiya…

65
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:12,625
We've gotta eat there.

66
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,375
The final stop will be Tokyo.

67
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:26,416
Thank you for riding with JR East.

68
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,500
This is a Hayabusa train
on the Tohoku-Shinkansen line

69
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,041
bound for Tokyo.

70
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:36,708
All seats on this train are reserved.

71
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,416
The next stop is Hachinohe.

72
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,166
Smoking is prohibited.

73
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,125
Ms. Kagami,

74
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:46,583
what if we remove the part
about energy policy?

75
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:47,791
Absolutely not.

76
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:51,833
It's on people's minds
because of the rising energy prices.

77
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,375
We can win support.

78
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,041
Yes, of course.

79
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:04,375
Excuse me.

80
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:09,458
Hey!

81
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,791
You're Todoroki, aren't you?
The unemployed millionaire.

82
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:13,791
Oh, uh…

83
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,750
Excuse me.

84
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,458
Seriously?

85
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,833
Oh, forgive me, ma'am.

86
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,291
Hi there!

87
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,791
Mom!

88
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,291
It's the sugar mama politician!

89
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000

00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,625
You'll need the schedule
of out-of-service trains.

93
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,875
-Shall I write it out?
-Please.

94
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,916
ITSUKI, SENDAI TRANSPORT DISPATCHER

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,833
Yes?

96
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,208
A sick passenger?

97
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,708
-A male.
-Sick passenger on 3025B!

98
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,250
He's fully conscious
but has an intense headache?

99
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,041
A headache?
Better arrange for an ambulance.

100
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,333
How long until Morioka?

101
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:14,583
Twenty-five minutes.

102
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,875
-Have 3025B stop at Mizusawaesashi.
-Yes, sir.

103
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,958
61B will remain in place
at Ichinoseki Station.

104
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:21,916
I'll send word.

105
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,666
Send the emergency medical team.

106
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,166
3025B, this is
Transport Dispatcher Itsuki.

107
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,875
5060B, Hayabusa No. 60,

108
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,458
is cleared for departure.

109
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,250
We need an ambulance. Thanks.

110
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,625
Repeater signal, "On."

111
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:42,916
Hayabusa No. 60 is now departing for Tokyo
from Platform 14.

112
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,250
Wait! We're getting on!

113
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,916

-Please stand clear of the closing doors.
-Close doors!

118
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,666
The doors are closing.

119
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,625
Side lights, off.

120
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,500
Signal clear, doors closed.

121
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,041
Time checked.

122
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,500
Brakes released.

123
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,875
One, two, three…

124
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:24,666
The safety barrier
on Platform 14 is closing.

125
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,416
Wave goodbye!

126
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,958
-Bye-bye!
-Bye-bye!

127
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,416
On time.

128
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,166
5060B has departed
on time from Shin-Aomori.

129
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:14,291
Thank you for riding with JR East.

00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:18,791
This is Hayabusa No. 60, bound for Tokyo.
All seats are reserved.

131
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:23,250
This train will make the following stops.

133
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,916
-Sure, thanks.
-Morioka…

134
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:29,625

135
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,416

Ueno, 6:26 p.m.

138
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,916
-The final stop is…
-We barely made it.

139
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,708
We didn't see any brown bears.

140
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,166
It's not my fault!

141
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:01,666

I'm sorry the announcements
were hard to hear.

145
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,791
We'll evaluate
the need for further training.

146
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,083
We apologize.

147
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:19,000
Thank you for calling
the JR East Call Center.

148
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,916
My name is Miyashita.

149
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,416
I have planted a bomb on Hayabusa No. 60,

150
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,625
which is traveling
from Shin-Aomori to Tokyo.

151
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:32,333
Forgive me. Could you please repeat that?

152
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:36,166
The bomb will detonate if the train
slows to less than 100 km/h.

153
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,500
To prove this is not a prank,

154
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:42,250
I have planted an identical bomb
on freight train 2074.

155
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,916
-On the Aoemori Railway Line.
-What is it?

156
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,333
That bomb will detonate
if the train slows below 5 km/h.

157
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:49,875
A bomb?

158
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,458
They hung up.

159
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,250
I'VE PLANTED A BOMB.

160
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:58,250
AOMORI-HIGASHI STATION,
AOEMORI RAILWAY LINE

161
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,250
This is Aomori-Higashi Station.

162
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,833
Huh?

163
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,875
-A bomb?
-What?

164
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,541
Is it a prank?

165
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,541
Look, we can't just tell them
not to drop below--

166
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,791
-What about the police and cabinet?
-They're aware.

167
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,291
A joint task force is being formed,

168
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,125
so we'll send a liaison too.

As the bomber said,

171
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,958
the moment speed fell below 5 km/h,
it detonated.

172
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,166
It's just like the 109 case.

173
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,250
-Connect me to the control center.
-Yes, sir.

174
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,166
An explosion if they slow
to less than 100 km/h?

175
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,083
If this is real,

176
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,333
Hayabusa No. 60 will have to keep running.

177
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,583
What is its current location and speed?

178
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:04,375
It's traveling just outside of
Shichinohe-Towada at 260 km/h.

179
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,625
Have them stay above 100
and pass through Hachinohe.

180
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:10,833
I'm on my way,
but use your own judgment to a degree.

181
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:11,875
Understood.

182
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,333
You all heard
what the General Manager said.

183
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,416
5060B will disable
Automatic Train Control,

184
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,666
stay above 120 km/h, and skip Hachinohe.

185
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,458
Too fast won't do either.

186
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,708
They'll need all the time they can get.

187
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,875
Suspend all bullet trains
on the Hokkaido and Tohoku lines.

188
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,333
Hokuriku and Joetsu trains
will turn back at Omiya.

189
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,708
-Evacuate all trains.
-All of them?

190
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,000
We need to clear the tracks for 5060B.

191
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,833
I can use my own judgment to a degree.

192
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:38,916
"To a degree…"

193
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,666
No operation
comes before passenger safety.

194
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,041
-Get moving!
-Yes, sir!

195
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,416
TOKYO

196
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,833
SHICHINOHE TOWN, AOMORI PREFECTURE
633 KM TO TOKYO

197
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,125
5060B, this is
Transport Dispatcher Nagano.

198
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,833
This is Matsumoto, driver of 5060B.

199
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,750
Please listen carefully.

200
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,125
Just now, an anonymous caller

201
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,083
said they planted a bomb on 5060B.

202
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,000
What?

203
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:22,291
Wait, is this a drill or something?

204
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,791
It's not a drill.

205
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:25,875
Understood.

206
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,000
When we stop at Hachinohe, we'll inspect--

207
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,125
The caller said

208
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,250
the bomb will detonate
if your speed falls below 100 km/h.

209
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:34,833
You mean we can't stop?

210
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,000
Nothing was found
during inspection, right?

211
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,333
Couldn't it be a prank?

212
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,416
On this route,
we'll have to stop at Tokyo--

213
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,250
This is General Commander Kasagi.

214
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,708
Ms. Matsumoto, please listen carefully.

215
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,250
Disable the ATC,
maintain a speed of 120 km/h,

216
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,125
and pass through Hachinohe.

217
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,500
We'll support you in any way we can.

218
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,041
Understood.

219
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,041
ATC, disabled.

220
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,041
ATC DISABLED

221
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,166
Disabled.

222
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,083
Check.

223
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,416
ATC disabled!

224
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,333
Check.

225
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,291
Since the freight car exploded,

226
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,333
it's highly likely there's a bomb
on 5060B too.

227
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,708
What do I tell the passengers?

228
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:48,625
Tell them you're skipping Hachinohe
due to "operational issues."

229
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:49,750
And…

230
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,041
What about the bomb?

231
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,750
Keep it quiet.

232
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,916
Avoid panic at all costs.

233
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,416
OIRASE TOWN, AOMORI PREFECTURE
612 KM TO TOKYO

234
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,958
Ice cream, please. Make it cold!

235
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,666
Certainly. One ice cream.

236
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,458
Oh, and can I have your Instagram?

237
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:13,583
I'm afraid this device
does not support Instagram.

238
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,208
Are you crazy?

239
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,750
Get real, Takei!

240
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,291
He did that for Aoi.

241
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,916
-Stop. That's gross.
-Right? I thought so too.

242
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,833
Right, Yuzuki?

243
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,041
Huh? What are we talking about?

244
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:30,250
Haven't you heard? Takei asked Aoi out.

245
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,541
-For real?
-So that was a performance.

246
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:35,083
-"You shot me down…"
-"But I'm over it!"

247
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,125
I heard that! Get real.

248
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,333
Would you butt out?
You're making me nauseous!

249
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,875
-Boom!
-Boom!

250
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,125
That was so cringe.

251
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,125
May I have your attention please.

252
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,666
We are approaching Hachinohe Station,

253
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,041
but due to operational issues,

254
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,666
this train will pass through
without stopping.

255
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,666
For those who intended
to disembark at Hachinohe,

256
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,833
we sincerely apologize

257
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,500
for the inconvenience.

258
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,000
I repeat.

259
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,375
Due to operational issues,

260
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,625
this train will not stop
at Hachinohe Station.

261
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,916
Is something wrong?

262
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Who knows.

263
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,500
As long as it stops
at Morioka, we're fine.

264
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,833
-Here they are.
-One at a time!

265
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:31,291
-Okay!
-2030B is at Kitakami on track one.

266
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,416
Passengers are deboarding 2030B now.

267
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,291
-3025B has reached the stock center.
-Roger that!

268
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:41,708
-Next, 66B is bound for Sendai.
-Tell the driver to depart!

269
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,125
-I'll do it.
-Roger!

270
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:46,166
Next, 5152B is at Ichinoseki on track one.

271
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,541
5152B has completed deboarding.

272
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,208
Deboarding complete! Roger!

273
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,458
Last up is 9166B.

274
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,125
We secured a route to Sendai.

275
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,958
Good. Where is No. 60 now?

276
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,833
The police liaison has arrived!

277
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,250
LT. KAWAGOE, SPECIAL INVESTIGATION

278
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:10,875
-I'm Kawagoe from Special Investigations.
-I'm Yoshimura from JR East.

279
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,375
This is General Commander Kasagi.

280
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,583
I've been briefed.
Are you in contact with the perpetrator?

281
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,750
Yes. The calls are forwarded here.

282
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,416
5060B is approaching Hachinohe!

283
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,291
Roger! Confirm that the ATC is disengaged.

284
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,375
Yes, sir!

285
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,416
ATC?

286
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,458
The Automatic Train Control system.

287
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:31,166
Bullet trains are equipped
with automatic brakes

288
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,083
that decelerate
when speed limits are exceeded.

289
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:38,250
The speed limit entering stations
is normally 75 km/h.

290
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,041
So it's disengaged?

291
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,208
Yes, of course.

292
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,541
Unless it activates by mistake.

293
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,083
5060B has left the Takadate Tunnel.

294
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,291
Three kilometers to Hachinohe!

295
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,708
ATC disabled. Check.

296
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,333
HACHINOHE CITY, AOMORI PREFECTURE
595 KM TO TOKYO

297
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,583
HACHINOHE STATION,
TOHOKU-SHINKANSEN LINE

298
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,583
-Your attention please…
-Please keep moving.

299
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,833
All passengers,
please return to the ticket gates.

300
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,708
Your attention please.

301
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:30,166
The Hayabusa No. 60 train bound for Tokyo
will not stop at Hachinohe today.

302
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,291
They say it won't stop!

303
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:34,541
Hey, sit down.

304
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,791
-It's not slowing--
-Out of the way!

305
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,791
Hey! Are you all right, dear?

306
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,250
5060B has passed Hachinohe.

307
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,458
The ATC did not engage.

308
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:05,791
Line one!

309
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,416
We're connected. Go ahead.

310
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,833
This is Yoshimura from JR East.

311
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:19,250
Prepare cash for a ransom.

312
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:22,125
I will tell you how to defuse the bomb.

313
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,833
I demand 100 billion yen.

314
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:25,750
What?

315
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,833
One hundred billion?

316
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:32,208
We can't arrange that much
by the time the train reaches Tokyo.

317
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,208
My demand is not to JR.

318
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,500
It's to all citizens of Japan.

319
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,083
All citizens?

320
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,458
Divided by population,

321
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:42,583
that's only 1,000 yen per person.

322
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,250
I'll leave the collection method to you.

323
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,166
But it must be 100 billion
from the people of Japan.

324
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,250
That is all.

325
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,541
This exceeds our authority.

326
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,000
We need the government involved.

327
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,541
Japan does not negotiate with terrorists!

328
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,916
I'm Sasaki,
Special Advisor to the Prime Minister.

329
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,916
-I'm Yoshi--
-No need for introductions.

330
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,500
General Manager Yoshimura.

331
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:20,708
This case is a test of our ability
to respond in a timely manner.

332
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,708
I'm aware of you too, Lt. Kawagoe.

333
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,041
Now then, Mr. Yoshimura.

334
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,291
Please inform the passengers
about the bomb.

335
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,333
-But--
-If you do that, there's sure to be chaos.

336
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:33,875
I'm well aware of that,

337
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,833
General Commander Kasagi.

338
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:39,041
At current speed, they'll reach Tokyo
in five and a half hours.

339
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:42,958
Our best option is to promptly disclose
and learn about the perpetrator.

340
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:43,958
Besides,

341
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,500
the government has made its decision.

342
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,458
NINOHE CITY, IWATE PREFECTURE
573 KM TO TOKYO

343
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,583
Understood.

344
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:57,583
Thank you.

345
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:05,250
We're gonna tell them about the bomb?

346
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,291
We can't do that! They'll panic!

347
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,583
It's easy to give orders from afar--

348
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,125
Fujii, stop.

349
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,708
I'm scared too.

350
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,416
But the worst that could happen

351
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,416
is for us to panic.

352
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,250
Attention please.

353
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,583
We've just been informed

354
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,916
that an explosive device

355
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,875
has been planted on this train.

356
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:48,333
According to the information
we've just received regarding this train…

357
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,833
Everyone, quiet!

358
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,291
…an explosive device has been planted.

359
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,250
Wait, what? What do we do?

360
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,291
-Below a set speed…
-It's a bomb.

361
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:57,375
No way.

362
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:02,666
We passed through Hachinohe
due to safety reasons.

363
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,250
What's going on?

364
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:07,333
The police are currently investigating.

365
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:08,833
Go get some answers.

366
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,333
Hear that? "Boom!"

367
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:12,916
These moments call for calm.

368
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,333
Panic within the confined space
of the train is very dangerous.

369
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:20,083
We ask that you please
follow instructions from the crew

370
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,916
and remain calm.

371
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:24,333
I repeat.

372
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,583
An explosive device has been planted

373
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:28,708
on board this train.

374
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:34,291
Didn't you people do an inspection?

375
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:36,041
Prior to departure!

376
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,041
Sir, we--

377
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:39,708
We conduct safety inspections
at each stop.

378
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:43,208
But if a device
is planted after inspection,

379
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:44,541
it's difficult to detect.

380
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:46,458
-"Difficult?"
-Come on!

381
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:48,750
Isn't that your job?

382
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:51,041
I sincerely apologize.

383
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:53,500
You don't give a damn about us, do you?

384
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:56,083
He's right! I have an appointment to keep.

385
00:22:56,833 --> 00:23:00,291
Ms. Kagami, you could use this
to shift focus from your scandal.

386
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:02,125
We're very sorry!

387
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:03,708
We sincerely apologize.

388
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:05,208
Everyone!

389
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:07,333
Everyone, please!

390
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:10,250
Why don't we all calm down?

391
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:16,083
The bad guy here
is the perpetrator, right?

392
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:18,375
Attacking the conductor won't--

393
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:20,166
-Hey!
-Sir, please!

394
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,708
Who's attacking anyone?

395
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:25,500
This is a complaint!

396
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,708
A justified response to error.

397
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:31,333
Ever heard that word?

398
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:34,958
So back off, sugar mama!

399
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:37,416
Yeah! Who do you think you are?

400
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,333
Adulterer!

401
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:41,375
When jerks like you

402
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,583
start whining like dogs,

403
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:47,208
how do you think the rest of us feel, huh?

404
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:48,625
-"Whining?"
-Please stop!

405
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:49,958
-Get off me!
-Uh-oh.

406
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,333
Why you--

407
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:53,708
Fujii, don't! Stop!

408
00:23:57,291 --> 00:24:00,208
You don't have to protect
someone like her.

409
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:07,458
I'm responsible for all passengers.

410
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,125
It's my job to ensure your safety!

411
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:14,250
Everyone, please return to your seats.

412
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,875
Please!

413
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:19,125
We'll update you
when we know more. Please!

414
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,583
Excuse me, sir.

415
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:21,500
Please!

416
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,708
I apologize. Thank you.

417
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:31,541
Well done, Mr. Takaichi.

418
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:34,583
If you need help, I'm in Car 9.

419
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:36,250
Don't hesitate to ask.

420
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:37,875
YUKO KAGAMI

421
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:39,166
NATIONAL DIET MEMBER

422
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:46,541
Thank you.

423
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:56,125
We interrupt scheduled programming

424
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:59,083
to bring you a briefing
by Chief Cabinet Secretary Suwa.

425
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:04,208
Thank you.

426
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:07,375
At 3:25 p.m. today, we received word

427
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:11,208
that an explosive device
has been planted on Hayabusa No. 60,

428
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:16,375
bound for Tokyo from Shin-Aomori.

429
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:18,625
It is Japan's policy

430
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:21,750
that we do not negotiate with terrorists.

431
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:23,708
As such,

432
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:26,416
we are prioritizing passenger safety

433
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,750
by focusing our efforts
on apprehending the perpetrator.

434
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:32,833
The Prime Minister
is currently visiting the U.S.

435
00:25:32,916 --> 00:25:36,041
but has been informed.

436
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:39,208
We were instructed to provide
prompt and accurate…

437
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:41,666
-Incoming call on line one.
-Go ahead.

438
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:46,083
This is Yoshimura.

439
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:49,166
Why didn't you demand the 100 billion yen?

440
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:53,333
The longer you wait,
the more time you waste.

441
00:25:53,416 --> 00:25:56,791
-Hayabusa--
-I represent the Prime Minister.

442
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:58,416
As you're aware,

443
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,791
this is an unprecedented situation.

444
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:05,833
We have no framework to collect funds
or a legal basis to do so.

445
00:26:05,916 --> 00:26:07,333
The Cabinet--

446
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:11,083
Did you trace it?

447
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:15,833
The Prime Minister…

448
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:16,916
What?

449
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,416
…has asked for a report…

450
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,000
"Framework," huh?

451
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:22,208
An investigation is underway,

452
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:26,458
and we are working with local governments
along the Tohoku-Shinkansen line.

453
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:31,083
The bomb onboard Hayabusa No. 60

454
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:34,500
will detonate if the train's speed
drops below 100 km/h.

455
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:36,708
The ransom is 100 billion yen.

456
00:26:36,791 --> 00:26:40,250
The bomb will detonate
if speed falls below 100 km/h.

457
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:43,583
The ransom is 100 billion yen.

458
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:44,750
Whoa!

459
00:26:45,416 --> 00:26:46,541
What the hell is this?

460
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:48,458
The ransom is 100 billion yen.

461
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:51,166
The bomb will detonate
if speed falls below 100 km/h.

462
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,833
The ransom is 100 billion yen.

463
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:56,166
The bomb will detonate if…

464
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,125
-What the…
-Huh?

465
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:59,166
The ransom is 100 billion yen.

466
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,291
The bomb will detonate
if speed falls below 100 km/h.

467
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:04,666
The ransom is 100 billion yen.

468
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,666
The bomb will detonate
if speed falls below 100 km/h.

469
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,875
The ransom is 100 billion yen.

470
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:11,458
Is that the rolling stock center?

471
00:27:11,541 --> 00:27:13,166
Yes, the video is from there.

472
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:16,333
Trace the server and account.
Analyze the video!

473
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:17,625
One more thing.

474
00:27:17,708 --> 00:27:20,041
When will we get the 1975 109 case file?

475
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:21,291
I'll follow up.

476
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:23,791
If speed falls below 100 km/h…

477
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:26,250
-It really is a bomb!
-Let me see!

478
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:28,166
What the hell is going on, huh?

479
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,125
-There's a bomb!
-Keep your voice down!

480
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:32,375
100 billion yen is out of the question.

481
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:34,541
-Who asked you, huh?
-What'd you say?

482
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:43,458
Please wait, everyone!

483
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:51,083
We're gonna die at this rate!

484
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:52,333
We're gonna die!

485
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:55,000
The ceiling is gonna collapse!

486
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:56,208
You can't go out there.

487
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:58,250
I have to do something!

488
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:00,791
Let me go!

489
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:02,708
I can't take this.

490
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:05,375
I wanna go home!

491
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:07,666
…if speed falls below 100 km/h.

492
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:10,333
The ransom is 100 billion yen.

493
00:28:10,416 --> 00:28:13,208
The bomb will detonate
if speed falls below 100 km/h.

494
00:28:14,541 --> 00:28:17,750
IWATE TOWN, IWATE WARD, IWATE PREFECTURE
531 KM TO TOKYO

495
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:21,708
I showed the video to staff,

496
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:25,458
and they believe the bomb
was likely planted in Car 4.

497
00:28:25,541 --> 00:28:27,750
Still, there might be more than one.

498
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:29,125
-Right.
-Commander!

499
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,416
What is it?

500
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,291
There's a problem on 5060B's route
at Switch Number 51, just past Morioka.

501
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:37,458
Train 3032B is malfunctioning
and can't move.

502
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:39,500
What's the cause? Can we move it?

503
00:28:39,583 --> 00:28:42,083
A bird hit the insulator
and caused a short circuit.

504
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:45,208
They say it will take
at least an hour to recover.

505
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:47,875
-Switch 5060B to the northbound track.
-We can't.

506
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:51,208
3027B is running on the northbound track.

507
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:52,625
They're gonna collide!

508
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:56,333
3032B (HAYABUSA NO. 32)
STOPPED ON SOUTHBOUND TRACK

509
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:00,041
3027B (HAYABUSA AND KOMACHI NO. 27)
RUNNING ON NORTHBOUND TRACK

510
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:03,083
5060B (HAYABUSA NO. 60)
RUNNING ON SOUTHBOUND MAIN LINE

511
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:07,333
5060B is 11 kilometers from Morioka.

512
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:10,583
Five and a half minutes.

513
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,791
How long until 3027B passes Morioka?

514
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:14,500
Just under six minutes.

515
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:15,916
We have no choice.

516
00:29:16,541 --> 00:29:20,291
We'll have them change tracks
before Morioka at Switch Number 63.

517
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:22,625
They'll run south on the northbound line.

518
00:29:22,708 --> 00:29:25,625
Tell 3027B to accelerate.

519
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:26,666
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

520
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,708
-I'll call Morioka Station.
-Please.

521
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:31,083
Connect the short one over there.

522
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:32,291
South on the northbound?

523
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:33,625
Yes.

524
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:36,500
This is the stalled 3032B.

525
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,291
This is 5060B, Hayabusa No. 60.

526
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:44,375
3027B, Hayabusa and Komachi No. 27,
is heading towards it.

527
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:48,791
5060B will change tracks
at this switch here.

528
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,583
At nearly the same time as 3027B.

529
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:13,208
5060B, this is the control center.

530
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:14,625
-What?
-Just as I said.

531
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:17,083
Please slow to 105 km/h.

532
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:19,958
We need every second
we can get before the switch!

533
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:22,916
But switching tracks at 105 km/h…

534
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,375
-It's too dangerous!
-There's no other way!

535
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:28,500
Decelerate to 105 km/h immediately!

536
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:33,750
Understood.

537
00:30:40,666 --> 00:30:43,291
One hundred twenty, nineteen, eighteen…

538
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,583
Fifteen, twelve…

539
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,333
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six…

540
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:52,083
One hundred and five!

541
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:05,125
The shaking will be intense.

542
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:07,583
Instruct all the passengers to sit.

543
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,541
Don't let the passengers
see you like that, got it?

544
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,375
Y-Yes, sir.

545
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,166
We expect major turbulence
while approaching a switch!

546
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:31,958
For your safety, please be seated
and keep your heads down.

547
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:34,041
Please turn your seats around.

548
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,166
-We expect shaking!
-Yuzuki!

549
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:38,208
-Please be seated.
-Stay with me, okay?

550
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:47,541
Everyone, remain seated,

551
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:50,416
stay low, and keep your heads down!

552
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,333
Stay low with your heads down!

553
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:55,000
Excuse me, why will there be shaking?

554
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:56,250
Is it the bomb?

555
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:58,625
It's to stop the bomb from going off.

556
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:01,708
Don't worry.
Just follow instructions, please.

557
00:32:02,291 --> 00:32:05,000
For your safety, please remain seated!

558
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:07,916
3027B has accelerated
and is approaching Morioka.

559
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,375
It's now at 320 km/h.

560
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:11,041
Good. Maintain that speed.

561
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:15,000
It's 5060B.

562
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:16,583
Decelerate to 102!

563
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:18,375
Every second counts.

564
00:32:54,541 --> 00:32:57,041
MORIOKA CITY, IWATE PREFECTURE

565
00:32:59,666 --> 00:33:01,916
PLATFORM 12, MORIOKA STATION
TOHOKU-SHINKANSEN LINE

566
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:04,208
We'll explain later.

567
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:05,708
For your safety, stay back!

568
00:33:05,791 --> 00:33:06,791
This is ridiculous.

569
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:07,875
Step back, please!

570
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:12,291
Watch out!

571
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:16,958
DEPUTY HEAD OF MORIOKA RAILWAY OPERATIONS

572
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:22,916
3027B has passed Morioka.

573
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,125
5060B is approaching the switch!

574
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:43,416
3027B is passing through the switch!

575
00:33:43,916 --> 00:33:46,208
Switch 63 signal reverse… Go!

576
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:56,041
Speed… accelerating!

577
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:46,708
This is the driver of 3027B.
We've made an emergency stop near Morioka.

578
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:48,583
The conductor is assessing damage.

579
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:50,333
This is the driver of 5060B.

580
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:52,166
Our lead car made contact.

581
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:54,375
There was an impact,

582
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:56,583
but we're running without issues.

583
00:34:57,083 --> 00:34:59,708
Roger. We've confirmed on our end too.

584
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:03,833
Accelerate to 120 km/h

585
00:35:03,916 --> 00:35:06,791
and return to the southbound line
using Switch 53 at Kitakami.

586
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:07,708
Roger.

587
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:27,333
Mr. Takaichi, what was
that impact we felt?

588
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,333
We struck an oncoming train,

589
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:33,166
but we made it through
and are running with no problems.

590
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,375
You can relax now.

591
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:38,625
Well done.

592
00:35:38,708 --> 00:35:41,166
Just doing my job. Excuse me.

593
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:43,083
-Thank god she's here.
-We'll be fine.

594
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:45,875
-It's all thanks to her.
-Glad we have a lawmaker here.

595
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:47,458
But all she did was sit there.

596
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:55,125
Is everything fine on your end?

597
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:58,083
I thought we were gonna die.

598
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:00,791
Don't jinx us.

599
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:08,041
I'll go check on things.

600
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:10,291
Right.

601
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:25,375
Excuse me.

602
00:36:26,791 --> 00:36:28,458
I have an idea.

603
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:37,000
Everyone, sorry to disturb you
in these dire circumstances.

604
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:41,041
It's Mr. "To do rock it,"
Mitsuru Todoroki!

605
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:42,083
Fujii…

606
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:46,083
You may know me from my bestseller,
The Unemployed Millionaire.

607
00:36:46,166 --> 00:36:49,041
Perhaps you've even read it.

608
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:53,208
Did everyone see the video of the bomb?

609
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:54,583
-We did!
-Yeah.

610
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:57,250
They've ordered the entire nation

611
00:36:57,333 --> 00:37:00,083
to pay a 100 billion-yen
ransom to defuse it.

612
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,083
But as far as I can tell, no one out there

613
00:37:04,166 --> 00:37:06,458
has taken any concrete action.

614
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:07,541
No wonder he's famous!

615
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,083
It's times like these

616
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:12,958
when we expect speedy leadership
from our government.

617
00:37:13,041 --> 00:37:16,208
But a huge ship needs
plenty of time and effort

618
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:18,416
for even a minor change in course.

619
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,333
That's why

620
00:37:19,416 --> 00:37:22,291
I've created a platform
to raise the ransom money.

621
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:26,833
Follow me on social media
to see the details.

622
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:30,250
And let's all work together
to spread the word!

623
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:33,791
As passengers on this train,

624
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:36,291
we must ask the country to donate!

625
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:38,541
All of us should--

626
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:40,375
Hey, everyone!

627
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:41,708
Let's do it too!

628
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:43,875
Post it to all your accounts, okay?

629
00:37:43,958 --> 00:37:45,541
-Yeah!
-Good idea!

630
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:46,750
These days,

631
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:49,916
we can't rely on the government
or the self-defense forces.

632
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,541
We have to look out for ourselves.

633
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:54,916
Let's change despair into hope.

634
00:37:55,416 --> 00:37:56,500
Together,

635
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:58,166
we can achieve miracles!

636
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:00,541
Mr. "To do rock it,"

637
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:03,875
Mitsuru Todoroki, signing off.

638
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Excuse me! I apologize!

639
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,375
Please let me through!

640
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:18,458
You…

641
00:38:34,583 --> 00:38:37,458
I'm Aoi Watanuki, a high school junior.

642
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:40,625
We're onboard Hayabusa No. 60.

643
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:43,416
-Please don't give up on us.
-Please!

644
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,875
We're counting on you!

645
00:38:44,958 --> 00:38:45,791
Where did it go?

646
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:46,916
Oh, click here.

647
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,833
This one here!

648
00:38:48,916 --> 00:38:51,666
We're onboard Hayabusa No. 60.

649
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,541
-And there's a bomb on the train.
-Yeah.

650
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:54,625
Can I have water?

651
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:56,041
-Here.
-Thank you!

652
00:38:56,958 --> 00:38:57,916
This guy here.

653
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:01,166
Tell everyone!

654
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:03,708
#I_PAID

655
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:30,250
I'm Fukuda from the Daily Nitto.

656
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:33,333
A private website is collecting donations,

657
00:39:33,416 --> 00:39:35,916
but the government
hasn't announced any plans.

658
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,750
Could you comment?

659
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:41,083
We're aware of the website

660
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:43,875
from media coverage.

661
00:39:43,958 --> 00:39:47,416
However, it is not in line with our policy

662
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,708
of refusing to negotiate with terrorists.

663
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:53,125
We're looking into having it taken down.

664
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:55,541
Are you abandoning the passengers?

665
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:58,708
Don't you have
any specific solutions in mind?

666
00:39:58,791 --> 00:40:00,958
Chief Cabinet Secretary, over here!

667
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:02,791
-You owe us answers!
-Yeah!

668
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:05,458
Say something, sir!

669
00:40:05,541 --> 00:40:09,250
On August 30th,
at approximately 12:45 p.m.,

670
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:11,291
a sudden explosion occurred.

671
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,541
The gunpowder smoke was awful.

672
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:18,458
A special task force was convened,
and the investigation began.

673
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:22,916
Based on the current situation
and the information we've received,

674
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,458
we're confident they used materials
intended for dynamite.

675
00:40:27,541 --> 00:40:32,500
Who planted the bombs
and for what purpose?

676
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:36,291
Such terrorism cannot be tolerated.

677
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:37,416
The bomb's features,

678
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,125
the use of a cargo train for intimidation,

679
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:41,791
and the ransom demand.

680
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:45,833
They're all identical
to the "109 case" from 1975.

681
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:49,166
We can be confident that
there's some connection.

682
00:40:49,666 --> 00:40:52,291
The only difference is the ransom amount.

683
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:54,875
Adjusting for inflation,

684
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:57,458
it's 70 times bigger
than the previous amount.

685
00:40:57,958 --> 00:41:01,291
Yet they leave
the collection method to us.

686
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:03,333
They're mocking us.

687
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:10,333
Mr. Todoroki,

688
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:12,083
can you hear me?

689
00:41:12,166 --> 00:41:13,708
-Yes!
-Switch to Camera 3.

690
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:17,375
The government seemed
critical of your actions.

691
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:22,083
It's easy to criticize, after all!

692
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:24,166
They act like I'm the terrorist.

693
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,041
You'd think they would thank me.

694
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:28,958
I've done nothing to be criticized for.

695
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:32,750
Some people have said it's not clear
what you're doing with the money.

696
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:37,708
I've merely used an existing fundraising
tool to show the amount raised.

697
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:40,500
Although it's true that I'm behind
the original fund.

698
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:43,583
-That could be seen as a problem.
-Camera 4!

699
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:45,083
But remember, I'm a hostage.

700
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:47,041
I've got nowhere to run.

701
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:49,958
Think of it as subscribing
to an exciting show

702
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,416
and throw us some money!

703
00:41:51,916 --> 00:41:55,958
Mr. "To do rock it,"
Mitsuru Todoroki, signing off!

704
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:01,083
Mr. Todoroki,

705
00:42:01,708 --> 00:42:05,708
shouldn't you think this through?

706
00:42:05,791 --> 00:42:08,416
You're raising money for terrorists!

707
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,750
It's absurd!

708
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:12,375
The remaining life expectancy
of all passengers

709
00:42:12,458 --> 00:42:15,291
is about 45 years on a weighted average.

710
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,541
If each person uses 300 million yen
in their lifetime,

711
00:42:18,625 --> 00:42:21,625
160 million yen in expenditures
is lost per passenger death.

712
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:24,291
Multiply that by 350 passengers,

713
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,875
and it comes to 56 billion.

714
00:42:25,958 --> 00:42:28,791
If you also consider lost profits,
compensation, and the like,

715
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:31,625
paying 100 billion yen might be a bargain.

716
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:36,833
The government refuses to negotiate
so it can prevent further terrorism!

717
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:39,916
Do you realize how selfish you're being?

718
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,958
Principles are useless
in the heat of the moment.

719
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:44,375
Actually, Ms. Kagami,

720
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:49,041
as a Diet member,
you could help boost the fundraising.

721
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:50,916
Let's raise our synergy.

722
00:42:51,583 --> 00:42:53,625
Synergy?

723
00:42:54,166 --> 00:42:55,125
Give me a break!

724
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Time is short.

725
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,708
The sooner we start
raising money, the better.

726
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:05,416
If you think it through, that is.

727
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:19,250
KITAKAMI CITY, IWATE PREFECTURE
453 KM TO TOKYO

728
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:20,958
KINTEKI GOOD LUCK

729
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:22,083
DETECTING TARGETS

730
00:43:22,916 --> 00:43:25,208
You're Goto from that helicopter company.

731
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:26,125
Listen, old man.

732
00:43:26,208 --> 00:43:29,875
Your photo is being reposted
all over social media.

733
00:43:29,958 --> 00:43:31,291
-Did you know?
-Sure he did.

734
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:32,875
More and more people

735
00:43:32,958 --> 00:43:35,958
are refusing to pay
because you're onboard!

736
00:43:36,041 --> 00:43:37,083
-Look!
-It's Goto!

737
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:39,625
If you apologize now,
more people might pay.

738
00:43:39,708 --> 00:43:41,916
-Good point.
-Come on, apologize!

739
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,958
"I'm responsible

740
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:47,541
for the run-down tourist helicopter
that crashed into an elementary school."

741
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,791
"I'm very sorry!"

742
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:50,541
Say it! Just apologize!

743
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:54,500
I won't let cockroaches like you
lecture me on responsibility!

744
00:43:54,583 --> 00:43:56,041
-See that?
-Stop recording!

745
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:58,250
Will you be responsible for more deaths?

746
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:00,125
-Apologize here and now!
-Move!

747
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:01,916
-Get on your knees!
-Kneel!

748
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,291
Down you go!

749
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:05,291
Now smash that subscribe button.

750
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:06,375
And pay our ransom!

751
00:44:06,458 --> 00:44:08,291
Kinteki Good Luck, signing off.

752
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:12,708
Let go of me!

753
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:14,875
-Hold it!
-Move!

754
00:44:19,625 --> 00:44:22,458
Why don't you stop them, Ms. Lawmaker?

755
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:26,208
You do it. You're a man, aren't you?

756
00:44:26,291 --> 00:44:27,375
Charge!

757
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,791
Sorry, coming through. Excuse me.

758
00:44:31,875 --> 00:44:33,750
Hey! Stop it, please!

759
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:34,875
Calm down!

760
00:44:36,416 --> 00:44:37,458
Are you okay, sir?

761
00:44:40,541 --> 00:44:41,541
Let me off.

762
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:43,375
I want off this train!

763
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:44,875
Mr. Takaichi!

764
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:47,166
Hey, are you okay?

765
00:44:49,125 --> 00:44:49,958
Uh-oh, watch out.

766
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:51,500
-Oh, man!
-Get back here!

767
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:53,416
Let go!

768
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:55,166
I want off of here!

769
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:56,583
Please!

770
00:44:56,666 --> 00:44:58,958
Press it! Press the button!

771
00:44:59,041 --> 00:45:00,791
No! Don't do it!

772
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:02,833
Please! Hurry!

773
00:45:02,916 --> 00:45:04,625
Press it! Hurry!

774
00:45:22,416 --> 00:45:23,916
Even if the button is pushed,

775
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,458
it just informs the crew.

776
00:45:25,541 --> 00:45:27,000
We won't automatically stop.

777
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:30,750
Ms. Matsumoto, this is Takaichi.

778
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:33,791
The button was pushed
because of a commotion.

779
00:45:33,875 --> 00:45:34,875
Don't stop the train.

780
00:45:35,458 --> 00:45:37,083
Excuse me. Please let me through.

781
00:45:37,666 --> 00:45:39,000
Out of the way, please.

782
00:45:44,291 --> 00:45:46,500
Does there happen to be

783
00:45:46,583 --> 00:45:48,375
a doctor on board?

784
00:45:48,875 --> 00:45:51,666
If there is, please come
to the deck in Car 5.

785
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:55,333
5060B is passing the 440 km point!

786
00:46:09,208 --> 00:46:11,041
It's not life-threatening,

787
00:46:11,125 --> 00:46:12,458
but he needs rest.

788
00:46:13,291 --> 00:46:14,500
Thank you very much.

789
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:19,791
Is there any point

790
00:46:20,875 --> 00:46:22,375
in saving someone like him?

791
00:46:23,875 --> 00:46:24,958
What do you mean?

792
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:27,458
I overheard someone say

793
00:46:27,541 --> 00:46:29,291
we're gonna die because of him.

794
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:32,458
That's the point of not helping?

795
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:34,583
Think about it!

796
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,833
Because you saved him,
we can't pay the ransom.

797
00:46:36,916 --> 00:46:38,458
Why do we have to die?

798
00:46:38,541 --> 00:46:41,416
Ensuring that each
of our passengers arrives safely.

799
00:46:43,666 --> 00:46:45,750
That's the point.

800
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:50,833
I'll be in the driver's cab.

801
00:47:17,583 --> 00:47:19,166
When the SOS button was pressed,

802
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,875
I almost stopped reflexively.

803
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:22,375
That's not funny.

804
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:23,708
Here's water.

805
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:25,625
No, thank you.

806
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:28,625
What if I have to use the bathroom?

807
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:31,458
Right. Is there anything you do need?

808
00:47:31,958 --> 00:47:35,750
Well, a cheeseburger
and an apple pie wouldn't hurt.

809
00:47:37,083 --> 00:47:38,625
As long as we make it to Tokyo.

810
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:43,333
I wouldn't stop this train
if you killed me.

811
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:45,291
I'm fine.

812
00:47:46,041 --> 00:47:47,541
That's not funny either.

813
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:07,166
Oh, Mr. Takaichi!

814
00:48:09,041 --> 00:48:10,541
You dropped this.

815
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:15,625
MORIOKA SHINKANSEN CREW DEPOT,
FIRST-LINE MANAGER, TAKAICHI

816
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,416
Thanks.

817
00:48:18,916 --> 00:48:19,958
Are you okay?

818
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,250
I, uh… I'm sorry.

819
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:26,416
You were hurt because I called for you.

820
00:48:26,916 --> 00:48:28,041
Don't apologize.

821
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:30,625
Pressing the button

822
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:32,583
returned everyone to their senses.

823
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:35,208
Thanks for the help.

824
00:48:37,166 --> 00:48:38,875
How does it feel

825
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:41,166
to save someone like him?

826
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,291
"Someone like him?"

827
00:48:44,291 --> 00:48:45,958
Someone who everyone hates

828
00:48:46,458 --> 00:48:48,458
or who has no right to exist.

829
00:48:49,625 --> 00:48:51,666
Someone else just asked me that.

830
00:48:52,208 --> 00:48:53,791
And how did you answer?

831
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:56,750
It's nothing special.

832
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:58,500
Because it's your job?

833
00:49:00,458 --> 00:49:02,208
That might be one reason.

834
00:49:02,708 --> 00:49:05,791
Keeping everyone safe and calm
is indeed our job.

835
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:09,541
Plus, I really did want to save him.
That's no lie.

836
00:49:17,083 --> 00:49:19,833
Sorry for the weird question.

837
00:49:34,791 --> 00:49:37,166
You want to uncouple the last car?

838
00:49:37,666 --> 00:49:38,916
While in motion?

839
00:49:39,833 --> 00:49:41,666
Can you do such a thing?

840
00:49:43,333 --> 00:49:45,291
SHINKANSEN TRANSPORT
& ROLLING STOCK MANAGER

841
00:49:45,375 --> 00:49:47,791
When cars are uncoupled while in motion,

842
00:49:47,875 --> 00:49:50,208
the automatic brake kicks in.

843
00:49:50,291 --> 00:49:53,500
But if we disable that,
the structure allows for it.

844
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:58,208
First, we need a train to run side-by-side

845
00:49:58,291 --> 00:50:00,416
carrying the necessary tools.

846
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,291
We'll hang pulleys
between the crew doors of both trains.

847
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,208
Those can open while running.

848
00:50:05,875 --> 00:50:10,291
The tools will pass like a cable car,
and we'll give orders by phone.

849
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:13,791
We'll uncouple the cars
physically and electrically.

850
00:50:15,083 --> 00:50:18,208
Once that's done, a rescue train
with a connecting car in front

851
00:50:18,291 --> 00:50:22,291
will approach and connect with No. 60.

852
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,833
In other words,

853
00:50:26,291 --> 00:50:29,250
by moving the passengers
from here to here,

854
00:50:29,333 --> 00:50:31,291
they can all escape?

855
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:32,958
Call it "rescue."

856
00:50:33,041 --> 00:50:35,916
You'll do all that
while maintaining 120 km/h

857
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,166
and without using the emergency brakes?

858
00:50:39,041 --> 00:50:41,416
Is this really the best plan?

859
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,791
I don't know if it's the best.

860
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,875
It's a question of do or don't.

861
00:50:49,416 --> 00:50:51,333
It's our responsibility to do it.

862
00:50:52,625 --> 00:50:54,083
ICHINOSEKI CITY
410 KM TO TOKYO

863
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:12,291
I noticed Mr. Goto was awake,

864
00:51:12,375 --> 00:51:13,583
so I gave him water.

865
00:51:14,458 --> 00:51:15,375
Yeah?

866
00:51:15,458 --> 00:51:16,666
Thanks.

867
00:51:19,458 --> 00:51:22,291
What should I do next?

868
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:24,541
We should rest in shifts--

869
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:30,708
Hello, this is the 5060B conductor.

870
00:51:30,791 --> 00:51:32,875
It's Kasagi. Open your tablet.

871
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:33,791
Okay.

872
00:51:35,208 --> 00:51:37,583
We're initiating a rescue operation.

873
00:51:37,666 --> 00:51:40,333
Please check the document
I've just shared.

874
00:51:40,416 --> 00:51:42,916
Roger. I'll look it over.

875
00:51:45,916 --> 00:51:47,125
Next up is the rescue.

876
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:52,125
ANNOUNCEMENT

877
00:51:54,291 --> 00:51:56,083
Your attention please.

878
00:51:56,583 --> 00:52:00,041
We are proceeding with a rescue operation.

879
00:52:00,625 --> 00:52:03,583
Please wait in your seats
until we give further instructions.

880
00:52:03,666 --> 00:52:06,583
-All right!
-We're saved!

881
00:52:06,666 --> 00:52:09,083
In addition, if a qualified electrician

882
00:52:09,166 --> 00:52:10,666
is on board,

883
00:52:11,166 --> 00:52:14,333
please come to Car 9.

884
00:52:14,416 --> 00:52:15,708
Ow! What?

885
00:52:15,791 --> 00:52:19,083
-Honey, this is your chance to be useful.
-What?

886
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:21,375
They need an electrician!

887
00:52:22,708 --> 00:52:24,375
An electrician, huh?

888
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,666
The uncoupling process must be completed
before 5060B passes the stock center.

889
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:32,958
-Dispatchers, switch to group call.
-Yes, sir!

890
00:52:33,041 --> 00:52:33,875
What's the latest?

891
00:52:34,666 --> 00:52:35,833
SUPPLY TRAIN 9012B

892
00:52:36,208 --> 00:52:39,125
Supply train 9012B is approaching 5060B.

893
00:52:39,625 --> 00:52:43,208
9012B will change
to the northbound line at Switch 53.

894
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,500
5060B is 44 kilometers
from the stock center.

895
00:52:53,583 --> 00:52:55,625
The actual travel time is 22 minutes.

896
00:53:02,458 --> 00:53:03,708
Everyone, please listen!

897
00:53:03,791 --> 00:53:06,958
This car will be uncoupled
as part of the rescue plan.

898
00:53:07,041 --> 00:53:08,708
Please leave your luggage here

899
00:53:08,791 --> 00:53:11,208
and move immediately to the other cars!

900
00:53:12,208 --> 00:53:14,541
Move to the cars in front, please!

901
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:20,458
-Here it comes!
-Look!

902
00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:53,625
I see you, 9012B.

903
00:53:53,708 --> 00:53:56,000
Our speed is fixed at 120 km/h.

904
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,958
This is 9012B.

905
00:53:58,458 --> 00:54:02,500
I'll handle adjustments,
so fix your speed at 120.

906
00:54:03,333 --> 00:54:04,708
A little slower!

907
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:07,333
A little more! There!

908
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:09,708
Open the crew doors!

909
00:54:09,791 --> 00:54:11,833
-Ms. Ninomiya, please!
-Opening!

910
00:54:15,125 --> 00:54:15,958
Step back!

911
00:54:18,416 --> 00:54:19,833
I'm launching the guide rope.

912
00:54:19,916 --> 00:54:20,750
Move!

913
00:54:20,833 --> 00:54:22,750
-Direction and pressure confirmed!
-Launch!

914
00:54:22,833 --> 00:54:24,291
Grab the guide!

915
00:54:24,375 --> 00:54:26,000
-Okay!
-Got it!

916
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:26,916
Pulling begun!

917
00:54:27,416 --> 00:54:28,541
Tie it to the bit!

918
00:54:29,416 --> 00:54:30,375
The guide is fixed!

919
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,416
Ready! Send the cargo!

920
00:54:32,916 --> 00:54:33,750
-Right!
-Right!

921
00:54:34,916 --> 00:54:37,416
Lift the cargo. Okay, at that height.

922
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,333
Pull!

923
00:54:38,916 --> 00:54:42,291
The first shipment is underway.
Cargo is being transferred.

924
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:43,791
-Take this!
-Just like that.

925
00:54:43,875 --> 00:54:45,708
We're 18 minutes from the stock center.

926
00:54:45,791 --> 00:54:46,625
That's good.

927
00:54:47,416 --> 00:54:50,416
Keep pulling! A little more!
You've got it!

928
00:54:51,083 --> 00:54:51,958
Don't rush!

929
00:54:52,583 --> 00:54:53,791
Everything alright?

930
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:54,708
Yes!

931
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:56,583
Cargo No. 1 received!

932
00:54:56,666 --> 00:54:58,750
Shipment two will be pipes
and Cargo No. 3.

933
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:00,125
-Let's go!
-Right!

934
00:55:00,208 --> 00:55:01,083
Keep pulling!

935
00:55:01,583 --> 00:55:03,458
-Pull!
-30 kilometers to the stock center.

936
00:55:03,958 --> 00:55:04,791
Got it!

937
00:55:04,875 --> 00:55:06,541
Third and final shipment coming.

938
00:55:06,625 --> 00:55:08,666
The uncoupling device
is heavy! Be careful!

939
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:13,125
5060B will soon pass Furukawa Station.
They're 14 minutes from the stock center.

940
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:25,916
Everything okay?

941
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,125
All cargo received!

942
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:29,333
Thank you very much!

943
00:55:29,916 --> 00:55:32,375
This is 9012B. We will now depart.

944
00:55:32,875 --> 00:55:35,166
We're praying for your safety, 5060B.

945
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:36,208
Roger that.

946
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:38,000
We'll put the engineers on the line.

947
00:55:38,083 --> 00:55:40,125
They only have 12 minutes to uncouple.

Roger!

Do you see the line marked BRK?

959
00:56:08,791 --> 00:56:09,625
I see it!

960
00:56:09,708 --> 00:56:11,041
That's the emergency brake.

961
00:56:11,125 --> 00:56:12,416
Pass me a No. 1 screwdriver.

962
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,500
Change the cables to disable it.

963
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:15,833
Mr. Shinohara, please.

964
00:56:15,916 --> 00:56:16,750
You got it.

965
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,500
Here we go…

966
00:56:21,583 --> 00:56:23,333
CENTRALIZED SWITCHBOARD

967
00:56:23,416 --> 00:56:26,625
We will soon begin transfer
to the rescue train.

968
00:56:27,291 --> 00:56:29,583
-Move quickly and safely.
-I'm not leaving this.

969
00:56:29,666 --> 00:56:34,750
-We ask that you leave your luggage.
-This was expensive.

970
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,708
Passengers aged 65 or over,

971
00:56:38,791 --> 00:56:42,333
as well as small children
will be given priority.

972
00:56:44,208 --> 00:56:45,833
Please proceed to Car 8.

973
00:56:45,916 --> 00:56:48,791
Leave as much luggage as you--
You can't bring those!

974
00:56:49,291 --> 00:56:50,250
Only important stuff!

975
00:56:50,333 --> 00:56:51,833
-What about ice cream?
-No way!

976
00:56:52,333 --> 00:56:54,375
Only bring important stuff!

977
00:56:54,458 --> 00:56:56,666
We ask that you please leave…

978
00:56:56,750 --> 00:57:00,666
Connect that cable to Terminals B0 and 17.

979
00:57:03,083 --> 00:57:03,916
Okay!

980
00:57:05,916 --> 00:57:07,083
TERMINAL 17

981
00:57:07,166 --> 00:57:08,416
There!

982
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:10,208
We have power!

983
00:57:10,708 --> 00:57:12,000
Last step.

984
00:57:12,083 --> 00:57:14,166
Disconnect Cable 16.

985
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:16,333
Be careful, Mr. Shinohara.

986
00:57:16,416 --> 00:57:18,750
Any mistakes will activate
the emergency brakes.

987
00:57:18,833 --> 00:57:19,791
I can't allow that.

988
00:57:24,125 --> 00:57:25,458
TERMINAL 16

989
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,708
No problems with speed or car condition.

990
00:57:36,875 --> 00:57:38,041
Emergency brakes…

991
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:41,000
aren't activated.

992
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,291
-We did it!
-Yeah.

993
00:57:46,791 --> 00:57:48,291
-All right!
-Way to go!

994
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:50,791
They've merely killed
the emergency brakes.

995
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:52,750
We're not done yet.

996
00:57:53,625 --> 00:57:55,041
Now for the uncoupling process.

997
00:57:55,125 --> 00:57:57,375
Mr. Shinohara, you cut the jumper cables.

998
00:57:57,458 --> 00:58:00,666
Mr. Takaichi, you cut the damper
in the conductor's compartment.

999
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:01,666
Okay.

1000
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:04,958
This dumper, please!

1001
00:58:05,041 --> 00:58:05,875
Got it.

1002
00:58:06,875 --> 00:58:08,500
-There.
-I got it!

1003
00:58:08,583 --> 00:58:09,875
Right! Here it comes!

1004
00:58:09,958 --> 00:58:11,083
Okay!

1005
00:58:17,708 --> 00:58:18,875
Ready, go!

1006
00:58:18,958 --> 00:58:19,958
Ready, go!

1007
00:58:20,041 --> 00:58:21,416
-It's off!
-I'll take it.

1008
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,500
Next, please!

1009
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:23,625
Heave-ho!

1010
00:58:25,583 --> 00:58:26,750
-Here.
-Thanks.

1011
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,791
Be careful, dear!

1012
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:37,916
-Lower him slowly.
-Okay.

1013
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:48,916
We're under ten kilometers.
Five minutes to go.

1014
00:58:59,416 --> 00:59:00,291
Okay, it's off!

1015
00:59:00,375 --> 00:59:01,208
This one too.

1016
00:59:06,083 --> 00:59:07,375
I removed it!

1017
00:59:09,666 --> 00:59:11,666
We're ready to disconnect the coupler!

1018
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:13,500
Set this coupler, please.

1019
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:14,416
Got it!

1020
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:17,583
Done.

1021
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:19,916
Put the tips inside here.

1022
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
-In here, okay.
-There!

1023
00:59:22,083 --> 00:59:23,833
Four minutes left.

1024
00:59:27,041 --> 00:59:28,375
-Ready, go!
-Ready, go!

1025
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:30,958
-Ready, go!
-Ready, go!

1026
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:33,625
-Ready, go!
-Ready, go!

1027
00:59:35,166 --> 00:59:36,708
-Ready, go!
-Ready, go!

1028
00:59:37,708 --> 00:59:38,958
-Ready, go!
-Ready, go!

1029
00:59:41,958 --> 00:59:43,541
We did it!

1030
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:47,666
-Mr. Takaichi!
-Watch out!

1031
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,583
Careful! This way!

1032
00:59:49,666 --> 00:59:51,166
-Mr. Conductor!
-Hurry this way!

1033
00:59:51,958 --> 00:59:53,375
Uncoupling confirmed.

1034
00:59:53,458 --> 00:59:55,250
Car 9's speed is decreasing.

1035
00:59:55,333 --> 00:59:57,791
-Jump!
-Mr. Takaichi, hurry!

1036
00:59:58,791 --> 01:00:00,875
-Got him!
-Thank goodness.

1037
01:00:25,583 --> 01:00:27,583
-What about power?
-Transmission normal!

1038
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:29,583
As I suspected, there was another bomb.

1039
01:00:29,666 --> 01:00:30,875
Call the stock center.

1040
01:00:30,958 --> 01:00:32,416
Release the rescue train!

1041
01:00:32,916 --> 01:00:35,625
This is the transport dispatcher.
Release 9014B.

1042
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:38,333
ATC disabled. Check.

1043
01:00:38,916 --> 01:00:40,125
Reverser set to back.

1044

Heading toward Tokyo.
Lead car increasing speed.

1048
01:00:56,791 --> 01:00:58,166
Wind pressure is fine.

1049
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:00,000
-Continue, as is.
-Roger.

1050
01:01:00,083 --> 01:01:01,541
To all rescue train staff.

1051
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:03,541
Stay calm and don't try the impossible.

1052
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:05,083
Understood.

1053
01:01:05,791 --> 01:01:08,250
This is Mukai.
I'm taking over transmission.

1054
01:01:08,333 --> 01:01:09,416
Roger that.

1055
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:14,375
The rescue train
will soon enter the main line.

1056
01:01:17,041 --> 01:01:19,041
5060B is running on the main line.

1057
01:01:20,041 --> 01:01:21,500
5060B is visible.

1058
01:01:21,583 --> 01:01:22,791
We're catching up.

1059
01:01:23,291 --> 01:01:26,791
Approach 5060B
after passing Sendai Station.

1060
01:01:29,125 --> 01:01:33,208
I'm reporting live from the roof
of a building near Sendai Station.

1061
01:01:33,291 --> 01:01:35,000
The Tohoku-Shinkansen lines are--

1062
01:01:35,083 --> 01:01:35,916
Hey, there it is.

1063
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,666
It's here. We've caught sight
of Hayabusa No. 60.

1064
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,416
It's Hayabusa No. 60!

1065
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:44,375
It continues running over 100 km/h
with a bomb onboard.

1066
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:45,708
And that's…

1067
01:01:45,791 --> 01:01:49,000
Another bullet train
is approaching on the same track!

1068
01:01:49,083 --> 01:01:50,916
It has no lead car.

1069
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,875
It appears to be moving faster.

1070
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:55,166
It's approaching Hayabusa No. 60!

1071
01:01:56,458 --> 01:01:58,750
5060B has passed through the Shiga Tunnel.

1072
01:01:58,833 --> 01:02:00,416
This is 5060B.

1073
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,541
Our speed is fixed at 120 km/h.

1074
01:02:02,625 --> 01:02:04,708
The rescue train is running at 130 km/h.

1075
01:02:04,791 --> 01:02:05,625
I'll slow down.

1076
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:17,416
The distance is about 60 meters.

1077
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:19,583
Fifty.

1078
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:21,333
Forty.

1079
01:02:23,458 --> 01:02:24,291
Thirty.

1080
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,791
Twenty-five.

1081
01:02:29,458 --> 01:02:32,166
The rescue train has now
slowed to 121 km/h.

1082
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:35,000
We'll begin preparing for coupling.

1083
01:02:35,083 --> 01:02:36,708
The pipes are ready!

1084
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:40,125
The gangway footplate is unlocked!
Everyone, get ready!

1085
01:02:40,625 --> 01:02:43,083
Begin detailed measurements.
Watch the winds!

1086
01:02:46,958 --> 01:02:47,916
Shield off!

1087
01:02:48,416 --> 01:02:49,458
I'm going out!

1088
01:02:51,041 --> 01:02:52,291
Hold it down!

1089
01:02:52,875 --> 01:02:53,708
I'll help!

1090
01:02:53,791 --> 01:02:54,791
Help him!

1091
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:56,375
TOTSUKA, STOCK CENTER DEPUTY HEAD

1092
01:03:03,875 --> 01:03:05,458
Ten meters more!

1093
01:03:06,416 --> 01:03:07,250
Eight!

1094
01:03:07,833 --> 01:03:09,000
Seven!

1095
01:03:10,166 --> 01:03:11,041
Six!

1096
01:03:11,541 --> 01:03:13,958
-Five!
-Lift the footplate!

1097
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:15,625
-Four!
-Come on!

1098
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:16,666
-Three!
-Take it slow!

1099
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:17,708
Gently!

1100
01:03:17,791 --> 01:03:19,416
-Decelerate!
-Hold it tight!

1101
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:20,416
-Don't let go!
-Two!

1102
01:03:21,125 --> 01:03:22,625
Lower the speed!

1103
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:24,166
One!

1104
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:25,666
-Okay!
-We've got it!

1105
01:03:28,541 --> 01:03:29,375
Zero!

1106
01:03:30,916 --> 01:03:31,791
Okay!

1107
01:03:32,666 --> 01:03:34,625
-Connection confirmed!
-Roger!

1108
01:03:34,708 --> 01:03:36,000
Prepare the handrail!

1109
01:03:36,625 --> 01:03:37,708
Begin rescue!

1110
01:03:37,791 --> 01:03:39,041
-Roger!
-Roger!

1111
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:44,916
Rescue train 9014B
has stabilized its distance from 5060B

1112
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:46,708
at zero.

1113
01:03:49,708 --> 01:03:51,750
You've done an incredible job!

1114
01:03:53,833 --> 01:03:55,833
We're just getting started! Let's go!

1115
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:57,333
Right!

1116
01:03:57,416 --> 01:03:58,500
Hooks first!

1117
01:03:58,583 --> 01:04:00,250
-Careful!
-Here's a hook.

1118
01:04:00,333 --> 01:04:01,833
-Take this!
-Here's a hook.

1119
01:04:01,916 --> 01:04:03,416
-Here!
-Got it!

1120
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,250
-Pass it on.
-Received.

1121
01:04:05,833 --> 01:04:07,583
-Keep them coming!
-Thank you!

1122
01:04:07,666 --> 01:04:09,708
-Pass it on.
-Tie it there, please!

1123
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:11,333
Next are the pipes!

1124
01:04:11,416 --> 01:04:12,375
Insert them in there!

1125
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:13,833
I'll secure it.

1126
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:15,208
Okay, this one's set!

1127
01:04:15,708 --> 01:04:17,208
-Let's do it!
-Yes, sir!

1128
01:04:17,291 --> 01:04:18,916
Excuse me. Coming through.

1129
01:04:19,583 --> 01:04:20,416
Excuse me!

1130
01:04:20,958 --> 01:04:21,958
We're ready!

1131
01:04:22,041 --> 01:04:24,375
Everyone, stay calm and move this way!

1132
01:04:25,125 --> 01:04:27,625
Okay! Please go slowly, everyone!

1133
01:04:27,708 --> 01:04:29,833
Hold on to the ropes, please!

1134
01:04:32,333 --> 01:04:33,333
Watch your step.

1135
01:04:33,416 --> 01:04:35,958
-Make sure to hold the rope!
-Take it slow.

1136
01:04:36,041 --> 01:04:38,125
Come here, sweetie. Good girl.

1137
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,333
We'll guide you
to the rescue car one by one!

1138
01:04:40,416 --> 01:04:42,125
-Please don't rush.
-Let me through!

1139
01:04:42,708 --> 01:04:44,916
-Please grasp the rope!
-Stay calm!

1140
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:45,958
-It's okay!
-Wait!

1141
01:04:46,041 --> 01:04:47,416
-What are you--
-I'm scared!

1142
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:49,125
-Don't leave me!
-Let go!

1143
01:04:49,208 --> 01:04:50,375
-Wait!
-You're hurting me!

1144
01:04:50,458 --> 01:04:51,291
Stay calm!

1145
01:04:51,375 --> 01:04:53,500
Don't rush! Take it slow!

1146
01:04:53,583 --> 01:04:54,625
Don't look down.

1147
01:04:54,708 --> 01:04:56,208
I can't. I don't wanna die!

1148
01:04:56,291 --> 01:04:57,250
-Go!
-Watch out, Aoi!

1149
01:04:57,333 --> 01:04:59,375
-Takei, now's not the time!
-Keep moving!

1150
01:05:00,208 --> 01:05:02,083
-Don't look down!
-Please keep going!

1151
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:04,166
Good! Come this way!

1152
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:06,083
Okay! Take it slow!

1153
01:05:06,166 --> 01:05:09,458
-Please grab the rope tightly!
-Just like that. There!

1154
01:05:17,041 --> 01:05:19,500
More than 200 passengers
have changed trains!

1155
01:05:21,291 --> 01:05:23,083
Please, let this go smoothly.

1156
01:05:26,083 --> 01:05:29,125
This is a special train
on the Tohoku-Shinkansen line.

1157
01:05:29,208 --> 01:05:32,083
I guess this site is useless now.

1158
01:05:32,166 --> 01:05:34,583
After uncoupling, his train will…

1159
01:05:34,666 --> 01:05:38,208
But then, it was more useful
than politics, wasn't it?

1160
01:05:38,708 --> 01:05:40,708
Please move as far forward as possible.

1161
01:05:40,791 --> 01:05:41,625
Ms. Kagami.

1162
01:05:42,625 --> 01:05:44,625
Chief Cabinet Secretary Suwa sent praise.

1163
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:46,541
I think you received it too.

1164
01:05:46,625 --> 01:05:47,583
-Let me see.
-Sure.

1165
01:05:48,791 --> 01:05:50,541
"I'm glad you're safe."

1166
01:05:50,625 --> 01:05:55,458
"Your being on the train has helped
keep down political criticism."

1167
01:05:56,208 --> 01:05:57,708
This is good news, ma'am.

1168
01:05:58,791 --> 01:06:00,000
That old weasel.

1169
01:06:03,791 --> 01:06:04,708
Excuse me!

1170
01:06:05,208 --> 01:06:06,791
Excuse me! Please make way!

1171
01:06:07,291 --> 01:06:08,166
Is he okay?

1172
01:06:08,666 --> 01:06:09,666
What happened?

1173
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:11,708
The helicopter man did it.

1174
01:06:11,791 --> 01:06:14,000
We tried to help him cross
and he went crazy.

1175
01:06:14,083 --> 01:06:16,791
-He struck him with a golf club!
-Could you not do that?

1176
01:06:16,875 --> 01:06:18,708
-Whoa!
-Calm down, please!

1177
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:22,541
Please stop!

1178
01:06:23,583 --> 01:06:25,166
Sir, calm down!

1179
01:06:26,291 --> 01:06:27,416
I want to die, damn it!

1180
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:28,833
This is my chance!

1181
01:06:28,916 --> 01:06:30,166
Just let me die!

1182
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:31,208
Ms. Ichikawa!

1183
01:06:31,291 --> 01:06:32,916
-What?
-Yuzuki is missing.

1184
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Missing?

1185
01:06:34,083 --> 01:06:34,916
Since when?

1186
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:37,250
I don't know.

1187
01:06:37,875 --> 01:06:40,416
I'll go find her. You all stay here.

1188
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,166
-Okay.
-Stay seated!

1189
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:43,333
Yuzuki!

1190
01:06:44,416 --> 01:06:46,416
Onodera… Don't tell me her heart…

1191
01:06:48,583 --> 01:06:49,416
Ms. Kagami!

1192
01:06:49,916 --> 01:06:50,750
Ma'am!

1193
01:06:50,833 --> 01:06:52,375
The sugar mama went too!

1194
01:06:52,458 --> 01:06:53,583
That's a surprise.

1195
01:06:53,666 --> 01:06:55,250
She has more guts than I thought.

1196
01:06:55,333 --> 01:06:56,833
I misjudged her.

1197
01:06:56,916 --> 01:06:57,916
Yeah, me too.

1198
01:06:59,041 --> 01:07:01,458
Oh! You too, Mr. Todoroki?

1199
01:07:01,541 --> 01:07:02,375
What?

1200
01:07:02,458 --> 01:07:04,083
All passengers will soon be…

1201
01:07:04,166 --> 01:07:05,750
-You don't disappoint.
-What?

1202
01:07:05,833 --> 01:07:06,916
You're a brave man!

1203
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:07,833
Huh?

1204
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:09,625
Wait a minute.

1205
01:07:09,708 --> 01:07:12,041
Once we have final confirmation…

1206
01:07:12,125 --> 01:07:14,125
-I'll follow your account.
-Off you go!

1207
01:07:14,625 --> 01:07:16,625
-A real man of action.
-What a guy.

1208
01:07:18,583 --> 01:07:19,416
Good luck!

1209
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:21,250
Excuse me!

1210
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:23,083
-I need to--
-Whoa! Get back inside!

1211
01:07:23,166 --> 01:07:25,041
-We're about to--
-My student is in there!

1212
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:27,375
Come back! It's too dangerous!

1213
01:07:27,458 --> 01:07:29,833
Hey! Are you listening?
I said it's dangerous!

1214
01:07:29,916 --> 01:07:32,000
Just let me die! Please!

1215
01:07:33,083 --> 01:07:33,958
Let go!

1216
01:07:34,958 --> 01:07:37,041
Their grieving families told me so!

1217
01:07:37,125 --> 01:07:40,083
-Calm down!
-"At least die without being a burden!"

1218
01:07:40,583 --> 01:07:41,583
Let me go!

1219
01:07:42,541 --> 01:07:43,708
Stop it now!

1220
01:07:46,208 --> 01:07:47,375
I said stop!

1221
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:50,166
You should learn to give up!

1222
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:52,250
Shut up, you hag!

1223
01:07:52,875 --> 01:07:53,750
In the first place,

1224
01:07:53,833 --> 01:07:56,791
if you politicians
hadn't deregulated the tourism industry,

1225
01:07:56,875 --> 01:07:59,666
that accident would never have happened!

1226
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:02,583
You can't blame everything on politics!

1227
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:05,833
Instead of moaning and groaning
about wanting to die,

1228
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:08,541
why don't you go out like a man?!

1229
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:17,291
Besides,

1230
01:08:18,958 --> 01:08:20,500
you can still start over.

1231
01:08:23,041 --> 01:08:25,291
I know how fickle the world can be.

1232
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,500
All too well.

1233
01:08:29,291 --> 01:08:32,583
No matter how bad the scandal,
people will soon forget.

1234
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:34,500
After all,

1235
01:08:35,583 --> 01:08:38,041
they even voted for me again.

1236
01:09:00,875 --> 01:09:01,791
Sixteen!

1237
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:03,375
We're losing speed!

1238
01:09:03,958 --> 01:09:06,041
-Is it the ATC?
-No, it's deactivated!

1239
01:09:06,125 --> 01:09:07,291
It's 9014B.

1240
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:09,708
Their emergency brake has activated.

1241
01:09:14,666 --> 01:09:16,416
Excuse me, please.

1242
01:09:17,958 --> 01:09:18,791
Ma'am!

1243
01:09:19,291 --> 01:09:20,875
One of my students is missing!

1244
01:09:21,375 --> 01:09:23,625
-Get everyone to the rescue train.
-Yes, sir!

1245
01:09:25,708 --> 01:09:27,041
I'm going to stand you up.

1246
01:09:28,041 --> 01:09:29,500
Hey, someone help.

1247
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:33,291
-Thank you!
-Sure.

1248
01:09:33,375 --> 01:09:35,333
-Careful.
-Everyone, this way!

1249
01:09:35,875 --> 01:09:37,250
-Ms. Kagami, let's go.
-Right.

1250
01:09:38,291 --> 01:09:40,708
Hey! What are you doing here?

1251
01:09:41,333 --> 01:09:42,375
Going with the flow?

1252
01:09:42,458 --> 01:09:44,208
-What?
-Ma'am, let's go. Hurry.

1253
01:09:44,291 --> 01:09:45,958
-Right.
-Just going with the flow.

1254
01:09:46,958 --> 01:09:49,291
Can't you disable the brakes?

1255
01:09:51,416 --> 01:09:52,250
It's no use!

1256
01:09:55,416 --> 01:09:56,500
Are you kidding me?

1257
01:09:58,791 --> 01:10:01,333
-Oh, no!
-Uncouple the car now!

1258
01:10:02,833 --> 01:10:04,791
-Can you…
-Can you get it off?

1259
01:10:06,458 --> 01:10:07,666
-Ow!
-Are you okay?

1260
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:09,083
Careful! Be careful, sir!

1261
01:10:09,166 --> 01:10:12,125
The bridge wires are entangled!
We can't uncouple!

1262
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,291
Almost there. Just a little further!

1263
01:10:22,791 --> 01:10:24,041
What the hell?

1264
01:10:25,125 --> 01:10:26,625
Why? What happened?

1265
01:10:28,125 --> 01:10:30,000
It's too dangerous! Get back!

1266
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,500
The bridge can't be used! Get back inside!

1267
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:35,916
Don't try! You could die!

1268
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:37,541
Stand back!

1269
01:10:37,625 --> 01:10:40,041
Mr. Totsuka, you're in danger!
Get out of there!

1270
01:10:40,125 --> 01:10:42,375
At this rate,
both trains will suffer the blast!

1271
01:10:42,458 --> 01:10:44,875
What about the evacuees?

1272
01:10:55,083 --> 01:10:56,958
-Get back! You'll be hit!
-Whoa!

1273
01:11:07,083 --> 01:11:09,625
-This way! Bring him here!
-Hurry!

1274
01:11:16,166 --> 01:11:17,250
Are you okay?

1275
01:11:17,333 --> 01:11:18,166
I'm sorry.

1276
01:11:18,666 --> 01:11:20,375
Was that the bomb?

1277
01:11:20,458 --> 01:11:23,166
No. If it were, we'd have derailed.

1278
01:11:28,166 --> 01:11:29,000
TSUTOMU ONODERA

1279
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:30,750
Onodera!

1280
01:11:32,625 --> 01:11:34,000
Where have you been?

1281
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,041
Everyone's already evacuated!

1282
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,250
-Let's move to the rear car for now.
-Okay.

1283
01:11:50,291 --> 01:11:51,458
-Here.
-Thanks.

1284
01:11:57,166 --> 01:11:58,000
Fujii…

1285
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:18,583
It can't be!

1286
01:12:43,416 --> 01:12:45,666
SHIROISHI-ZAO

1287
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:47,916
5060B has regained a speed of 120 km/h.

1288
01:12:49,166 --> 01:12:51,291
The rescue train is running without issue.

1289
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:59,291
We've received word from 9014B

1290
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:02,208
that a total of 340 people
were safely rescued,

1291
01:13:02,291 --> 01:13:05,208
including 339 passengers
and one crew member.

1292
01:13:05,291 --> 01:13:09,333
There were nine people left behind.
Six passengers and three crew members.

1293
01:13:09,416 --> 01:13:11,583
All right!

1294
01:13:12,541 --> 01:13:13,666
We did it!

1295
01:13:14,541 --> 01:13:16,458
With one more rescue operation--

1296
01:13:16,541 --> 01:13:20,916
Unfortunately, the train is built in a way
that prevents multiple circuit bypasses.

1297
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,416
Another rescue operation
of that kind is impossible.

1298
01:13:29,708 --> 01:13:31,250
Isn't there something you can do?

1299
01:13:31,333 --> 01:13:32,500
Whatever the case,

1300
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:36,250
we don't have time for another operation.

1301
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:42,000
What are the estimates
if the bomb explodes in an urban area?

1302
01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:46,125
Assuming that an explosion that big
happens in every car,

1303
01:13:46,791 --> 01:13:47,916
the worst case scenario

1304
01:13:48,416 --> 01:13:51,291
would see all train cars derail
and break the noise barriers.

1305
01:13:52,791 --> 01:13:55,041
The damage would be tremendous.

1306
01:13:56,791 --> 01:13:58,291
If that happens at Tokyo Station,

1307
01:13:58,375 --> 01:14:00,625
the seat of government
could be compromised.

1308
01:14:11,166 --> 01:14:15,208
SHIROISHI-ZAO STATION

1309
01:14:17,708 --> 01:14:20,791
286 KM TO TOKYO

1310
01:14:35,875 --> 01:14:38,125
Hey, what are we gonna do now?

1311
01:14:38,208 --> 01:14:39,875
Isn't there another plan?

1312
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:41,750
None on our end.

1313
01:14:44,625 --> 01:14:46,416
Has the perpetrator made contact?

1314
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,625
The last call was two hours ago.

1315
01:14:53,541 --> 01:14:55,750
Your fund's not doing so well either.

1316
01:14:55,833 --> 01:14:58,083
HAYABUSA NO. 60 BOMB FUND

1317
01:14:58,166 --> 01:14:59,833
It's not like it's my fault!

1318
01:15:00,333 --> 01:15:02,625
There are only nine of us left.

1319
01:15:02,708 --> 01:15:05,250
The ransom no longer has value.

1320
01:15:07,458 --> 01:15:10,875
What happens if nothing else can be done?

1321
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:15,958
As far as the government is concerned,

1322
01:15:16,458 --> 01:15:18,250
if no solution can be found,

1323
01:15:18,333 --> 01:15:21,166
they won't stand by
and let us reach Tokyo.

1324
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:22,291
I'm certain of that.

1325
01:15:22,791 --> 01:15:23,625
What?

1326
01:15:25,458 --> 01:15:29,916
If No. 60 blows up at Tokyo Station,
the damage would be immeasurable.

1327
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,166
M-Ma'am, are you saying

1328
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:35,916
that they'll force us to stop
before we reach Tokyo Station?

1329
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,791
Well, I'm sure something
can still be done!

1330
01:15:40,291 --> 01:15:43,416
If we all raise our synergy…

1331
01:15:43,916 --> 01:15:44,750
Right?

1332
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:47,500
Synergy? Give me a break.

1333
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,458
What?

1334
01:15:49,125 --> 01:15:50,250
-Excuse me…
-Ma'am!

1335
01:15:50,333 --> 01:15:52,375
Can they really do that?

1336
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,500
Force us to stop, I mean.

1337
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:56,833
Is that…

1338
01:15:58,291 --> 01:15:59,250
Mr. Takaichi.

1339
01:16:01,541 --> 01:16:03,750
Technically, it's possible.

1340
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:06,250
But don't worry.

1341
01:16:06,333 --> 01:16:07,541
We won't let that…

1342
01:16:08,708 --> 01:16:11,208
Excuse me, I'm going to call my father.

1343
01:16:26,458 --> 01:16:28,958
We can't let a child die, can we?

1344
01:16:29,041 --> 01:16:31,625
They could at least let us
pass through Tokyo.

1345
01:16:31,708 --> 01:16:33,791
What are you talking about?

1346
01:16:33,875 --> 01:16:35,833
The train stops at the last station.

1347
01:16:35,916 --> 01:16:37,125
It's the end of the line.

1348
01:16:37,666 --> 01:16:38,500
Yeah.

1349
01:16:43,416 --> 01:16:45,041
TOKYO STATION

1350
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:51,875
CONNECTING YOU TO TOWNS AND PEOPLE

1351
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:54,125
We can connect them.

1352
01:16:57,625 --> 01:17:01,166
KUNIMI TOWN, FUKUSHIMA PREFECTURE
269 KM TO TOKYO

1353
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:03,208
We have two and a half hours left.

1354
01:17:03,291 --> 01:17:04,375
If prospects are low,

1355
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:09,291
are you saying you'll resort to
the alternative before they reach Tokyo?

1356
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:10,625
The alternative?

1357
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,750
Don't tell me you intend to stop 5060B?

1358
01:17:19,166 --> 01:17:22,875
Passengers and our co-workers
are still onboard!

1359
01:17:22,958 --> 01:17:24,583
I understand how you feel.

1360
01:17:25,125 --> 01:17:28,583
However, the lives of millions of
our citizens depend on the bullet train.

1361
01:17:28,666 --> 01:17:31,666
You act before the worst happens.
That's what it means to govern!

1362
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:33,500
Do their lives mean nothing to you?!

1363
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:38,083
What good is government
if it abandons lives in peril!

1364
01:17:38,166 --> 01:17:40,333
-Stop!
-You think I like this?

1365
01:17:40,416 --> 01:17:41,458
I said stop!

1366
01:17:41,541 --> 01:17:42,375
Calm down!

1367
01:17:43,333 --> 01:17:44,416
This is Transport Dis--

1368
01:17:45,083 --> 01:17:46,083
General Commander.

1369
01:17:47,666 --> 01:17:49,708
It's the conductor of 5060B.

1370
01:17:54,458 --> 01:17:55,375
This is Kasagi.

1371
01:17:57,458 --> 01:17:58,291
What?

1372
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:05,333
TOKYO STATION

1373
01:18:05,416 --> 01:18:08,583
Connect Hayabusa No. 60
directly to the Tokaido Shinkansen line?

1374
01:18:08,666 --> 01:18:11,125
Aren't the rails connected already?

1375
01:18:11,208 --> 01:18:14,625
At Tokyo Station, the tracks for
the Tohoku and Tokaido Shinkansen lines

1376
01:18:14,708 --> 01:18:16,416
are only five meters apart.

1377
01:18:17,625 --> 01:18:19,125
If we connect them quickly,

1378
01:18:19,208 --> 01:18:22,208
we can keep 5060B running
to Kagoshima-Chuo Station.

1379
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:29,333
If we start now, we can make it.

1380
01:18:29,958 --> 01:18:31,500
We need the government's approval!

1381
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:34,333
Two and a half hours?

1382
01:18:34,416 --> 01:18:35,583
Mr. Sasaki!

1383
01:18:36,458 --> 01:18:37,750
Please let us do it!

1384
01:18:50,333 --> 01:18:51,875
Make sure you finish in time.

1385
01:18:52,583 --> 01:18:54,125
I'll handle the permission.

1386
01:18:54,208 --> 01:18:55,041
Thank you!

1387
01:18:56,958 --> 01:19:00,250
Find out if we can dispatch
E7 rescue trains.

1388
01:19:00,333 --> 01:19:02,708
-Send maintenance vehicles.
-Call the stock center!

1389
01:19:02,791 --> 01:19:04,791
And the Omiya Tech Center!

1390
01:19:04,875 --> 01:19:06,416
We'll need to coordinate!

1391
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:09,666
We've received an update.

1392
01:19:10,666 --> 01:19:14,458
Cars 9 and 10 that exploded near Miyagi

1393
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:17,541
had no passengers or crew on board.

1394
01:19:18,208 --> 01:19:20,958
No injuries have been confirmed

1395
01:19:21,041 --> 01:19:23,041
to any passengers or crew.

1396
01:19:24,125 --> 01:19:25,041
I repeat.

1397
01:19:25,916 --> 01:19:28,541
Cars 9 and 10, which were disconnected,

1398
01:19:28,625 --> 01:19:31,375
had no one on board.

1399
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,875
-No injuries are reported to any…
-Yuzuki?

1400
01:19:34,958 --> 01:19:36,916
How many times do I have to call?

1401
01:19:38,416 --> 01:19:41,083
I apologize, Father.

1402
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:45,333
Are you onboard No. 60?

1403
01:19:46,833 --> 01:19:47,666
Yes.

1404
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:49,250
I am.

1405
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:50,583
I knew it.

1406
01:19:51,833 --> 01:19:54,083
What about injuries? Are you okay?

1407
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:57,500
Yeah, I'm okay.

1408
01:19:58,500 --> 01:19:59,333
What?

1409
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:03,958
Speak properly.

1410
01:20:04,458 --> 01:20:06,833
"Yes, Father. I am uninjured."

1411
01:20:07,625 --> 01:20:08,458
Am I wrong?

1412
01:20:11,333 --> 01:20:13,833
Yes, Father. I am uninjured.

1413
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:18,583
Yuzuki.

1414
01:20:21,541 --> 01:20:23,000
I know what this is.

1415
01:20:24,291 --> 01:20:25,541
It's revenge.

1416
01:20:26,583 --> 01:20:29,708
The culprits who got away
on that day have regrouped,

1417
01:20:30,291 --> 01:20:32,125
and I'm the target of their revenge.

1418
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:34,375
Damn it.

1419
01:20:34,875 --> 01:20:36,125
Those bastards.

1420
01:20:36,625 --> 01:20:40,125
I'll hunt and kill them all
with my bare hands!

1421
01:20:44,791 --> 01:20:46,208
Fat chance of that.

1422
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:48,083
What?

1423
01:20:48,833 --> 01:20:49,666
What did you say?

1424
01:20:53,625 --> 01:20:54,750
You heard me.

1425
01:20:55,833 --> 01:20:56,666
Fat chance.

1426
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:00,791
You're not hunting or killing anyone.

1427
01:21:01,916 --> 01:21:03,333
Not a chance in hell.

1428
01:21:04,958 --> 01:21:06,625
Did I hear you right?

1429
01:21:07,583 --> 01:21:10,208
Who do you think you're talking to?
I'm your father!

1430
01:21:10,291 --> 01:21:12,541
You can't lay a finger on the culprit.

1431
01:21:13,958 --> 01:21:15,416
After all, the culprit…

1432
01:21:17,125 --> 01:21:18,250
is me.

1433
01:21:20,416 --> 01:21:21,250
What?

1434
01:21:26,916 --> 01:21:29,458
The one who planted
the bombs on the bullet train

1435
01:21:31,166 --> 01:21:32,166
was me.

1436
01:21:36,791 --> 01:21:40,875
I've listened to your bullshit story
of killing the culprit for years on end.

1437
01:21:40,958 --> 01:21:43,250
It's a wonder I didn't blow my brains out!

1438
01:21:43,333 --> 01:21:45,583
But I decided to plant a bomb instead.

1439
01:21:46,125 --> 01:21:47,750
Besides, I know everything.

1440
01:21:47,833 --> 01:21:49,666
The culprit blew himself up.

1441
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:51,291
You didn't kill anyone.

1442
01:21:52,458 --> 01:21:54,625
Rather than surrender to the cops,

1443
01:21:55,625 --> 01:21:57,458
he had the guts to die.

1444
01:21:58,916 --> 01:22:00,708
That's more than I can say for you.

1445
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,375
Say that again.

1446
01:22:05,833 --> 01:22:07,125
I dare you to!

1447
01:22:07,208 --> 01:22:08,625
Now you've done it.

1448
01:22:08,708 --> 01:22:11,000
You place Koga above me?

1449
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,000
You've gotta be kidding.

1450
01:22:13,708 --> 01:22:15,291
Well, I ain't laughing!

1451
01:22:16,125 --> 01:22:18,416
I will never allow that from you.

1452
01:22:19,375 --> 01:22:22,291
How would a little girl
like you make a bomb, huh?

1453
01:22:23,291 --> 01:22:24,708
Enough jokes.

1454
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:27,666
It's no joke.

1455
01:22:29,666 --> 01:22:31,083
If you don't believe me,

1456
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:32,958
look behind you.

1457
01:22:53,958 --> 01:22:55,708
What is this supposed to be?

1458
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:14,666
Onodera.

1459
01:24:25,041 --> 01:24:25,875
Line one!

1460
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:28,958
Line one, please.

1461
01:24:32,791 --> 01:24:33,875
This is Yoshimura.

1462
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:37,083
I'll tell you how to defuse the bombs.

1463
01:24:44,541 --> 01:24:46,166
And who are you?

1464
01:24:46,791 --> 01:24:48,333
Yuzuki Onodera.

1465
01:24:49,541 --> 01:24:52,166
I planted the bombs on the bullet train.

1466
01:24:55,625 --> 01:24:56,875
For real?

1467
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,041
Yuzuki Onodera?

1468
01:25:05,208 --> 01:25:07,291
Are you aboard Hayabusa No. 60?

1469
01:25:08,375 --> 01:25:09,208
Yes.

1470
01:25:10,125 --> 01:25:12,166
It's really you who did it?

1471
01:25:13,333 --> 01:25:16,333
Why would you plant bombs
on a train when you're aboard?

1472
01:25:19,416 --> 01:25:21,583
I just killed my father.

1473
01:25:22,208 --> 01:25:24,041
With the same type of bomb.

1474
01:25:25,708 --> 01:25:26,875
What are you after?

1475
01:25:27,375 --> 01:25:28,666
It can't be the money.

1476
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:31,041
I've already gotten what I'm after.

1477
01:25:31,875 --> 01:25:35,291
My father is gone,
and I've seen what I wanted to see.

1478
01:25:35,958 --> 01:25:37,958
So now I'll tell you
how to defuse the bombs.

1479
01:25:38,916 --> 01:25:39,791
Fine.

1480
01:25:39,875 --> 01:25:41,000
What do we do?

1481
01:25:43,166 --> 01:25:45,083
To defuse the bombs…

1482
01:25:52,083 --> 01:25:54,208
you must kill me.

1483
01:26:01,625 --> 01:26:03,375
Inside my body,

1484
01:26:03,458 --> 01:26:07,708
there's a device that monitors my heart
in case of side effects from my condition.

1485
01:26:08,583 --> 01:26:11,583
If I die, the monitor
will cease detecting my heartbeat

1486
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:14,125
and an app on my smartphone

1487
01:26:14,625 --> 01:26:17,708
will emit a signal that defuses the bomb.

1488
01:26:19,166 --> 01:26:20,375
Can you prove that's true?

1489
01:26:24,625 --> 01:26:27,041
Hello? Hello?!

1490
01:26:28,458 --> 01:26:29,291
Damn it!

1491
01:26:31,541 --> 01:26:33,333
The Kanagawa Fire Department

1492
01:26:33,416 --> 01:26:36,666
has informed us that five minutes ago,
a bomb went off in Hadano City.

1493
01:26:36,750 --> 01:26:39,083
It matches Onodera's address.

1494
01:26:46,666 --> 01:26:47,916
It was you?

1495
01:26:50,458 --> 01:26:51,625
Is that true?

1496
01:26:52,125 --> 01:26:54,958
The bombs will be defused once you die?

1497
01:26:57,041 --> 01:26:58,625
There's only one way

1498
01:26:59,125 --> 01:27:00,958
to find out, isn't there?

1499
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:46,750
There will be many squads
coming in and out!

1500
01:27:46,833 --> 01:27:49,375
Be aware of the adjacent track
as you work!

1501
01:27:49,458 --> 01:27:50,875
Let's begin!

1502
01:27:50,958 --> 01:27:52,166
-Check right!
-Okay!

1503
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:53,416
-Check left!
-Okay!

1504
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:54,708
-Check before you!
-Okay!

1505
01:27:54,791 --> 01:27:56,250
-Be safe!
-Be safe!

1506
01:27:57,875 --> 01:27:59,375
This is the work crew.

1507
01:28:00,958 --> 01:28:01,791
I see.

1508
01:28:04,833 --> 01:28:07,583
You're sure we'll get permission?

1509
01:28:09,791 --> 01:28:10,625
Okay.

1510
01:28:11,375 --> 01:28:13,041
Understood. I'll have faith.

1511
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:15,833
Right.

1512
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,125
Get to work!

1513
01:28:21,208 --> 01:28:22,208
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

1514
01:28:22,291 --> 01:28:24,958
Okay, everyone.
Please go to your designated spots.

1515
01:28:25,041 --> 01:28:25,875
-Right!
-Right!

1516
01:28:25,958 --> 01:28:28,416
Let's go! Connect us to JR Tokai!

1517
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:29,416
How's it look?

1518
01:28:30,125 --> 01:28:32,875
Fifty centimeters
toward Shinagawa, please!

1519
01:28:32,958 --> 01:28:34,916
-You got it!
-Let's move!

1520
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,541
5060B is estimated to arrive at 9:04 p.m.

1521
01:28:39,333 --> 01:28:41,375
Let's set the course!

1522
01:28:41,458 --> 01:28:43,375
A little this way, please!

1523
01:28:46,125 --> 01:28:48,250
The handcar is coming. Watch behind you!

1524
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,291
Please take that to the Shinagawa side.

1525
01:28:51,875 --> 01:28:52,958
Watch your step!

1526
01:28:54,125 --> 01:28:56,083
Anyone who's free, head over that way.

1527
01:28:56,750 --> 01:28:58,833
Sending the Tokai facility crew.

1528
01:28:59,333 --> 01:29:01,500
Please bring all info from HQ here.

1529
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:09,000
-One, two…
-Three!

1530
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:34,791
They've begun work
to extend the track at Tokyo Station.

1531
01:29:35,333 --> 01:29:38,458
Can they really do it
in such a short time?

1532
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:40,666
I don't know.

1533
01:29:41,166 --> 01:29:43,333
We just have to place faith in the crew.

1534
01:29:44,666 --> 01:29:48,458
And if this plan fails,
what happens to us?

1535
01:30:05,791 --> 01:30:08,500
Shall I… be the one?

1536
01:30:16,041 --> 01:30:18,250
It won't make
much of a difference if I do it.

1537
01:30:19,333 --> 01:30:20,250
I mean…

1538
01:30:21,708 --> 01:30:23,958
Oh… right!

1539
01:30:24,541 --> 01:30:25,791
You've got a point.

1540
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:27,916
You do it!

1541
01:30:28,416 --> 01:30:30,208
If it saves the eight of us,

1542
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:33,583
you can offset the deaths
from the helicopter crash.

1543
01:30:33,666 --> 01:30:34,625
Right?

1544
01:30:34,708 --> 01:30:35,708
Offset?

1545
01:30:36,458 --> 01:30:37,458
What do you mean?

1546
01:30:37,541 --> 01:30:38,375
Well, you know.

1547
01:30:38,458 --> 01:30:40,666
His missile helicopter killed eight.

1548
01:30:41,166 --> 01:30:42,208
It evens out.

1549
01:30:43,208 --> 01:30:45,000
Yeah… Yeah.

1550
01:30:47,041 --> 01:30:48,125
You make me sick.

1551
01:30:48,625 --> 01:30:49,458
What?

1552
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:55,166
I said you make me sick.
Who do you think you are?

1553
01:30:55,250 --> 01:30:57,333
Whoa, slow down.

1554
01:30:57,958 --> 01:31:01,125
Making tough calls at times like this

1555
01:31:01,208 --> 01:31:03,458
is your job as a politician, right?

1556
01:31:03,541 --> 01:31:06,000
I've heard enough about politics from you!

1557
01:31:06,541 --> 01:31:07,875
Let me tell you something!

1558
01:31:07,958 --> 01:31:10,291
-The job of a politician…
-Let go!

1559
01:31:10,375 --> 01:31:13,958
It's to stand for what's right
and make the world a better place!

1560
01:31:14,041 --> 01:31:15,291
-Hayashi, stop!
-Let me go!

1561
01:31:15,375 --> 01:31:16,958
-Stop it!
-Hayashi!

1562
01:31:17,041 --> 01:31:19,750
-You little shrimp!
-Calm down!

1563
01:31:19,833 --> 01:31:21,625
What the hell do you know?

1564
01:31:22,416 --> 01:31:23,833
Shame on you!

1565
01:31:23,916 --> 01:31:25,458
-Stop it now!
-Calm down!

1566
01:31:25,541 --> 01:31:27,541
-Everyone, please!
-Stop!

1567
01:31:27,625 --> 01:31:28,791
You old fart!

1568
01:31:28,875 --> 01:31:30,500
-Stop!
-Pipsqueak!

1569
01:31:30,583 --> 01:31:31,833
Please calm down!

1570
01:31:31,916 --> 01:31:33,375
-Come and get it!
-Hayashi, stop!

1571
01:31:33,458 --> 01:31:34,708
Shame on you!

1572
01:31:34,791 --> 01:31:36,916
-Shut up, already!
-Stop!

1573
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,875
Yuzuki Onodera's mother
died nine years ago from illness.

1574
01:31:39,958 --> 01:31:41,458
According to neighbors,

1575
01:31:41,541 --> 01:31:45,333
they began hearing regular shouting
from her house around that time.

1576
01:31:45,416 --> 01:31:47,166
About Tsutomu Onodera…

1577
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:49,333
During the 109 case,

1578
01:31:49,958 --> 01:31:53,666
he was part of the police force sent
to apprehend one of the bombers.

1579
01:31:54,833 --> 01:31:57,833
The bomber blew himself up
on the spot with an explosive,

1580
01:31:57,916 --> 01:32:01,500
and the higher-ups wanted
to avoid responsibility.

1581
01:32:01,583 --> 01:32:02,916
They made Onodera a hero

1582
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,333
by creating the myth
that he shot the bomber in self-defense.

1583
01:32:07,583 --> 01:32:10,083
But before long,

1584
01:32:10,166 --> 01:32:12,750
Onodera started to brag
as if the story were true.

1585
01:32:13,291 --> 01:32:14,291
DIED OR FLED OVERSEAS?

1586
01:32:14,375 --> 01:32:17,875
He would tell people
that the bullet train still exists

1587
01:32:17,958 --> 01:32:19,833
because of him.

1588
01:32:22,708 --> 01:32:24,916
I spoke with Yuzuki Onodera's doctor.

1589
01:32:25,625 --> 01:32:27,625
Her story about the monitor implant

1590
01:32:27,708 --> 01:32:29,375
turned out to be true.

1591
01:32:29,458 --> 01:32:32,541
The crime lab confirmed
that an app could isolate the signal

1592
01:32:32,625 --> 01:32:34,541
and sync it with a detonator.

1593
01:32:38,625 --> 01:32:42,250
The manufacture of the explosives
and planting of the detonator

1594
01:32:43,375 --> 01:32:46,500
couldn't possibly have been done
by her alone.

1595
01:32:48,916 --> 01:32:51,500
She must have an accomplice somewhere.

1596
01:33:07,041 --> 01:33:10,083
Onodera, can we talk?

1597
01:33:10,958 --> 01:33:11,791
What is it?

1598
01:33:25,708 --> 01:33:26,708
Is there anything…

1599
01:33:29,083 --> 01:33:31,041
that I can do for you?

1600
01:33:32,416 --> 01:33:34,083
Please kill me.

1601
01:33:35,458 --> 01:33:36,583
Other than that.

1602
01:33:41,666 --> 01:33:44,708
If something has been troubling you…

1603
01:33:46,166 --> 01:33:48,416
If talking would ease the pain somewhat--

1604
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:49,375
Ms. Ichikawa.

1605
01:33:52,833 --> 01:33:54,375
You knew, didn't you?

1606
01:33:54,875 --> 01:33:56,333
About my home life.

1607
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:00,916
That's why you kept an eye on me.

1608
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,916
You were always
stealing glances, weren't you?

1609
01:34:05,791 --> 01:34:08,083
Was I fitting in?

1610
01:34:08,666 --> 01:34:11,041
Was I going to cause trouble?

1611
01:34:11,708 --> 01:34:15,791
You'd check, and if you liked
what you saw, you felt so relieved.

1612
01:34:19,875 --> 01:34:21,375
Is it my fault?

1613
01:34:23,291 --> 01:34:25,625
Don't make this about you.

1614
01:34:28,583 --> 01:34:32,791
I merely grew tired of this fake
everyday life held up by obvious lies.

1615
01:34:33,875 --> 01:34:36,166
It's because I endured

1616
01:34:38,083 --> 01:34:40,166
that you all could live a normal life.

1617
01:34:42,208 --> 01:34:43,750
Doing exactly as you like.

1618
01:34:45,875 --> 01:34:46,791
And that's why…

1619
01:34:49,208 --> 01:34:50,708
I decided to destroy it.

1620
01:34:51,458 --> 01:34:52,708
That false normality.

1621
01:34:54,250 --> 01:34:57,000
How much could I pollute you all
with my poison?

1622
01:34:57,750 --> 01:35:00,875
Seeing you all cry
and squeal for your lives…

1623
01:35:00,958 --> 01:35:02,833
Your anger and hatred…

1624
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:08,833
That reality, free of lies,
is what I wanted to see.

1625
01:35:22,916 --> 01:35:24,291
And now I'm satisfied.

1626
01:35:25,625 --> 01:35:27,291
I got to see that face.

1627
01:35:41,541 --> 01:35:44,583
I've discovered what appears to be
Yuzuki Onodera's account.

1628
01:35:48,125 --> 01:35:50,000
"Signs everywhere."

1629
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,208
"It's a wonder we don't all go insane."

1630
01:35:54,875 --> 01:35:57,125
"The deafening roar that is silence."

1631
01:35:57,625 --> 01:36:00,291
"The abyss that stares back."

1632
01:36:00,791 --> 01:36:02,416
"Lies and asphalt."

1633
01:36:03,291 --> 01:36:05,083
"I want to peel them all away."

1634
01:36:05,166 --> 01:36:06,583
1 FOLLOWER, 0 FOLLOWING

1635
01:36:07,708 --> 01:36:10,708
At the moment, this is her last post.

1636
01:36:10,791 --> 01:36:12,166
I WILL DESTROY FALSE NORMALITY

1637
01:36:13,875 --> 01:36:15,708
"Destroy false normality?"

1638
01:36:16,708 --> 01:36:18,291
Look at this too.

1639
01:36:19,583 --> 01:36:20,791
ONE LIKE
FEBRUARY 8TH

1640
01:36:20,875 --> 01:36:22,375
LIKED BY KEISODO75

1641
01:36:23,125 --> 01:36:24,875
She had an ongoing conversation

1642
01:36:24,958 --> 01:36:27,000
with an account on this messaging tool.

1643
01:36:28,583 --> 01:36:31,250
It includes talk of explosives.

1644
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:33,666
YOU MAKE BOMBS ON YOUR OWN?

1645
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:35,208
I WISH I HAD THE POWER OF A BOMB

1646
01:36:35,291 --> 01:36:36,625
I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL

1647
01:36:38,416 --> 01:36:41,583
"It's an ugly world
full of lies and hypocrisy."

1648
01:36:43,250 --> 01:36:45,666
So this man reached out to her.

1649
01:36:46,916 --> 01:36:48,208
What about the account?

1650
01:36:48,291 --> 01:36:49,125
We traced it.

1651
01:36:50,583 --> 01:36:54,000
It belongs to a 50-year-old man
in Saitama Prefecture.

1652
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:57,500
He works as a blasting expert
at Daiei Industry Co.

1653
01:36:57,583 --> 01:37:00,000
ACCOMPLICE "MASARU KOGA" SHOT TO DEATH

1654
01:37:11,833 --> 01:37:14,750
DAIEI INDUSTRY CO.

1655
01:37:14,833 --> 01:37:18,833
Hayabusa No. 60 is currently maintaining
a speed of 120 km/h.

1656
01:37:22,375 --> 01:37:24,041
Saitama Police Department!

1657
01:37:24,708 --> 01:37:26,666
Is Masatoshi Koga here?

1658
01:37:27,458 --> 01:37:31,291
-As far as planting the bombs…
-Yes?

1659
01:37:31,375 --> 01:37:32,291
The mechanism…

1660
01:37:35,583 --> 01:37:37,333
Still, it's technically possible.

1661
01:37:40,166 --> 01:37:42,125
NIHONMATSU CITY, FUKUSHIMA PREFECTURE

1662
01:37:42,208 --> 01:37:44,333
231 KM TO TOKYO

1663
01:37:53,333 --> 01:37:54,166
Have some.

1664
01:37:55,250 --> 01:37:58,375
Hey… I think he's fading.

1665
01:38:07,208 --> 01:38:08,041
Fujii.

1666
01:38:09,791 --> 01:38:10,666
Fujii, wake up!

1667
01:38:11,458 --> 01:38:12,541
Fujii, please!

1668
01:38:13,083 --> 01:38:15,625
Please wake up! Fujii!

1669
01:38:28,708 --> 01:38:32,250
If we don't get him to a hospital soon,
it might be too late.

1670
01:38:38,458 --> 01:38:39,916
He's a really good guy.

1671
01:38:40,541 --> 01:38:41,916
He's still immature,

1672
01:38:42,416 --> 01:38:45,500
but he's passionate
and determined to succeed.

1673
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:50,333
Please.

1674
01:38:55,250 --> 01:38:56,500
I want to save him.

1675
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:03,416
Then please kill me.

1676
01:39:05,750 --> 01:39:07,250
Why is that how it is?

1677
01:39:10,458 --> 01:39:11,875
Can't you do it

1678
01:39:11,958 --> 01:39:13,416
if it's your job?

1679
01:39:17,916 --> 01:39:22,583
If you're so determined
to save people who don't deserve to live,

1680
01:39:22,666 --> 01:39:24,541
then you should kill me now.

1681
01:39:25,583 --> 01:39:27,333
Everyone here,

1682
01:39:27,416 --> 01:39:28,333
including me,

1683
01:39:28,833 --> 01:39:30,916
is waiting for someone to do it.

1684
01:39:45,333 --> 01:39:47,333
I won't ever let that happen.

1685
01:39:56,916 --> 01:39:58,833
Wait a minute!

1686
01:40:00,416 --> 01:40:02,000
How can you say that?

1687
01:40:02,708 --> 01:40:04,541
I promised them!

1688
01:40:04,625 --> 01:40:07,000
That's right. A promise!

1689
01:40:07,708 --> 01:40:09,791
Do you think I don't know that?

1690
01:40:09,875 --> 01:40:10,791
This is Yoshimura.

1691
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:12,791
You're aware, aren't you?

1692
01:40:13,291 --> 01:40:15,416
What? How could that be?!

1693
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:17,375
We don't have time to wait for a legal…

1694
01:40:17,458 --> 01:40:20,291
People's lives are at stake, damn it!

1695
01:40:21,416 --> 01:40:25,250
Besides, how could you
make such a decision without my--

1696
01:40:25,333 --> 01:40:26,875
If we don't act, we fail them!

1697
01:40:26,958 --> 01:40:28,458
No, we fail all of Japan!

1698
01:40:28,541 --> 01:40:29,458
Sir?

1699
01:40:29,541 --> 01:40:31,791
The whole nation is watching!

1700
01:40:32,625 --> 01:40:34,541
Stop the work at Tokyo Station.

1701
01:40:35,041 --> 01:40:36,000
-What?
-Huh?

1702
01:40:36,791 --> 01:40:37,916
But why?

1703
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,208
Why?!

1704
01:40:39,916 --> 01:40:41,791
Hello? Are you there?!

1705
01:40:42,666 --> 01:40:45,125
We're to resolve things
in our jurisdiction.

1706
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,916
No track extensions can be made!

1707
01:41:35,291 --> 01:41:37,125
-One, two…
-Three!

1708
01:41:37,208 --> 01:41:43,333
-One, two…
-Three!

1709
01:41:43,916 --> 01:41:45,916
-Again!
-Right!

1710
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:51,791
-One, two…
-Three!

1711
01:42:07,250 --> 01:42:10,333
I'm sorry I've let you down.

1712
01:42:14,416 --> 01:42:16,833
I'll let you know as soon as I hear more.

1713
01:42:20,875 --> 01:42:23,041
You're all we can rely on now.

1714
01:42:27,166 --> 01:42:29,166
Don't let things accelerate further

1715
01:42:29,666 --> 01:42:31,375
and look after the passengers.

1716
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:36,541
Do what you can.

1717
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:40,083
What?

1718
01:43:00,583 --> 01:43:03,208
They've stopped work at Tokyo Station.

1719
01:43:10,291 --> 01:43:12,708
Mr. Takaichi… Don't.

1720
01:43:47,583 --> 01:43:49,291
That's the face I wanted to see.

1721
01:44:19,708 --> 01:44:22,125
Stop it! That's disgusting! Stop!

1722
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,208
You can't. You can't do that!

1723
01:44:34,375 --> 01:44:35,333
I…

1724
01:44:38,125 --> 01:44:40,166
I don't deserve to live.

1725
01:45:21,125 --> 01:45:22,166
I really do

1726
01:45:23,166 --> 01:45:24,833
pity her.

1727
01:45:26,875 --> 01:45:29,750
Her father treated her horribly.

1728
01:45:32,375 --> 01:45:35,500
Since her mother died,
the violence was constant.

1729
01:45:37,583 --> 01:45:39,000
He always told her…

1730
01:45:39,875 --> 01:45:40,708
That's right.

1731
01:45:41,708 --> 01:45:43,000
"If only you'd been a male."

1732
01:45:43,083 --> 01:45:44,791
"IF ONLY YOU'D BEEN A MALE."

1733
01:45:59,041 --> 01:46:01,541
To be denied any meaning in your birth…

1734
01:46:03,208 --> 01:46:04,291
For a human being,

1735
01:46:05,250 --> 01:46:08,000
is there anything worse?

1736
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:14,291
And so you provided her with bombs?

1737
01:46:17,875 --> 01:46:21,791
The bomber of Train 109
who her father was said to have killed…

1738
01:46:22,625 --> 01:46:23,791
Masaru Koga…

1739
01:46:25,250 --> 01:46:26,875
He's your father, isn't he?

1740
01:46:39,541 --> 01:46:40,375
Yes.

1741
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,500
Tsutomu Onodera tainted

1742
01:46:45,250 --> 01:46:46,791
your father's honorable death.

1743
01:46:48,541 --> 01:46:50,750
Isn't that what you believe?

1744
01:46:58,833 --> 01:46:59,916
You all

1745
01:47:01,791 --> 01:47:04,208
know what kind of person he was.

1746
01:47:07,333 --> 01:47:08,916
He boasted

1747
01:47:10,583 --> 01:47:12,708
about shooting the bomber

1748
01:47:14,250 --> 01:47:16,291
and saving the bullet train.

1749
01:47:17,791 --> 01:47:20,083
A vulgar man to the core.

1750
01:47:25,083 --> 01:47:28,041
That's why Yuzuki
targeted the bullet train.

1751
01:47:32,916 --> 01:47:35,333
The bullet train is a symbol

1752
01:47:37,083 --> 01:47:38,708
of the father she hated.

1753
01:47:58,958 --> 01:48:00,125
The government

1754
01:48:01,041 --> 01:48:03,958
has ordered us to stop the train.

1755
01:48:07,333 --> 01:48:09,833
Mr. Takaichi made an honorable decision.

1756
01:48:11,916 --> 01:48:13,625
We can be proud of him.

1757
01:48:17,291 --> 01:48:19,333
-I'll send the signal--
-No.

1758
01:48:20,666 --> 01:48:21,875
I'll do it.

1759
01:48:23,375 --> 01:48:25,375
I'm responsible to the end.

1760
01:48:28,041 --> 01:48:28,875
Understood.

1761
01:48:30,875 --> 01:48:32,958
We found out
which cars have bombs in them.

1762
01:48:33,041 --> 01:48:34,583
Koga said there were three more.

1763
01:48:34,666 --> 01:48:37,541
Cars 1, 4, and 6.

1764
01:48:37,625 --> 01:48:40,250
If all of them explode,
we can't contain the damage.

1765
01:48:49,958 --> 01:48:52,083
Mr. Yoshimura, where is kilometer zero?

1766
01:48:52,166 --> 01:48:55,083
It's 11 kilometers from Omiya Station.

1767
01:49:02,166 --> 01:49:03,208
What is it, Kasagi?

1768
01:49:08,833 --> 01:49:13,333
WASHINOMIYA

1769
01:49:14,208 --> 01:49:16,791
It all depends on
whether they can endure it.

1770
01:49:17,958 --> 01:49:18,875
That and…

1771
01:49:25,875 --> 01:49:28,000
Just political action.

1772
01:49:30,875 --> 01:49:32,541
Can you connect the short one?

1773
01:49:44,375 --> 01:49:45,541
It's connected.

1774
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,500
We'll use two switches

1775
01:49:53,583 --> 01:49:56,750
to uncouple the cars
from Hayabusa No. 60 without stopping.

1776
01:49:56,833 --> 01:50:00,875
To limit damage, the operation
will occur in a sparsely populated area.

1777
01:50:00,958 --> 01:50:03,958
We'll use the branch
near the Washinomiya Rolling Stock Center.

1778
01:50:04,041 --> 01:50:06,708
Cars 1 through 6
will take the northbound track,

1779
01:50:06,791 --> 01:50:10,333
and just as the front truck
of Car 7 passes through,

1780
01:50:10,416 --> 01:50:11,500
we'll operate Switch A.

1781
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:15,750
Car 7 will skid diagonally
across both tracks,

1782
01:50:15,833 --> 01:50:17,583
followed by Car 8.

1783
01:50:18,250 --> 01:50:21,583
And once the train
reaches the Washinomiya branch line,

1784
01:50:22,083 --> 01:50:23,166
we'll operate Switch B.

1785
01:50:24,958 --> 01:50:27,625
By operating the switch
as the specific cars pass,

1786
01:50:27,708 --> 01:50:31,416
we'll uncouple Cars 1 through 6,
and they'll explode on the branch line.

1787
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:34,666
Meanwhile, Cars 7 and 8
will stop on the main line.

1788
01:50:35,958 --> 01:50:37,208
That's the idea.

1789
01:50:44,041 --> 01:50:46,166
A single car is 25 meters long.

1790
01:50:46,250 --> 01:50:47,708
If they pass at 100 km/h,

1791
01:50:47,791 --> 01:50:50,166
we'll have less than a second
to trigger Switch A.

1792
01:50:50,250 --> 01:50:52,333
And Switch B
is used for track maintenance,

1793
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:54,375
so it can only be operated manually.

1794
01:51:00,625 --> 01:51:01,833
It's as difficult

1795
01:51:02,333 --> 01:51:05,125
as threading a needle in the dark.

1796
01:51:06,458 --> 01:51:09,000
Even if the uncoupling is successful,

1797
01:51:09,083 --> 01:51:11,041
a derailment at a speed near 100 km/h

1798
01:51:11,125 --> 01:51:14,291
will likely have tremendous impact
on Hayabusa No. 60.

1799
01:51:20,833 --> 01:51:24,625
Are you sure there's no way
to defuse the bombs?

1800
01:51:32,208 --> 01:51:35,083
Does everyone on Hayabusa No. 60 agree?

1801
01:52:07,916 --> 01:52:10,208
Yes. Please proceed.

1802
01:52:14,666 --> 01:52:15,791
Very well.

1803
01:52:16,291 --> 01:52:17,750
Tell me what we need.

1804
01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:20,958
Thank you very much!

1805
01:52:21,041 --> 01:52:22,750
-Thank god.
-Let's get started!

1806
01:52:23,250 --> 01:52:24,500
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

1807
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:36,666
UNCOUPLING POINT

1808
01:52:37,916 --> 01:52:40,541
NASUSHIOBARA CITY, TOCHIGI PREFECTURE

1809
01:52:40,625 --> 01:52:43,541
160 KM TO TOKYO

1810
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:51,125
I'll be in the driver's cab.

1811
01:52:51,625 --> 01:52:55,083
Find as much soft
cushioning material as you can.

1812
01:52:55,166 --> 01:52:56,000
-Got it.
-Okay.

1813
01:52:56,083 --> 01:52:57,666
Stay with him, Ms. Kagami.

1814
01:53:00,625 --> 01:53:02,416
This will work for padding.

1815
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:04,958
These too. Okay.

1816
01:53:33,666 --> 01:53:35,083
Hayabusa No. 60…

1817
01:53:38,541 --> 01:53:41,625
It has run non-stop
since leaving Shin-Aomori.

1818
01:53:42,916 --> 01:53:44,250
Matsumoto, let's go.

1819
01:53:44,333 --> 01:53:45,166
Right!

1820
01:53:46,625 --> 01:53:47,625
Mr. Takaichi.

1821
01:53:49,291 --> 01:53:50,666
I need a favor.

1822
01:53:53,041 --> 01:53:53,875
Can you…

1823
01:53:55,791 --> 01:53:58,125
peel my hand off the master controller?

1824
01:54:00,791 --> 01:54:01,708
Of course.

1825
01:54:16,083 --> 01:54:18,416
A speed of 120 km/h… Check!

1826
01:54:28,250 --> 01:54:31,416
Avoid high voltage equipment
and ready the ladders!

1827
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:35,208
-Ladder turning!
-Sort out the shared data from the system.

1828
01:54:35,291 --> 01:54:37,416
Saving lives is top priority.

1829
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:38,875
Train damage doesn't matter.

1830
01:54:38,958 --> 01:54:41,541
The command station
is at the center of the field.

1831
01:54:41,625 --> 01:54:44,833
-Crash cushions coming through.
-Go around!

1832
01:54:44,916 --> 01:54:46,208
Go around!

1833
01:54:46,291 --> 01:54:47,833
Keep going!

1834
01:54:49,833 --> 01:54:52,041
DRUM-SHAPED CRASH CUSHIONS
FOR IMPACT ABSORPTION

1835
01:54:52,125 --> 01:54:54,291
Overhead lines
three and above are high voltage.

1836
01:54:54,375 --> 01:54:55,958
-Start pumping!
-Pumping begun!

1837
01:54:56,041 --> 01:54:57,125
Go ahead!

1838
01:54:57,208 --> 01:54:58,583
Get ready for pressure!

1839
01:55:00,416 --> 01:55:01,541
-Lift them up!
-Get back!

1840
01:55:01,625 --> 01:55:03,083
Okay, hoist them up!

1841
01:55:03,166 --> 01:55:04,458
Everyone, stand back!

1842
01:55:04,958 --> 01:55:06,250
Hoisting begun.

1843
01:55:06,958 --> 01:55:09,833
-Maintenance car arriving.
-Three, two, one…

1844
01:55:09,916 --> 01:55:11,208
-Okay, stop.
-Take them off!

1845
01:55:12,125 --> 01:55:16,000
We'll create three blocks
pointed in the direction of Tokyo.

1846
01:55:17,791 --> 01:55:19,166
Lift!

1847
01:55:19,666 --> 01:55:20,666
Okay, that'll do!

1848
01:55:20,750 --> 01:55:21,583
Ready, go!

1849
01:55:21,666 --> 01:55:24,541
-Okay, okay!
-Keep it up!

1850
01:55:37,750 --> 01:55:39,166
-If you could.
-Right.

1851
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:57,875
Please.

1852
01:55:58,416 --> 01:55:59,291
Hang in there.

1853
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,166
It's dangerous here.

1854
01:56:16,875 --> 01:56:18,458
You haven't met, have you?

1855
01:56:18,541 --> 01:56:20,041
This is Matsumoto, our driver.

1856
01:56:20,541 --> 01:56:22,416
Um, everyone…

1857
01:56:23,375 --> 01:56:24,708
I'm so sorry!

1858
01:56:24,791 --> 01:56:26,500
Because I hit the brakes, you…

1859
01:56:27,666 --> 01:56:29,166
Don't apologize.

1860
01:56:29,250 --> 01:56:31,500
Can you help us find padding instead?

1861
01:56:33,416 --> 01:56:34,250
Right.

1862
01:56:41,958 --> 01:56:42,791
Fujii!

1863
01:56:45,250 --> 01:56:46,083
Don't worry.

1864
01:56:53,791 --> 01:56:54,958
I know we'll make it.

1865
01:56:59,750 --> 01:57:03,083
Six hours have passed since the hijacking

1866
01:57:03,166 --> 01:57:04,958
of Japan's bullet train.

1867
01:57:05,041 --> 01:57:08,833
The Japanese government ordered the rescue

1868
01:57:08,916 --> 01:57:11,666
of the remaining nine passengers and crew.

1869
01:57:12,250 --> 01:57:14,250
The details of the operation are unclear,

1870
01:57:14,333 --> 01:57:16,958
but bringing a running bullet train
to a sudden stop…

1871
01:57:17,041 --> 01:57:18,000
Yuzuki…

1872
01:57:18,083 --> 01:57:20,916
It's sure to be very dangerous.

1873
01:57:21,708 --> 01:57:23,208
At the final stopping point,

1874
01:57:23,708 --> 01:57:27,208
JR East, the police, the fire department,

1875
01:57:27,291 --> 01:57:30,166
and local construction workers
are hard at work.

1876
01:57:30,250 --> 01:57:32,875
Together, they are preparing
for the train's arrival.

1877
01:57:34,125 --> 01:57:36,250
Can the nine men and women be rescued?

1878
01:57:37,041 --> 01:57:40,166
We must look on with hope in our hearts.

1879
01:57:41,041 --> 01:57:43,250
KOGA CITY, IBARAKI PREFECTURE
62 KM TO TOKYO

1880
01:57:50,083 --> 01:57:52,875
WASHINOMIYA ROLLING STOCK
MAINTENANCE CENTER, SWITCH NO. 51

1881
01:57:55,458 --> 01:57:57,000
-No foreign objects.
-Okay.

1882
01:57:57,083 --> 01:57:58,500
Work will finish shortly.

1883
01:57:58,583 --> 01:58:00,958
-We're gonna inspect the switch!
-Understood.

1884
01:58:01,750 --> 01:58:04,041
-Six minutes left, everyone! Hurry!
-Got it!

1885
01:58:04,125 --> 01:58:05,250
-Power's ready.
-Okay.

1886
01:58:05,333 --> 01:58:06,916
-It's up to you now!
-Right!

1887
01:58:07,583 --> 01:58:08,875
Power on!

1888
01:58:09,375 --> 01:58:10,375
Throwing the switch!

1889
01:58:25,416 --> 01:58:26,625
That should do.

1890
01:58:27,541 --> 01:58:28,666
-Keep it tight.
-Right.

1891
01:58:29,708 --> 01:58:30,875
-Does it hurt?
-No.

1892
01:58:31,416 --> 01:58:32,250
There.

1893
01:58:33,208 --> 01:58:34,208
Okay.

1894
01:58:34,833 --> 01:58:36,000
Yeah. We're ready.

1895
01:58:36,833 --> 01:58:38,041
Tie that one again.

1896
01:58:38,708 --> 01:58:39,541
Okay.

1897
01:58:53,333 --> 01:58:54,625
Where did that come from?

1898
01:58:55,125 --> 01:58:56,875
If you can't hold your liquor, let me.

1899
01:58:56,958 --> 01:58:58,500
I can't, but I will!

1900
01:58:59,416 --> 01:59:00,750
-Okay.
-Yeah.

1901
01:59:14,125 --> 01:59:14,958
Fujii!

1902
01:59:16,041 --> 01:59:17,333
Hang in there.

1903
01:59:33,125 --> 01:59:35,833
They're about to reach
the uncoupling point.

1904
01:59:47,958 --> 01:59:49,583
5060B is approaching

1905
01:59:50,250 --> 01:59:51,541
at 121 km/h.

1906
02:00:11,250 --> 02:00:12,291
It's here!

1907
02:00:14,458 --> 02:00:16,208
5060B is entering the switch!

1908
02:00:22,916 --> 02:00:23,916
Countdown to Car 7.

1909
02:00:25,291 --> 02:00:26,125
Ten…

1910
02:00:27,916 --> 02:00:28,750
Nine…

1911
02:00:30,125 --> 02:00:31,125
Eight…

1912
02:00:33,291 --> 02:00:34,125
Seven…

1913
02:00:36,250 --> 02:00:37,083
Six…

1914
02:00:39,416 --> 02:00:40,291
Five…

1915
02:00:43,125 --> 02:00:44,000
Four…

1916
02:00:46,416 --> 02:00:47,500
Three…

1917
02:00:49,125 --> 02:00:50,958
Switch 52, go!

1918
02:01:07,541 --> 02:01:08,541
Switch 51, go!

1919
02:01:08,625 --> 02:01:09,833
Throwing the switch!

1920
02:01:24,500 --> 02:01:25,458
Matsumoto!

1921
02:01:49,583 --> 02:01:51,250
-Mr. Fujii!
-Fujii!

1922
02:02:35,250 --> 02:02:36,833
5060B has stopped.

1923
02:02:37,541 --> 02:02:39,958
5060B Car 8 has stopped.

1924
02:02:40,458 --> 02:02:43,833
Cars 1 through 6 have derailed
on the Washinomiya branch line.

1925
02:02:43,916 --> 02:02:46,166
Cars 1, 4, and 6 are on fire.

1926
02:02:46,250 --> 02:02:48,333
This is emergency response.
We're on our way.

1927
02:02:48,875 --> 02:02:49,708
Roger.

1928
02:02:50,208 --> 02:02:52,791
This is the police helicopter.
We'll transmit video.

1929
02:02:56,541 --> 02:02:58,958
This is emergency response.
We're arriving now.

1930
02:03:02,416 --> 02:03:05,583
UNCOUPLING POINT

1931
02:03:05,666 --> 02:03:06,583
We've arrived.

1932
02:03:07,500 --> 02:03:09,333
We'll enter through the coupling area.

1933
02:03:10,708 --> 02:03:11,541
Ready?

1934
02:03:12,666 --> 02:03:13,875
-Ready, go!
-Ready, go!

1935
02:03:15,041 --> 02:03:16,708
Okay, it's open.

1936
02:03:17,916 --> 02:03:20,958
We're inside.
Checking for those in need of rescue.

1937
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:23,541
Watch the cables! They're broken!

1938
02:03:23,625 --> 02:03:25,916
This is the rescue team!
Can anyone hear me?

1939
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,791
If you do, please respond!

1940
02:03:29,458 --> 02:03:30,291
-Roger.
-Roger.

1941
02:03:31,666 --> 02:03:34,291
This is the rescue team!
Can anyone hear me?

1942
02:03:34,375 --> 02:03:35,208
Can you hear me?

1943
02:03:35,750 --> 02:03:36,833
What about there?

1944
02:03:37,958 --> 02:03:39,375
I don't see anyone!

1945
02:03:40,916 --> 02:03:42,375
-Going further back.
-Right.

1946
02:03:43,916 --> 02:03:45,000
Damn it!

1947
02:03:49,916 --> 02:03:50,750
Damn it!

1948
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,083
If you can hear me, please make a sound!

1949
02:03:56,208 --> 02:03:57,750
Please… This is rescue.

1950
02:03:57,833 --> 02:03:59,000
Is anyone…

1951
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:02,416
We…

1952
02:04:03,375 --> 02:04:05,291
-Huh? You what?
-Roger!

1953
02:04:06,375 --> 02:04:07,666
-Repeat that!
-Surv…

1954
02:04:09,041 --> 02:04:09,875
Survivors…

1955
02:04:10,500 --> 02:04:11,416
…found.

1956
02:04:11,500 --> 02:04:13,541
They're…

1957
02:04:15,708 --> 02:04:18,083
-They're all alive!
-Yes!

1958
02:04:18,166 --> 02:04:19,000
All right!

1959
02:04:39,083 --> 02:04:40,083
Great job, everyone.

1960
02:04:41,041 --> 02:04:41,958
Thank you.

1961
02:04:42,833 --> 02:04:44,916
No time to lose.
Let's get the trains running.

1962
02:04:45,416 --> 02:04:48,333
Cancel trains between Omiya to Oyama
and Sendai to Furukawa.

1963
02:04:48,833 --> 02:04:51,625
All other sections, resume service!

1964
02:04:51,708 --> 02:04:52,666
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

1965
02:04:53,416 --> 02:04:54,708
All right! Get confirmation!

1966
02:04:54,791 --> 02:04:56,791
3032B, southbound track in Morioka!

1967
02:04:56,875 --> 02:04:58,125
How's that short circuit?

1968
02:04:58,208 --> 02:04:59,083
It's active.

1969
02:04:59,166 --> 02:05:02,166
3027B, also derailed in Morioka,
northbound track!

1970
02:05:02,250 --> 02:05:03,916
I'll call HQ.

1971
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,250
All right. Double-check
the tracks and power.

1972
02:05:07,583 --> 02:05:10,458
I'm calling from Switch Number 51.
All three operators are safe.

1973
02:05:10,541 --> 02:05:12,291
Roger that. Well done.

1974
02:05:13,166 --> 02:05:15,166
The patient is secured. Let's go!

1975
02:05:15,666 --> 02:05:16,500
You'll be okay!

1976
02:05:16,583 --> 02:05:18,333
-The ambulance is right here!
-Fujii!

1977
02:05:18,416 --> 02:05:20,416
-Hurry, his blood pressure is falling.
-Right!

1978
02:05:20,916 --> 02:05:21,916
Fujii!

1979
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,833
He'll be all right. Leave him to us.

1980
02:05:23,916 --> 02:05:26,000
-Up we go. One, two, three!
-Three!

1981
02:05:28,541 --> 02:05:29,875
-Okay!
-Closing the door.

1982
02:05:31,208 --> 02:05:32,541
Check evacuation status.

1983
02:05:32,625 --> 02:05:33,750
Start with Honden-cho.

1984
02:05:36,708 --> 02:05:39,333
The ambulance is turning left.

1985
02:05:42,500 --> 02:05:44,250
Tokyo Police will handle the suspect.

1986
02:05:44,333 --> 02:05:47,250
-Saitama Police should remain on scene.
-All employees, regroup!

1987
02:05:47,333 --> 02:05:49,333
This is Saitama Police. Roger.

1988
02:05:52,291 --> 02:05:55,916
One victim was taken to the hospital.
The other eight have minor injuries.

1989
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:57,083
No health concerns.

1990
02:05:57,916 --> 02:05:59,291
Command station. Roger that.

1991
02:05:59,375 --> 02:06:00,750
I'm Kawagoe, Tokyo Police.

1992
02:06:02,875 --> 02:06:04,500
I'm in charge of your case.

1993
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,208
Any regrets?

1994
02:06:13,375 --> 02:06:14,291
No.

1995
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,916
I did it of my own free will.

1996
02:06:20,708 --> 02:06:22,916
Your accomplice exploited your hatred

1997
02:06:24,250 --> 02:06:27,541
to get revenge on Tsutomu Onodera
without dirtying his own hands.

1998
02:06:28,875 --> 02:06:29,958
Your will

1999
02:06:30,458 --> 02:06:32,541
was manipulated by Koga.

2000
02:06:35,375 --> 02:06:37,541
Is it easier for you to think that?

2001
02:06:41,958 --> 02:06:45,583
To think I'm just a poor girl
who was exploited by mean old adults.

2002
02:06:48,833 --> 02:06:50,791
That's the real false normality.

2003
02:06:53,250 --> 02:06:56,000
You look as if you hate the whole world.

2004
02:06:57,708 --> 02:06:58,541
But you know…

2005
02:07:11,916 --> 02:07:16,041
HAYABUSA NO. 60 BOMB FUND
GOAL REACHED

2006
02:07:20,083 --> 02:07:23,333
It's not completely hopeless, is it?

2007
02:07:35,333 --> 02:07:36,791
-Let's go.
-Right.

2008
02:07:36,875 --> 02:07:40,291
The media are getting in the way.
Expand the restricted area.

2009
02:07:40,375 --> 02:07:41,208
Roger that.

2010
02:07:41,291 --> 02:07:43,000
We'll coordinate with Saitama City.

2011
02:07:43,083 --> 02:07:45,458
-Command station. Roger that.
-Roger.

2012
02:07:45,541 --> 02:07:48,875
We'll assist with the fire
in Cars 1 through 6.

2013
02:07:48,958 --> 02:07:50,625
Got it. Please do.

2014
02:07:51,125 --> 02:07:52,500
This is Officer Kawagoe.

2015
02:07:52,583 --> 02:07:55,166
I'm transporting the suspect
in an ambulance.

2016
02:07:55,250 --> 02:07:56,375
Roger that.

2017
02:08:01,666 --> 02:08:04,250
All 21 people, from eight households,
have been confirmed.

2018
02:08:04,333 --> 02:08:06,333
One day we'll laugh about this.

2019
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,375
Eighteen people from
five households confirmed.

2020
02:08:13,333 --> 02:08:14,500
Okay. Next, Honmachi.

2021
02:08:14,583 --> 02:08:15,708
The microbus is here!

2022
02:08:15,791 --> 02:08:18,166
All 15 people,
from four households, confirmed.

2023
02:08:18,250 --> 02:08:19,083
Okay.

2024
02:08:19,166 --> 02:08:21,625
Next, I can report
that evacuation is complete.

2025
02:08:22,791 --> 02:08:25,125
JTSB is here! Make room!

2026
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Roger that! We'll get started.

2027
02:08:40,791 --> 02:08:43,208
We're ready, so follow me.

2028
02:08:45,708 --> 02:08:47,625
Thank you very much.

2029
02:08:48,708 --> 02:08:50,291
Enter the microbus over here.

2030
02:08:50,375 --> 02:08:52,416
-Take care!
-Thank you very much.

2031
02:08:54,416 --> 02:08:56,666
I just heard from the police.

2032
02:09:02,416 --> 02:09:03,250
Okay!

2033
02:09:06,583 --> 02:09:08,833
So, do you need refreshments?

2034
02:09:13,791 --> 02:09:16,250
Hey! There's even an apple pie in there!

2035
02:09:17,708 --> 02:09:18,916
Are you as hungry as me?

2036
02:09:19,791 --> 02:09:22,166
Hey, Saitama City.
Could you come and check this?

2037
02:09:25,250 --> 02:09:27,500
JTSB will handle that first.

2038
02:09:28,750 --> 02:09:31,083
The microbus is leaving!

2039
02:09:32,500 --> 02:09:33,708
Ms. Matsumoto!

2040
02:09:33,791 --> 02:09:34,875
I'm back!

2041
02:09:35,708 --> 02:09:37,583
-Mr. Takaichi!
-Way to go!

2042
02:09:38,291 --> 02:09:39,500
Thanks.

2043
02:09:39,583 --> 02:09:41,333
-Good work.
-Thank you very much.

2044
02:09:49,833 --> 02:09:51,083
Thanks, everybody.

2045
02:09:53,416 --> 02:09:54,500
Good work.

2046
02:10:04,125 --> 02:10:05,291
Thank you!

2047
02:10:11,208 --> 02:10:12,458
Good work!

2048
02:10:15,458 --> 02:10:16,666
Good work!

2049
02:14:35,833 --> 02:14:40,958
