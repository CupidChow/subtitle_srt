1
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:06,868
I think that's enough.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,642
Do you love me, young master?

3
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:11,613
A lover...

4
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:13,101
No, we are not.

5
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:16,005
Maybe in the future.

6
00:00:18,467 --> 00:00:21,793
Hey, ant nest!

7
00:00:24,614 --> 00:00:27,757
Right now, just watching the stars...

8
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:29,496
makes me feel happy.

9
00:00:54,914 --> 00:00:56,151
I apologize.

10
00:00:57,412 --> 00:00:59,505
Did I make you uncomfortable?

11
00:01:01,648 --> 00:01:06,821
Nah, I was just surprised. No harm done.

12
00:01:08,848 --> 00:01:10,961
I'm afraid you'd feel uncomfortable.

13
00:01:12,233 --> 00:01:14,812
I'm okay. It's fine.

14
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:29,057
Did you remember anything last night?

15
00:01:32,948 --> 00:01:34,082
Sun...

16
00:01:48,614 --> 00:01:49,819
Can I ask you something?

17
00:01:51,614 --> 00:01:55,644
Last night, did you recall anything?

18
00:02:07,114 --> 00:02:08,194
Nothing at all.

19
00:02:09,814 --> 00:02:11,430
I was heavily drunk.

20
00:02:16,148 --> 00:02:19,403
Did anything happen, young master?

21
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:22,960
Nothing.

22
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:26,512
Just asking.

23
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:35,401
What if,

24
00:02:36,648 --> 00:02:38,603
you are not my bodyguard.

25
00:02:40,839 --> 00:02:44,865
Would you still help me out like this?

26
00:02:53,114 --> 00:02:54,578
Absolutely, I will.

27
00:02:59,536 --> 00:03:00,917
Because I...

28
00:03:07,714 --> 00:03:08,963
You what?

29
00:03:15,248 --> 00:03:16,438
Tell me.

30
00:04:23,146 --> 00:04:26,542
=Golden Blood=

31
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,750
Finally done for the day.

32
00:04:37,224 --> 00:04:39,304
Pitch, bro.

33
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,693
Can we switch places?

34
00:04:41,773 --> 00:04:43,055
Why?

35
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,436
I'm having a backache.

36
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:46,559
Alright, alright.

37
00:04:48,683 --> 00:04:49,752
I'm so sleepy.

38
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:08,862
Bro, can I switch back?

39
00:05:09,621 --> 00:05:10,647
Why?

40
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:13,561
There are rocks poking me.

41
00:05:18,681 --> 00:05:20,065
There, there.

42
00:05:34,014 --> 00:05:35,088
Hey, bro!

43
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:36,802
What is it?

44
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,399
My legs hurt.

45
00:05:39,253 --> 00:05:41,069
I just switched places with you.

46
00:05:41,797 --> 00:05:43,559
It's because I played football.

47
00:05:44,508 --> 00:05:46,629
Hurry, your last chance.

48
00:05:51,081 --> 00:05:52,333
Hold on, bro!

49
00:05:53,681 --> 00:05:56,694
What the hell is it?
Can I get some sleep?

50
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,281
My body is aching.

51
00:06:02,414 --> 00:06:06,013
Damn, do you have to be tired
before you can sleep?

52
00:06:09,896 --> 00:06:11,074
Hey, what are you doing?

53
00:06:11,154 --> 00:06:14,175
-You ask for it.
-What?

54
00:06:14,255 --> 00:06:15,671
Godzilla.

55
00:06:17,788 --> 00:06:19,198
A Godzilla?

56
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:22,171
Ticklish Godzilla,
you've ever heard of that?

57
00:06:25,105 --> 00:06:26,381
You aren't sleepy?

58
00:06:26,831 --> 00:06:28,345
You can't sleep?

59
00:06:28,425 --> 00:06:30,654
Hey, stop it, bro.
Others might've heard us.

60
00:07:01,781 --> 00:07:04,793
Pitch, what was that?

61
00:07:06,948 --> 00:07:07,908
I'm sorry.

62
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:11,399
Why did you apologize?

63
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,628
We should head back.

64
00:07:48,114 --> 00:07:49,229
It's getting late.

65
00:07:56,648 --> 00:07:57,962
I can stand by myself.

66
00:08:03,048 --> 00:08:05,026
Young master, why are you upset?

67
00:08:08,148 --> 00:08:09,806
How do you feel about me?

68
00:08:22,548 --> 00:08:25,893
Bro, what was that?

69
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:29,264
I don't know.

70
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:35,619
What did you just say?

71
00:08:37,181 --> 00:08:38,574
I said I don't know.

72
00:08:40,081 --> 00:08:43,573
How can you not know?
You just kissed me.

73
00:08:44,239 --> 00:08:47,177
I don't know. I don't. You understand?

74
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:53,347
Yeah, it was my fault. Sorry.

75
00:08:55,948 --> 00:08:58,414
Hey, you've got to have a reason.

76
00:08:59,448 --> 00:09:00,977
Why did you kiss me?

77
00:09:01,353 --> 00:09:04,340
What do you want? It was just a kiss.

78
00:09:12,448 --> 00:09:15,900
I'm sleepy.
Can we talk about this tomorrow?

79
00:09:17,981 --> 00:09:19,154
Where are you going?

80
00:09:27,514 --> 00:09:31,023
Why aren't you answering? You tell me.

81
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:32,930
How do you feel about me?

82
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:54,389
How do I feel? It's not important.

83
00:09:56,748 --> 00:09:58,397
You're talking to me.

84
00:09:59,327 --> 00:10:00,947
Look at my face.

85
00:10:03,398 --> 00:10:08,498
Tell me, what does "not important" mean?

86
00:10:12,308 --> 00:10:13,894
I'm just a bodyguard.

87
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,311
My only duty is to protect you.

88
00:10:20,114 --> 00:10:22,440
So, you only think of me as your boss?

89
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,776
I have no right to think otherwise.

90
00:10:25,856 --> 00:10:27,440
Can you stop being stubborn?

91
00:10:27,913 --> 00:10:30,422
There is no one else around here.

92
00:10:32,648 --> 00:10:37,639
I know that you feel something for me.

93
00:10:38,878 --> 00:10:42,314
Otherwise, you wouldn't ask me that
last night.

94
00:10:46,548 --> 00:10:47,914
Do you love me, young master?

95
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:54,146
Just tell me truth.

96
00:10:54,746 --> 00:10:57,859
Just admit it, how do you feel about me?

97
00:11:05,981 --> 00:11:08,544
I'm only a young master's bodyguard.

98
00:11:11,248 --> 00:11:13,652
No right to think other things.

99
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:21,681
Alright.

100
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:28,011
If you said so, I won't ask you again.

101
00:13:21,048 --> 00:13:22,438
Where are you going, young master?

102
00:13:24,481 --> 00:13:25,750
It's my business.

103
00:13:26,225 --> 00:13:29,835
You only have to take care of my safety.
You do your job.

104
00:13:30,156 --> 00:13:32,235
Other than that,
don't pry into my business.

105
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:34,988
I apologize, sir.

106
00:13:43,148 --> 00:13:47,763
Then, I'll be checking the area.

107
00:13:48,848 --> 00:13:51,574
Fine, go wherever you want.

108
00:14:33,048 --> 00:14:34,212
Sun!

109
00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:46,801
This represents my heart.

110
00:14:48,161 --> 00:14:51,476
And this is yours, young master.

111
00:14:59,714 --> 00:15:01,516
I'm just a bodyguard.

112
00:15:05,848 --> 00:15:07,999
My only duty is to protect you.

113
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:17,669
I have no right to be something else.

114
00:19:14,648 --> 00:19:16,172
You brought a lot.

115
00:19:16,825 --> 00:19:18,746
We won't finish these by today.

116
00:19:20,281 --> 00:19:21,289
Sun.

117
00:19:28,181 --> 00:19:29,183
Mr. Bank.

118
00:19:30,848 --> 00:19:32,062
Have you seen Sky?

119
00:19:32,641 --> 00:19:35,604
I don't know. I haven't seen him today.

120
00:19:36,493 --> 00:19:38,818
I thought he was packing up with you.

121
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:43,114
Sun, come sit with us.

122
00:19:51,214 --> 00:19:55,365
Hey, Pitch, come over here.
There's room.

123
00:20:04,281 --> 00:20:07,916
Hey, can I sit here?

124
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,506
What?

125
00:20:18,248 --> 00:20:19,768
It's yummy.

126
00:20:20,548 --> 00:20:21,527
Thank you.

127
00:20:22,932 --> 00:20:24,075
Bank.

128
00:20:31,915 --> 00:20:33,668
Bro, can you pass me the chilli paste?

129
00:20:33,749 --> 00:20:34,848
Shrimp paste chilli.

130
00:20:37,865 --> 00:20:39,563
You look starving.

131
00:20:39,643 --> 00:20:40,920
Bank.

132
00:20:43,181 --> 00:20:44,782
I...

133
00:20:54,514 --> 00:20:57,177
Bank, are you full?

134
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:58,882
Yeah, I'm full.

135
00:21:52,581 --> 00:21:53,917
Young master.

136
00:21:58,248 --> 00:22:00,036
We should get on the bus.

137
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,966
We're heading back.

138
00:22:30,413 --> 00:22:32,279
Does anyone sit beside you, Toktaeng?

139
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,503
Can I sit here?

140
00:22:34,712 --> 00:22:36,650
Yeah, sure. I save this seat for you.

141
00:22:37,775 --> 00:22:39,086
Thanks.

142
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:43,572
Sun, you can sit with me.

143
00:23:13,881 --> 00:23:16,233
We're all here. Let's take off.

144
00:23:31,687 --> 00:23:34,350
Hey, aren't you guys going to sing?

145
00:24:18,681 --> 00:24:21,405
I don't need supper today.

146
00:24:25,614 --> 00:24:28,668
Yes, sir.

147
00:24:54,248 --> 00:24:55,458
Hey, Bank.

148
00:24:55,538 --> 00:24:57,987
Are you calling
just to sigh all night long?

149
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:02,685
I'm bored. I thought it
might help if I call you.

150
00:25:02,765 --> 00:25:05,733
But damn, it's getting worse.

151
00:25:06,181 --> 00:25:07,640
What's wrong?

152
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,542
And what's wrong with you?

153
00:25:09,622 --> 00:25:13,070
I asked you first.
Don't answer me with my question.

154
00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:15,757
So what? You tell me first.

155
00:25:16,095 --> 00:25:17,318
It's nothing.

156
00:25:17,398 --> 00:25:20,095
Bullshit, stop being tongue-tied.

157
00:25:20,175 --> 00:25:21,915
I'm not tongue-tied.

158
00:25:23,047 --> 00:25:24,335
Dang it.

159
00:25:24,783 --> 00:25:28,823
I hate it when people don't say
what they actually feel.

160
00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:34,573
Right, I fricking hate that too.

161
00:25:35,114 --> 00:25:36,796
So, what do you feel about me?

162
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:41,108
Why are you not answering?

163
00:25:42,196 --> 00:25:45,434
You tell me,
what do you really feel about me?

164
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:54,381
Yeah true, it's frustrating
to be with that kind of person.

165
00:25:55,381 --> 00:25:57,015
What was that?

166
00:25:57,095 --> 00:25:58,398
I don't know.

167
00:25:58,969 --> 00:26:02,561
How can you not know?
You just kissed me.

168
00:26:03,043 --> 00:26:04,840
I don't know. I don't.

169
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:08,409
What does he want?
I can't figure it out.

170
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,972
Same here, I can't figure it out.

171
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,894
Hey, who did you talk about?

172
00:26:16,105 --> 00:26:19,082
I was talking about you.
Who do you think it is?

173
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:20,956
I was just saying random things.

174
00:26:21,505 --> 00:26:23,695
Talk later, I'll go to bed.

175
00:26:23,775 --> 00:26:24,768
Alright.

176
00:26:46,081 --> 00:26:47,795
Finally done.

177
00:26:48,714 --> 00:26:50,688
After this class, let's play football.

178
00:26:50,768 --> 00:26:52,684
Have some sweat to shake things up.

179
00:26:53,562 --> 00:26:55,912
Sure, let's play.

180
00:26:56,782 --> 00:27:00,352
Are you going to play football?
I'll go watch.

181
00:27:00,432 --> 00:27:03,350
Hang on, before you go watch those men,

182
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,519
send me to the restroom first.

183
00:27:06,477 --> 00:27:07,809
We'll be back guys.

184
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,355
Hey, hold on.

185
00:27:24,414 --> 00:27:27,105
Sun, let's play.

186
00:27:27,408 --> 00:27:28,879
You don't have to invite him.

187
00:27:29,854 --> 00:27:31,516
He'll follow me anyway.

188
00:27:32,828 --> 00:27:35,307
He has to stick with me.

189
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,944
Sun, is it okay
if Sky goes play football?

190
00:27:40,024 --> 00:27:41,979
Why did you ask him permission?

191
00:27:42,692 --> 00:27:45,485
Whatever I want to do is my business.

192
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:48,587
Calm down, man.

193
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,227
You were always listening to him.

194
00:28:04,448 --> 00:28:06,621
Hey, wait, man.

195
00:28:21,814 --> 00:28:22,904
Sky!

196
00:28:24,548 --> 00:28:26,094
Go, go.

197
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,872
Sun, aren't you going to play?

198
00:28:31,063 --> 00:28:32,228
I'm good.

199
00:28:34,075 --> 00:28:35,730
Watch out!

200
00:28:37,903 --> 00:28:40,766
Pitch, you want to play with us?

201
00:28:40,846 --> 00:28:42,244
Yeah, sure.

202
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,542
I'll leave this with you.

203
00:28:49,848 --> 00:28:51,168
Sky,

204
00:28:51,248 --> 00:28:54,905
if you have more players,
then it's not fair.

205
00:28:58,681 --> 00:29:01,004
Sun, come play with my side.

206
00:29:01,769 --> 00:29:03,365
Yeah, Sun, let's play together.

207
00:29:03,445 --> 00:29:05,271
There's not enough players.

208
00:29:05,896 --> 00:29:07,198
Hurry up!

209
00:29:16,348 --> 00:29:18,548
Go!

210
00:29:21,624 --> 00:29:24,112
Go, Sky!

211
00:29:33,548 --> 00:29:34,903
Hey, Pitch.

212
00:29:39,947 --> 00:29:41,312
Watch out!

213
00:29:46,881 --> 00:29:49,443
I didn't give you an order to play.

214
00:29:52,548 --> 00:29:54,196
Well, you're the one who said...

215
00:29:54,822 --> 00:29:56,723
that I have to stick with you.

216
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,009
That was close.

217
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:17,719
Hey, bro, you alright?

218
00:30:22,514 --> 00:30:23,647
Whoa!

219
00:30:24,564 --> 00:30:28,908
I'm fine. It was just a scratch.
No problem.

220
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:32,684
Scratch your ass, it might get infected.

221
00:30:33,072 --> 00:30:36,047
Better go check at the infirmary,
I'll go with you.

222
00:31:02,414 --> 00:31:03,938
Where have they gone?

223
00:31:04,848 --> 00:31:06,168
Bro, you sit there.

224
00:31:13,281 --> 00:31:14,381
Give me your hand.

225
00:31:19,748 --> 00:31:21,117
What are you looking at?

226
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:23,948
I'm looking at a kind person.

227
00:31:26,403 --> 00:31:28,820
Kind? Okay.

228
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,166
Ouch.

229
00:31:32,748 --> 00:31:36,528
What's up? Isn't it just a scratch?

230
00:31:36,608 --> 00:31:39,612
Bank, can you properly dress the wound?

231
00:31:39,692 --> 00:31:43,282
Who would use alcohol,
they use saline solution.

232
00:31:44,337 --> 00:31:45,942
Ouch, it stings.

233
00:31:46,022 --> 00:31:48,706
I didn't know that, sorry.

234
00:31:50,281 --> 00:31:52,000
I'll find a saline solution.

235
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,834
Here.

236
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:57,936
Are you worried about me?

237
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,955
No, I'm not.

238
00:32:00,295 --> 00:32:02,801
I just take responsibility for what I did.

239
00:32:03,914 --> 00:32:05,594
Not like someone.

240
00:32:16,452 --> 00:32:20,863
How do you know I'm irresponsible?

241
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:49,658
Bank.

242
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:54,568
What's up?

243
00:32:55,543 --> 00:32:58,665
I'm asking,
do you want to go home with me?

244
00:32:58,745 --> 00:33:00,036
Yeah, sure, sure.

245
00:33:00,116 --> 00:33:01,778
Bank will come home with me.

246
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:06,730
Hold on, bro. When did I say that?

247
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:11,414
You are the one who hurt me.
It's your responsibility.

248
00:33:14,048 --> 00:33:16,914
So, are we going?

249
00:33:18,481 --> 00:33:20,203
Alright.

250
00:33:20,781 --> 00:33:23,166
Okay, I'll leave first.

251
00:33:42,681 --> 00:33:43,992
Can I see your wound?

252
00:33:46,802 --> 00:33:48,900
-Are you naughty?
-Ouch!

253
00:33:49,447 --> 00:33:50,747
Bye.

254
00:33:53,425 --> 00:33:54,786
Wait for me!

255
00:34:03,114 --> 00:34:04,423
Damn it all!

256
00:34:19,948 --> 00:34:22,647
Dinner is ready, young master.

257
00:34:50,681 --> 00:34:51,694
What about yours?

258
00:34:52,609 --> 00:34:55,329
I thought that you'd like to eat
by yourself,

259
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,952
without having me.

260
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,432
I didn't give the order.
What right do you have to decide that?

261
00:35:04,707 --> 00:35:09,545
I think it's more appropriate this way,
for us.

262
00:35:10,612 --> 00:35:11,839
Why?

263
00:35:14,444 --> 00:35:18,448
Because you think
you're a bodyguard. Right?

264
00:35:22,481 --> 00:35:23,574
Fine!

265
00:35:25,571 --> 00:35:27,470
If you want to be like this...

266
00:35:28,361 --> 00:35:30,719
Get out of here, go!

267
00:35:31,325 --> 00:35:33,990
Seeing your face ruins my appetite.

268
00:35:37,414 --> 00:35:40,018
Go, get out!

269
00:36:21,781 --> 00:36:23,356
Do you want to come inside?

270
00:36:25,081 --> 00:36:26,104
No.

271
00:36:27,036 --> 00:36:28,649
There's no reason to go inside.

272
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:32,186
Get off, get off.

273
00:36:45,248 --> 00:36:46,161
Give it back.

274
00:36:51,448 --> 00:36:52,646
Hey, wait!

275
00:36:54,814 --> 00:36:56,661
I have something to tell you.

276
00:36:56,741 --> 00:36:58,327
What do you want?

277
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,416
That day you asked me.

278
00:37:07,714 --> 00:37:09,129
What was that?

279
00:37:09,209 --> 00:37:10,316
I don't know.

280
00:37:10,759 --> 00:37:14,469
How can you not know? You kissed me.

281
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,741
I don't know. I don't!

282
00:37:18,748 --> 00:37:22,119
I can't answer it myself. What it was.

283
00:37:23,648 --> 00:37:27,881
I only knew that
I've never felt this way towards anyone.

284
00:37:29,759 --> 00:37:32,822
I only have this feelings toward you.

285
00:37:36,502 --> 00:37:40,907
Are you satisfied with the answer?

286
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:43,599
Yeah.

287
00:37:47,881 --> 00:37:49,899
You're not mad anymore, right?

288
00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:53,263
Ouch!

289
00:37:55,714 --> 00:37:57,550
What are you doing?

290
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:01,885
Not yet, your answer is fine
but not in the right spot.

291
00:38:02,857 --> 00:38:03,981
See you later.

292
00:38:04,061 --> 00:38:05,644
Aren't you going to come in?

293
00:38:07,414 --> 00:38:08,787
No is no.

294
00:38:17,481 --> 00:38:18,690
Bank...

295
00:38:19,848 --> 00:38:21,123
Drive safe.

296
00:38:24,114 --> 00:38:25,337
I'm worried.

297
00:38:26,068 --> 00:38:28,674
Thanks, Pitch.

298
00:38:32,514 --> 00:38:33,734
Bye.

299
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:10,214
Who the hell are you?

300
00:39:13,548 --> 00:39:15,467
Father sent me to protect you.

301
00:39:15,547 --> 00:39:18,131
I'll be staying with you here.

302
00:39:21,393 --> 00:39:22,991
May I come in?

303
00:40:07,659 --> 00:40:10,843
Just admit it, what do you think of me?

304
00:40:11,369 --> 00:40:13,721
I'm just a young master's bodyguard.

305
00:40:16,448 --> 00:40:18,719
No right to think otherwise.

306
00:41:07,982 --> 00:41:10,000
I'm sorry. I broke your treasure.

307
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,309
I'll buy you a new one.

308
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,811
It's okay.

309
00:41:18,881 --> 00:41:22,642
It's late and windy.

310
00:41:23,996 --> 00:41:25,478
You should get inside, young master.

311
00:41:36,809 --> 00:41:38,795
Are you doing this because it's your job?

312
00:41:44,624 --> 00:41:46,077
You should get to bed.

313
00:41:46,722 --> 00:41:49,993
There'll be an early morning class.
Don't stay up late.

314
00:41:51,026 --> 00:41:53,064
Stop ordering me around.

315
00:41:53,796 --> 00:41:56,914
I'll sleep or not
is none of your business.

316
00:41:58,748 --> 00:42:01,058
I was listening to you,

317
00:42:02,614 --> 00:42:05,011
because I thought
you actually care about me.

318
00:42:05,383 --> 00:42:11,901
But now I know,
you're just doing your job.

319
00:42:15,483 --> 00:42:18,283
There isn't going to be any trouble.

320
00:42:19,981 --> 00:42:22,125
I will tell my dad to change a bodyguard.

321
00:42:27,414 --> 00:42:28,831
-Young master...
-I don't want you...

322
00:42:28,911 --> 00:42:30,125
to be my bodyguard anymore.

323
00:42:32,382 --> 00:42:33,914
I don't want to see you again.

324
00:44:33,581 --> 00:44:34,894
Who are you calling?

325
00:44:37,248 --> 00:44:38,616
I'm reporting to Father.

326
00:44:39,781 --> 00:44:40,914
No need.

327
00:44:41,614 --> 00:44:43,412
But they're acting more violently.

328
00:44:44,189 --> 00:44:45,969
I'll tell Father to take care of it.

329
00:44:46,881 --> 00:44:48,833
What if I ask you not to tell dad.

330
00:44:49,651 --> 00:44:51,443
Why is that, young master?

331
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:54,429
Your life is in danger, young master.

332
00:44:55,748 --> 00:44:57,157
Please don't be stubborn.

333
00:44:57,424 --> 00:45:00,269
I'm not stubborn. But I know too well.

334
00:45:00,677 --> 00:45:03,188
You know how my dad is.

335
00:45:05,581 --> 00:45:07,499
Take revenge in a vicious cycle.

336
00:45:11,048 --> 00:45:13,149
I don't want to see that anymore.

337
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:21,651
More importantly, having you is enough.

338
00:45:22,439 --> 00:45:25,342
I believe that you can protect me.

339
00:45:28,981 --> 00:45:30,438
Alright,

340
00:45:31,515 --> 00:45:32,910
I won't tell Father.

341
00:45:36,548 --> 00:45:38,357
May I have my phone?

342
00:46:34,214 --> 00:46:36,189
What's the matter, Sun?

343
00:46:37,057 --> 00:46:39,563
Father, the other day,

344
00:46:40,337 --> 00:46:42,409
Sakkhee sent his guy
to beat up young master.

345
00:46:44,081 --> 00:46:46,882
The other day? Why did you just tell me?

346
00:46:48,381 --> 00:46:52,935
It's young master's order.
He's afraid you might be worried.

347
00:46:53,898 --> 00:46:55,323
So why tell me now?

348
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:02,452
Young master wants a replacement.

349
00:47:03,518 --> 00:47:05,924
Replacement? What to replace?

350
00:47:08,714 --> 00:47:11,608
Did you make him angry?

351
00:47:15,647 --> 00:47:19,158
Dang my son,
he's really been spoiled rotten.

352
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:25,881
Out of all my underlings,
you are the best of them.

353
00:47:27,181 --> 00:47:31,947
I want to be his bodyguard
until you get rid of Sakkhee.

354
00:47:32,848 --> 00:47:34,285
Perhaps.

355
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,768
Will young master agree with that?

356
00:47:40,848 --> 00:47:43,335
You don't have to worry about it.
I'll handle that.

357
00:47:44,013 --> 00:47:47,429
Do your best, taking care of Sky.

358
00:47:49,081 --> 00:47:52,707
I'll protect young master with my life.

359
00:48:07,133 --> 00:48:08,251
Shane!

360
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,380
Yes, boss.

361
00:48:12,814 --> 00:48:15,006
I have an order for you.

362
00:48:15,548 --> 00:48:18,157
Gather everyone here.

363
00:48:18,676 --> 00:48:19,707
Yes, sir.

364
00:48:46,922 --> 00:48:48,323
On that shelf too!

365
00:48:49,748 --> 00:48:51,034
Hurry, pack that too.

366
00:48:56,548 --> 00:48:57,782
What's that smoke?

367
00:48:58,955 --> 00:49:00,674
This is bad, this is bad, Boss!

368
00:49:00,754 --> 00:49:03,931
The factory is on fire.
Our warehouse burnt down to ash, Boss.

369
00:49:04,011 --> 00:49:04,903
Holy shit!

370
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:07,256
Hey, you fool, quickly pack them up.

371
00:49:07,336 --> 00:49:11,229
Hurry up,
my goods, it's all burning out.

372
00:49:13,581 --> 00:49:14,776
Hey, hurry up.

373
00:49:18,534 --> 00:49:19,772
Phu.

374
00:49:23,244 --> 00:49:24,430
Is this your doing?

375
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:28,396
I warned you, Sakkhee.
Don't mess with my son.

376
00:49:28,476 --> 00:49:29,993
But you didn't listen.

377
00:49:30,073 --> 00:49:33,336
Boss, the cops
have cordoned off the building.

378
00:49:34,116 --> 00:49:36,664
Phu, I won't let you get away with this.

379
00:49:36,744 --> 00:49:39,112
Mind your own business.

380
00:49:41,678 --> 00:49:42,676
Damn it!

381
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:45,719
We need to leave now.

382
00:49:56,341 --> 00:49:58,102
Sun!

383
00:50:01,011 --> 00:50:04,023
Did you call my dad
saying I want another guy?

384
00:50:05,378 --> 00:50:06,950
-Young master.
-Why?

385
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:10,126
You want to leave so badly
you had to tell him?

386
00:50:12,471 --> 00:50:13,930
You're happy now?

387
00:50:16,111 --> 00:50:19,548
Dad said after everything's clear,
he'll send another guy.

388
00:51:22,232 --> 00:51:24,104
I want to ask you out on a date.
(Next episode)

389
00:51:24,184 --> 00:51:25,774
What is your problem?

390
00:51:25,854 --> 00:51:28,877
Just admit it,
that you also have feelings for me.

391
00:51:31,557 --> 00:51:33,985
Your dad has stabbed me badly.

392
00:51:35,583 --> 00:51:37,128
I'll wipe him off.

393
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,748
Wake up now. Can you hear me?

394
00:51:48,828 --> 00:51:51,067
How can I live without you?

395
00:51:51,147 --> 00:51:52,772
Sun!
