00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:25,196
Damn it. What the heck!

2
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,421
Father sent me here to look after you.

3
00:00:32,501 --> 00:00:34,968
So I have to live here with you.

4
00:00:35,372 --> 00:00:36,474
Are you out of your mind?

5
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,060
Hey! Don't come in!

=Golden Blood=

17
00:01:37,122 --> 00:01:38,345
A bodyguard?

18
00:01:38,425 --> 00:01:41,018
I've already enrolled him
in the same faculty as you.

19
00:01:41,098 --> 00:01:44,965
But I don't like this.
You have to bring your underling back.

20
00:01:45,526 --> 00:01:47,566
I'll let you study there.

21
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:49,911
But you can only go there
under my conditions.

22
00:01:49,991 --> 00:01:53,701
But I don't want anyone
to keep an eye on me.

23
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:55,247
You must live with him.

24
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:58,693
Non-negotiable. Understood?

25
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:04,545
Hey, what? For real?

26
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,708
This is my house. What are you doing?

27
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:11,110
I am doing a security check for you,
young master.

28
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,826
But it's annoying.

29
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:16,859
It is my duty and my responsibility.
Please understand that.

30
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:20,630
It is my duty and my responsibility.
Please understand, huh.

31
00:02:21,562 --> 00:02:23,125
Alright, do whatever you want.

32
00:02:28,096 --> 00:02:30,797
If you want to stay here, fine.
I will go somewhere else.

33
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,481
Fuck, did I forget my key?

34
00:02:48,312 --> 00:02:49,744
Hey, stop!

35
00:03:04,992 --> 00:03:09,556
Sun, this is Bank. My buddy.

36
00:03:09,636 --> 00:03:12,004
Bank, this is Sun. My cousin.

37
00:03:12,084 --> 00:03:14,384
He got accepted
to the same university as us.

38
00:03:14,464 --> 00:03:16,908
Why have you never told me
that you have a relative?

39
00:03:18,427 --> 00:03:21,366
He's a distant relative of mine.

40
00:03:21,818 --> 00:03:25,258
When my dad knew that we're going to
the same university he sent him here.

41
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:26,369
Right, Sun?

42
00:03:28,005 --> 00:03:29,250
So why are you here?

43
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:32,859
I was going to invite you to lunch, Sky.

44
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:34,133
I think you..

45
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:37,782
I am full.
Anyway, thanks for coming today.

46
00:03:38,213 --> 00:03:40,941
See you tomorrow. I will walk you out.

47
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:42,153
Yeah, alright

48
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,300
I'll fight back this time.

49
00:04:01,943 --> 00:04:03,593
Dang, come on, man.

50
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:05,103
What the hell on earth?

51
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:08,934
-Young master.
-Who is that?

52
00:04:09,393 --> 00:04:10,429
Sun?

53
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,531
Yes, is everything alright?

54
00:04:13,611 --> 00:04:15,851
The water is not running, can't you see?

55
00:04:15,931 --> 00:04:17,638
Ouch, my eyes hurt.

56
00:04:18,781 --> 00:04:19,863
Let's get out of here.

57
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:22,910
Wait, wait, wait, do you see anything?

58
00:04:24,747 --> 00:04:25,826
Nothing.

59
00:04:26,278 --> 00:04:29,153
Why can't you see? I'm naked.

60
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:30,546
It's covered with bubbles.

61
00:04:31,582 --> 00:04:34,874
Bubble? Did you just say I'm tiny? Huh?

62
00:04:34,954 --> 00:04:36,363
You want to get into trouble, Sun?

63
00:04:39,216 --> 00:04:40,338
Not tiny.

64
00:04:40,725 --> 00:04:45,689
Yeah right. Wait, so you saw it then.
Did you lie to me, Sun?

65
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:47,159
I think we should go outside.

66
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:27,474
All done.

67
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:34,550
Just now, I locked the door.
How did you get in?

68
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:39,064
Just picked a lock. It's very simple.

69
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,994
Pardon me?

70
00:06:20,485 --> 00:06:23,014
Are you looking for your class?
I can take you there.

71
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:27,805
I'm fine, but thanks.

72
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,461
-Don't be shy.
-Never mind.

73
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,798
I'll carry that.

74
00:06:31,878 --> 00:06:33,686
I think she's not shy...

75
00:06:44,522 --> 00:06:46,601
but more like disgusted.

76
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:48,414
It's none of your business.

77
00:06:48,937 --> 00:06:49,937
Try me.

78
00:06:54,757 --> 00:06:55,725
See you later.

79
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,906
Thank you.

80
00:07:04,986 --> 00:07:06,114
No problem.

81
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:08,804
I'm Toktaeng.

82
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:12,571
Toktaeng? What a cool name you have.

83
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:17,245
My parents are interior designers,
that's how I got my name.

84
00:07:17,325 --> 00:07:23,735
Well, do you know where room 413 is?

85
00:07:24,255 --> 00:07:25,958
Room 413?

86
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,060
We're going there too.
Want to come with us?

87
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,124
Really?

88
00:07:31,224 --> 00:07:32,241
Sure.

89
00:07:34,558 --> 00:07:38,552
Mr.Bank, does your dad work in a bank?

90
00:07:38,632 --> 00:07:40,955
Yeah, Sun, how do you know?

91
00:07:42,443 --> 00:07:43,471
Sun?

92
00:07:44,051 --> 00:07:47,093
Why do you want to study Fine Arts?

93
00:07:47,647 --> 00:07:49,647
I like to draw since I was a kid.

94
00:07:50,086 --> 00:07:53,992
Really? I like it since birth.

95
00:07:54,722 --> 00:07:55,909
You like to draw?

96
00:07:55,989 --> 00:07:58,461
I like you, TokTaeng.

97
00:07:58,542 --> 00:08:01,028
So lame, Bank.

98
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:04,134
Juno.

99
00:08:04,214 --> 00:08:05,250
TokTaeng!

100
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:07,584
Oops!

101
00:08:20,452 --> 00:08:21,564
Are you okay?

102
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:24,859
Did I almost fall and embarrass myself?

103
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:25,807
Yeah.

104
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,476
Thank you.

105
00:08:32,556 --> 00:08:34,001
Toktaeng's friend?

106
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:39,227
I'm Sky. This guy's Bank and that is Sun.

107
00:08:44,016 --> 00:08:45,708
Hey, you can take this seat.

108
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:51,783
Thanks.

109
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:03,282
Just the first day and you already
made a move on a girl.

110
00:09:17,381 --> 00:09:19,060
Why did you tell my dad about Toktaeng?

111
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:22,636
My duty is to report your daily life
to Father every day.

112
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:24,932
But it doesn't have to be everything.

113
00:09:25,012 --> 00:09:27,888
What if he doesn't allow me
to have a girlfriend, what'd you do?

114
00:09:28,732 --> 00:09:30,952
I respected all Father's decisions.

115
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,894
But I don't.

116
00:09:45,112 --> 00:09:46,361
Why don't you dodge that?

117
00:09:47,405 --> 00:09:49,244
Wasn't it your order?

118
00:10:00,592 --> 00:10:04,685
I'd better go shower.
Dinner will be ready soon.

119
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,351
Cheers to you, beauty?

120
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:31,934
May I?

121
00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:33,674
Sure.

122
00:10:34,378 --> 00:10:37,798
One is cute, another one is gorgeous,
I can't choose.

123
00:10:51,206 --> 00:10:53,377
Do you have any problems with my juniors?

124
00:10:57,273 --> 00:10:58,203
Yeah?

125
00:10:58,283 --> 00:10:59,531
Nothing, man.

126
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:00,526
Let's go guys.

127
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,992
I thought we would get beaten up.

128
00:11:08,115 --> 00:11:09,959
How come are you here, Pitch?

129
00:11:10,743 --> 00:11:12,470
Well, my friends ditched me.

130
00:11:12,927 --> 00:11:17,915
They told me to save their seats,
but never showed up.

131
00:11:18,663 --> 00:11:19,671
Really?

132
00:11:19,751 --> 00:11:22,171
Are you two alright?

133
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,264
We're good.

134
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:28,416
May I sit with you?
So they won't come to bother you again.

135
00:11:33,997 --> 00:11:35,291
Sky, come sit here.

136
00:11:37,628 --> 00:11:40,383
Who teaches you to stand over
your senior shoulder.

137
00:11:40,724 --> 00:11:42,278
No one ever told you?

138
00:11:43,878 --> 00:11:47,110
Let's order to our heart content,
the bill's on Sky.

139
00:11:48,045 --> 00:11:49,238
Really, Sky?

140
00:11:50,727 --> 00:11:52,001
Cheers!

141
00:11:53,489 --> 00:11:56,250
Don't think too much. Cheers!

142
00:11:56,907 --> 00:11:58,804
I'll go to the bathroom.

143
00:11:59,295 --> 00:12:02,530
What a loser, Cheers.

144
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:07,347
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

145
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:10,633
Hey! I saw you did that on purpose.

146
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,533
Hey, my friend said he's sorry.
What do you want?

147
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:16,224
Hey, Bank.

148
00:12:21,622 --> 00:12:22,685
Hey.

149
00:12:49,918 --> 00:12:51,167
Young master!

150
00:12:59,104 --> 00:13:01,308
Pitch, you take them home now.

151
00:13:01,388 --> 00:13:02,368
Okay.

152
00:13:03,294 --> 00:13:05,008
Juno, Toktaeng, let's go now.

153
00:13:05,587 --> 00:13:06,576
Bank.

154
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:12,884
Let me go. I'll go help my friend.

155
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,452
Toktaeng and Juno,
can you get home by yourself?

156
00:13:27,532 --> 00:13:28,734
What about Sky and Sun?

157
00:13:28,814 --> 00:13:30,472
Sun will take care of everything.

158
00:13:30,552 --> 00:13:31,630
And Bank?

159
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,652
You should go home.

160
00:13:34,868 --> 00:13:36,871
I'll take care of this guy.

161
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,795
Bank.

162
00:13:51,681 --> 00:13:52,854
Ouch, it hurts.

163
00:13:53,885 --> 00:13:55,625
Can you be more gentle?

164
00:13:55,705 --> 00:13:57,870
Who told you to run into trouble
like that?

165
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,840
I didn't start it. They did.

166
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,085
Young master,

167
00:14:03,752 --> 00:14:06,797
do you know how precious your blood is?

168
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:12,199
Even if they wanted to pick a fight,
you shouldn't get involved.

169
00:14:16,435 --> 00:14:20,032
I helped you just now too.

170
00:14:27,665 --> 00:14:30,910
Are you hurt anywhere else?

171
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,230
Nope.

172
00:14:34,675 --> 00:14:37,864
-Auntie.
-Do you want these?

173
00:14:38,384 --> 00:14:41,008
Yeah, how much?

174
00:14:41,488 --> 00:14:44,859
-Twenty baht each.
-Just a moment.

175
00:14:57,644 --> 00:15:00,388
The cash is too big.
Sorry, I don't have enough changes.

176
00:15:01,173 --> 00:15:04,815
No worries, I'll take all those.
Can I have the basket too?

177
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:06,732
Sure. Thank you so much!

178
00:15:10,846 --> 00:15:14,630
Little one, can you come here for a sec?

179
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,966
I want to give these to you
for your educational fund.

180
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:33,284
Thank you very much.

181
00:15:33,777 --> 00:15:35,072
Thank you so much!

182
00:15:35,152 --> 00:15:36,835

00:36:16,289 --> 00:36:17,332
Young master!

362
00:36:20,984 --> 00:36:21,939
Young master.

363
00:36:26,482 --> 00:36:27,484
Sun!

364
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,095
Sun!

365
00:36:54,752 --> 00:36:58,187
Help please! Somebody got hurt. Help!

366
00:36:58,267 --> 00:36:59,698
Damn it!

367
00:36:59,778 --> 00:37:01,631
Hey, they're having a fight.

368
00:37:17,674 --> 00:37:19,386
Sun, Sun!

369
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,666
Sun!

370
00:37:22,008 --> 00:37:23,949
Sun, wake up!

371
00:37:24,051 --> 00:37:25,949
I order you to wake up now, you hear me?

372
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:28,203
Sun!

373
00:37:39,095 --> 00:37:40,424
Sun, wake up!

374
00:37:41,481 --> 00:37:42,618
Wake up.

375
00:37:42,698 --> 00:37:45,525
Sun, you have to be alright.

376
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,463
Help! Please!

377
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,703
Anyone, please!

378
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:21,671
Sun!

379
00:38:22,868 --> 00:38:23,870
Sun!

380
00:38:32,428 --> 00:38:34,346
Wake up, Sun!

381
00:38:36,417 --> 00:38:38,753
Sun, you can't die on me.

382
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:39,913
Sun...

383
00:39:50,455 --> 00:39:54,369
Who wants to kill me?

384
00:40:05,824 --> 00:40:06,914
Hey.

385
00:40:06,994 --> 00:40:10,269
Are you still hoping that
I would accept the deal?

386
00:40:11,018 --> 00:40:13,741
Just let me trade in your territory,

387
00:40:14,213 --> 00:40:18,230
while you stand there watching
and get a piece of the pie.

388
00:40:18,793 --> 00:40:22,101
I can't stand you or any damn one
trading drugs around here.

389
00:40:22,835 --> 00:40:24,297
I'll give you some time.

390
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,774
You better watch out.

391
00:40:31,737 --> 00:40:33,272
I mean your golf ball.

392
00:40:38,295 --> 00:40:42,456
So, Father sent me
to protect young master.

393
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:49,329
He knows that Sakkhee
won't back off easily.

394
00:40:51,299 --> 00:40:52,421
Now, I know.

395
00:40:57,341 --> 00:40:59,150
I understand what's happened.

396
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,201
Thank you, you always take care of me.

397
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,075
I'm ready.

398
00:41:29,903 --> 00:41:32,688
Are you sure, young master?

399
00:41:33,922 --> 00:41:38,903
I don't want you to get hurt
because of me anymore.

400
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,702
Ouch, that hurts so bad.

401
00:41:58,696 --> 00:42:01,891
You have a lot to practice, young master.

402
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,516
I know your weakness.

403
00:42:34,622 --> 00:42:35,930
Hey, young master!

404
00:42:36,257 --> 00:42:39,619
-Stop, young master, please.
-Aren't you a bad-ass?

405
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,945

We've got some big sponsors,

459
00:46:59,729 --> 00:47:04,873
and the rest is up to you guys
to do a fundraiser.

460
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:08,656
Can I go to the volunteer camp?

461
00:47:09,884 --> 00:47:13,403
I know that you want
to live like an ordinary kid.

462
00:47:14,176 --> 00:47:20,360
Moreover, it's a club activity.
It'd be strange if we won't go.

463
00:47:23,084 --> 00:47:26,194
We just have to be more careful.

464
00:47:27,634 --> 00:47:30,507
Anyway, leave that to my worries.

465
00:47:33,804 --> 00:47:36,085

00:48:16,255 --> 00:48:18,958

00:48:26,911 --> 00:48:28,122

Have some, you won't get cold.

471
00:48:32,479 --> 00:48:33,717
Try them.

475
00:48:41,298 --> 00:48:44,535
Tell me if you want anything.
I'll go home then.

476
00:48:44,615 --> 00:48:46,111
Sure thing.

477
00:48:48,409 --> 00:48:49,560

478
00:48:51,222 --> 00:48:52,440
I don't usually drink.

479
00:48:52,521 --> 00:48:54,718
Just take a sip since we're here.

00:48:58,256 --> 00:49:00,703
Hurry up!

483
00:49:01,042 --> 00:49:04,810
If he doesn't want to, then I'll do it.

484
00:49:06,592 --> 00:49:08,967
Hey, there you go.

485
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,205

-What the heck?
-I think he's pretty much wasted.

492
00:50:05,924 --> 00:50:09,403
-I'm not drunk!
-What the heck, Sky? We're having fun.

493
00:50:09,483 --> 00:50:11,528
Sun, come with me.

494
00:50:26,383 --> 00:50:28,457
Hey, it's all wet.

495
00:50:31,083 --> 00:50:33,620
What the hell, I'm drenched.

496
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,141
How refreshing.

497
00:50:46,244 --> 00:50:47,809
How are you?

498
00:51:08,997 --> 00:51:12,064
You're kind of cute when you're drunk.

499
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,186
Then...

500
00:51:26,256 --> 00:51:27,560
Did you fall for me?

501
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,430
I don't know.

502
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:49,699
You wash up first, I'll wait outside.

503
00:51:57,464 --> 00:51:58,553
Okay.

504
00:52:30,541 --> 00:52:31,706
See?

505
00:52:31,786 --> 00:52:33,591
Act like you could take care of it all.

506
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:36,726
But when you're drinking,
it turns out you're lightweight.

507
00:52:37,828 --> 00:52:42,037
I'm not a lightweight.
But because it's unfamiliar liquor.

508
00:52:42,521 --> 00:52:45,706
And you took the drinks for me?
Served you right.

509
00:52:45,786 --> 00:52:48,243
Well, good thing
I was drunk instead of you.

510
00:52:48,672 --> 00:52:50,758
So, I have to take care of you instead?

511
00:52:51,874 --> 00:52:52,941
I'm sorry.

512
00:52:54,656 --> 00:52:57,060
Oh, come on, I was joking.

513
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:03,103
Sun, last night
you were pretty cute, you know.

514
00:53:07,334 --> 00:53:10,572
I was a little tipsy.

515
00:53:10,652 --> 00:53:12,924
But I had a clear picture
of your dance moves.

516
00:53:13,004 --> 00:53:14,097
Like this...

517
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:28,496
I swear I'm not going to drink again.

518
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:34,697
Moreover, I was such a burden
to Sky last night.

519
00:53:36,154 --> 00:53:39,260
It was a fun night.
He wouldn't blame you.

520
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:40,456
Right, Sky?

521
00:53:41,773 --> 00:53:45,776
Yeah, having a bit of fun
ain't kill nobody.

522
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:54,493
How are you? You're all right?

523
00:53:54,573 --> 00:53:56,091
They're all gone.

524
00:54:01,824 --> 00:54:03,016
I feel better now.

525
00:54:04,771 --> 00:54:07,397
I've got a good helper. Thank you.

526
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:14,521
I heard that you're going
to teach English today.

527
00:54:15,202 --> 00:54:16,565
Can I accompany you?

528
00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:19,279
Sounds good.

529
00:54:20,165 --> 00:54:22,602
Juno, are you okay with that?

530
00:54:22,682 --> 00:54:24,703
Then I'll be with Sun today.

531
00:54:28,745 --> 00:54:32,659
You don't have to. My job is heavy labor.

532
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,764
You'll get too tired.

533
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:37,283
Not at all.

534
00:54:37,363 --> 00:54:41,455
I'm used to heavy labor.
I'm actually pretty tough.

535
00:54:42,006 --> 00:54:45,237
Just being near you is good enough.

536
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:49,819
Let's go, Toktaeng.

537
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,557
Don't follow them.

538
00:54:58,588 --> 00:55:01,500
I think they want some privacy.

539
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:13,680
Do you think there's something weird?

540
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:20,275
Yeah, weird, a distant relative
but they're very close.

541
00:55:21,253 --> 00:55:22,406
That's it.

542
00:55:23,458 --> 00:55:29,666
Last night, Sky was trying
to stand in Juno's way.

543
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,932
He acted like he was jealous.

544
00:55:37,089 --> 00:55:38,260
I think so, too.

545
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:41,865
Wow, you're awesome.

546
00:55:49,495 --> 00:55:53,349
Okay, you and I, we should dig into it.

547
00:55:54,436 --> 00:55:58,007
To find the truth.
What is going on between them?

548
00:55:58,469 --> 00:55:59,581
(Child Development Center Nhong Bak Keab)

549
00:55:59,661 --> 00:56:03,464
F-A-T...

550
00:56:03,544 --> 00:56:07,861
H-E-R.

551
00:56:07,941 --> 00:56:10,355
Father.

552
00:56:10,435 --> 00:56:14,210
Speak louder.

553
00:56:14,625 --> 00:56:15,920
Next.

554
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,792
M-O-T...

555
00:56:20,872 --> 00:56:25,597
H-E-R.

556
00:56:25,677 --> 00:56:27,829
Mother.

557
00:56:27,909 --> 00:56:30,790
Mother.

558
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:34,373
-Repeat.
-Repeat.

559
00:56:34,453 --> 00:56:37,363
-Brother.
-Yes, sweety?

560
00:56:37,443 --> 00:56:40,355
Are you two, a father and a mother?

561
00:56:42,226 --> 00:56:46,068
No, we are friends.

562
00:56:46,148 --> 00:56:47,375
Just friends.

563
00:56:49,587 --> 00:56:53,298
A lover..

564
00:56:53,378 --> 00:56:54,742
It's not like that.

565
00:56:57,113 --> 00:56:59,392
Sun, you should take a break.

566
00:57:01,086 --> 00:57:02,886
You have sweat all over.

567
00:57:04,013 --> 00:57:06,287
No big deal. This is nothing.

568
00:57:17,762 --> 00:57:20,799
We are just friends for now.

569
00:57:21,731 --> 00:57:25,833
But we don't know
what we might be in the future.

570
00:57:30,059 --> 00:57:36,649
Lovers. Lovers. Lovers.

571
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:40,598
All right guys. Back to our lesson.

572
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:48,234
Hey, you don't have to follow me around.

573
00:57:48,658 --> 00:57:52,563
It's all right.
Yesterday I was a burden to you.

574
00:57:53,573 --> 00:57:55,681
So, today, I'll do my best on my duty.

575
00:57:59,563 --> 00:58:00,947
Did you fall for me?

576
00:58:06,493 --> 00:58:08,131
Do you love me?

577
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,352
What are they talking about?

578
00:58:19,191 --> 00:58:21,255
We have to get closer.

579
00:58:23,004 --> 00:58:25,230
I can't hear a thing. Let's go.

580
00:58:26,525 --> 00:58:30,794
Hey, are you stupid?

581
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:34,349
If we get closer,
they'll see us eavesdropping.

582
00:58:49,293 --> 00:58:51,789
Do you remember anything
that happened last night?

583
00:58:55,456 --> 00:58:56,578
Sun.

584
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:06,836
Hey, Sun is gone.

585
00:59:10,718 --> 00:59:13,129
-What is it?
-You look.

586
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:22,781
Ant nest!

587
00:59:22,861 --> 00:59:25,232
Ouch, it's itchy!

588
00:59:36,084 --> 00:59:38,410
Damn, so itchy.

589
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:39,662
Go to the shore.

590
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:51,393
-Itchy.
-What itchy?

591
00:59:51,473 --> 00:59:52,842
It's itchy, ants bite.

592
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:54,675
-Still have them?
-Yeah.

593
00:59:54,755 --> 00:59:56,173
Take it off.

594
00:59:56,253 --> 00:59:57,567
-Hey.
-What?

595
00:59:57,647 --> 00:59:59,286
No, I don't want to take it off.

596
00:59:59,366 --> 01:00:01,423
You don't have to be embarrassed.
I've seen you naked.

597
01:00:01,503 --> 01:00:04,005
-I don't want to.
-Take off your shirt.

598
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:27,450
Hey!

599
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:30,560
Your nose is bleeding!

600
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,013
Hey, blood!

601
01:00:40,259 --> 01:00:42,991
Come here, I'll wipe it off.

602
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,851
I think we should get out.

603
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:14,890
Wait for me.

604
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:37,008
What a beautiful starry night.

605
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:40,901
Seeing them reminds me of Father's house.

606
01:01:41,452 --> 01:01:47,512
But I don't miss that place.
It's more beautiful here.

607
01:01:48,442 --> 01:01:50,032
More freedom.

608
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:53,176
Was it that suffocating?

609
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:57,248
Not with you.

610
01:01:58,314 --> 01:02:05,154
I mean it was suffocating
when dad kept an eye on me all the time.

611
01:02:07,635 --> 01:02:09,275
So, I applied to a university in Bangkok.

612
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:15,173
Anyhow, I don't mind that.

613
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,407
Now that...

614
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:25,437
Now that...

615
01:02:26,508 --> 01:02:31,228
I can be here watching the stars.
I'm happy. That's all.

616
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:52,803
I apologize.

617
01:02:54,459 --> 01:02:56,476
Did I make you feel uncomfortable?

618
01:02:57,310 --> 01:03:02,743
No, I was just surprised. No harm done.

619
01:03:03,916 --> 01:03:05,923
I'm afraid you'd feel uncomfortable.

620
01:03:06,375 --> 01:03:07,399
It's fine.

621
01:03:21,696 --> 01:03:22,927
Can I ask you something?

622
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:28,708
Do you remember anything from last night?

623
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:39,842
Nothing at all.

624
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:42,896
I was heavily drunk.

625
01:03:47,312 --> 01:03:50,656
Did anything happen, young master?

626
01:03:53,043 --> 01:03:54,090
Nothing.

627
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:56,960
Just asking.

628
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:05,066
What if,

629
01:04:05,531 --> 01:04:07,425
you are not my bodyguard.

630
01:04:08,603 --> 01:04:12,646
Would you still help me out like this?

631
01:04:13,893 --> 01:04:15,229
Absolutely, I will.

632
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,427
Because I...

633
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:28,979
You what?

634
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:35,679
Tell me.

643

We should head back. It's getting late.

644
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:28,371
I can stand by myself.

645
01:05:33,133 --> 01:05:35,096
Young master, why are you upset?

646
01:05:36,484 --> 01:05:38,307
How do you feel about me?

647
01:05:46,023 --> 01:05:49,453
Why won't you answer? Tell me.

648
01:05:49,957 --> 01:05:51,728
How do you really feel about me?

649
01:06:01,428 --> 01:06:02,729
How do I feel?

650
01:06:04,464 --> 01:06:05,888
It's not important.

651
01:06:05,968 --> 01:06:07,263
You're talking to me.

652
01:06:08,308 --> 01:06:10,129
Look up at my face.

653
01:06:12,349 --> 01:06:17,660
Tell me, what does "not important" mean?

654
01:06:19,127 --> 01:06:20,647
I am just a bodyguard.

655
01:06:22,919 --> 01:06:25,127
My only duty is to protect you.

656
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:27,872
So, you only think of me as your boss?

657
01:06:28,335 --> 01:06:30,520
I have no right to think otherwise.

658
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,317
Can you stop being stubborn?

659
01:06:32,784 --> 01:06:35,359
There is no one else around here.

660
01:06:37,488 --> 01:06:42,010
I know that you feel something for me.

661
01:06:43,059 --> 01:06:46,725
Otherwise, last night,
you wouldn't ask me that.

662
01:06:49,511 --> 01:06:52,567
Just admit it, how do you feel about me?

663
01:06:59,831 --> 01:07:02,250
I'm only a young master's bodyguard.

664
01:07:05,026 --> 01:07:07,140
I have no right to think otherwise.

665
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:13,765
If you said so, I won't bother you again.

666
01:08:10,970 --> 01:08:13,986
This represents my heart.

667
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:19,286
And this is yours, young master.

668
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:29,132
I'm just a bodyguard.

669
01:08:33,507 --> 01:08:35,521
My only duty is to protect you.

670
01:08:42,435 --> 01:08:45,432
I have no right to be something else.

671
01:11:16,227 --> 01:11:18,762
Pitch, bro.

672
01:11:19,426 --> 01:11:21,055
Can we switch places?

673
01:11:21,135 --> 01:11:22,442
Why?

674
01:11:22,522 --> 01:11:23,737
I'm having a backache.

675
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,918
Alright, alright.

676
01:11:28,102 --> 01:11:29,287
I'm so sleepy.

677
01:11:34,393 --> 01:11:35,375
Hold on, bro.

678
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:40,390
What the hell is it?
Can I get some sleep?

679
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:42,620
My body is aching.

680
01:11:45,775 --> 01:11:49,299
Damn, do you have to be tired
before you can sleep?

681
01:11:52,874 --> 01:11:54,548
Hey, what are you doing?

682
01:11:54,628 --> 01:11:57,523
-You asked for it.
-What?

683
01:11:57,603 --> 01:11:58,607
Godzilla!

684
01:12:01,147 --> 01:12:02,710
A Godzilla?

685
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:05,439
Ticklish Godzilla,
you've ever heard of that?

686
01:12:08,403 --> 01:12:09,872
You aren't sleepy?

687
01:12:09,952 --> 01:12:11,452
You can't sleep?

688
01:12:11,532 --> 01:12:13,764
Hey, stop it, bro. Others might hear us.

689
01:12:52,453 --> 01:12:55,375
Pitch, what was that?

690
01:12:57,693 --> 01:12:58,715
I'm sorry.

691
01:13:00,295 --> 01:13:01,730
Why are you apologizing?

692
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:22,596
Bro, what was that?

693
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:25,901
I don't know.

694
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:32,450
What did you just say?

695
01:13:33,874 --> 01:13:35,401
I said I don't know.

696
01:13:36,693 --> 01:13:40,674
How can you not know? You just kissed me.

697
01:13:40,754 --> 01:13:43,506
It was my fault. Sorry.

698
01:13:45,717 --> 01:13:48,480
Hey, you've got to have a reason.

699
01:13:49,338 --> 01:13:51,307
Why did you kiss me?

700
01:13:51,387 --> 01:13:54,190
What do you want? It was just a kiss.

701
01:14:02,530 --> 01:14:05,739
I'm sleepy. Can we talk
about this tomorrow?

702
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:51,481
I don't need supper today.

703
01:14:55,530 --> 01:14:56,540
Yes, sir.

704
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,278
Are you free today, Toktaeng, Juno?

705
01:15:26,848 --> 01:15:28,596
Absolutely, why?

706
01:15:29,208 --> 01:15:30,715
I want to ask you out for a date.

707
01:15:33,024 --> 01:15:33,948
Cool.

708
01:15:34,437 --> 01:15:35,581
Yes.

709
01:15:44,821 --> 01:15:46,483
Do you know where the restroom is, Juno?

710
01:15:46,563 --> 01:15:48,890
A restroom, over there.

711
01:15:50,150 --> 01:15:52,444
Excuse me for a bit.

712
01:15:52,963 --> 01:15:55,167
Juno, can you take me there?

713
01:15:55,247 --> 01:15:57,629
You guys wait here.
Then we'll go in together.

714
01:16:20,021 --> 01:16:21,447
What do you want from me?

715
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:26,195
Tell me,

716
01:16:26,903 --> 01:16:28,371
you protected me,

717
01:16:29,947 --> 01:16:31,536
did everything for me,

718
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:34,527
you don't have any feelings for me.

719
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:46,799
I...

720
01:16:47,330 --> 01:16:48,443
You what?

721
01:16:50,430 --> 01:16:51,712
You tell me.

722
01:16:57,700 --> 01:17:01,330
Tell me,

Say it!

725
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:20,927
Say it, say you love me.

726
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:23,869

Hey, stop it, be still.

742
01:18:53,233 --> 01:18:54,237
Let go!

743
01:18:58,535 --> 01:18:59,553
Young master.

744
01:19:02,626 --> 01:19:03,470
Sun!

745
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:08,319
Sun!

746
01:19:09,696 --> 01:19:11,143
-Go.
-Sun!

747
01:19:12,344 --> 01:19:13,492
Young master!

748
01:19:16,330 --> 01:19:17,656
Sun!

749
01:19:27,232 --> 01:19:28,446
Who did that to you?

750
01:19:28,526 --> 01:19:29,863
Sky was being kidnapped.

751
01:19:29,943 --> 01:19:30,925
What?

752
01:19:32,027 --> 01:19:35,887
I've downloaded a tracking application
on his phone.

753
01:19:41,285 --> 01:19:42,530
You know what?

754
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:45,883
Your father was a pain in the ass.

755
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,326
This is bad, this is bad, Boss!

756
01:19:57,406 --> 01:20:00,527
The factory is on fire.
Our warehouse burnt down to ash.

757
01:20:01,366 --> 01:20:04,222
This time, I'll make him buried alive.

758
01:20:07,718 --> 01:20:10,123
Have you gone nuts? What will you do?

759
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,695
How's it going, Sakkhee?

760
01:20:17,070 --> 01:20:19,227
Where have you been hidden?

761
01:20:19,734 --> 01:20:23,118
It's not important where I am, it's all.

762
01:20:23,583 --> 01:20:25,284
Who I'm with.

763
01:20:25,686 --> 01:20:27,744
-Dad.
-Sky!

764
01:20:27,824 --> 01:20:29,245
Dad, help me, dad!

765
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:32,167
Sakkhee, what are you doing to him?

766
01:20:36,309 --> 01:20:37,491
Dad, help me!

767
01:20:37,571 --> 01:20:38,560
Sakkhee!

768
01:20:43,306 --> 01:20:45,615
If you hurt him, I'll kill you.

769
01:20:46,084 --> 01:20:48,050
I'll leave his body for you.

770
01:20:48,655 --> 01:20:51,198
If you still remember his face though.

771
01:20:52,828 --> 01:20:53,973
Sakkhee!

772
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:59,395
Boss, Sun just called me.

773
01:20:59,747 --> 01:21:01,111
He's heading to help young master.

774
01:21:01,191 --> 01:21:02,654
I'll end all of this.

775
01:21:02,743 --> 01:21:03,965
Boss, boss!

776
01:21:04,045 --> 01:21:05,783
The nearby factory is on fire.

777
01:21:06,208 --> 01:21:07,759
Why the heck is it on fire?

778
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,063
You two, guard here, the rest follow me.

779
01:21:19,597 --> 01:21:21,595
Hey, it was really his plan.

780
01:21:22,093 --> 01:21:23,994
Hey, the exit is this way.

781
01:21:24,074 --> 01:21:25,171
Thanks, bro!

782
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:28,147
You can't escape now.

783
01:21:28,227 --> 01:21:30,607
Are you really going to do this? Alright.

784
01:21:37,030 --> 01:21:38,654
His moves look scary.

785
01:21:38,734 --> 01:21:39,741
Loser!

786
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:42,815
I'll teach you how we do in a real fight.

787
01:22:40,259 --> 01:22:41,387
Why aren't they back yet?

788
01:22:42,230 --> 01:22:43,158
Yeah, bro.

789
01:23:16,985 --> 01:23:18,699
Your bodyguard, huh.

790
01:23:19,317 --> 01:23:21,404
My underling will beat him to the ground.

791
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,304
You wait just a bit,

792
01:23:23,811 --> 01:23:26,376
I'll let him cut off his head for you.

793
01:23:29,465 --> 01:23:30,539
Dad!

794
01:23:33,872 --> 01:23:34,880
Bastard!

795
01:23:35,630 --> 01:23:36,596
Hey!

796
01:23:37,134 --> 01:23:38,150
Young master.

797
01:23:41,896 --> 01:23:43,357
Hey, you bastard.

798
01:23:45,054 --> 01:23:46,605
You can't get away from me.

799
01:23:54,247 --> 01:23:55,200
Young master!

800
01:24:13,525 --> 01:24:14,472
Young master.

801
01:24:22,898 --> 01:24:24,018
Let's get out of here.

802
01:24:25,509 --> 01:24:27,737
Hurry up, find them!

803
01:24:27,817 --> 01:24:28,813
Go!

804
01:24:33,530 --> 01:24:34,587
Hey!

805
01:24:34,667 --> 01:24:36,983
Stop. Stop...

806
01:24:37,498 --> 01:24:38,847
Stop there!

807
01:24:40,061 --> 01:24:41,337
I said stop!

808
01:24:49,073 --> 01:24:50,505
Hey, over there.

809
01:24:51,687 --> 01:24:53,526
Come on, try me.

810
01:24:53,606 --> 01:24:54,662
Come on.

811
01:24:54,742 --> 01:24:55,725
Go!

812
01:25:06,845 --> 01:25:09,106
Hey, Pitch, what do we do?

813
01:25:09,186 --> 01:25:10,230
Come here.

814
01:25:45,787 --> 01:25:47,121
Out of the way!

815
01:25:55,397 --> 01:25:56,492
Young master.

816
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:05,492
Hey, stay back.

817
01:26:14,192 --> 01:26:15,407
Young master, watch out!

818
01:26:47,630 --> 01:26:48,640
Sun.

819
01:26:49,394 --> 01:26:50,520
Sun.

820
01:26:51,545 --> 01:26:53,911
Stay with me.

821
01:26:53,991 --> 01:26:54,958
Sun.

822
01:27:00,914 --> 01:27:01,953
Go, Shain!

823
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:11,159
Don't leave me, Sun.

824
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:14,790
Don't leave me, Sun.

825
01:27:14,870 --> 01:27:16,131
Sky!

826
01:27:16,211 --> 01:27:18,234
Sun, Sun!

827
01:27:20,111 --> 01:27:21,946
You've got to be alright.

828
01:27:22,026 --> 01:27:23,224
Sun!

829
01:27:26,261 --> 01:27:27,842
Sun, wake up, Sun!

830
01:27:27,922 --> 01:27:30,020
I don't want this, Sun!

831
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:43,995
How can I live without you, Sun.

832
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:49,467
Doctor.

833
01:27:50,039 --> 01:27:51,403
How is he?

834
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:54,411
The bullet didn't injure any main organs.

835
01:27:54,791 --> 01:27:56,894
But the patient has lost a lot of blood.

836
01:27:56,974 --> 01:28:00,453
The hospital
is trying to find more blood for him.

837
01:28:00,764 --> 01:28:03,776
Take my blood, I used to donate my blood.

838
01:28:04,702 --> 01:28:06,823
-Me too.
-You can't.

839
01:28:07,248 --> 01:28:09,518
The patient has a very special blood-type,

840
01:28:09,598 --> 01:28:12,757
called "RH-null" or Golden Blood.

841
01:28:16,262 --> 01:28:17,666
What is it, doc?

842
01:28:19,445 --> 01:28:20,884
Normally, our blood-type...

843
01:28:21,902 --> 01:28:27,984
are O, A, B, AB.

844
01:28:30,325 --> 01:28:33,081
Either positive or negative.

845
01:28:34,218 --> 01:28:38,724
But golden blood is AB Rh-negative.

846
01:28:39,339 --> 01:28:43,891
There are only 20,000
out of 70 million people.

847
01:28:44,779 --> 01:28:48,200
How can we find the rare blood for Sun?

848
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:52,480
Right, bro, where do we find that?

849
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:57,609
Doctor.

850
01:28:58,253 --> 01:29:00,060
I have golden blood.

851
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:03,465
I'm afraid that's not enough.

852
01:29:03,545 --> 01:29:06,335
Because the patient needs a lot of blood.

853
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:07,827
I'll take my leave.

854
01:29:41,864 --> 01:29:43,015
Dad!

855
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:55,019
Sun.

856
01:29:56,078 --> 01:29:58,452
There's not enough blood to help Sun.

857
01:29:58,532 --> 01:30:02,809
Even if I donated my blood,
I still can't help him.

858
01:30:02,889 --> 01:30:04,698
You don't need to give him your blood.

859
01:30:07,170 --> 01:30:08,983
How can I not?

860
01:30:09,063 --> 01:30:12,703
Sun also has a rare blood-type.
And he's dying because he saved me.

861
01:30:13,291 --> 01:30:14,442
Calm down, Sky.

862
01:30:18,873 --> 01:30:23,325
I've already contacted the staff
to bring the blood Sun's been donated.

863
01:30:23,405 --> 01:30:26,735
He's on his way here.
Sun will be alright.

864
01:30:27,930 --> 01:30:31,962
Has Sun been donating blood?

865
01:30:36,146 --> 01:30:40,193
It's the reason I adopted him
in the first place.

866
01:30:41,318 --> 01:30:44,196
I've fetched the boy who
has the same blood type as young master.

867
01:30:44,689 --> 01:30:48,678
If you want to stay,
you have to obey my orders.

868
01:30:49,046 --> 01:30:50,148
Yes, sir.

869
01:30:50,228 --> 01:30:51,939
Call me Father.

870
01:30:52,408 --> 01:30:53,864
Yes, Father.

871
01:30:55,192 --> 01:30:57,700
From now on, you have to donate
your blood every three months.

872
01:30:57,780 --> 01:31:00,260
Remember, your blood
is to be exclusively kept for Sky.

873
01:31:00,932 --> 01:31:01,999
Yes, father.

874
01:31:02,909 --> 01:31:07,019
You adopted Sun to keep his blood for me?

875
01:31:07,589 --> 01:31:09,961
Since the day we lost your mother.

876
01:31:11,231 --> 01:31:12,817
I swear...

877
01:31:13,283 --> 01:31:15,852
that won't happen ever again.

878
01:31:18,098 --> 01:31:20,262
Where are you going, Sky?

879
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:30,268
Mom!

880
01:31:32,469 --> 01:31:35,715
Your mother's blood-type
is also golden blood.

881
01:31:40,274 --> 01:31:43,652
I tried to find someone
who had the same blood-type as you.

882
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:46,753
Then, I found Sun.

883
01:31:47,326 --> 01:31:49,750
Have you ever considered his feelings?

884
01:31:50,286 --> 01:31:54,417
Sky, I did all of this for you.

885
01:31:57,894 --> 01:32:00,995
Sun is also a human being.

886
01:32:01,535 --> 01:32:04,482
He's alive and has feelings too.

887
01:32:04,943 --> 01:32:09,680
What you did to him is like a cave animal.

888
01:32:12,142 --> 01:32:14,607
I just wanted to protect you, Sky.

889
01:32:15,392 --> 01:32:18,507
I ordered him to learn self-defense.

890
01:32:19,441 --> 01:32:20,562
You know what for?

891
01:32:21,156 --> 01:32:23,564
To protect you.

892
01:32:23,644 --> 01:32:25,882
I don't need that, dad.

893
01:32:26,801 --> 01:32:30,023
It's all because of you.
Sun doesn't get to live like others.

894
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:36,305
If I didn't do that,
would you have spare blood to use, Sky?

895
01:32:36,909 --> 01:32:40,293
Why don't you understand?
Your blood is very rare.

896
01:32:40,373 --> 01:32:42,351
Sun is willing to do that too.

897
01:32:42,922 --> 01:32:47,078
He agreed to donate his blood
every three months.

898
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:52,564
Do I have to be happy
knowing that how Sun...

899
01:32:52,654 --> 01:32:57,449
think of his life as nothing,
nothing but only his blood.

900
01:34:02,587 --> 01:34:04,447
You've been watching him for many days.

901
01:34:05,587 --> 01:34:07,727
You should go home and have some rest.

902
01:34:08,657 --> 01:34:09,796
I don't want to.

903
01:34:10,343 --> 01:34:13,421
I'll bring you some clothes.

904
01:34:19,777 --> 01:34:20,935
Sun.

905
01:34:22,662 --> 01:34:23,755
I love you.

906
01:34:28,994 --> 01:34:30,959
Can you open your eyes?

907
01:34:46,126 --> 01:34:48,170
I'll go to the hospital, bye.

908
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:50,092
Sakkhee's already been caught.

909
01:34:51,218 --> 01:34:54,071
I think
you don't need a bodyguard anymore.

910
01:34:54,635 --> 01:34:57,558
No, dad,
Sun will have to stay here with me.

911
01:35:01,243 --> 01:35:04,930
I know now you feel attached to Sun.

912
01:35:05,382 --> 01:35:07,510
Because he saved your life.

913
01:35:07,590 --> 01:35:10,021
But don't forget that it's also his job.

914
01:35:10,101 --> 01:35:12,824
I don't want you to cross the boundary.

915
01:35:12,904 --> 01:35:16,188
Both Sun and I
will make a decision for ourselves.

916
01:35:33,789 --> 01:35:35,925
Take a look at this notebook.

917
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:41,449
Whether it was just his duty
like you think or not.

918
01:35:58,187 --> 01:36:01,920
Wet hair in the AC,
do you want to get sick?

919
01:36:02,386 --> 01:36:06,015
What's the matter? You look troubled.

920
01:36:06,593 --> 01:36:08,308
It's about Sky.

921
01:36:08,388 --> 01:36:11,782
Since that incident,
he's been watching Sun all the time.

922
01:36:14,005 --> 01:36:16,917
He looks very worn-out.

923
01:36:20,032 --> 01:36:21,808
What should I do?

924
01:36:23,297 --> 01:36:25,120
You just have to be a good friend.

925
01:36:27,130 --> 01:36:28,308
Listen to him.

926
01:36:29,912 --> 01:36:32,152
Maybe that's the only thing he needs.

927
01:36:36,771 --> 01:36:40,992
Wow, I didn't think you were so capable.

928
01:36:42,940 --> 01:36:45,205
Come here, I'll give you a reward.

929
01:36:49,575 --> 01:36:50,859
One more time.

930
01:36:53,631 --> 01:36:56,795
What to reward? I don't want it.

931
01:36:57,274 --> 01:37:00,272
Come here, come get your reward.

932
01:37:03,751 --> 01:37:05,002
What are you doing?

933
01:37:05,082 --> 01:37:07,210
You want to play hard to get? Alright.

934
01:38:08,158 --> 01:38:10,439
So you have all those feelings for me,

935
01:38:14,521 --> 01:38:16,260
why didn't you just say it?

936
01:38:23,524 --> 01:38:25,532
Can you wake up and tell me now?

937
01:38:27,055 --> 01:38:30,060
Wake up and confess
your true feelings to me, Sun.

938
01:38:33,230 --> 01:38:36,913
Say that you also love me.

939
01:38:38,277 --> 01:38:40,174
Like how I love you.

940
01:39:10,566 --> 01:39:14,590
That represents my heart,

941
01:39:18,866 --> 01:39:23,344
and this represents yours.

942
01:39:24,393 --> 01:39:26,102
If you're not here,

943
01:39:27,447 --> 01:39:30,855
what's the meaning
of this other half, Sun.

944
01:39:34,581 --> 01:39:37,560
Can you wake up Sun?

945
01:39:42,262 --> 01:39:45,138
I'm not ready to lose you now.

946
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:54,800
Young master.

947
01:40:02,835 --> 01:40:04,089
Sun.

948
01:40:14,723 --> 01:40:16,694
Don't disappear on me again.

949
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:48,806
I love you, Sun.

950
01:40:58,220 --> 01:40:59,672
I love you, Young master.

951
01:41:04,230 --> 01:41:05,393
If possible,

952
01:41:07,378 --> 01:41:09,022
I want to be with you,

953
01:41:11,272 --> 01:41:15,625
not only as a bodyguard
or a made-up relative.

954
01:41:17,888 --> 01:41:22,304
I also want to be with you.
Not as your young master.

955
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:25,445
But as your lover.

956
01:41:34,732 --> 01:41:38,557
From now on, call me Sky.

957
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:42,634
I will be your Sky forever.

958
01:41:44,805 --> 01:41:45,860
Yes.

959
01:41:49,609 --> 01:41:51,145
You are my Sky.

960
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:15,175
I've been missing you.

961
01:42:15,702 --> 01:42:19,257
When you get discharged,
let's go on a date.

962
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:20,963
I can't.

963
01:42:21,423 --> 01:42:22,410
Why?

964
01:42:29,492 --> 01:42:31,302
I already have someone I love.

965
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:38,710
You mean...

966
01:42:39,124 --> 01:42:42,264
Yeah, I love Sky.

967
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:54,650
Good for you.

968
01:42:55,781 --> 01:42:59,533
Then, I'll leave Sun to Sky.

969
01:43:00,138 --> 01:43:03,868
If he's hurt again, I won't forgive you.

970
01:43:04,624 --> 01:43:07,365
I'll leave Sky to you, Sun.

971
01:43:08,068 --> 01:43:09,569
There, we should get going.

972
01:43:29,003 --> 01:43:30,847
How does everything turn out like this?

973
01:43:31,391 --> 01:43:33,627
Maybe, it's fate.

974
01:43:35,195 --> 01:43:39,362
For those two kids
who have the same rare blood-type.

975
01:43:39,442 --> 01:43:40,735
To meet each other.

976
01:43:44,199 --> 01:43:45,404
Get rid of Sun!

977
01:43:46,690 --> 01:43:50,002
I went to the supermarket while I was out.

978
01:43:51,663 --> 01:43:53,607
Come down and help me arrange things.

979
01:43:55,051 --> 01:43:56,200
Sun.

980
01:44:00,260 --> 01:44:01,295
Sun.

981
01:44:03,690 --> 01:44:04,963
Where is he?

982
01:44:12,965 --> 01:44:14,307
When did he send this?

983
01:44:17,521 --> 01:44:21,070
Sky, Shin called me to meet up.

984
01:44:21,463 --> 01:44:24,018
I know it was father's order.

985
01:44:24,982 --> 01:44:29,327
I think it's time.
Don't be mad at father.

986
01:44:29,407 --> 01:44:32,595
He did this because he loves you.

987
01:44:33,066 --> 01:44:36,705
A guy like me is not worth it for you.

988
01:44:36,785 --> 01:44:41,124
Sky, you have a bright future ahead,
not like me.

989
01:44:41,626 --> 01:44:45,604
Even without me,
you have to take good care of yourself.

990
01:44:46,276 --> 01:44:50,093
I love you, Sky. More than my life.

991
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:53,348
Sun.

992
01:45:08,059 --> 01:45:11,313
Hey, how is it? Can you contact him?

993
01:45:11,393 --> 01:45:14,037
Not at all. I couldn't reach him.

994
01:45:14,571 --> 01:45:16,614
Oh, I remember something.

995
01:45:16,694 --> 01:45:19,150
Sun downloaded the tracking app
on your phone.

996
01:45:19,230 --> 01:45:23,084
If his phone is still on,
we'll be able to reach him.

997
01:45:23,387 --> 01:45:24,257
Yeah, right.

998
01:45:24,337 --> 01:45:26,534
Let's hurry now. Get in my car.

999
01:45:27,695 --> 01:45:30,797
Run while you still have the chance.

1000
01:45:30,877 --> 01:45:32,506
That's the only thing I can help.

1001
01:45:36,700 --> 01:45:37,730
No.

1002
01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:44,299
A life without young master
is like living dead.

1003
01:45:45,169 --> 01:45:47,246
My life belongs to father.

1004
01:45:47,326 --> 01:45:51,892
If father wants me dead,
then I'll accept it.

1005
01:45:52,562 --> 01:45:54,901
Then, be prepared for your death.

1006
01:46:16,660 --> 01:46:18,454
GPS said it's here.

1007
01:46:18,970 --> 01:46:21,009
Let's split up to look for him.

1008
01:46:21,089 --> 01:46:22,291
Okay.

1009
01:46:22,371 --> 01:46:23,831
Then, I'll go inside.

1010
01:46:24,905 --> 01:46:27,214
-Bank, you go that way.
-Alright, bro.

1011
01:46:27,294 --> 01:46:28,806
I'll go this way.

1012
01:46:32,026 --> 01:46:36,675
You were adopted, don't be so arrogant.

1013
01:46:37,214 --> 01:46:39,775
You dare touch my only son.

1014
01:46:53,127 --> 01:46:54,394
Sun!

1015
01:46:55,012 --> 01:46:56,130
Sun!

1016
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:01,181
Let it all end here.

1017
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:28,323
Sun.

1018
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:39,929
Are you alright?

1019
01:47:40,569 --> 01:47:41,806
I'm fine.

1020
01:47:51,858 --> 01:47:54,129
I just want to test him.

1021
01:47:54,834 --> 01:47:58,634
If he's worth it for you.

1022
01:47:59,178 --> 01:48:01,036
You approve of our relationship?

1023
01:48:01,116 --> 01:48:02,138
No.

1024
01:48:02,913 --> 01:48:04,730
Today is just the first test.

1025
01:48:06,188 --> 01:48:08,489
I'll send you to study abroad.

1026
01:48:09,225 --> 01:48:12,165
-I won't go.
-I said you have to go.

1027
01:48:12,744 --> 01:48:16,381
If you believe that it's actual love,
you've got to prove it.

1028
01:48:17,489 --> 01:48:20,021
If you both
are in a long distance relationship,

1029
01:48:20,101 --> 01:48:21,672
then you forget about each other.

1030
01:48:22,526 --> 01:48:26,196
That means it's just a teen-love,
not real love.

1031
01:48:26,588 --> 01:48:28,161
Please send young master aboard.

1032
01:48:34,900 --> 01:48:38,521
During that time,
we'll break our contact.

1033
01:48:39,421 --> 01:48:41,333
We'll prove our love for you.

1034
01:48:42,547 --> 01:48:47,631
Our feelings are not just a spark
because we're close.

1035
01:48:49,075 --> 01:48:53,075
I'll wait until Sky finishes school
and comes back.

1036
01:48:55,060 --> 01:48:59,835
Till that day, if we are still the same,

1037
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:03,410
I beg you,

1038
01:49:04,109 --> 01:49:08,591
can you approve of our love then?

1039
01:49:08,671 --> 01:49:10,604
I accept the deal.

1040
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:22,218
Why don't you fight for us?

1041
01:49:22,298 --> 01:49:24,311
Why do you want us to be apart?

1042
01:49:24,391 --> 01:49:26,677
We'll get father's approval.

1043
01:49:27,746 --> 01:49:30,626
I'm sure that time won't change me.

1044
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,244
What about you?

1045
01:49:36,165 --> 01:49:40,220
For me, you are forever.

1046
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:46,820
♪Do you hear me?♪

1047
01:49:46,900 --> 01:49:51,980
♪When you are in pain and left out.♪

1048
01:49:52,060 --> 01:49:57,440
♪I want to keep you by my side.♪

1049
01:49:57,988 --> 01:50:01,733
Hey, can I play with another rubik's cube?

1050
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:05,666
I only have one.

1051
01:50:05,746 --> 01:50:07,306
What about the one poking my back?

1052
01:50:09,098 --> 01:50:10,411
That's a gun.

1053
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:15,586
Can I check out your gun?

1054
01:50:30,668 --> 01:50:32,518
Didn't you say you want to check the gun?

1055
01:50:32,598 --> 01:50:34,252
Didn't dad tell you?

1056
01:50:34,783 --> 01:50:36,662
Before you check someone's gun,

1057
01:50:37,263 --> 01:50:38,841
you have to search him first.

1058
01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:12,012
What are you thinking?

1059
01:51:15,222 --> 01:51:16,512
I miss you.

1060
01:51:21,550 --> 01:51:25,041
I'm right here. Why do you still miss me?

1061
01:51:29,295 --> 01:51:33,586
But soon, I have to go.

1062
01:51:52,369 --> 01:51:54,459
Let's leave the worries to the future.

1063
01:51:56,560 --> 01:52:01,231
Today, we're still together.

1064
01:52:02,242 --> 01:52:06,623
Even when I come back,
dad still doesn't approve?

1065
01:52:11,230 --> 01:52:15,648
Then, I'll wait until he does.

1066
01:52:16,753 --> 01:52:22,122
What if it's been five years, ten years,

1067
01:52:24,028 --> 01:52:25,723
but dad still won't approve?

1068
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:39,817
For me, I can wait for you my whole life.

1069
01:52:42,100 --> 01:52:44,095
You won't forget me, right?

1070
01:52:44,436 --> 01:52:45,932
How can I forget?

1071
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:54,321
My heart is with you, Sky.

1072
01:53:00,900 --> 01:53:04,900
My heart is with you, too.

1073
01:56:51,502 --> 01:56:53,563
We won't say goodbye, Sky.

1074
01:56:54,139 --> 01:56:55,801
Take good care of yourself.

1075
01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:58,396
Let's trade the hat once we meet again.

1076
01:56:58,908 --> 01:57:02,234
PS. Finish this too.

1077
01:57:53,060 --> 01:57:56,590
(Six years later)

1078
01:57:58,030 --> 01:58:01,130
(Japan)

1079
01:59:20,694 --> 01:59:21,917
Hi, dad.

1080
01:59:21,997 --> 01:59:24,111
Welcome back home, son.

1081
01:59:27,022 --> 01:59:28,263
I really missed you.

1082
01:59:30,286 --> 01:59:32,510
How are you? Feels like home?

1083
01:59:33,070 --> 01:59:36,720
I miss Thailand, and also miss you too.

1084
01:59:38,363 --> 01:59:42,357
How's it going? What are your plans
after coming back?

1085
01:59:42,987 --> 01:59:47,126
I want to help your business.

1086
01:59:48,122 --> 01:59:51,215
You've been working hard.
It's time for retirement.

1087
01:59:51,902 --> 01:59:55,564
I'm glad to hear you say that.

1088
01:59:55,644 --> 01:59:57,226
Where is Sun?

1089
01:59:58,300 --> 01:59:59,958
Why didn't he come to pick me up?

1090
02:00:01,430 --> 02:00:05,860
He won't get to see you till I allow him.

1091
02:00:06,851 --> 02:00:08,926
I keep my promise.

1092
02:00:09,899 --> 02:00:12,030
I hope you do too.

1093
02:00:14,389 --> 02:00:16,367
It's been six years.

1094
02:00:17,339 --> 02:00:18,972
How can you be so sure...

1095
02:00:19,451 --> 02:00:22,190
that he'll still have feelings for you?

1096
02:00:22,782 --> 02:00:24,722
I'm believe in him.

1097
02:01:36,132 --> 02:01:37,310
-Shin.
-Yes, sir.

1098
02:01:37,390 --> 02:01:38,380
Where is Sky?

1099
02:01:38,460 --> 02:01:40,368
Young master went out
to donate his blood.

1100
02:01:40,448 --> 02:01:42,753
He said he'll meet up
with his friends later.

1101
02:01:44,360 --> 02:01:45,333
Boss.

1102
02:01:47,882 --> 02:01:52,626
They both proved themselves,
what are you going to do?

1103
02:02:20,496 --> 02:02:24,677
When you come back,
we'll go there together.

1104
02:02:26,100 --> 02:02:27,061
Promise?

1105
02:02:54,594 --> 02:02:58,520
Don't go out by yourself. It's dangerous.

1106
02:03:05,308 --> 02:03:09,236
You promised, we'll come together.

1107
02:03:09,796 --> 02:03:12,896
Why did you sneak here alone?

1108
02:03:16,098 --> 02:03:20,970
How did you know I'm here?

1109
02:03:23,184 --> 02:03:25,040
Father told me to come here.

1110
02:03:27,130 --> 02:03:28,237
Dad?

1111
02:03:28,956 --> 02:03:31,912
Father said you're here.

1112
02:03:33,404 --> 02:03:39,038
