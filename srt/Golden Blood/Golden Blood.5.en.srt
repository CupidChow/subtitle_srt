1
00:00:02,813 --> 00:00:05,479
I don't want you to get hurt
because of me anymore.

2
00:00:11,313 --> 00:00:14,096
Can I go to a volunteer camp?

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,213
Yeah, we can go.

4
00:00:15,547 --> 00:00:17,233
You are the cutest.

5
00:00:18,145 --> 00:00:22,562
Mr. Bank, do you know why young master
is afraid of firecrackers?

6
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:23,863
When he was a child,

7
00:00:23,947 --> 00:00:27,506
he confronted a shooting in his house.

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,713
Sky!

9
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:05,114
Ouch!

10
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,586
Bank! Wake up, sleepyhead.

11
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:10,479
What the heck, bro?
I'm in the middle of it.

12
00:01:10,564 --> 00:01:12,130
Young master, we've arrived.

13
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,746
Damn you!

14
00:01:18,447 --> 00:01:21,780
Young master, time to wake up, please.

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,430
Young master, we've arrived, sleepyhead.

16
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,446
Nah, can I sleep some more?

17
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,828
We came here as volunteers, remember?

18
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,080
Open your eyes.

19
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,413
Let's go.

20
00:02:07,047 --> 00:02:08,280
Do you want some?

21
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,946
I thought you might disgust my breath.

22
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:15,901
Not at all, young master.

23
00:02:16,713 --> 00:02:20,522
I don't hate anything about you.

24
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:10,813
You have something on your face.

25
00:03:11,247 --> 00:03:12,513
Right.

26
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,856
It smells good.

27
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:25,746
We should go.

28
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,113
Wow, there are so many of you. Tired?

29
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,629
Are you kids tired?

30
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,478
-A little bit, sir.
-Have something to drink.

31
00:04:17,563 --> 00:04:20,212
-Hello, everyone.
-Hello, sir.

32
00:04:20,297 --> 00:04:22,835
Welcome to my village,
"Nhong Bak Keaw"

33
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:25,430
I've prepared everything
for your requests.

34
00:04:25,554 --> 00:04:27,070
You can set up tents over there.

35
00:04:27,155 --> 00:04:29,821
-Wow!
-You see back there.

36
00:04:30,165 --> 00:04:33,371
If anyone needs toilet to wash up,

37
00:04:33,498 --> 00:04:34,854
the place is over there.

38
00:04:35,032 --> 00:04:37,448
You can also take a shower to freshen up.

39
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:38,366
Alright, uncle.

40
00:04:38,698 --> 00:04:41,398
Moving on, this place back here,

41
00:04:41,798 --> 00:04:44,893
is our canteen, the food is ready.

42
00:04:45,532 --> 00:04:48,194
Then, we'll go to school in the afternoon.

43
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:50,503
Okay, I'll take my leave now.

44
00:04:50,588 --> 00:04:52,788
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you, sir.

45
00:04:53,348 --> 00:04:56,414
If you need anything else,
just let me know.

46
00:04:58,698 --> 00:04:59,964
You all have your tent?

47
00:05:00,498 --> 00:05:03,931
Then, go set it up with your tentmate,
all right?

48
00:05:06,898 --> 00:05:08,431
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

49
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,052
I don't have a tentmate.

50
00:05:11,307 --> 00:05:13,748
You can sleep alone.

51
00:05:13,832 --> 00:05:16,998
Aww, I'd be lonely.

52
00:05:20,258 --> 00:05:21,860
Can I sleep with others?

53
00:05:21,944 --> 00:05:22,854
Who'd that be?

54
00:05:23,332 --> 00:05:24,432
Sky?

55
00:05:25,332 --> 00:05:28,114
You can't.
The tent is maximum for two.

56
00:05:28,198 --> 00:05:29,998
I'll be sleeping with Sun.

57
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,626
Juno?

58
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:33,699
Don't ever think about it!

59
00:05:34,498 --> 00:05:36,332
-Toktaeng?
-Shut up!

60
00:05:38,085 --> 00:05:40,351
-You?
-You fucking joking?

61
00:05:43,365 --> 00:05:45,398
Bank, why do you have to make a fuss?

62
00:05:45,832 --> 00:05:48,065
Just sleep by yourself. It won't hurt.

63
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:51,232
Right, nothing is going to eat you up
at night.

64
00:05:54,798 --> 00:05:57,464
You're a grown man.
What are you afraid of?

65
00:05:57,972 --> 00:05:59,199
Don't tell me.

66
00:05:59,903 --> 00:06:01,219
You can't sleep alone?

67
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:09,398
Boo! you can't sleep alone. Boo!

68
00:06:11,198 --> 00:06:14,381
All right, everyone set up your tent
and put down your bag.

69
00:06:14,465 --> 00:06:16,598
We'll have activity in the afternoon. Go.

70
00:06:17,965 --> 00:06:19,398
All right, split up.

71
00:06:22,932 --> 00:06:25,965
Pitch, you bear that in mind.

72
00:06:33,965 --> 00:06:35,165
Can you carry that?

73
00:06:36,632 --> 00:06:38,570
Damn, they are so mean.

74
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:40,328
How could they say that?

75
00:06:40,573 --> 00:06:43,573
Bank, you really can't sleep alone?

76
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:45,645
I can.

77
00:06:46,382 --> 00:06:47,831
But I don't want to.

78
00:06:48,238 --> 00:06:49,216
It's lonely.

79
00:06:49,682 --> 00:06:52,882
You keep nagging,
aren't you pitching a tent?

80
00:06:54,274 --> 00:06:55,107
Hey!

81
00:06:57,301 --> 00:06:58,901
Why are you here?

82
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:02,427
I'll be your tentmate.

83
00:07:03,644 --> 00:07:04,883
You said you were lonely.

84
00:07:06,108 --> 00:07:08,341
There, what are you looking at?

85
00:07:09,404 --> 00:07:10,801
Set up the tent.

86
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,223
Or you don't know how?

87
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:20,520
I do. It's just a piece of cake.

88
00:07:20,604 --> 00:07:22,983
Hmm. You're boasting.

89
00:07:27,904 --> 00:07:32,370
Wait, then what about your ex-buddy?

90
00:07:33,504 --> 00:07:34,568
My ex-buddy?

91
00:07:37,004 --> 00:07:37,942
It's you.

92
00:07:44,504 --> 00:07:46,179
Come on, help me.

93
00:07:51,147 --> 00:07:53,050
One, two, three.

94
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:06,904
Anything I can help?

95
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:11,054
It's okay. I got this.

96
00:08:11,437 --> 00:08:13,186
Don't say that.

97
00:08:13,404 --> 00:08:14,833
I'm also your buddy.

98
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,138
We have to help each other.

99
00:08:18,515 --> 00:08:19,515
Here you go.

100
00:08:57,361 --> 00:08:58,261
All done.

101
00:08:58,537 --> 00:09:01,370
Yeah, finally.

102
00:09:08,489 --> 00:09:09,589
Be still.

103
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,473
Why?

104
00:09:33,316 --> 00:09:34,479
Your face is a bit messy.

105
00:09:36,928 --> 00:09:37,861
Thanks.

106
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:40,940
Hey, Sun!

107
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:45,517
Your face is messy too.

108
00:09:46,775 --> 00:09:47,740
Where is it?

109
00:10:06,043 --> 00:10:07,043
It's sweat.

110
00:10:09,404 --> 00:10:10,322
Thank you.

111
00:10:11,004 --> 00:10:11,975
Forget it.

112
00:10:12,223 --> 00:10:13,527
You also do the same to me.

113
00:10:33,714 --> 00:10:35,614
Kids, line up to grab our giveaway.

114
00:10:36,118 --> 00:10:38,518
Come this way.

115
00:11:21,971 --> 00:11:24,837
Boo!

116
00:11:29,109 --> 00:11:32,842
If you're naughty,
I'll eat you all up.

117
00:11:34,138 --> 00:11:36,471
Try me!

118
00:11:36,556 --> 00:11:39,705
No heroes are going to save you.

119
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,623
Brother!

120
00:11:41,073 --> 00:11:44,339
Everyone beats him together!

121
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:54,399
I give up. I resign...

122
00:11:54,484 --> 00:11:57,956
Kiddos, anyone hungry?

123
00:11:58,091 --> 00:11:59,607
Me. Me.

124
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,796
The food is ready, let's go eat.

125
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,660
You too Godzilla,
you might starve to death.

126
00:12:21,983 --> 00:12:24,183
You look cute in that.

127
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,750
Aren't you scared of Godzilla?

128
00:12:34,483 --> 00:12:36,183
Why so?

129
00:12:36,683 --> 00:12:39,883
You aren't scared?

130
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,983
Shoot it.

131
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:01,882
Great.

132
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:07,783
Sun!

133
00:13:14,683 --> 00:13:15,649
Thank you.

134
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,583
Thank you.

135
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,508
Stay hydrated, so you'll cool down.

136
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,383
Thank you.

137
00:13:55,677 --> 00:13:57,057
I'm also hot.

138
00:13:57,889 --> 00:13:59,549
But nobody cares.

139
00:14:04,316 --> 00:14:06,916
Who told you
to play football wearing that?

140
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,716
You said I look cute.

141
00:14:19,123 --> 00:14:20,791
-Abracadabra!
-Shit!

142
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,016
There, feeling cooler?

143
00:14:24,616 --> 00:14:26,266
Are you trying to get a kick?

144
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:30,283
Na-ah, you look sweaty.
I just want to help.

145
00:14:30,716 --> 00:14:32,432
There, there!

146
00:14:32,516 --> 00:14:33,582
No, stop.

147
00:14:35,357 --> 00:14:36,518
Stop it already.

148
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,099
Stop it.

149
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,016
You look cool down.

150
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:47,949
I'm not in the mood.

151
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,683
Herbal liquor from our villagers.

152
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,449
They are good spirits.

153
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,383
Have some, you won't get cold.

154
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:11,983
Try them.

155
00:15:12,983 --> 00:15:15,553
Share it to others too.

156
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:17,566
Hey guys, say thank you to uncle.

157
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,532
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

158
00:15:19,616 --> 00:15:22,832
Tell me if you want anything.
I'll go home then.

159
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,550
Sure thing!

160
00:15:27,283 --> 00:15:30,949
Pitch, is it true?
That you won't get cold.

161
00:15:31,394 --> 00:15:34,327
Uncle said so, do you think he lied?

162
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:37,314
Sorry, I pass.

163
00:15:40,316 --> 00:15:41,182
Juno?

164
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:45,149
I'll try some.

165
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,832
There good girl.

166
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,949
She's a drinker.

167
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:53,516
What about you two?

168
00:15:55,592 --> 00:15:57,023
I usually don't drink.

169
00:15:57,345 --> 00:16:01,132
Hey Sun, try some,
aren't you embarrassed.

170
00:16:01,216 --> 00:16:03,782
Try a little, Juno also did.

171
00:16:05,183 --> 00:16:07,232
Just take a sip since we're here.

172
00:16:07,316 --> 00:16:09,099
Come on, you'll lose your face.

173
00:16:09,183 --> 00:16:10,816
Come on, man.

174
00:16:11,283 --> 00:16:13,116
Hurry up!

175
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:17,250
If he doesn't want to, then I'll do it.

176
00:16:19,116 --> 00:16:21,916
Hey, there you go.

177
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:29,602
I'll drink it.

178
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:37,222
Wait Sun, you said you don't drink?

179
00:16:40,414 --> 00:16:41,687
I changed my mind.

180
00:16:43,883 --> 00:16:46,166
Then, drink up.

181
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:53,116
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

182
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,016
Make some noise!

183
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,049
It's hot.

184
00:17:57,716 --> 00:17:59,116
Young master, go!

185
00:18:00,883 --> 00:18:04,083
Mowgli's hunting,
Mowgli's hunting.

186
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:07,166
Kill Sher Khan,
Kill Sher Khan.

187
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,066
Peeling off all his skin.

188
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:09,999
Young master!

189
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,432

190
00:18:12,516 --> 00:18:15,266
Kill Sher Khan,

191
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,550
Peel his skin,

Peel his skin,
Peel his skin.

195
00:18:30,116 --> 00:18:32,932
Hunt the cow,
kill the buffalo.

196
00:18:33,016 --> 00:18:36,216
Mowgli's hunting,
Mowgli's hunting.

197
00:18:44,516 --> 00:18:47,132
Kill the cow,
kill the buffalo.

198
00:18:47,216 --> 00:18:50,416
Mowgli's hunting,

199
00:18:50,716 --> 00:18:53,266
Kill Sher Khan,

200
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:56,550
Peel his skin,
Peel his skin.

201
00:18:56,716 --> 00:18:59,516
Hunt the cow,
kill the buffalo.

202
00:19:02,616 --> 00:19:04,032
Give him a break.

203
00:19:04,116 --> 00:19:06,330
-What the heck?
-I think he's pretty much wasted.

204
00:19:06,415 --> 00:19:09,515
-I'm not drunk!
-What the heck, Sky? We're having fun.

205
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,050
Sun, come with me.

206
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:44,656
Sit down, Sun.

207
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:57,266
Hang on, who are you talking about?

208
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:01,350
Be still, shush.

209
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:03,432
What did he do wrong
that you want to hunt him?

210
00:20:03,516 --> 00:20:07,882
Kill Sher Khan, peel his skin.

211
00:20:08,216 --> 00:20:10,416
Enough, enough, shush it now.

212
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,616
Take a deep breath, look at me.

213
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:25,199
Okay, sit up, part your legs.

214
00:20:25,283 --> 00:20:26,682
What legs?

215
00:20:27,116 --> 00:20:28,182
Part your thighs.

216
00:20:34,183 --> 00:20:35,316
Stop it.

217
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,999
-Be still.
-Fun!

218
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:43,416
Bend down your head
and part your legs.

219
00:20:44,616 --> 00:20:48,416
I'll never bow down to anyone!

220
00:20:48,616 --> 00:20:52,166
Bullshit, just now you bow down
to any dogs that passed by.

221
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,509
Who's drunk? What a loser!

222
00:20:56,783 --> 00:20:58,716
Stay there, like that.

223
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:03,150
Hey, It's all wet.

224
00:21:05,616 --> 00:21:08,149
What the hell, I'm drenched.

225
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,449
How refreshing.

226
00:21:20,823 --> 00:21:22,365
How are you?

227
00:21:43,687 --> 00:21:46,520
You're kind of cute when you're drunk.

228
00:21:56,589 --> 00:21:57,567
Then...

229
00:22:00,717 --> 00:22:02,060
Did you fall for me?

230
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,205
Do you love me?

231
00:22:11,283 --> 00:22:13,171
You crazy drunkard.

232
00:22:28,935 --> 00:22:29,943
Sober up?

233
00:22:39,183 --> 00:22:40,549
So...

234
00:22:45,052 --> 00:22:46,664
Young master, do you love me?

235
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,883
I don't know.

236
00:23:09,205 --> 00:23:12,155
You wash up first, I'll wait outside.

237
00:23:19,917 --> 00:23:20,883
Okay.

238
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:26,582
Hold on, wasn't he already sober?

239
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,583
Eh, or he's still drunk?

240
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,404
Young master, aren't you asleep?

241
00:24:57,316 --> 00:24:59,916
Yeah, I'm going to sleep.

242
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,183
And you?

243
00:25:04,916 --> 00:25:09,537
Oh, yeah sure.

244
00:25:21,816 --> 00:25:26,149
Wait, are you going to sleep with that?

245
00:25:37,345 --> 00:25:38,478
Dry your hair first.

246
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,616
Thank you.

247
00:25:51,088 --> 00:25:53,237
Aren't you sleepy?

248
00:25:53,416 --> 00:25:56,116
Yeah, yeah, I am.

249
00:26:34,383 --> 00:26:35,666
See?

250
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,532
Act like you could take care of it all.

251
00:26:37,616 --> 00:26:40,816
But when you're drinking,
turns out you're lightweight.

252
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:45,749
I'm not lightweight.
But because it's unfamiliar liquor.

253
00:26:46,683 --> 00:26:49,516
And you took the drinks for me?
Serve you right.

254
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:52,250
Well, good thing
I was drunk instead of you.

255
00:26:52,683 --> 00:26:54,716
So, I have to take care of you instead?

256
00:26:58,516 --> 00:26:59,582
I'm sorry.

257
00:27:01,116 --> 00:27:05,116
Oh come on, I was joking.
No harm done.

258
00:27:06,316 --> 00:27:11,149
Sun, last night
you were pretty cute you know.

259
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:21,183
I don't remember a thing.

260
00:27:23,284 --> 00:27:25,849
You know last night. Sun was like...

261
00:27:27,116 --> 00:27:29,149
Swinging those hips like a pro.

262
00:27:29,683 --> 00:27:33,566
Yeah, I was a little tipsy.

263
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:36,010
But I had a clear picture
of your dance moves.

264
00:27:36,283 --> 00:27:37,683
Like this...

265
00:27:53,412 --> 00:27:54,883
I swear I'm not going to drink again.

266
00:27:55,683 --> 00:28:01,066
Moreover, I was such
a burden to Sky last night.

267
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:05,516
Aww, it was a fun night.
He wouldn't blame you.

268
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,902
Right, Sky?

269
00:28:08,116 --> 00:28:12,016
Yeah, have a bit of fun ain't kill nobody.

270
00:28:16,871 --> 00:28:18,011
Right, Toktaeng?

271
00:28:18,344 --> 00:28:19,177
Sure.

272
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,299
How are you? You're all right?

273
00:28:24,383 --> 00:28:26,283
They're all gone.

274
00:28:31,516 --> 00:28:32,796
I feel better now.

275
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:35,816
I've got a good helper.

276
00:28:36,267 --> 00:28:37,310
Thank you.

277
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:44,516
I heard that you're going
to teach English today.

278
00:28:45,168 --> 00:28:46,425
Can I accompany you?

279
00:28:48,355 --> 00:28:52,355
Sounds good,
Juno, are you okay with that?

280
00:28:53,345 --> 00:28:58,278
Absolutely, then I'll be with Sun today.

281
00:29:02,417 --> 00:29:03,489
You don't have to.

282
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,288
My job is heavy labor.

283
00:29:06,816 --> 00:29:08,203
You'll get too tired.

284
00:29:08,383 --> 00:29:10,616
Not at all!

285
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:15,116
I'm used to heavy labor.
I'm actually pretty tough.

286
00:29:15,622 --> 00:29:18,771
Just being near you is good enough.

287
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:24,214
All right, if you said so.

288
00:29:24,816 --> 00:29:26,216
Let's go, Toktaeng.

289
00:29:32,476 --> 00:29:33,866
Don't follow them.

290
00:29:34,783 --> 00:29:37,775
I think they want some privacy.

291
00:29:46,468 --> 00:29:48,089
You sweet talking like that.

292
00:29:48,568 --> 00:29:49,773
Better now?

293
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:51,683
Yeah.

294
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,649
Wait.

295
00:29:57,383 --> 00:29:58,316
Here.

296
00:30:01,429 --> 00:30:02,543
What is it?

297
00:30:03,379 --> 00:30:04,702
A breath spray.

298
00:30:05,441 --> 00:30:06,611
Open your mouth.

299
00:30:15,283 --> 00:30:18,232
How is it? Refreshing?

300
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:21,352
Very refreshing and smells good too.

301
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:22,732
What is it?

302
00:30:23,124 --> 00:30:24,074
You like it?

303
00:30:30,556 --> 00:30:33,570
Here, have it.

304
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,150
Thank you, Pitch.

305
00:30:37,783 --> 00:30:41,116
One more thing,

306
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,466
Do you think what I'm thinking?

307
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,983
-Yeah.
-Eh.

308
00:30:48,483 --> 00:30:49,849
You know what I'm thinking?

309
00:30:50,483 --> 00:30:54,583
Bro, just looking at you
I can tell what's on your mind.

310
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,236
You mean what's going on
between Sun and Sky?

311
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,749
You really get me.

312
00:31:04,383 --> 00:31:07,716
Do you think there's something weird?

313
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:14,589
Yeah, weird, a distant relative
but they're very close.

314
00:31:15,561 --> 00:31:16,561
That's it.

315
00:31:17,783 --> 00:31:24,049
Last night, Sky was trying
to stand in Juno's way.

316
00:31:26,008 --> 00:31:29,208
He acted like he was jealous.

317
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:32,580
I think so too.

318
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,125
Wow, you're awesome.

319
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:47,750
Okey-doke, you and I,
we should dig into it.

320
00:31:48,783 --> 00:31:50,339
To find the truth.

321
00:31:50,978 --> 00:31:52,351
What is going on between them?

322
00:31:53,904 --> 00:31:54,937
Deal!

323
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:03,187
Where did you learn that?

324
00:32:03,434 --> 00:32:04,406
I didn't.

Brother.

335
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:47,810
Yes, sweet.

336
00:32:47,895 --> 00:32:50,495
Are you two, a father and a mother?

337
00:32:52,816 --> 00:32:56,466
No, we are friends.

338
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,983
Just friends.

339
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:03,932

-A lover...

340

It's not like that.

341
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,698
Sun, you should take a break.

342
00:33:11,416 --> 00:33:13,317
You have sweat all over.

343
00:33:14,216 --> 00:33:16,875
No big deal. This is nothing.

344
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:31,116
We are just friends for now.

345
00:33:32,216 --> 00:33:36,516
But we don't know
what we might be in the future.

All right guys. Back to our lesson.

348
00:33:56,183 --> 00:33:57,196
Sky.

349
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,864
Sky, are you all right?

350
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:05,666
Ah, I'm fine. Where are we?

351
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,016
Sister.

352
00:34:15,616 --> 00:34:16,649
Boy.

353
00:34:18,916 --> 00:34:20,452
Why are you here alone?

354
00:34:20,983 --> 00:34:23,031
Everyone is looking for you.

355
00:34:23,916 --> 00:34:25,030
I don't buy that.

356
00:34:26,883 --> 00:34:28,097
Why not?

357
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,345
Nobody wants to be with me.

358
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:32,783
Even my mom and dad left me.

359
00:34:41,483 --> 00:34:44,949
Come here, can I give you a hug?

360
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,411
That's not true, Boy.

361
00:34:57,383 --> 00:35:00,270
At least there are teachers,

362
00:35:01,687 --> 00:35:04,983
and me that wants to be with you.

363
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:08,486
Don't cry, good boy.

364
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:10,136
You'll be all right.

365
00:35:11,816 --> 00:35:13,895
Boy, why are you here?

366
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,146
Your friends were asking about you.
Come on.

367
00:35:18,265 --> 00:35:19,626
Excuse me, ma'am.

368
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,184
Yes?

369
00:35:23,783 --> 00:35:28,049
Just now, Boy told me
his parents left him behind.

370
00:35:29,883 --> 00:35:32,349
Yes, right.

371
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:36,950
He is an orphan.
His parents passed away.

372
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:40,183
He lives with his two aunties.

373
00:35:40,716 --> 00:35:44,516
They don't really have time for him.
So they leave him with me.

374
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,183
Well, that's usually
what happens to orphans.

375
00:35:51,183 --> 00:35:54,749
Eventually, they'll end up all alone.

376
00:35:56,816 --> 00:35:58,449
Pardon?

377
00:35:59,716 --> 00:36:02,249
Nothing, ma'am.
I was talking to myself.

378
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:07,483
Anyway, I'm very thankful
for your volunteer work.

379
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:08,908
My pleasure.

380
00:36:09,061 --> 00:36:10,041
Thank you.

381
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,850
Just now, you said that...

382
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:33,783
orphans will end up all alone?

383
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,422
It's nothing.

384
00:36:36,971 --> 00:36:38,383
You don't have to pay attention to that.

385
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:43,096
Listen to me,

386
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:49,150
I knew that you never had anyone,

387
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,040
but I want you to remember this.

388
00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:56,593
From now on, whatever happens...

389
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,083
you'll always have me.

390
00:37:11,383 --> 00:37:12,398
All right.

391
00:37:14,403 --> 00:37:16,191
I'll keep that in mind.

392
00:37:17,463 --> 00:37:20,866
Good. Don't ever forget it.

393
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,180
If you do, I'll kill you.

394
00:37:38,246 --> 00:37:39,814
Where are you going?

395
00:37:57,451 --> 00:38:00,356
Hey, you don't have
to follow me around.

396
00:38:00,932 --> 00:38:01,863
It's all right.

397
00:38:02,384 --> 00:38:04,842
Yesterday I was a burden to you.

398
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:07,884
So, today I'll do my best on my duty.

399
00:38:13,216 --> 00:38:14,549
So, today I'll do my best on my duty.

400
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,783
Do you love me?

401
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:31,830
What are they talking about?

402
00:38:32,883 --> 00:38:34,874
We have to get closer.

403
00:38:36,683 --> 00:38:39,283
I can't hear a thing. Go.

404
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:44,349
Hey, are you stupid?

405
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:48,083
If we get closer,
they'll see us eavesdropping.

406
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:52,250
Yeah right. Sorry.

407
00:38:54,516 --> 00:38:56,082
Do you think we overreact?

408
00:38:56,358 --> 00:38:58,221
Sun and Sky may be just a relative.

409
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:00,416
Nothing strange if they're close.

410
00:39:00,783 --> 00:39:03,483
Sun sticking to Sky is not strange,

411
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:06,416
but Sky on the other hand, is strange.

412
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,616
If you think about it. Last night,

413
00:39:09,916 --> 00:39:12,086
Sun was drunk and flirting with girl.

414
00:39:12,816 --> 00:39:14,370
If he wasn't jealous,

415
00:39:14,964 --> 00:39:18,182
why did he have to seperate them?

416
00:39:25,316 --> 00:39:27,332
-Ouch.
-We should call it a day.

417
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:29,532
-What the heck?
-I think he's pretty much wasted.

418
00:39:29,616 --> 00:39:32,816
-No, I'm not drunk.
-What the heck, Sky? We're having fun.

419
00:39:33,589 --> 00:39:34,622
You're right.

420
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,150
Do you remember anything
that happened last night?

421
00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:00,825
Sun?

422
00:40:08,378 --> 00:40:11,578
Hey, Sun was gone.

423
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:12,750
Look!

424
00:40:16,016 --> 00:40:18,949
He was there just now.

425
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,983
-What is it?
-Check it out.

426
00:40:31,478 --> 00:40:34,583
-Ant nest!
-Ant nest!

427
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:37,950
Ouch, it's itchy.

428
00:40:48,216 --> 00:40:50,166
Damn, so itchy.

429
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,550
Go to the shore.

430
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:03,199
-Itchy!
-What itchy?

431
00:41:03,283 --> 00:41:04,832
It's itchy, ants bite.

432
00:41:04,916 --> 00:41:06,316
-Still have them?
-Yeah.

433
00:41:06,783 --> 00:41:08,099
Take it off!

434
00:41:08,183 --> 00:41:09,666
-Hey!
-What?

435
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,132
No, I don't want to take it off.

436
00:41:11,216 --> 00:41:13,432
You don't have to be embarrassed.
I've seen you naked.

437
00:41:13,516 --> 00:41:16,216
-I don't want to.
-Take off your shirt.

438
00:41:36,816 --> 00:41:39,282
Hey!

439
00:41:41,172 --> 00:41:42,536
Nosebleeding!

440
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,850
Hey, blood!

441
00:41:52,183 --> 00:41:55,016
Come here, I'll wipe it off.

442
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:18,464
I think we should get out.

443
00:42:24,283 --> 00:42:26,783
Wait for me.

444
00:42:55,716 --> 00:42:57,782
He said he'll do his best.

445
00:42:58,316 --> 00:42:59,616
Where is he now?

446
00:43:03,216 --> 00:43:04,449
Where were you?

447
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:07,661
I went to pee.

448
00:43:10,725 --> 00:43:12,085
We should get going.

449
00:43:40,052 --> 00:43:41,088
Ant.

450
00:43:41,912 --> 00:43:43,878
It would be very itchy if you get bitten.

451
00:43:48,283 --> 00:43:49,316
Thank you.

452
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:53,883
-Err..
-Yes.

453
00:44:02,383 --> 00:44:03,732
Attention everyone!

454
00:44:03,816 --> 00:44:06,616
Today, we've prepared a very special show.

455
00:44:07,416 --> 00:44:12,349
There is a request for a girl asking
a special someone to sing.

456
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:14,883
Who is going to be the one?

457
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:19,766
Please, welcome Mr. Sun.

458
00:44:19,851 --> 00:44:21,559
I requested it.

459
00:44:34,648 --> 00:44:38,314
Just don't think
that only Juno wants you to sing.

460
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:41,170
I also want to hear you sing.

461
00:44:42,004 --> 00:44:43,339
Can you do that for me?

462
00:44:46,783 --> 00:44:49,449
-But...
-Please.

463
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:51,783
All right.

464
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:58,050
Please welcome Sun with a big applause.

Good job!

496
00:48:31,751 --> 00:48:32,976
Girl, are you a sloth?

497
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,479
You took so long.

498
00:48:35,753 --> 00:48:38,953
Sorry, I have something on my mind.

499
00:48:39,419 --> 00:48:42,077
What were you thinking about?
Sky asked you out?

500
00:48:45,646 --> 00:48:47,321
Not as that but pretty close.

501
00:48:47,776 --> 00:48:49,770
But I think I overreacted.

502
00:48:50,156 --> 00:48:53,356
Hmm, how so, tell me about it?

503
00:48:55,086 --> 00:48:56,319
It's nothing.

504
00:48:57,086 --> 00:48:58,719
Tell me, girl.

505
00:49:01,853 --> 00:49:03,149
It's nothing.

506
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:05,669
In the English class today,

507
00:49:05,754 --> 00:49:07,858
kids were making a fuss
about lover thing,

508
00:49:08,897 --> 00:49:10,620
but Sky said that...

509
00:49:11,253 --> 00:49:15,786
Now we're just friends, but we might be
something else in the future.

510
00:49:18,986 --> 00:49:20,119
Sounds good.

511
00:49:21,205 --> 00:49:25,193
I'm getting closer to Sun too.

512
00:49:27,186 --> 00:49:31,052
Well, it's our last day of camp,

513
00:49:31,588 --> 00:49:36,586
I'm thinking of asking Sun out
to go watch star together.

514
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:37,654
What do you think?

515
00:49:38,586 --> 00:49:39,919
You should.

516
00:49:40,453 --> 00:49:45,653
I'm giving opportunity for you and Sky.

517
00:49:46,486 --> 00:49:47,386
But...

518
00:49:47,728 --> 00:49:50,609
No buts, let's go!

519
00:49:52,053 --> 00:49:54,753
-You think so?
-Come on, go.

520
00:50:04,062 --> 00:50:05,735
Guys, are you sleeping?

521
00:50:13,819 --> 00:50:14,910
Slept already?

522
00:50:15,894 --> 00:50:17,191
Where are they?

523
00:50:18,019 --> 00:50:19,923
Where can they be
in the middle of the night?

524
00:50:20,076 --> 00:50:21,289
They probably slept.

525
00:50:21,886 --> 00:50:24,486
But if they're sleeping,
they should be awake because we're loud.

526
00:50:27,753 --> 00:50:29,119
What are you doing?

527
00:50:29,821 --> 00:50:31,454
Checking to make sure.

528
00:50:32,119 --> 00:50:34,085
See your manners, Juno.

529
00:50:34,686 --> 00:50:37,606
Don't bother them, they're sleeping.

530
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:43,419
Damn, what a disappointing trip.

531
00:50:44,686 --> 00:50:47,486
Never mind, we should head back.

532
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:49,231
We have to get up early.

533
00:50:51,619 --> 00:50:56,319
-Right, split up, see you tomorrow.
-I don't want to.

534
00:51:08,886 --> 00:51:10,352
What a beautiful starry night.

535
00:51:16,021 --> 00:51:19,686
Seeing them reminds me of Father's house.

536
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:27,419
But I don't miss that place.
It's more beautiful here.

537
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:30,552
More freedom.

538
00:51:31,153 --> 00:51:33,586
Was it that suffocating?

539
00:51:36,019 --> 00:51:37,185
Not with you.

540
00:51:38,419 --> 00:51:39,780
I mean,

541
00:51:41,634 --> 00:51:46,102
it was suffocating
when dad kept an eye on me all the time.

542
00:51:48,453 --> 00:51:49,999
So, I applied to a university in Bangkok.

543
00:51:55,239 --> 00:51:58,106
Anyhow, I don't mind that.

544
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:08,785
Now that...

545
00:52:10,153 --> 00:52:14,986
I can be here watching the stars.
I'm happy. That's all.

546
00:52:40,974 --> 00:52:42,190
Why did you kiss me?

547
00:52:42,337 --> 00:52:43,470
It was just a kiss.

548
00:52:43,919 --> 00:52:45,385
How do you feel about me?

549
00:52:45,819 --> 00:52:47,141
I am just a bodyguard.

550
00:52:47,749 --> 00:52:49,702
I have no right to be something else.

551
00:52:49,928 --> 00:52:51,302
Can you stop being stubborn?

552
00:52:51,386 --> 00:52:55,169
I thought you sincerely care about me.
I'll tell my dad to change a bodyguard.

553
00:52:55,253 --> 00:52:57,452
-Young master.
-I don't want you as a bodyguard anymore.

554
00:52:58,086 --> 00:53:01,335
I am a bodyguard.
My only duty is to protect you.

555
00:53:01,419 --> 00:53:04,619
No right to be something else.

556
00:53:13,019 --> 00:53:15,152
