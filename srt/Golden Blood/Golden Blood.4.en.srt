I'm okay now.

00:01:45,693 --> 00:01:46,923

I'm okay.

Just tell me the truth.

33
00:04:06,923 --> 00:04:09,853
Hey, have you made up your mind?

34
00:04:10,893 --> 00:04:14,493
Are you still hoping
that I would accept the deal?

35
00:04:15,023 --> 00:04:17,453
Just let me trade in your territory,

36
00:04:18,123 --> 00:04:22,223
while you stand there watching
and get a piece of the pie.

37
00:04:22,453 --> 00:04:24,553
Aren't you rich enough, Sakkhee?

38
00:04:26,623 --> 00:04:31,723
Money? I can never have too much.

39
00:04:32,853 --> 00:04:33,953
Sakkhee.

40
00:04:36,153 --> 00:04:38,623
Since that incident,
I've been out of business.

41
00:04:39,923 --> 00:04:43,283
You do whatever you want,
but not in my territory.

42
00:04:44,023 --> 00:04:47,323
I can't stand you or any damn one
trading drugs around here.

43
00:04:48,193 --> 00:04:49,993
I'll give you some time,

44
00:04:51,293 --> 00:04:54,823
but don't take it too long.
I couldn't be bothered.

45
00:04:56,223 --> 00:05:01,053
Or else I might have a short temper,
who knows.

46
00:05:13,453 --> 00:05:15,053
You better watch out.

47
00:05:17,723 --> 00:05:19,823
I mean your golf ball.

48
00:05:37,393 --> 00:05:39,553
Later that day,

49
00:05:40,093 --> 00:05:45,853
Sakkhee sent his underlings
to attack our guys, seriously injured.

50
00:05:47,253 --> 00:05:48,783
As a threat.

51
00:05:51,323 --> 00:05:56,223
But what he did made Father decide easier.

52
00:05:57,693 --> 00:05:59,693
So dad rejected him, right?

53
00:06:03,793 --> 00:06:05,453
You really won't change your mind?

54
00:06:06,193 --> 00:06:10,423
I stand by my words and you know me.

55
00:06:11,693 --> 00:06:14,623
Don't ever bring the dreadful drugs
in my territory.

56
00:06:19,215 --> 00:06:23,445
So, Father sent me
to protect young master.

57
00:06:25,493 --> 00:06:30,423
He knows that Sakkhee
won't back off easily.

58
00:06:39,823 --> 00:06:41,223
I knew it now.

59
00:06:45,953 --> 00:06:47,853
I understand what's happened.

60
00:06:52,323 --> 00:06:56,453
Thank you, you always take care of me.

61
00:08:03,053 --> 00:08:05,183
Young master, what can I do for you?

62
00:08:06,323 --> 00:08:07,923
I have a favor to ask.

63
00:08:27,823 --> 00:08:28,823
I'm ready.

64
00:08:30,623 --> 00:08:33,553
Are you sure, young master?

65
00:08:34,593 --> 00:08:36,253
It might not help that much,

66
00:08:37,023 --> 00:08:40,253
at least I won't be your burden.

67
00:08:43,153 --> 00:08:46,953
From now on, I'll listen to what you say.

68
00:08:52,023 --> 00:08:56,453
I don't want you to get hurt
because of me anymore.

69
00:09:02,193 --> 00:09:03,323
Shall we begin?

70
00:09:14,993 --> 00:09:17,453
Ouch, ouch.

71
00:09:18,153 --> 00:09:19,453
Be gentler!

72
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:23,653
Stand up.

73
00:09:33,723 --> 00:09:36,123
That was just a warm up.

74
00:09:36,953 --> 00:09:40,583
Here, I'm serious now.

75
00:09:43,623 --> 00:09:44,553
Yes, sir.

76
00:10:13,223 --> 00:10:14,723
What are you made of?

77
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:22,383
Let go, Sun, let go.

78
00:10:48,253 --> 00:10:49,483
Why can't I take you down?

79
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,523
Ouch, that hurts so bad.

80
00:11:17,993 --> 00:11:21,223
You have a lot to practice, young master.

81
00:11:48,053 --> 00:11:49,853
I know your weakness.

82
00:11:52,823 --> 00:11:56,669
Hey, young master!

83
00:11:56,753 --> 00:11:59,009
-Don't young master, please.
-Aren't you a badass?

84
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:03,253
Young master, don't…

85
00:12:47,023 --> 00:12:50,153
Excuse me, I'll go take a shower.

86
00:12:53,053 --> 00:12:54,783
Then, I'll prepare your dinner.

87
00:13:05,453 --> 00:13:10,323
Do light exercise or cool down
while you wait.

88
00:13:12,023 --> 00:13:12,856
Uh-huh.

89
00:13:41,493 --> 00:13:44,093
Let me apply ointment for you.

90
00:13:51,923 --> 00:13:53,253
What ointment?

91
00:13:54,152 --> 00:13:56,052
Bruise and pain reliever ointment.

92
00:13:56,697 --> 00:13:58,497
You rarely exercise,

93
00:13:59,223 --> 00:14:00,680
and today was rough.

94
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:02,866
You would get sore.

95
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:05,657
Yeah.

96
00:14:06,493 --> 00:14:07,823
Take off your shirt, sir.

97
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:11,283
Huh, do I really have to?

98
00:14:12,053 --> 00:14:14,453
If you don't, how can I apply it?

99
00:14:17,753 --> 00:14:19,053
Don't be shy.

100
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:25,323
That time,
I've already seen you naked.

101
00:14:25,623 --> 00:14:29,053
Hey, why did you bring that up?

102
00:14:30,793 --> 00:14:32,193
Take off your shirt, please.

103
00:15:02,453 --> 00:15:03,623
Turn around.

104
00:16:13,093 --> 00:16:14,353
Lay on your front.

105
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,037
Why?

106
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:20,920
I'll massage your back.

107
00:17:16,423 --> 00:17:20,053
Wow, it feels so good.

108
00:17:23,453 --> 00:17:25,653
Is there anything you aren't capable of?

109
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,923
All done, sir.

110
00:17:46,053 --> 00:17:47,223
Young master?

111
00:17:52,153 --> 00:17:53,323
Young master.

112
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:19,339
See, I told you.

113
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:22,039
Nah. Really. No way.

114
00:19:22,123 --> 00:19:24,039
What are you talking about?
Sounds fun.

115
00:19:24,123 --> 00:19:25,809
Hello.

116
00:19:25,901 --> 00:19:27,298
May I sit?

117
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:29,631
Sit down.

118
00:19:29,893 --> 00:19:31,153
Move your ass.

119
00:19:32,823 --> 00:19:34,523
Have you eaten, Pitch?

120
00:19:37,122 --> 00:19:40,198
Just looking at you girls,
I'm already full.

121
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:42,953
-Wow.
-Yuck!

122
00:19:45,493 --> 00:19:48,423
Are you pregnant?
You throw up a lot.

123
00:19:52,423 --> 00:19:55,353
Sky, Sun come here.

124
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:01,621
Hey guys, I have something to tell you.

125
00:20:01,893 --> 00:20:05,323
I want to invite you all
to a dance rematch.

126
00:20:05,876 --> 00:20:06,976
Come with us, Sun.

127
00:20:07,496 --> 00:20:10,426
So me and Toktaeng
will be at ease if you're there.

128
00:20:13,321 --> 00:20:15,581
Yeah, sound good.

129
00:20:16,223 --> 00:20:18,123
What a shame, last time we had a fight.

130
00:20:18,731 --> 00:20:21,091
Sun, please come with us.

131
00:20:22,175 --> 00:20:23,616
Yeah, we all go, it'd be fun.

132
00:20:23,701 --> 00:20:24,956
Sun, please come.

133
00:20:25,193 --> 00:20:27,523
I think now is not a good time
for partying.

134
00:20:30,393 --> 00:20:32,393
What are you afraid of, Sun?

135
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,011
You can fight like Tony Jaa.

136
00:20:36,123 --> 00:20:39,053
Yeah, last time you bounced them off.

137
00:20:39,523 --> 00:20:42,526
Right, come on, please come.

138
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,805
I think I agree with Sun.

139
00:20:47,391 --> 00:20:50,551
We'll have classes together
for many years, there's always next time.

140
00:20:51,093 --> 00:20:54,523
But now we should go to class.

141
00:20:57,903 --> 00:20:59,180
Wait, what?

142
00:21:00,453 --> 00:21:01,823
What the heck?

143
00:21:04,553 --> 00:21:05,718
That's weird.

144
00:21:06,553 --> 00:21:09,253
Usually, Sky would go against Sun.

145
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:11,497
Why did he give up so easily?

146
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:15,899
Yeah right, but I won't give up.

147
00:21:16,553 --> 00:21:19,953
I'll keep convincing till he's in.

148
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,814
See you later, Pitch.

149
00:21:21,898 --> 00:21:22,920
Bye-bye.

150
00:21:34,853 --> 00:21:36,023
Hey.

151
00:21:37,138 --> 00:21:38,207
What are you looking at?

152
00:21:38,623 --> 00:21:41,883
Look at you, aren't you going to class?

153
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:45,153
Nosy, you long nose.

154
00:21:46,623 --> 00:21:48,509
Hmm, this is too much!

155
00:21:48,593 --> 00:21:50,739
-You're nosy
-Try me, bruh!

156
00:21:50,823 --> 00:21:52,869
Let go, I have to go.

157
00:21:53,635 --> 00:21:55,135
-Hey!
-What?

158
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,480
Going to class without the bag?

159
00:21:56,923 --> 00:21:58,083
Bye.

160
00:21:59,723 --> 00:22:01,272
As everyone knows,

161
00:22:01,568 --> 00:22:04,738
the volunteer camp is coming
around the corner.

162
00:22:05,453 --> 00:22:07,824
We've got some big sponsors,

163
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:13,683
and rest is up to you guys
to do a fundraiser.

164
00:22:14,523 --> 00:22:19,253
If anyone has special techniques,
strategies, or any talents,

165
00:22:20,223 --> 00:22:22,553
please bring them out on the table
to do so.

166
00:22:39,523 --> 00:22:45,023
Hey, can I go to the volunteer camp?

167
00:22:48,793 --> 00:22:52,223
If you want to go, then we will.

168
00:22:52,723 --> 00:22:56,553
Eh, why is it so easy?

169
00:22:57,853 --> 00:23:01,423
I know that you want to live
like an ordinary kid.

170
00:23:02,323 --> 00:23:08,223
Moreover, it's a club activity.
It'd be strange if we won't go.

171
00:23:10,993 --> 00:23:14,293
Just have to be more careful.

172
00:23:15,723 --> 00:23:18,704
Anyway, leave that to my worries.

173
00:23:21,753 --> 00:23:23,995
You're the cutest.

174
00:24:03,794 --> 00:24:05,077
Why don't you come in?

175
00:24:06,323 --> 00:24:07,923
I'll guard the door for you.

176
00:24:09,723 --> 00:24:11,857
I'm done. You should get in.

177
00:24:14,793 --> 00:24:20,123
Sun, there're a lot of people here.
I'll be fine. Take care of your business.

178
00:24:26,853 --> 00:24:27,923
Yes, sir.

179
00:24:37,993 --> 00:24:38,993
What do you want?

180
00:24:39,893 --> 00:24:42,153
Come with me, serious talk.

181
00:24:48,023 --> 00:24:50,953
Look me in the eyes, and answer me.

182
00:24:51,393 --> 00:24:53,593
Why are you suddenly
being friendly to Sun?

183
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:57,323
I thought you hated him like a crap.

184
00:24:58,438 --> 00:25:02,898
I told you that he's my distant relative.
What do you want?

185
00:25:03,491 --> 00:25:04,491
One more thing,

186
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:07,067
you lied to me that day,
you said you'd do assignments at home.

187
00:25:07,323 --> 00:25:10,853
I knew you went out with Sun.

188
00:25:11,323 --> 00:25:13,139
Whoa, when did you become a detective?

189
00:25:13,223 --> 00:25:14,614
Don't change the topic.

190
00:25:15,244 --> 00:25:16,514
Answer me.

191
00:25:17,993 --> 00:25:21,015
That day, I just hung out with Sun.

192
00:25:21,666 --> 00:25:23,239
What's the big deal?

193
00:25:23,323 --> 00:25:27,601
Hold on, you tell me the truth.

194
00:25:28,463 --> 00:25:30,123
I'm your best friend.

195
00:25:46,353 --> 00:25:47,323
Young master.

196
00:25:48,993 --> 00:25:50,193
Young master.

197
00:25:52,953 --> 00:25:57,283
No wonder, he's so good at fighting.

198
00:25:58,953 --> 00:26:00,471
Well, yeah.

199
00:26:01,068 --> 00:26:03,998
I know that he's been hurt
because of me so many times.

200
00:26:04,293 --> 00:26:06,123
I don't want to walk into
any kind of trouble.

201
00:26:06,493 --> 00:26:08,948
Yeah, I agree with you.

202
00:26:09,498 --> 00:26:14,368
Having someone point the gun at you,
who'd be happy.

203
00:26:15,353 --> 00:26:16,462
Young master.

204
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,683
Why don't you wait for me there?

205
00:26:26,123 --> 00:26:27,366
I'm sorry.

206
00:26:28,114 --> 00:26:30,837
I have something to discuss
with Bank.

207
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,023
Sun.

208
00:26:37,293 --> 00:26:38,993
I told him everything.

209
00:26:40,123 --> 00:26:42,683
He already knew about my dad.

210
00:26:43,423 --> 00:26:44,766
So, I don't want to hide it.

211
00:26:47,893 --> 00:26:48,823
Yes, sir.

212
00:26:51,123 --> 00:26:55,183
Mr. Bank, please keep this confidential.

213
00:26:56,683 --> 00:26:59,283
Okay, I promise.

214
00:27:14,753 --> 00:27:16,653
You should have told me.

215
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,923
It's not that easy.

216
00:27:22,093 --> 00:27:22,926
Hey!

217
00:27:24,493 --> 00:27:26,023
So you guys are here.

218
00:27:26,753 --> 00:27:29,683
We've been looking at the restroom,
but didn't see you there.

219
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:33,413
Really, what's the matter?

220
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:35,983
Pitch invites us to go
pay respect to the shrine.

221
00:27:37,423 --> 00:27:39,983
It's very sacred. I guarantee.

222
00:27:41,123 --> 00:27:42,483
You bullshit.

223
00:28:01,693 --> 00:28:03,823
It's called "Officially Graduated Shrine".

224
00:28:04,861 --> 00:28:05,889
What?

225
00:28:06,454 --> 00:28:07,616
For real?

226
00:28:09,223 --> 00:28:10,823
It wasn't called that at first,

227
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:13,629
but many students successfully
graduated after praying,

228
00:28:14,627 --> 00:28:16,115
so it became sacred.

229
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,703
So, I brought you kids to pay respect.

230
00:28:20,853 --> 00:28:23,783
But I think the shrine's name
is kind of weird.

231
00:28:25,776 --> 00:28:27,476
Officially done or doomed.

232
00:28:27,953 --> 00:28:29,183
You doomed!

233
00:28:32,093 --> 00:28:35,023
If you show disrespect
you better not worship that.

234
00:28:39,376 --> 00:28:40,676
I'll do it.

235
00:28:53,223 --> 00:28:58,953
All right, everyone prays after me.

236
00:29:00,053 --> 00:29:04,239
-Puttang Arathananung.
-Puttang Arathananung.

237
00:29:04,323 --> 00:29:08,169
-Thammang Arathananung.
-Thammang Arathananung.

238
00:29:08,253 --> 00:29:12,023
-Sangkung Arathananung.
-Sangkung Arathananung.

239
00:29:12,553 --> 00:29:15,983
Whoever prayed this
would be successfully done.

240
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:18,883
What done?

241
00:29:20,284 --> 00:29:21,529
You're probably doomed!

242
00:29:22,883 --> 00:29:23,893
Nah.

243
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,618
Pray and make a wish.

244
00:29:48,277 --> 00:29:50,147
All done? Let put it in the urn.

245
00:29:51,193 --> 00:29:52,993
Give it to me, I'll do it.

246
00:30:06,893 --> 00:30:09,496
Young master, young master?

247
00:30:19,052 --> 00:30:19,885
Young master.

248
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:28,512
Are you all right?

249
00:30:31,523 --> 00:30:32,853
Are you okay, young master?

250
00:30:37,423 --> 00:30:38,637
Take it easy.

251
00:31:12,093 --> 00:31:13,793
Hey, Sun.

252
00:31:14,223 --> 00:31:15,923
Have you practiced Ninja moves?

253
00:31:16,323 --> 00:31:17,783
Mr. Bank, do you have any idea?

254
00:31:18,207 --> 00:31:21,637
Why is young master scared
of the firecracker noise?

255
00:31:22,251 --> 00:31:23,852
You don't know?

256
00:31:24,878 --> 00:31:27,483
Then you need some help.

257
00:31:31,938 --> 00:31:33,223
As far as I knew,

258
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:37,314
Sky told me that when he was a child,

259
00:31:37,453 --> 00:31:41,153
he confronted the shooting at his house.

260
00:31:42,029 --> 00:31:46,659
After that he's developed some kind
of gun phobia, gunshot, firecracker.

261
00:31:52,193 --> 00:31:54,523
If you want to know more…

262
00:31:57,093 --> 00:31:58,123
What the?

263
00:32:01,023 --> 00:32:01,953
Suppose...

264
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:08,383
your friend is the mafia's son
and he is currently under attack.

265
00:32:08,953 --> 00:32:12,183
Then his dad sent a bodyguard
to protect him.

266
00:32:13,493 --> 00:32:14,453
Go on.

267
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:18,351
The enemy keeps sending
a bad guy to go after him.

268
00:32:19,223 --> 00:32:21,283
Then what would you do?

269
00:32:22,653 --> 00:32:23,953
Why are you asking this?

270
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:28,753
I want to hear your opinion.

271
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:32,420
Brainstorming some ideas
to help your friend.

272
00:32:34,323 --> 00:32:35,983
You care a lot for your friend huh.

273
00:32:36,907 --> 00:32:40,337
Yeah, wait, what are you saying?

274
00:32:41,253 --> 00:32:43,223
Just forget it, it's just a made up story.

275
00:32:52,123 --> 00:32:53,523
Why did you hit me?

276
00:32:54,093 --> 00:32:56,393
I eat rice, not grass.

277
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:01,159
So all you were saying
is about Sky and Sun, right?

278
00:33:02,723 --> 00:33:05,453
Heh, how do you know?

279
00:33:05,968 --> 00:33:06,879
Excuse me.

280
00:33:07,382 --> 00:33:08,693
Are you ordering more?

281
00:33:09,668 --> 00:33:12,898
I'm going to order
a grass milkshake for you.

282
00:33:13,767 --> 00:33:15,417
Nothing, we won't bother.

283
00:33:16,275 --> 00:33:20,405
I knew at the first glance
when I met Sky, that he's a mafia's son.

284
00:33:21,323 --> 00:33:23,523
Also, when he got stabbed in the restroom.

285
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:27,453
I knew there got to be something wrong.

286
00:33:28,523 --> 00:33:30,453
And I waited to hear it from you.

287
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:44,253
You're kind of cute.

288
00:33:47,023 --> 00:33:48,118
What do you mean?

289
00:33:49,013 --> 00:33:53,313
I thought you were a little dump,
but you care a lot for your friend.

290
00:33:53,807 --> 00:33:58,567
Of course, but just now
you petted me like a dog.

291
00:34:16,123 --> 00:34:17,690
Put your hand through this.

292
00:34:18,551 --> 00:34:21,087
Hey, too fast.

293
00:34:22,153 --> 00:34:25,183
Put through then lift.

294
00:34:26,591 --> 00:34:28,000
Okay. Okay.

295
00:34:38,253 --> 00:34:41,523
Dang, why is it so hard to throw you off.

296
00:34:42,253 --> 00:34:44,053
You just need more practice.

297
00:34:45,123 --> 00:34:48,053
Even landing a punch on you is impossible.

298
00:34:53,323 --> 00:34:54,953
Careful there.

299
00:34:55,915 --> 00:34:59,345
Hey, I have an idea.

300
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,130
I'll spread the news to my friends,

301
00:35:02,537 --> 00:35:06,467
that someone is targeting Sky,
so they'll look out for him.

302
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:13,223
Well, turn out you can do
something out of your character too.

303
00:35:14,692 --> 00:35:15,678
Is that a compliment?

304
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,153
A curse.

305
00:35:19,353 --> 00:35:20,944
Calm down.

306
00:35:21,345 --> 00:35:25,553
You're the handsomest
and coolest, alright?

307
00:35:34,353 --> 00:35:37,583
Dang, that hurts.

308
00:36:26,723 --> 00:36:27,653
Mom.

309
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:30,983
Mom!

310
00:36:31,193 --> 00:36:33,523
Young master, young master.

311
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:35,223
Young master, what's going on?

312
00:36:36,684 --> 00:36:37,884
You're having a nightmare?

313
00:36:51,353 --> 00:36:52,453
It's all right.

314
00:36:58,306 --> 00:36:59,836
You'll be all right, young master.

315
00:37:01,759 --> 00:37:03,048
I'm here with you.

316
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:07,477
Young master,

317
00:37:09,047 --> 00:37:10,621
I want to know...

318
00:37:12,484 --> 00:37:14,784
why are you scared
of the firecracker noise?

319
00:37:24,053 --> 00:37:25,423
You really want to know?

320
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,720
I want to know everything about you.

321
00:37:30,553 --> 00:37:35,523
I only knew that you hate gunshot
and firecrackers.

322
00:37:36,793 --> 00:37:38,393
But I didn't know why.

323
00:37:54,921 --> 00:37:56,081
Are you ready?

324
00:37:57,797 --> 00:37:59,567
Where are...

325
00:38:07,721 --> 00:38:08,895
My dad's enemy...

326
00:38:10,323 --> 00:38:12,283
broke into the house
when I was a child.

327
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:18,053
It was the last time...

328
00:38:20,993 --> 00:38:22,553
that I hugged my mom.

329
00:38:34,623 --> 00:38:36,283
You'll be all right, young master.

330
00:38:39,493 --> 00:38:41,253
I'll be here with you...

331
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:45,817
until you fell asleep.

332
00:38:54,493 --> 00:38:56,293
Let's tuck you in.

333
00:39:13,723 --> 00:39:15,023
Sun,

334
00:39:16,323 --> 00:39:18,223
can you sleep over tonight?

335
00:40:11,745 --> 00:40:14,395
Toktaeng, you're great at drawing.

336
00:40:17,523 --> 00:40:21,268
You'll get better at it too, Sun.

337
00:40:24,023 --> 00:40:25,009
I'm sure.

338
00:40:25,093 --> 00:40:26,653
Morning, guys

339
00:40:29,544 --> 00:40:32,014
What's up Bank?
So perkiness in the early morning.

340
00:40:32,693 --> 00:40:36,793
A senior wants me to pass around
a paper to sign up for volunteer camp.

341
00:40:37,315 --> 00:40:38,275
We should go together.

342
00:40:41,623 --> 00:40:43,990
Please guys, come on.

343
00:40:47,793 --> 00:40:50,219
If Sun will go, I'll go too.

344
00:40:54,682 --> 00:40:57,612
If Juno will go, I'll go too.

345
00:41:05,282 --> 00:41:07,312
Err…

346
00:41:08,814 --> 00:41:10,914
I'll talk about this with him later.

347
00:41:14,623 --> 00:41:17,953
Just go camping,
do you need permission for that?

348
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:22,172
Yeah, if you didn't tell us
you're a relative,

349
00:41:22,483 --> 00:41:24,583
I'd think you're dating.

350
00:41:32,593 --> 00:41:37,053
It's not like that. Guys go talk.

351
00:41:38,943 --> 00:41:40,210
Come on, up.

352
00:41:40,788 --> 00:41:41,983
We'll be back.

353
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,716
I'll wait for good news, hurry up.

354
00:41:49,493 --> 00:41:50,593
The thing is…

355
00:42:02,075 --> 00:42:05,605
Yesterday, I told you we can go.

356
00:42:06,805 --> 00:42:08,075
I know,

357
00:42:09,283 --> 00:42:13,035
but I've been thinking
about it last night,

358
00:42:14,514 --> 00:42:16,043
I don't want to bother you.

359
00:42:17,476 --> 00:42:18,495
Bother me?

360
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:24,950
They sent the guy after me
even though we are in Bangkok.

361
00:42:26,136 --> 00:42:27,528
If we'll go out of town,

362
00:42:28,817 --> 00:42:30,214
wouldn't they come after me?

363
00:42:37,693 --> 00:42:41,923
I am here to protect you, young master.

364
00:42:44,083 --> 00:42:46,413
I want you to live a happy life.

365
00:42:47,897 --> 00:42:49,460
If you're happy,

366
00:42:52,176 --> 00:42:53,687
I'll be too.

367
00:43:01,614 --> 00:43:03,356
I want you to be happy too.

368
00:43:27,653 --> 00:43:30,183
Bank is circling the paper
for everybody to sign up.

369
00:43:30,723 --> 00:43:32,623
We could sum up the number
at the end of the day.

370
00:43:34,021 --> 00:43:37,803
Good thing he helps us out,
or else we couldn't make it on time.

371
00:43:38,483 --> 00:43:39,819
I think so too.

372
00:43:42,576 --> 00:43:43,806
What's not on time?

373
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:47,599
Paperwork for my club,
there's not enough members.

374
00:43:47,923 --> 00:43:50,753
The date is coming up
but nothing is done.

375
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:53,805
You want a hand?

376
00:43:54,769 --> 00:43:55,821
I happen to be free.

377
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:59,086
Really, an activist like you?

378
00:43:59,342 --> 00:44:00,884
Are you going to help out?

379
00:44:01,993 --> 00:44:06,553
If you help us out
I'll prostrate your feet respectfully.

380
00:44:06,923 --> 00:44:08,323
Sit down, you sit there.

381
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:12,007
This is my head, not feet,
or else I'll change my mind.

382
00:44:12,092 --> 00:44:12,980
Wait, hang on.

383
00:44:13,459 --> 00:44:15,540
Then what about your club?

384
00:44:15,827 --> 00:44:17,214
Are you really going to help?

385
00:44:17,953 --> 00:44:21,653
Sure, but on one condition.

386
00:44:30,522 --> 00:44:32,622
Aww, pretty.

387
00:44:32,958 --> 00:44:36,188
Please tell me something else
I don't already know.

388
00:44:37,913 --> 00:44:39,769
Look, this camping...

389
00:44:40,099 --> 00:44:43,643
I'm going to win that stone-face heart
under the light of stars.

390
00:44:46,237 --> 00:44:48,990
Don't make a face like that.

391
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:51,544
Have you made up your mind?

392
00:44:52,353 --> 00:44:53,453
Made up what?

393
00:44:54,053 --> 00:45:00,438
Well, either Sky, Bank, or Pitch?

394
00:45:02,153 --> 00:45:04,696
You're mad. They're all friends.

395
00:45:05,299 --> 00:45:07,029
Sounds suspicious, high note.

396
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:08,498
You're weird.

397
00:45:09,293 --> 00:45:10,793
Sound suspicious, low tone.

398
00:45:11,523 --> 00:45:13,698
They're just friends.

399
00:45:13,993 --> 00:45:15,762
Something's up.

400
00:45:16,874 --> 00:45:17,823
I'll go now.

401
00:45:17,993 --> 00:45:19,693
There, I smell something.

402
00:45:23,201 --> 00:45:24,132
Pitch!

403
00:45:25,425 --> 00:45:26,425
Hold on.

404
00:45:30,953 --> 00:45:31,786
What' up?

405
00:45:32,405 --> 00:45:36,105
Do you know I am going to
the club volunteer camp?

406
00:45:36,922 --> 00:45:38,586
And we have to stay overnight
in the countryside.

407
00:45:39,372 --> 00:45:40,595
Why are you so worked up?

408
00:45:40,882 --> 00:45:42,305
You've never been out of town?

409
00:45:42,923 --> 00:45:44,140
It's not that.

410
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:46,455
This time it's for community service.

411
00:45:47,314 --> 00:45:49,809
Sounds like you'll save the world
from aliens.

412
00:45:50,493 --> 00:45:52,644
Dang it, man.
You don't get it.

413
00:45:53,794 --> 00:45:54,793
See you later.

414
00:45:59,293 --> 00:46:04,423
I'll be gone in a couple of days,
you must be careful.

415
00:46:06,253 --> 00:46:07,283
For what?

416
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:11,452
That you're going to miss me too much.

417
00:46:12,628 --> 00:46:14,437
Like I'm going to miss you?

418
00:46:15,315 --> 00:46:16,230
Never mind,

419
00:46:16,894 --> 00:46:18,773
I'll be the one who misses you then.

420
00:46:19,123 --> 00:46:21,672
See you later, bye.

421
00:46:37,718 --> 00:46:40,764
Wow, this is impressive.

422
00:46:43,545 --> 00:46:45,005
You did all this by yourself?

423
00:46:49,546 --> 00:46:50,946
Hey, wait, wait.

424
00:46:53,252 --> 00:46:56,710
For the underwear, I'll take care of them.

425
00:46:57,598 --> 00:47:00,298
Don't worry, I'll do it.

426
00:47:03,593 --> 00:47:08,353
You would spoil me rotten.

427
00:47:10,853 --> 00:47:14,553
Why not, so you wouldn't tell Father,

428
00:47:15,282 --> 00:47:16,785
to replace me by someone else.

429
00:47:19,593 --> 00:47:21,392
You could read my mind,

430
00:47:22,254 --> 00:47:23,793
who else could do that?

431
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:36,939
Young master, you can check
if there's anything missing.

432
00:47:41,053 --> 00:47:42,423
Let me see.

433
00:47:50,453 --> 00:47:53,753
All set, as expected of your standard.

434
00:47:54,337 --> 00:47:55,847
What you haven't do is to bathe me.

435
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:02,164
If you want, I can do that too.

436
00:48:03,523 --> 00:48:07,613
I've seen it all anyway.

437
00:48:09,585 --> 00:48:11,122
Young master's thing...

438
00:48:12,778 --> 00:48:14,393
is showing.

439
00:48:18,053 --> 00:48:20,925
Hey, why didn't you say so?

440
00:48:21,553 --> 00:48:22,983
You do whatever you're doing.

441
00:48:36,338 --> 00:48:37,754
I slept well last night.

442
00:48:38,926 --> 00:48:40,799
That's a lie. Look at you.

443
00:48:41,123 --> 00:48:42,753
Really, I'm not lying.

444
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:44,451
Pitch?

445
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,921
Are you going to volunteer camp too?

446
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:49,922
Yes, sweetie.

447
00:48:50,237 --> 00:48:53,197
Hold on, you're not a club member.

448
00:48:53,643 --> 00:48:54,773
How can you go?

449
00:48:56,123 --> 00:48:59,823
Too bad, I've got a connection.
I can join any camp.

450
00:49:00,675 --> 00:49:01,545
All right?

451
00:49:04,953 --> 00:49:07,369
All right, you two keep talking,

452
00:49:07,453 --> 00:49:09,771
we'll go settle down
before the seats are all taken.

453
00:49:10,093 --> 00:49:11,193
See you in the bus.

454
00:49:12,351 --> 00:49:17,721
I was so happy not to see you
for a couple days. Dang.

455
00:49:23,209 --> 00:49:24,688
I'm going with you,

456
00:49:26,301 --> 00:49:27,994
so you don't have to miss me.

457
00:49:29,993 --> 00:49:31,020
Sounds good?

458
00:49:33,953 --> 00:49:35,283
Don't play with my head.

459
00:49:35,893 --> 00:49:37,053
Hold it.

460
00:49:48,623 --> 00:49:51,383
Hey, is something wrong?

461
00:49:53,093 --> 00:49:53,993
Nothing.

462
00:49:54,793 --> 00:49:57,723
If nothing's wrong then stop frowning.

463
00:49:57,993 --> 00:50:00,393
I think they won't bother us in the woods.

464
00:50:01,593 --> 00:50:02,426
Yeah.

465
00:50:05,623 --> 00:50:09,323
Sun, do you realize...

466
00:50:10,053 --> 00:50:13,753
that you're very handsome when you smile.

467
00:50:17,093 --> 00:50:19,353
Let's see, smile.

468
00:50:22,253 --> 00:50:23,283
Just like this.

469
00:50:27,593 --> 00:50:29,953
Man, a superhuman like you,

470
00:50:30,398 --> 00:50:33,568
is it that hard just to smile?

471
00:50:43,993 --> 00:50:46,793
Just like that,
smile every now and then.

472
00:50:48,723 --> 00:50:49,883
But...

473
00:50:52,759 --> 00:50:53,782
What?

474
00:50:55,392 --> 00:50:57,452
Can I keep this smile just for you?

475
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:20,190
Hey, Sun, Sky!

476
00:51:21,038 --> 00:51:24,338
-Hey, hurry up, the bus is departing.
-Come on.

477
00:51:25,043 --> 00:51:25,943
I'm here.

478
00:51:27,819 --> 00:51:30,119
What took you so long?

479
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,760
(Next Episode)
Boo!

480
00:51:43,965 --> 00:51:45,638
