are you all right?

From now on, I'll take custody of you.

00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:21,840
Yes, sir.

73
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,740
Why?

00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,690
I want to live a better life.

75

00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:39,860
Firstly,

80
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,860
call me father.

81
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,040
Yes, father.

00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,490

87
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,620
Go harder.

88
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,690
Go right-left, right-left.

89
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,810
Make use of
the strength of your shoulders.

90
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,820
Go.

91
00:08:17,028 --> 00:08:18,600
Hum! Kick! Kick! Kick!

92
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:25,790
Try again.

93
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,280
What!?

94
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,760
So, you are an orphan.

95
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,650
And my dad adopted you.

96
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,439
Then you practiced the martial arts.

97
00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:09,213
That's it?

98
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,980
Yeah, that's it.

99
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,038
My life is just too ordinary.

100
00:09:15,364 --> 00:09:19,400
I just study hard and
take good care of you.

101
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,290
To repay father's kindness.

102
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,390
Can I have a little more details?

103
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,760
What do you want to know, young master?

104
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,140
Something like

105
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,750
friends?

106
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,300
Do you any friends?

107
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,020
Close one like me and Bank.

108
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,060
I have none, sir.

109
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,960
I am homeschooling without friends.

110
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,080
Actually, I had some
when I was in an orphanage.

111
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,460
I hadn't visited the place
since I was adopted.

112
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,040
No friends.

113
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,970
What about any lover?

114
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,050
None.

115
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,330
No?

116
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,700
But what about your preference style?

117
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,470
Actually, I have.

118
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,680
I like people who is kind,

119
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,110

120
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:26,260

121
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,870
If your face is sweet,

122
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,640
it can't be better.

123
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,750
Sweet face?

124
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,990
But I'm still okay if not so.

125
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:44,970
That's all?

126
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,550
That's all.

127
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,230
What about

128
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,050
your dreams?

129

else you want to do?

From now on,

00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,640
you have to donate your
blood every three months.

136
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,260
Remember, your blood is
to be exclusively kept for Sky.

137

My only purpose is
to serve young master.

144
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:43,630
I studied hard,

145
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,600
and practiced fighting.

146
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,660
I just want to be
capable of protecting you.

147
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,420
Thanks a lot.

148
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,950
Do you want anything or

149
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,310
can I do anything for you?

150
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,290
I can do anything.

151
00:13:13,121 --> 00:13:17,220
You know, you've got hurt for me.

152
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,040
I want to repay you.

153
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,600
You're safe and sound,

154
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,060
that's the best thing for me.

155
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,260
Don't say that,

156
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,460
I can do anything.

157

Stop! Stop! Stop!

159
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:17,960
Is this what you really want me to do?

160
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,450
To exercise?

161
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,030
Sun,

162
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,722
do you want to harass me?

163
00:14:23,722 --> 00:14:25,130
Out with it.

164
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,270
No, young master.

165
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,620
I just want you to be stronger.

166
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,740
If you get stronger,

167
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,240
I want you to learn some self-defense.

168
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,190
But,

169
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,590
if you don't want to put up with it,

170
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,427
that's okay.

171
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,070
I will protect you anyway.

172
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,110
You want me to learn self-defense,

173
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,580
because someone
wants to kill me, right?

174
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,200
Well, no one gives me an answer.

175
00:15:00,855 --> 00:15:03,820
But I know this is not a small matter,

176
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:07,660
or my dad won't send you to guard me.

177
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:12,500
Fine, do whatever you want.
I'm sleeping now.

178
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,290
Wait, young master.

179
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,690
Keep going a bit more.

180
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,430
- More?
- Yeah, for your own goods.

181
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,520
Come on, keep going.

182
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,757
Come on, keep going.

183
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,720
- What is it?
- Let's go.

184
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,860
Hurry up.

185
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,630
Riding your back
is better for yourself too.

186
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,030
What do you get then?

187
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,150
Make way, please.

188
00:16:35,352 --> 00:16:35,928
Ready?

189
00:16:36,254 --> 00:16:36,958
Yeah.

190
00:16:38,312 --> 00:16:40,480
Freeze, police! Don't move.

191
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,920
Hey, don't move.

192
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:48,910
Go.

193
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,180
Son of a bitch, what about the lost?

194
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,421
Where is that bastard?

195
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:03,390
I've made him shut up
so the cops won't find us.

196
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,110
Well, great.

197
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,290
How did the cops know?

198
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,160
Bastard.

199
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,490
You are a bastard,

200
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,350
aren't you?

201
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:32,080
A payback for that you dared
send the guy to hurt my son.

202
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,180
Hey, wait.

203
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,410
You bastard,

204
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,680
if you are right,
don't hang up on Gudiva.

205
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,150
Hello?

206
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,850
Son of a bitch.

207
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,450
Hey, Bank.

208
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,860
Hey, Pitch.

209
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,410
Hello.

210
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,780
What are you doing here?

211
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,520
I want to give you clothes
and some snacks.

212
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,820
Thanks again for helping me last time.

213
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:45,810
What a good timing.

214
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,080
I'm bored.

215
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,010
I want to travel.

216
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,810
Sure.

217
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,290
Let me see.

218
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,420
Right now you shouldn't go out,
young master.

219
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,460
Do you want me to just stay home?

220
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,930
I have to go to school.

221
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:22,820
But...

222
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,260
Anyway.

223
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,130
I won't fear with your protection.

224
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,722
I'll invite Sky.

225
00:19:32,722 --> 00:19:34,820
The more the better.

226
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,560
Uh, I think.

227
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,140
Hush.

228
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Hold on.

229
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,440
Hello, Bank. What's up?

230
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,410
Just stay at home.

231
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,660
No plans at all.

232
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,810
Just stay at home and write a report.

233
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,480
Give me the key,

234
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,630
I'll drive today.

235
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,130
But you're the boss.

236
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,550
This is an order, okay?

237
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:19,970
Or you won't obey me?

238
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,069
Yes, sir.

239
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,690
Where are you going?

240
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,610
Come on. Don't be drippy!

241
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,040
Hey, that is Sky's car.

242
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,130
He said he wouldn't go out today.

243
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,120
What's going on?

244
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,450
Why you want to meddle with him?

245
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,920
Well, the more the better.

246
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,190
Why,

247
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,600
or you want to stay with me?

248
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,635
Do you want me to answer?

249
00:21:33,121 --> 00:21:34,270
Leave it out.

250
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,020
Let's follow him.

251
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,510
Hurry up!

252
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,770
It's not even just a lie.
He didn't answer me.

253
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,180
What a traitor!

254
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,470
Let's follow him, hurry.

255
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,690
He got to have private time, man.

256
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:09,815
What's wrong with you?

257
00:22:10,104 --> 00:22:12,050
Why you have to meddle with Sky?

258
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,884
Are you so lack of love?

259
00:22:15,884 --> 00:22:16,510
Hmm?

260
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,650
Hey,

261
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,870
why do you take this way?

262
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,430
Hey, Pitch.

263
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,800
Damn it.

264
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:31,760
We got lost.

265
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,020
I'm starving.

266
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,480
I haven't had food since morning.

267
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,781
You brought the food,

268
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:42,187
but I haven't eaten.

269
00:22:42,187 --> 00:22:43,760
I'm driving for you here,

270
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,440
all right?

271
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,770
Sorry.

272
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,730
It seems the you are Hangry.

273
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,420
Why don't you answer Bank?

274
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,870
I've told that it's your day.

275
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,230
I mean it,

276
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:14,280
therefore today you can't
disobey my order, understand?

277
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,797
You ought to do whatever I demand.

278
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:17,664
No excuses.

279
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,880
Yes, sir.

280
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,300
The store is closed, young master.

281
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,360
Should we go somewhere else?

282
00:24:03,664 --> 00:24:04,484
Lets go, boss.

283
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,490
It's closed for everyone else.

284
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,000
Let's get in.

285
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,360
What are you waiting for? Get in.

286
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,720
Have a seat.

287
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,530
Sit down.

288
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,920
What is this, young master?

289
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:38,330
I've told you that today's all yours.

290
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,010
I reserved the whole restaurant for you.

291
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:47,942
Why?

292
00:25:47,942 --> 00:25:49,360
Stop,

293
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,650
I'm very hungry, enjoy it.

294
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,850
Yes, sir.

295
00:25:58,730 --> 00:25:59,690
Just a minute,

296
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,890
I have a surprise for you.

297
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:40,860
Try this.

298
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,600
How does it taste?

299
00:26:52,138 --> 00:26:55,390
When we finished,
we'll do something fun.

300
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,482
(You always service me,)

301
00:26:59,482 --> 00:27:00,740
( so let me do it.)

302
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,370
I want this pink one.

303
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,090
- Pink?
- Uh-huh.

304
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,600
- Sun, let's go.
- Okay.

305
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,840
- Come on.

306
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,470
- Two cups.
- Thank you.

307
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,610
Thank you.

308
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,560
Try it, it's yummy.

309
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,140
Thank you.

310
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:25,550
- Where are we going next?
- Over there.

311
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,950
Turn around.

312
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,470
- Just a bit more.
- Sure.

313
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,580
Damn it,

314
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,700
it's so hard.

315
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:44,830
Your turn.

316
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,497
Me?

317
00:28:46,497 --> 00:28:47,310
Uh.

318
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,450
Hey!

319
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,690
You're so good, here's the reward.

320
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,190
Thank you.

321
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,554
Damn it, that was awesome.

322
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:23,690
How did you do it?

323
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,440
Have you are, young master.

324
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,100
Wear yours, too.

325
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:47,060
- Hmm?
- There are two trappers.

326
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,500
We'll wear them together.

327
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,330
Just do it.

328
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:07,440
Don't take it off.

329
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,050
If I didn't tell you to,
don't take it off.

330
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,100
Wear it.

331
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,850
Come on, let's go.

332
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,480
Don't take it off.

333
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:36,060
Sun, don't touch it, it's not ours.

334
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:43,860
- Do you like it?
- You're so cute. Can I take a photo?

335
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,720
Sure.

336
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,020
Look at the camera.

337
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,705
One, two, three.

338
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,970
- Squeeze yours.
- Sure.

339
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,860
- Ready?
- One, two...

340
00:30:59,676 --> 00:31:00,590
Thank you.

341
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,360
Look like it has dropped just now.

342
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,730
Sun.

343
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,520
That was so good.

344
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,520
Thank you,

345
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,140
it hasn't come to an end today.

346
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,680
There is one more song.

347
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,810

You have a beautiful voice,
young master.

397
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,976
Easy peasy,

398
00:35:49,976 --> 00:35:52,340
I haven't shown you my best yet.

399
00:35:55,121 --> 00:35:56,730
You are a little boastful, too.

400
00:35:57,861 --> 00:35:58,786
What?

401
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,890
Nothing, sir.

402
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:25,460
What is it, young master?

403
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,340
There's cotton candy on your mouth.

404
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:28,808
Where is it?

405
00:36:29,283 --> 00:36:30,030
Here?

406
00:36:31,445 --> 00:36:32,610
Right here.

407
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:34,590
This?

408
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,200
Wait for a moment.

409
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,340
Here.

410
00:37:08,531 --> 00:37:09,860
What is it, young master?

411
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,630
Exchange for a puppy that you gave me.

412
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,960
They are two magnets.

413
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,280
When they collide,

414
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:29,070
they make a heart.

415
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,700
We'll share each half.

416
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,910
Then can I have the other half?

417
00:37:49,398 --> 00:37:50,910
And you take mine.

418
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,588
Why?

419
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:54,300
They are the same.

420
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:55,790
Well...

421
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,970
This represents my mind,

422
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:09,310

432

How was today?

433
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,190
Were you having fun?

434
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,560
Yes, sir.

435
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,490
I've never gone out
and played like this.

436
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,970
Do you have anything
else you want to do?

437
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,600
Don't bother.

438
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,210
This is enough for me.

439
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,780
Just tell me.

440
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,890
Say it.

441
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,010
Do you want this?

442
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:33,610
Yes.

443
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,220
Ready?

444
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:44,830
Let's jump.

445
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,490
What's this?

446
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,030
You've asked for such a small favor.

447
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,800
Yes, Sir.

448
00:40:32,381 --> 00:40:34,930
I've never had a childhood
memory like other kids do.

449
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:37,810
No fun,

450
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,770
no traveling.

451
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:42,240
In the past,

452
00:40:43,699 --> 00:40:45,570
I've lived for others.

453
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:52,620
This is the first time that someone
has done things for me in my life.

454
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,650
Thank you very much, young master.

455
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,740
I had a lot of fun today.

456
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,180
Pardon me.

457
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:18,460
May I ask Mr.Sky

458
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,820
to frame out to advertise
for our restaurant?

459
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,690
Uh, okay.

460
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,760
Then, please follow me.

461
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,910
I will leave you these.

462
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,800
Hey,

463
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,880
wait for me here.

464
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,910
It's embarrassing if you're there.

465
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,480
But...

466
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:52,860
It's alright,

467
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,960
just a few minutes, I'll be back soon.

468
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,810
Please.

469
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,110
One, two, three.

470
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,420
So beautiful.

471
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,340
Good job.

472
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,360
One, two, three. Good.

473
00:42:20,624 --> 00:42:23,050
Adjust your shirt a bit.

474
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:25,400
Look at the camera. Smile.

475
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,800
One, two, three.

476
00:42:35,063 --> 00:42:36,150
What's happened?

477
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:09,970
We've met again,

478
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,650
Mr.Sky.

479
00:43:26,115 --> 00:43:28,440
I almost forgot to wear
the wristband this morning.

480
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,700
Luckily, or else you
couldn't sign in for work.

481
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,570
Yeah, what a strict rule they have.

482
00:43:34,265 --> 00:43:35,722
Then, please follow me.

483
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,590
Stay put!

484
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,040
Young master!

485
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:49,330
Sun.

486
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,240
Go.

487
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,390
Young master.

488
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:12,730
Young master.

489
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,400
Beat him.

490
00:44:15,017 --> 00:44:15,583
Get out of here!

491
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:19,390
Young master.

492
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:48,680
Young master.

493
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,100
Young master.

494
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:54,400
Let him go!

495
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:55,690
Okay.

496
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:57,880
I'll loosen him.

497
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:02,010
Young master.

498
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,770
Young master.

499
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:27,780
Look at him.

500
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:28,497
Young master.

501
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:44,730
Young master.

502
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:09,090
Young master.

503
00:46:12,497 --> 00:46:13,500
Young master.

504
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:17,850
Young master.

505
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,050
Young master.

506
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:32,700
Sun.

507
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:43,290
Sun.

508
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,240
Help, please! Somebody got hurt. Help!

509
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:04,340
Damn it!

510
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,690
Hey, they're having a fight.

511
00:47:10,531 --> 00:47:11,490
Sun.

512
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:32,720
Sun! Sun!

513
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:33,870
Sun!

514
00:47:34,138 --> 00:47:35,540
Sun! Wake up!

515
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:38,100
Sun, Sun, Sun!

516
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:41,180
Hey!

517
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:42,570
Sun!

518
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:51,120
Sun!

519
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:52,380
Sun!

520
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,610
Sun, wake up!

521
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,920
I order you to wake up now,
can you hear me?

522
00:47:57,970 --> 00:47:58,930
Sun!

523
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:03,230
Sun!

524
00:48:09,734 --> 00:48:11,140
Sun, wake up!

525
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:13,260
Wake up!

526
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,500
Sun, you have to be alright.

527
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:16,600
Sun!

528
00:48:45,699 --> 00:48:47,280
Help! Please!

529
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:49,630
Anyone, please!

530
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:52,590
Sun!

531
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,220
Wake up, Sun!

532
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,630
Sun, you can't die.

533
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:20,730
Sun!

534
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,280
I knew who Sky is at a glimpse.

535
00:50:25,398 --> 00:50:26,774
He's a son of mafia.

536
00:50:26,936 --> 00:50:31,470
My purpose of life is to protect you.

537
00:50:31,757 --> 00:50:34,120
I want you to live a happy life,
young master.

538
00:50:34,427 --> 00:50:35,690
During the outing,

539
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:39,210
I'll win that stone-face man
under the light of the stars.

540
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:41,687
