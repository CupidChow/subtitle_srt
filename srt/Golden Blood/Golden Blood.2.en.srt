00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:02,691
Father sent me here to look after you,
young master.

2
00:00:02,922 --> 00:00:03,912
A bodyguard?

3
00:00:04,039 --> 00:00:06,391
I've enrolled him
in the same faculty as you.

4
00:00:06,962 --> 00:00:10,324
It's the first day, but you already made
a move on girl, Sun.

5
00:00:13,378 --> 00:00:14,466
Sun!!

6
00:00:14,962 --> 00:00:16,434
Why did you guys suddenly run out?

7
00:00:17,013 --> 00:00:17,589
Nothing.

8
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:20,237
Go grab my wallet. I left it in my room.

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,638
Bye bye.

10
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:27,257
Did they bother you, Toktaeng?

11
00:00:27,477 --> 00:00:29,275
It's none of your business.

12
00:00:31,255 --> 00:00:32,990
Do you have any problem with my juniors?

13
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:38,399
Yeah?

14
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:39,445
Nothing, man.

15
00:00:39,524 --> 00:00:40,311
Let's go guys.

16
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,963
I thought we would get beaten up.

17
00:00:48,285 --> 00:00:49,710
How come are you here, Pitch?

18
00:00:52,015 --> 00:00:53,267
Well, my friends ditched me.

19
00:00:54,162 --> 00:00:58,898
They told me to save their seats,
but never showed up.

20
00:01:00,015 --> 00:01:00,411
Really?

21
00:01:00,952 --> 00:01:03,235
Are you two alright?

22
00:01:05,825 --> 00:01:06,584
We're good.

23
00:01:07,858 --> 00:01:08,972
Good thing then.

24
00:01:09,525 --> 00:01:13,568
May I sit with you?
So they won't come to bother you again.

25
00:01:20,901 --> 00:01:24,125
You should just calm down a bit.

26
00:01:25,045 --> 00:01:25,834
Me?

27
00:01:29,177 --> 00:01:29,753
Where is Sun?

28
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:32,679
He didn't want to come, sir.

29
00:01:33,945 --> 00:01:35,025
Did you just talk politely to me?

30
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,191
Come sit, man.

31
00:01:41,048 --> 00:01:42,221
Sky, come sit here.

32
00:01:44,746 --> 00:01:47,050
Who teaches you to stand over
your senior shoulder.

33
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:49,024
No one ever told you?

34
00:01:51,206 --> 00:01:53,991
Let's order to our heart content,
the bill's on Sky.

35
00:01:55,298 --> 00:01:56,091
Really, Sky?

36
00:01:57,863 --> 00:02:00,191
Cheers!

37
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,800
I can't think of anything.

38
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,240
Yey!

39
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:25,101
Excuse me for a bit.
I'll go to the bathroom.

40
00:02:26,037 --> 00:02:28,996
What a loser. Cheers.

41
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,180
Shall we go on?

42
00:02:31,973 --> 00:02:33,591
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

43
00:02:34,193 --> 00:02:36,820
Hey! I saw you did that on purpose.

44
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:39,791
Hey, my friend said he's sorry.
What do you want?

45
00:02:42,198 --> 00:02:42,724

- Get it together.

00:04:59,278 --> 00:05:00,957
Toktaeng and Juno,
can you get home by yourself?

91
00:05:03,528 --> 00:05:05,721
What about Sky and Sun?

92
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:09,019
Don't worry about them,
Sun can handle that.

93
00:05:10,084 --> 00:05:12,125
And Bank?

94
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:16,341
Don't worry, you should go home.

95
00:05:17,869 --> 00:05:19,658
I'll take care of this guy.

96
00:05:21,178 --> 00:05:23,027

Shut it.
You pull yourself together first.

101
00:05:48,072 --> 00:05:49,819
No. I'll go.

run into trouble like that.

Young master,
do you know how precious your blood is?

116
00:06:49,126 --> 00:06:52,525
Even if they wanted to pick a fight,
you shouldn't get involved.

117
00:06:57,018 --> 00:07:00,391
I helped you just now too.

118
00:07:08,923 --> 00:07:11,824

00:13:50,565 --> 00:13:51,741
I'm not Toktaeng.

181
00:13:51,741 --> 00:13:53,614
You're not? You're not Toktaeng.

182
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,280
Ho Ho Ho.

183
00:13:56,873 --> 00:13:58,773
You're not Toktaeng.

184
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,614
Damn it.

185
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:08,144
Take off your clothes,
you'll dirty up my sheet.

186
00:14:08,558 --> 00:14:12,624
Toktaeng baby baby cutie.

187
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,108
I'm not!

188
00:14:14,108 --> 00:14:16,825
You're cutie.

189
00:14:17,415 --> 00:14:19,825
Oh you want to take my shirt off!

190
00:14:20,075 --> 00:14:21,181
I'm not Toktaeng.

191
00:14:21,181 --> 00:14:22,747
I can't hold it in anymore.

192
00:14:22,915 --> 00:14:25,448
- I'm your dad!
- I can't

193
00:14:26,048 --> 00:14:27,950
Toktaeng.

194
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,014
Take your pants off.

195
00:14:31,381 --> 00:14:37,747
No no no.

196
00:14:37,748 --> 00:14:39,414
You're dirtying my sheet.

197
00:14:39,741 --> 00:14:45,641
I said no. I'll handle it myself.

198
00:14:46,908 --> 00:14:48,041
- Here.
- Wait!

199
00:14:49,275 --> 00:14:50,325
What the fuck are you doing?

200
00:14:50,325 --> 00:14:52,275
I'm gonna pee pee.

201
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:55,608
For christ's sake, this is a bedroom.

202
00:14:55,941 --> 00:14:58,941
Why can't I pee, it's loaded.

203
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:01,171
- Oh shit.
- I can't hold it.

204
00:15:01,171 --> 00:15:02,250
Come here.

205
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,847
Let go I'll go pee.

206
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:12,650
Done yet?

207
00:15:12,975 --> 00:15:14,308
Just a bit more.

208
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:26,845
Wait, stop it.

209
00:15:27,641 --> 00:15:29,025
I want to thank you.

210
00:15:29,025 --> 00:15:30,974
No need to, go wash your hand.

211
00:15:31,675 --> 00:15:33,050
Are you disgusted?

212
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,608
There.

213
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:46,297
This is nice.

214
00:15:48,311 --> 00:15:49,939
This is nice.

215
00:15:52,778 --> 00:15:53,702
Bank.

216
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,204
you can't sleep here, come inside.

217
00:15:59,911 --> 00:16:00,603
Hey.

218
00:16:07,645 --> 00:16:09,045

I'm fucking hungover.

238
00:18:54,408 --> 00:18:55,274
Here, young master.

239
00:18:58,408 --> 00:18:59,451
To freshen up.

240
00:19:06,675 --> 00:19:09,675
Have some hot soup, it'll help.

241
00:19:13,841 --> 00:19:15,707
This is a hangover pill.

242
00:20:04,355 --> 00:20:08,721
I see you play with that Rubik's cube
all the time. Is it fun?

243
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,914
Want to try?

244
00:20:19,995 --> 00:20:20,528
Here, sir.

245
00:20:45,741 --> 00:20:48,507
Why is it so hard?

246
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,481
You solve it.

247
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,671
Damn cool. How did you do it?

248
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:29,767
I played with it since I was a kid.

249
00:21:31,058 --> 00:21:34,679
The Rubik? For what?

250
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:39,074
I didn't have any friends.

251
00:21:40,351 --> 00:21:43,541
The rubik is my only company.

252
00:21:46,141 --> 00:21:47,574
Right now you have me.

253
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:53,741
Have breakfast with me. Come sit.

254
00:21:56,308 --> 00:21:57,141
Sit down.

255
00:22:18,387 --> 00:22:19,120
Is it good?

256
00:22:22,293 --> 00:22:22,666
Yeah.

257
00:22:25,341 --> 00:22:28,341
It has to be, you cooked that.

258
00:22:31,124 --> 00:22:31,928
What about you?

259
00:22:33,378 --> 00:22:35,175
So so.

260
00:22:52,478 --> 00:22:53,344
Where am I?

261
00:22:54,008 --> 00:22:55,974
Are you drunk to the ponit
of being Alzheimer's?

262
00:22:59,741 --> 00:23:03,741
Hey, Pitch why did you undress me?

263
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:08,711
Me? You ask your brain.

264
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:12,798
Take your pants off.

265
00:23:13,122 --> 00:23:15,874
No no no.

266
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,475
I'll handle it.

267
00:23:18,775 --> 00:23:19,775
- Sure.
- Hey.

268
00:23:20,811 --> 00:23:23,041
Oh, it was me.

269
00:23:24,675 --> 00:23:28,008
So why did you take me here?
I have my own house.

270
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:32,641
If I knew that would I bring you here?

271
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:35,886
Use your brain.

272
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,518
Are you not going to thank me?

273
00:23:47,491 --> 00:23:48,174
Thank you.

274
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,641
And apologized for what I did.

275
00:23:52,989 --> 00:23:54,255
You sure can speak properly.

276
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:59,645
Here, go to take a shower.

277
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,930
Are you really? Haiz.

278
00:24:16,741 --> 00:24:19,441
Thank you, Mr. er...

279
00:24:19,975 --> 00:24:22,527
I'm Panthep.
My pleasure is to help you.

280
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:23,275
(Panthep Rawinit)

281
00:24:23,275 --> 00:24:26,175
Oh right, I have some treats for you.

282
00:24:26,975 --> 00:24:27,559
Thank you.

283
00:24:31,047 --> 00:24:32,389
Here you go.

284
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:33,231
Thank you, sir.

285
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:37,730
Enjoy the treats.

286
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,430
Thank you.

287
00:24:51,608 --> 00:24:52,541
Here, young master.

288
00:24:53,908 --> 00:24:56,541
- You all can eat these.
- Thanks.

289
00:24:57,472 --> 00:25:02,117
I didn't expect Sun to be that strong.
You was so cool yesterday.

290
00:25:03,145 --> 00:25:05,611
Not at all, I was just protecting myself.

291
00:25:06,775 --> 00:25:12,108
You humble, last night it was like
an action movie, right Toktaeng?

292
00:25:12,475 --> 00:25:14,931
Yeah, Juno is right.

293
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,988
How is your hand, Sky?

294
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:22,574
This? Just a tiny wound
from a broken glass.

295
00:25:27,207 --> 00:25:31,239
Why you keep following me?
What do you care?

296
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:34,174
Jack ass, if I'm not looking
you might puke on someone.

297
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:36,507
Eh? Why are they together?

298
00:25:36,508 --> 00:25:38,225
Why you following me around?

299
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,102
Bank.

300
00:25:40,989 --> 00:25:41,433
Hey.

301
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:43,730
Hey.

302
00:25:46,141 --> 00:25:48,976
- Stop following me.
- I follow my clothes.

303
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,262
Just go shoo!

304
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:54,284
Sky, you are fucking loud, you ass.

305
00:25:54,941 --> 00:25:58,902
I still got a hangover

306
00:25:59,341 --> 00:26:02,607
Man, I didn't think you'd be this sick.

307
00:26:04,508 --> 00:26:06,974
For real? You're not hungover?

308
00:26:07,408 --> 00:26:11,640
Sure thing. I'm a heavyweight.

309
00:26:11,908 --> 00:26:13,974
Oh yeah?

310
00:26:14,408 --> 00:26:18,074
Not as wasted as you, Bank.
He walked like a dog.

311
00:26:21,053 --> 00:26:25,145
Pitch, I'm begging you.
please stop talking about it.

312
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:29,226
Oh yeah, I have a long story to tell.

313
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:33,008
You were so drunk
and didn't tell me where you live.

314
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:36,508
So I had to take you with me.
There you're wearing my clothes.

315
00:26:36,808 --> 00:26:41,908
Which is such a good taste.
He sure is hungover and sleepover too.

316
00:26:43,675 --> 00:26:47,065
Stop it. They would tease me
till my son become a monk.

317
00:26:49,489 --> 00:26:50,345
Don't be shy.

318
00:26:50,891 --> 00:26:55,691
Good thing is he took care of
you otherwise you'd be on street.

319
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,073
Did you girls get back home alright?

320
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:03,808
We're good. Thanks for asking.

321
00:27:05,913 --> 00:27:09,676
Next time if you go out
you should call me, just in case.

322
00:27:12,641 --> 00:27:18,307
What classes do you have today?
If you have any problems just ask.

323
00:27:19,572 --> 00:27:21,854
It's all right.
I don't want to bother you.

324
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:25,641
Not at all, we are friends.

325
00:27:28,108 --> 00:27:31,892
Just one drink and
you are acting like we're close.

326
00:27:33,516 --> 00:27:35,075
What a cheap trick.

327
00:27:36,008 --> 00:27:37,649
You envy me?

328
00:27:38,668 --> 00:27:40,474
No, I'm not.

329
00:27:41,808 --> 00:27:43,310
At least I wasn't drunk like a dog.

330
00:27:43,805 --> 00:27:44,957
Go on, go.

331
00:27:45,475 --> 00:27:46,659
We should get to class.

332
00:27:47,581 --> 00:27:51,677
- Later, man.
- See you.

333
00:27:57,908 --> 00:28:00,460
Are you not hungover for real?

334
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:01,680
No.

335
00:28:08,175 --> 00:28:10,479
- You mean not drunk?
- Not being nosy.

336
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:46,198
Wow so cool.

337
00:28:49,116 --> 00:28:55,710
Looking good, perfect, classy.

338
00:29:00,658 --> 00:29:01,858
Really?

339
00:29:05,455 --> 00:29:06,494
Let me see.

340
00:29:07,054 --> 00:29:09,355
You're not joking?

341
00:29:17,821 --> 00:29:19,736
Woah.

342
00:29:25,321 --> 00:29:31,021
Is this cool? Your act looks good,
but your work is shit.

343
00:29:31,662 --> 00:29:33,954
Bank, be nice. Don't bully him.

344
00:29:36,788 --> 00:29:39,821
Er I...

345
00:29:41,455 --> 00:29:43,839
You guys don't understand art.

346
00:29:45,888 --> 00:29:48,864
Don't worry. I'll help you.

347
00:29:50,576 --> 00:29:51,928
You ruined my imagination.

348
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:54,503
I'm disappointed, Sun.

349
00:29:55,588 --> 00:29:57,880
Where are you going, Sky?

350
00:29:58,102 --> 00:29:59,521
I'm going to clean my brushes.

351
00:30:10,251 --> 00:30:13,584
Wait, Sun, are you going too?
we haven't finished.

352
00:30:21,305 --> 00:30:22,171
Wait, Sun.

353
00:30:24,629 --> 00:30:26,297
Do you dislike me that much?

354
00:30:30,521 --> 00:30:31,387
Erm...

355
00:30:31,388 --> 00:30:35,754
Sun, why do you have to stick
with Sky all the time?

356
00:30:36,621 --> 00:30:40,087
He's just going to restroom, not warzone.

357
00:31:19,355 --> 00:31:21,588
Excuse me.

358
00:31:22,888 --> 00:31:24,021
Are you Mr.Wayha?

359
00:31:27,255 --> 00:31:28,588
How do you know my real name?

360
00:32:05,835 --> 00:32:07,732
Here take whatever you want.

361
00:32:08,355 --> 00:32:09,755
I don't want any.

362
00:32:11,588 --> 00:32:12,888
I want you dead.

363
00:32:28,107 --> 00:32:30,115
Why is Sky gone for so long?

364
00:32:31,655 --> 00:32:34,588
Yeah, did he go to Mars?

365
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,183
I'm Panthep. My pleasure to help you.

366
00:32:41,183 --> 00:32:42,962
(Panthep Rawinit)

367
00:32:46,188 --> 00:32:48,554
(Panthep Rawinit)

368
00:32:59,111 --> 00:32:59,654
Young master.

369
00:33:07,321 --> 00:33:08,287
Go! Young master.

370
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:11,721
Young master.

371
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:14,411
Sun!

372
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:19,265
Young master.

373
00:33:23,872 --> 00:33:24,588
Young master.

374
00:33:28,436 --> 00:33:29,753
Not so bad.

375
00:33:40,955 --> 00:33:41,455
Sun!

376
00:34:08,557 --> 00:34:11,223
Help! Please help!

377
00:34:12,488 --> 00:34:13,768
Let the guards take care of the rest.

378
00:34:14,129 --> 00:34:14,948
But...

379
00:34:14,948 --> 00:34:16,395
No but.

380
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,146
Sun.

381
00:34:19,488 --> 00:34:20,702
Young master.

382
00:34:20,702 --> 00:34:23,499
Let's get to the infirmary first.

383
00:34:25,221 --> 00:34:26,287
Hurry up.

384
00:34:29,921 --> 00:34:33,087
That's the one, follow him!

385
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,330
(First Aid Room)

386
00:34:42,255 --> 00:34:46,121
We're sorry, Sky.
We came too late.

387
00:34:46,769 --> 00:34:51,629
Never mind.
How did you guys know?

388
00:34:52,068 --> 00:34:56,168
Because Sun was running out
all of a sudden.

389
00:34:56,168 --> 00:35:00,877
When we arrived we heard the fight,
so Bank called the guards.

390
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:08,834
Do you have an enemy?
He came to hurt you.

391
00:35:15,601 --> 00:35:18,401
I pray that Sun will be alright.

392
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,399
Will his wound have to be stitched?

393
00:35:22,337 --> 00:35:22,901
Yeah.

394
00:35:23,368 --> 00:35:25,034
Bank hasn't come back.

395
00:35:28,568 --> 00:35:29,501
Is Sun okay?

396
00:35:30,168 --> 00:35:32,368
How is it, did you catch him?

397
00:35:32,835 --> 00:35:35,568
No, he was very fast.

398
00:35:36,101 --> 00:35:39,128
The guards gave up halfway.

399
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:42,852
I ran after him but only saw the uniform.

400
00:35:43,968 --> 00:35:45,870
He might have stolen it.

401
00:35:46,075 --> 00:35:47,175
Right.

402
00:35:54,268 --> 00:35:57,904
The wound is all clean.
Good thing it wasn't a very deep cut.

403
00:35:58,058 --> 00:36:00,548
Check and clean the wound often,
he'll get well soon.

404
00:36:00,968 --> 00:36:02,801
Thank you very much.

405
00:36:06,668 --> 00:36:10,634
You guys wait here,
I have something to discuss with Sun.

406
00:36:31,091 --> 00:36:32,758
The nurse said you're fine.

407
00:36:35,337 --> 00:36:35,870
Yep.

408
00:36:37,301 --> 00:36:38,334
Just a small cut.

409
00:36:44,768 --> 00:36:45,595
Wait.

410
00:36:50,301 --> 00:36:51,635
Tell me honestly,

411
00:36:54,284 --> 00:36:55,835
someone wants me dead right?

412
00:37:06,451 --> 00:37:09,784
You've been knowing about this?
So as Sun?

413
00:37:10,378 --> 00:37:14,411
Don't worry too much,
you just have to be more careful.

414
00:37:15,063 --> 00:37:19,341
But dad, you have to tell me
why he wanted to kill me and who is he?

415
00:37:19,846 --> 00:37:23,579
I said nothing to be worry.
I can handle it. Talk later.

416
00:37:25,235 --> 00:37:25,786
Dad...

417
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:27,676
Dad...

418
00:37:30,773 --> 00:37:32,739
So no one's really going
to tell me the truth.

419
00:37:36,968 --> 00:37:37,705
Sun...

420
00:37:39,421 --> 00:37:40,231
Sun...

421
00:38:08,158 --> 00:38:10,958
I apologized, boss.
I was too careless.

422
00:38:11,668 --> 00:38:13,735
I didn't know his guard was something.

423
00:38:14,801 --> 00:38:16,234
I don't want anymore mistakes.

424
00:38:17,168 --> 00:38:20,460
No, sir. You can wait for the good news.

425
00:38:21,181 --> 00:38:23,081
I won't make any mistakes again.

426
00:38:26,067 --> 00:38:28,901
Good. Don't make me wait for long.

427
00:38:30,181 --> 00:38:31,168
I have works to do,

428
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:34,723
and no one can get in my way.

429
00:38:35,768 --> 00:38:36,234
Yes, sir.

430
00:38:42,095 --> 00:38:42,786
Sun.

431
00:38:44,435 --> 00:38:47,468
What the heck he forgot to fix my dinner.

432
00:38:50,214 --> 00:38:50,934
Sun.

433
00:38:51,501 --> 00:38:52,167
Sun.

434
00:38:55,052 --> 00:38:56,167
Sun, what are you doing?

435
00:39:01,801 --> 00:39:02,467
Sun.

436
00:39:06,735 --> 00:39:08,001
Sun, do you hear me?

437
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,220
Sun.

438
00:39:37,871 --> 00:39:38,437
Sun.

439
00:39:41,492 --> 00:39:42,058
Sun.

440
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:49,451
Hey, your temperature is very high.

441
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,334
I'm sorry.
I was asleep for too long.

442
00:39:58,343 --> 00:40:00,460
I'll fix dinner for you.

443
00:40:06,878 --> 00:40:08,118
Are you alright?

444
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:13,494
Don't worry.
They are just bruises.

445
00:40:14,481 --> 00:40:16,006
I already applied some ointment.

446
00:40:17,136 --> 00:40:19,298
I'll cook dinner shortly.

447
00:40:23,181 --> 00:40:24,034
It's fine.

448
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:29,490
For dinner, I'll take care of that.

449
00:40:44,135 --> 00:40:44,893
But...

450
00:40:54,514 --> 00:40:55,538
This is an order.

451
00:41:02,368 --> 00:41:05,913
You have sweat all over.
I'll wipe you down.

Young master.

473
00:42:39,484 --> 00:42:42,194
Why? Are you going to disobey?

474
00:42:45,901 --> 00:42:47,136
Yep!

475
00:42:51,706 --> 00:42:54,558
Are you shy?

476
00:43:01,587 --> 00:43:02,062
Yeah.

477
00:43:05,189 --> 00:43:09,547
Good, but I'm not shy. I'll carry on.

478
00:43:18,255 --> 00:43:19,352
Stay still.

479
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:27,473
Okay.

480
00:43:53,393 --> 00:43:55,901
I told you to stay in bed,
why don't you sleep.

481
00:43:57,003 --> 00:43:57,952
I can't sleep.

482
00:44:01,001 --> 00:44:03,015
What are you doing, young master?

483
00:44:03,913 --> 00:44:04,879
Fried rice.

484
00:44:06,801 --> 00:44:11,767
I think it's the easiest thing,
or instant noodle.

485
00:44:16,589 --> 00:44:17,381
Instant noodles is fine.

486
00:44:20,622 --> 00:44:21,707
Are you looking down on me?

487
00:44:23,196 --> 00:44:25,529
You think I can't cook fried rice?

488
00:44:26,285 --> 00:44:28,185
No, sir.

489
00:44:32,751 --> 00:44:33,706
Young master.

490
00:44:35,051 --> 00:44:39,551
You have to cut both edges
so it's easier to peel.

491
00:44:52,251 --> 00:44:53,600
One more thing,

492
00:45:03,151 --> 00:45:06,117
use this one, so you don't get cut.

493
00:45:08,108 --> 00:45:09,315
Why don't you say it from the beginning?

494
00:45:17,885 --> 00:45:20,451
Just let me cook, please.

495
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:23,918
No way. I can do it.

496
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:26,808
Ouch.

497
00:45:29,174 --> 00:45:31,251
See. Show off.

498
00:46:00,218 --> 00:46:05,484
If we have some onions or parsley.

499
00:46:05,485 --> 00:46:07,918
It might look better.

500
00:46:08,666 --> 00:46:12,468
Young master doesn't eat them
so I didn't buy any.

501
00:46:13,151 --> 00:46:16,951
Wow, is there anything
you don't know about me?

502
00:46:24,118 --> 00:46:25,545
Should we order a delivery?

503
00:46:27,287 --> 00:46:34,630
You can order anything you like,
but I'm going to eat this fried rice.

504
00:47:21,236 --> 00:47:24,802
I think it's because of the surrounding
that makes it tastes bad.

505
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:39,763
Now, better.

506
00:48:05,085 --> 00:48:05,513
Here.

507
00:48:08,951 --> 00:48:11,717
Why? Do you mind my spoon?

508
00:48:15,118 --> 00:48:15,707
Nope.

509
00:48:32,143 --> 00:48:33,951
Eat a lot. Good job.

510
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:36,879
Then take the pills and have some rest.

511
00:48:39,842 --> 00:48:42,342
Young master, you have some too.

512
00:48:44,222 --> 00:48:48,255
Don't mind me. I'm full.

513
00:48:48,555 --> 00:48:51,232
I ate a lot while I am tasting it.

514
00:49:35,779 --> 00:49:37,545
Come on,
I'll rub on the ointment for you.

515
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:45,818
Thank you, young master.
But I already rubbed it on.

516
00:49:47,161 --> 00:49:50,812
Can you rub it around your back?
No, right?

517
00:50:09,592 --> 00:50:10,369
Take off your top.

518
00:50:14,179 --> 00:50:14,622
Okay.

519
00:50:58,351 --> 00:50:59,010
Is it hurt?

520
00:51:03,961 --> 00:51:04,452
No, sir.

521
00:51:30,717 --> 00:51:31,850
Just admitted it if it's hurt.

522
00:51:32,785 --> 00:51:34,868
You don't have to be
an iron man all the time.

523
00:51:35,485 --> 00:51:36,685
Stop showing off.

524
00:51:41,618 --> 00:51:42,060
Yes, sir.

525
00:52:05,046 --> 00:52:07,478
I want you to donate your blood
every three months.

526
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:10,115
Your blood is to be kept
exclusively for Sky.

527
00:52:14,585 --> 00:52:19,651
This one represents my heart
and this represents yours.

528
00:52:22,163 --> 00:52:25,196
I have to learn martial arts, because
somebody is trying to kill me right?
