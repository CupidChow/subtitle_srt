1
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,233
I said no is no.

2
00:00:36,866 --> 00:00:38,966
There'll be no drugs in my territory.

3
00:00:39,766 --> 00:00:44,166
Whatever you do is your business.
But I don't want any of these in my area.

4
00:00:47,866 --> 00:00:50,832
Okay. Chill, I’m just asking.

5
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:54,366
I thought it’s a win-win for both of us.

6
00:00:54,766 --> 00:00:57,732
I could expand my business and you get the profits.

7
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:59,599
But if you don’t want it. Fine.

8
00:01:09,766 --> 00:01:11,166
You sure you won't change your mind later?

9
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:19,532
I have my word. You know me well.

10
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,666
Don’t ever bring those evil drugs in my area!

11
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:35,933
Hey, Stop!

12
00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:51,432
Huh. You really want to do this.

13
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,866
A guy like Sakkhee won’t back off this easily.

14
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,500
Boss, you have to be careful.

15
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:23,466
Let him come. I’m always ready.

16
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:26,033
I'm only concerned about one thing.

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,033
Yes, Father?

18
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,333
You want me to be a bodyguard?

19
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:08,632
Argh. Why ringing that damn bell so many times.
Don’t you have it at your house?

20
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,299
Excuse me

21
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:24,132
Who the hell are you?

22
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:30,099
Father sends me here to look after you,
young master.

23
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,800
So I have to live here with you.

24
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,433
Are you out of your mind?

25
00:03:35,866 --> 00:03:38,499
Hey, what the fuck are you doing? Let go!

26
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:42,433
Wait, What are you trying to do? Stop!

27
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,900
Ouch ouch

I apologize.

39
00:04:57,433 --> 00:04:59,933
Hey, wait, you wait. Hey,
this is my house!

40
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,833
A bodyguard? Dad,
I am a grown-up not a kid anymore.

41
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:09,366
Sky, it's not that big of a deal.

42
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:13,499
Hey hey, you, that one is pricey.
Hold it tight.

43
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,066
I made an effort to choose the one
who is nearly your age.

44
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:20,099
When you go on campus no one would notice.

45
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,600
What? You want him to go to school with me?

46
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:29,766
Really? Dad, my friends are going to make fun of me
being a daddy’s boy. I'll pass.

47
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:33,099
Tell other that he's a relative or something.

48
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,933
I enrolled him in the same faculty as you,
there's nothing to worry about.

49
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,600
But I don't like this.
You have to bring your underling back.

50
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:45,166
You have to keep him.

51
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:48,066
Listen to me, Sky.

52
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,799
I permitted you to study there.

53
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,900
But you can only go there under my conditions.
As a compromise.

54
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,333
But I don’t want anyone to keep an eye on me.

55
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:03,099
Sky, You must live with him.

56
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,433
Non-negotiable. Understand?

57
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:12,366
Hey, what? Really?

58
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,133
Hey, this is my house.
What are you doing?

59
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,900
I am doing a security check for you,
young master.

60
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,900
But it's annoying.

61
00:06:35,866 --> 00:06:39,832
It is my duty and my responsibility.
Please understand that.

62
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:44,399
It is my duty and my responsibility
Please understand, huh.

63
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,200
Alright, do whatever you want.

64
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,000
A bodyguard? Urgh,
you are just a guard dog.

65
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,300
Just walking being a smart-ass in someone else's house
makes you look cool? Damn it.

66
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,933
If you want to stay here.
Fine. I will go somewhere else.

67
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:14,866
Fuck, did I forget my key?

68
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,433
Hey, STOP!!

69
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:30,366
Ouch

70
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:53,733
Sun, This is Bank.
My buddy.

71
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:57,499
Bank, This is Sun.
My cousin.

72
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,766
He got accepted to the same university as us.

73
00:07:59,766 --> 00:08:03,799
Wait. Why have you never told me
that you have a relative?

74
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,900
Ahh well..

75
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,400
He's a distant relative of mine.

76
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,266
So when my dad knew that we’re going to the same university
he sent him here.

77
00:08:14,266 --> 00:08:15,499
Right, Sun.

78
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:18,399
Yes

79
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,100
Then why did he have to take me down like that?

80
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,566
He might have thought that you were going to attack me.

81
00:08:31,866 --> 00:08:35,466
Sun has just left the monkhood.
So he is kinda naive.

82
00:08:35,466 --> 00:08:38,299
and wasn't realized that just a joke,
so he misunderstood.

83
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,133
Where did he be ordained?
Kang-fu Temple or what?

84
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:44,233
Shit. He was so strong.

85
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,132
So why are you here?

86
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:51,799
I was going to invite you to lunch, Sky.

87
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,033
Mr. Bank,
Mr. Bank, how did you get into this housing estate?

88
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:58,833
Do you have a keycard?

89
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:02,199
Just call me Bank.

90
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,066
Sky gave me a copied keycard.
So I can come anytime.

91
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:09,766
I think you..

92
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:13,299
I am full. Anyway, thanks for coming today.

93
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,433
See you tomorrow.
I will walk you out.

94
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:18,066
Yeah yeah.

95
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,200
Don't you think I'm not going to fight back?

96
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,400
Have you realized
that you almost hurt my friend?

97
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:06,266
I apologized.
I thought that guy was going to hurt you.

98
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:15,200
Listen to me. A housing estate with this level
is not that easy to  enter.

99
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,933
If my dad didn’t give you the keycard,

100
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:21,766
you wouldn’t be able to pass the security guard.

101
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:26,666
Not at all.
For me, it’s not that hard to pass by.

102
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,100
Whatever, oh, and one more thing.

103
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:40,400
When we are not alone,
don’t call me “young master”. Understand?

104
00:10:41,366 --> 00:10:46,332
Then how should I address you?
You are father’s son.

105
00:10:47,066 --> 00:10:53,132
Father?
You called my dad “Father”?

106
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:56,733
Yes, sir. He wants me to call him like that.

107
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,733
Damn it. I suddenly have a brother.

108
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,799
Anyway, since I couldn’t get rid of you.

109
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,800
Just simply “you”, not “young master”.

110
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,966
I don’t want anyone to know that my dad sent me a sitter

111
00:11:21,966 --> 00:11:26,732
and know that I’m a mafia’s son.

112
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,866
But being a mafia has nothing to be ashamed of.

113
00:11:30,866 --> 00:11:35,466
Father is influential, but he doesn't run any illegal businesses.

114
00:11:35,466 --> 00:11:39,099
But I dislike it.

115
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,066
Yes, sir.

116
00:11:45,766 --> 00:11:48,466
May I stay in the room on the mezzanine?

117
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:50,666
Please excuse me. I’m going to unpack.

118
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:02,266
He did whatever he wants, go wherever he likes.
Is this really my house?

119
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:08,299
Damn it, who brought this rascal into my life.

120
00:12:55,033 --> 00:12:56,266
Hey, this is not funny.

121
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,000
Come on, man.

122
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:02,233
What the hell on earth?

123
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,700
Young master!

124
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,800
Who is that?

125
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:07,699
Sun?

126
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,533
Yes, is everything alright, young master?

127
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:12,666
The water is not running, can't you see?

128
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,899
Ouch, my eyes hurt.

129
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:16,799
Let's get out of here.

130
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,966
Wait wait wait, do you see anything?

131
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,333
Nothing

132
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,166
Why can't you see? I'm naked.

133
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,433
It's covered with bubble.

134
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,566
Bubble?
Did you just say I'm tiny? Huh?

135
00:13:32,566 --> 00:13:34,966
You want to get into trouble? Sun.

136
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:38,966
Not tiny.

137
00:13:38,966 --> 00:13:44,499
Yeah right. Wait, so you saw it.
Did you lie to me, Sun?

138
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,933
I think we should go outside.

139
00:14:35,433 --> 00:14:36,699
All done.

140
00:14:38,966 --> 00:14:43,832
Just now I locked the door. How did you get in?

141
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,533
Just picked a lock. It's very simple.

142
00:14:56,866 --> 00:14:58,266
Wait, Sun.

143
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,266
Just now you didn't see my thing right?

144
00:15:11,466 --> 00:15:13,099
Young master, try closing your eyes.

145
00:15:15,033 --> 00:15:16,233
Close your eyes

146
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:22,232
Do you see anything?

147
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,133
No

148
00:15:24,766 --> 00:15:26,032
Absolutely

149
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,333
What the?

150
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:40,499
Good thing he didn't see it.

151
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:04,766
Don't ever do that again.

152
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,133
Even though you wanted to help,
but at least knocked first.

153
00:16:11,933 --> 00:16:13,233
I was naked.

154
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:20,966
I've prepared your clothes for tomorrow.

155
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,166
I'm going to put them in your room.

156
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:31,199
Nevermind. I can do it myself.
I'm not a little kid.

157
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,066
Young master,

158
00:16:44,233 --> 00:16:47,899
Tomorrow is your first day.
Don't forget to pack your bag.

159
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:54,199
Is he going to be a bodyguard or a dad?

160
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:10,666
Serious, straight face,
not friendly, unsociable

161
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:17,432
Sun is just like that,
but he can do everything.

162
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:20,266
So I entrust him with you.

163
00:17:20,266 --> 00:17:24,132
Dad, it's like having another dad.

164
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:27,333
That guy is even stricter than you.

165
00:17:27,866 --> 00:17:30,566
That's good. It gives me peace of mind.

166
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:33,566
Anyway, son, you find anything strange lately?

167
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:37,999
Find What? The weirdest thing is the bodyguard
that you sent me.

168
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:41,599
or you mean something else?

169
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,966
Nothing, everything's all good. Call you later.

170
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,733
Anything abnormal happened, boss?

171
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,233
Sakkhee is untrustworthy.

172
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:07,033
Order our guys to keep an eye on their moves.

173
00:18:07,033 --> 00:18:08,299
Yes, sir.

174
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:36,232
Great!

175
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:42,299
Now we know where his beloved son lives.

176
00:18:44,966 --> 00:18:47,799
What's your next move, boss?

177
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:57,266
I want to give him a lesson.

178
00:18:57,266 --> 00:19:02,632
What he will get if he did not cooperate.

179
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:08,032
Please be careful, young master.

180
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,800
How did he do that?

181
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,200
Thank you, bro

182
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,366
My pleasure

183
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,633
We come here to study not to battle.

184
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:27,999
You don't have to be this serious.

185
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,600
I must be.

186
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,933
Whatever you like. Let's go

187
00:22:56,366 --> 00:22:57,299
I'm sorry.

188
00:22:58,433 --> 00:22:59,599
It's okay.

189
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:02,299
Sun, why you did that. so reckless

190
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,400
Let me help you.

191
00:23:08,733 --> 00:23:09,766
Here you go

192
00:23:15,066 --> 00:23:17,032
What's your name?

193
00:23:33,466 --> 00:23:36,732
Woah, your combat pose is so scary.

194
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,200
Bank, what the heck are you doing?
That freaked me out

195
00:23:45,766 --> 00:23:50,599
I saw you were alone,
so I dragged you here.

196
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,300
So it means you just escaped from Sun?

197
00:23:57,066 --> 00:23:58,499
Something like that.

198
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:03,599
You know, it's so frustrating.

199
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,066
I get how you feel.
Your cousin is kinda scary.

200
00:24:09,066 --> 00:24:11,766
Are we going to the classroom now?

201
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,466
What a sunny day.

202
00:24:57,366 --> 00:24:58,966
Pardon me?

203
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:03,666
Are you looking for class?
I can take you there.

204
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:07,866
I'm fine, but thanks.

205
00:25:09,366 --> 00:25:12,199
Come on, let's go together

206
00:25:14,233 --> 00:25:17,166
Don't be shy. I'll carry that.

207
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:18,799
Nevermind

208
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,500
I think she's not shy,

209
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:37,166
but more like disgusted.

210
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:39,199
None of your business

211
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,666
Try me.

212
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,566
See you later

213
00:26:03,933 --> 00:26:05,033
Thank you

214
00:26:05,033 --> 00:26:07,233
No problem

215
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:09,433
I'm Toktaeng.

216
00:26:09,433 --> 00:26:12,533
Toktaeng? What a cool name you have.

217
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:18,366
My parents are interior designers
that's how I got my name.

218
00:26:18,366 --> 00:26:25,732
Well, do you know where is room 413?

219
00:26:25,733 --> 00:26:30,466
Room 413? We're going there too.
Want to come with us?

220
00:26:30,466 --> 00:26:34,899
Really? Sure.

221
00:26:37,066 --> 00:26:40,966
Mr.Bank, does your dad work in a bank?

222
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:44,899
Yeah Sun, how do you know?

223
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,033
Sun?

224
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,333
Why do you want to study Fine Arts?

225
00:26:50,533 --> 00:26:52,766
I like to draw since I was a kid.

226
00:26:52,766 --> 00:26:57,432
Really? I like it since birth.

227
00:26:57,433 --> 00:26:58,799
Like to draw?

228
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,433
Like you, TokTaeng

229
00:27:01,433 --> 00:27:04,499
Urgh, so lame, Bank.

230
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,333
Man, just kidding

231
00:27:08,633 --> 00:27:10,833
-Juno
-TokTaeng

232
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,500
Oops!

233
00:27:30,966 --> 00:27:32,399
Are you okay?

234
00:27:33,866 --> 00:27:37,399
-Did I almost fall and embarrass myself?
-Yep

235
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:43,366
-Thank you
-Sure

236
00:27:44,133 --> 00:27:45,999
Toktaeng's friend?

237
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,833
I'm Sky. This guy's Bank and that one's Sun.

238
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,733
Hey, you can sit here.

239
00:28:02,133 --> 00:28:03,533
Thanks

240
00:28:10,366 --> 00:28:14,966
Just the first day and you already made a move on a girl.

241
00:28:50,533 --> 00:28:52,033
What a hot guy.

242
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:56,566
What do you mean, young master?

243
00:28:56,566 --> 00:29:02,132
Don't be sneaky, Juno has eyes on you.
Don't you think I can see that?

244
00:29:02,133 --> 00:29:05,399
If she could stick with you she would already do.

245
00:29:11,766 --> 00:29:16,099
I'm not interested. What's on my mind,

246
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,633
is only your safety, young master.

247
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:36,300
You're very determined with your job.
I'll tell my dad for you.

248
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,300
to give you a big bonus.

249
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,266
What were you talking about?

250
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:54,032
Nothing, I was thinking about what to have for lunch.

251
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,133
Hurry, those girls are waiting.

252
00:29:57,133 --> 00:29:59,699
Wait for me

253
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,999
Wait.

254
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:07,933
Wait guy.

255
00:30:12,966 --> 00:30:16,166
Just now, did you see how Sun helped me?

256
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:20,099
Yeah, he's as fast as a spy in the movie.

257
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:25,233
Yeah right, he's so cool,
I'm going after him.

258
00:30:25,233 --> 00:30:30,333
Sure, I can see how you like him from Saturn.

259
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:33,333
How irony

260
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,533
Just as same as the eyes you have for Sky, girl!

261
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:44,766
All good, we like different guys, no drama

262
00:30:46,633 --> 00:30:49,466
Pitty Bank. He's an odd.

263
00:30:49,466 --> 00:30:51,966
Yeah, right.

264
00:30:51,966 --> 00:30:55,532
Who's an odd? I can be a pair.

265
00:31:03,766 --> 00:31:09,066
I'm Pitch. A junior.
We haven't introduced ourselves.

266
00:31:09,066 --> 00:31:12,532
This time I won't miss.

267
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:15,799
Sorry, but I don't care.

268
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,966
Excuse us, we have to go.

269
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:24,700
Wait girls, we want to know about you.

270
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:28,600
Aren't you going to tell us at least your name?

271
00:31:33,966 --> 00:31:38,332
No answer? Then I'll call you

272
00:31:40,033 --> 00:31:40,999
Babe.

273
00:31:43,133 --> 00:31:49,066
Toktaeng, Juno, are you guys coming?
Professor's waiting

274
00:31:52,666 --> 00:31:55,999
Yeah, the professor wants to see us, let's go.

275
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,666
Excuse us.

276
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,832
Go go

277
00:32:02,566 --> 00:32:05,399
Hurry

278
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:19,099
This is a second time.

279
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:25,432
That was close.
Thanks again for saving us.

280
00:32:25,933 --> 00:32:29,499
No problems.
You guys shouldn't be alone just the two of you.

281
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,866
We should stick together, it's safer.

282
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:35,132
If anything happens, you can call us.

283
00:32:35,833 --> 00:32:39,733
Should we exchange contacts and line ID?

284
00:32:39,733 --> 00:32:42,933
-Since we are in the same faculty.
-Sure

285
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,766
Here's my number, you can call me 24/7.

286
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,166
and you can add my line ID.

287
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:08,099
Give your number to her.

288
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,133
Can I have Sky's number?

289
00:33:23,533 --> 00:33:26,766
Then can I have Toktaeng's too?

290
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,566
Thanks

291
00:33:58,433 --> 00:34:01,999
Hey, this noon

292
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,166
You didn't meet the professor, right?

293
00:34:08,533 --> 00:34:09,866
Hey!

294
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,633
A senior is talking to you.
Why don't you say anything?

295
00:34:19,033 --> 00:34:23,066
I'm sorry, but my words

296
00:34:23,966 --> 00:34:26,799
worth more than talking with someone like you.

297
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,066
Ouch

298
00:34:40,266 --> 00:34:42,799
Ouch, that's hurt.

299
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,433
Enough, Sun

300
00:34:45,866 --> 00:34:48,532
-But he was going to attack you, young master
-I know

301
00:34:51,866 --> 00:34:55,599
I said enough is enough. If he gets injured,
what are you going to do?

302
00:34:56,933 --> 00:34:57,766
Ouch

303
00:35:04,033 --> 00:35:05,766
You'd better watch it

304
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,800
Hey

305
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,366
I apologize

306
00:36:21,933 --> 00:36:23,133
Sun

307
00:36:30,366 --> 00:36:32,132
Let me ask you something.

308
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,799
If I didn't stop you,
what would you do to that guy?

309
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,633
-Break his arm.
-What?

310
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:44,533
Does it have to be that big?

311
00:36:44,533 --> 00:36:48,666
Yes, sir. Because he dared to hurt you.

312
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,566
I know, but that's too much.

313
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,566
No, sir.
If I don't take care of them first.

314
00:36:56,566 --> 00:36:59,566
Later, they will pick a fight with you again.

315
00:37:01,233 --> 00:37:05,333
I know that,
but I don't want anyone to get injured.

316
00:37:08,133 --> 00:37:10,633
But you seem to disagree with them.

317
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,066
I know that you'll protect me,
so I challenged them.

318
00:38:20,233 --> 00:38:21,966
Why did you tell my dad about Toktaeng?

319
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,733
My duty is to report your daily life to Father every day.

320
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:30,566
But it doesn't have to be everything.

321
00:38:30,566 --> 00:38:33,766
What if he doesn't allow me to have a girlfriend,
what'd you do?

322
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:37,366
I respected all Father's decisions.

323
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,900
But I don't. The reason why I want to study in Bangkok
is because I want freedom.

324
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:49,266
I'm a grown-up and I don't want him to control everything,
you know?

325
00:38:49,866 --> 00:38:51,266
I don't get it.

326
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,833
I only know that I must do everything Father's ordered,

327
00:38:57,566 --> 00:39:01,099
and nothing else. I don't care.

328
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,533
What a loyal servant.
What did he feed you?

329
00:39:06,533 --> 00:39:08,399
Dog Food?

330
00:39:15,566 --> 00:39:22,532
It's an obligation.
I was a left-over orphan.

331
00:39:22,533 --> 00:39:28,966
If not for Father,
I would be dead or live on the street.

332
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:35,666
Whatever I can do for him, I would do it with no doubts.

333
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,566
Dodge like a monkey.

334
00:40:06,866 --> 00:40:07,932
Stay still!

335
00:40:21,133 --> 00:40:22,433
Why don't you dodge that?

336
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,166
Isn't it your order?

337
00:40:29,466 --> 00:40:30,932
I accepted that.

338
00:40:45,266 --> 00:40:50,032
I'd better go shower and dinner will be ready soon.

339
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,733
You told others that we are cousins,
then I'll ride shotgun.

340
00:41:50,766 --> 00:41:51,532
but...

341
00:41:51,533 --> 00:41:54,966
Can you relax
just a little like we are the real cousins?

342
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,300
Yes.

343
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,333
Just like that.

344
00:42:25,266 --> 00:42:27,232
[Freshmen Initiation]

345
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,466
Our next activity is

346
00:42:54,466 --> 00:42:59,299
we want a pair from each group
to compete in dance battle.

347
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:04,833
Which pair with the best move will get a reward.

348
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Quick, c'mon.

349
00:43:21,733 --> 00:43:26,466
Sun, come with me.

350
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:35,333
Are you ready?

351
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:37,433
Ready!

352
00:43:37,433 --> 00:43:40,399
Ready, set, music

353
00:43:47,233 --> 00:43:50,066
Go go go all out!

354
00:43:57,766 --> 00:43:59,999
Sky, Sun fighting!

355
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,633
Sun, do it better.

356
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,233
Sun, break your legs.

357
00:44:19,566 --> 00:44:22,399
Sun, go all out or we'll lose.

358
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:31,099
Sun, you make a big one.

359
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:37,899
Sun!

360
00:44:43,033 --> 00:44:44,799
Where did he go?

361
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,933
Don't know.

362
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,233
Let's go after him.

363
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,899
Are you Boss Sakkhee's underling?

364
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,800
Can I have a look at that phone?

365
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,500
Excuse me.

366
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,300
Hey, Sky! Let's go!

367
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:31,000
Sun.

368
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,466
What's the matter?

369
00:46:33,466 --> 00:46:34,732
Nothing

370
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,766
Are you sure?

371
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,166
Yeah sure

372
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,166
Really?

373
00:46:49,533 --> 00:46:51,099
Are you okay?

374
00:46:51,766 --> 00:46:54,799
Ask him.
Why did he suddenly run...

375
00:46:55,466 --> 00:46:57,766
Are you okay, Sun?

376
00:47:04,233 --> 00:47:07,066
What happened?
why you ran away?

377
00:47:08,933 --> 00:47:11,533
It was nothing.

378
00:47:11,533 --> 00:47:16,566
No? He said nothing.

379
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Sun, I knew you chickened out. You can't dance.

380
00:47:35,766 --> 00:47:40,766
What's up? Why do you stop laughing?
Wasn't it funny?

381
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,266
It's not funny anymore.

382
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:53,433
Here, we might as well
eat out together.

383
00:47:53,933 --> 00:47:56,766
What tricks are you playing?

384
00:47:57,933 --> 00:48:00,766
Why so, you've never eaten?

385
00:48:05,166 --> 00:48:07,999
Toktaeng, it's my treat.

386
00:48:11,066 --> 00:48:14,732
Wow, a rich type,
aren't you interested?

387
00:48:14,733 --> 00:48:15,866
Shut up

388
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,933
Sky, are you coming?

389
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:27,633
Yeah, sure, what a lucky day to save money.

390
00:48:29,733 --> 00:48:34,533
What are you waiting for?
let's go

391
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,966
-Yeah
-I didn't mean you.

392
00:48:36,966 --> 00:48:40,032
But I'm starving, too.

393
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:58,432
You're crossing the line here.

394
00:48:58,433 --> 00:49:01,599
You're just a bodyguard,
not my father.

395
00:49:03,466 --> 00:49:05,132
But night clubbing is

396
00:49:05,766 --> 00:49:08,599
putting yourself in danger, young master.

397
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:14,133
I've told you that the reason
why I study in Bangkok is for freedom.

398
00:49:14,133 --> 00:49:17,799
You want me to just stay home
and go to classes?

399
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,666
It's freaking boring, you know?

400
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:25,332
I understand.
But your safety is my priority, young master.

401
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,633
What is so dangerous in going out with friends?

402
00:49:29,533 --> 00:49:33,933
or there is something else you didn't tell me?

403
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,000
No, sir.

404
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,666
Then, just let me go.

405
00:49:43,066 --> 00:49:45,499
I really can't allow that.

406
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,733
Boo!

407
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,366
Where are you going, young master?

408
00:51:23,366 --> 00:51:28,232
Nowhere, do I look suspicious?

409
00:51:38,633 --> 00:51:41,866
Sun, let go!

410
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,166
Hey, what are you doing?

411
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,500
I won't allow you to go out.

412
00:51:53,466 --> 00:51:55,066
I'm not a prisoner.

413
00:51:55,933 --> 00:51:57,766
You're not.

414
00:51:57,766 --> 00:52:01,266
Your safety is my responsibility.

415
00:52:10,433 --> 00:52:12,266
Let go!

416
00:52:13,366 --> 00:52:14,999
Let go!

417
00:52:46,933 --> 00:52:48,699
Please understand

418
00:53:14,166 --> 00:53:16,366
You better watch out.

419
00:53:30,733 --> 00:53:31,599
Hey

420
00:53:35,033 --> 00:53:36,066
Are you for real?

421
00:53:41,433 --> 00:53:43,533
Anything I can help, young master?

422
00:53:44,233 --> 00:53:47,933
Nothing, I'm hungry and ordered a delivery just now.

423
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,266
You sure?

424
00:53:51,266 --> 00:53:53,566
Yeah

425
00:53:55,933 --> 00:54:00,366
Look at me,
I'm wearing pajamas where can I go?

426
00:54:02,633 --> 00:54:07,699
If that so, I'll go downstairs with you.
I'm worried.

427
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,333
Up to you

428
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,366
Come on

429
00:54:45,933 --> 00:54:47,799
Good day, sir.

430
00:54:51,766 --> 00:54:53,499
Just a moment

431
00:54:55,033 --> 00:55:01,733
Okay, all this is 480 baht?

432
00:55:09,566 --> 00:55:11,932
Where's my purse?

433
00:55:14,833 --> 00:55:18,233
Sun, go grab it.
I left it in my room.

434
00:55:19,866 --> 00:55:21,832
Go on, he's waiting.

435
00:55:23,533 --> 00:55:25,199
-Yes
-Just a minute.

436
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,200
He can use mobile banking.

437
00:55:50,666 --> 00:55:53,232
Bye bye

438
00:55:54,566 --> 00:55:57,399
Enjoy eating, I left a snack for you.

439
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:20,033
Phew, I almost had a heart attack.

440
00:56:20,033 --> 00:56:22,166
Come on.

441
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,533
Thanks, bro

442
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:35,732
Here, have this.

443
00:56:35,733 --> 00:56:39,166
The clothes are pricey.
Thanks for helping.

444
00:56:41,933 --> 00:56:45,066
Tonight, drinks are on me.

445
00:56:45,066 --> 00:56:48,932
The night is still young.

446
00:56:48,933 --> 00:56:51,266
Let's go, man

447
00:57:20,166 --> 00:57:22,999
Man, looking good.

448
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,433
What a shame. You didn't see his face just now,
freaking hilarious.

449
00:57:28,433 --> 00:57:33,733
You're laughing, but it scared the hell out of me.
Afraid he'll take me down, again.

450
00:57:34,266 --> 00:57:37,199
Last time is still haunting me.

451
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:42,700
Come on, if anything happened I'll handle it.
Okay?

452
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:48,200
Sound easy, huh,
where else in the world for a good friend like me.

453
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,866
If not for you, I wouldn't help.

454
00:57:51,866 --> 00:57:57,999
Okay, okay, tonight is my treat.

455
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Aw, you know your role for tonight, come on.

456
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:05,333
Don't keep the girls wait,
or they'll be mad.

457
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:21,733
I can't tell at all, really

458
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,500
Ops, you knew then.

459
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:28,133
Yeah, look how you're craned.

460
00:58:29,133 --> 00:58:34,099
I just want to know when Sky is coming.

461
00:58:35,833 --> 00:58:38,666
He'll arrive soon, calm down.

462
00:58:45,366 --> 00:58:47,999
Cheer's to you, beauty?

463
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:50,800
May I?

464
00:58:58,233 --> 00:58:59,333
Sure.

465
00:58:59,333 --> 00:59:03,266
One is cute, another one is gorgeous,
I can't choose.

466
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,833
Let me get through.

467
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:21,933
Sorry to keep you waiting.

468
00:59:22,966 --> 00:59:25,799
No, not at all. We've just arrived.

469
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:32,866
Did those guys bother you, Toktaeng?

470
00:59:32,866 --> 00:59:35,032
None of your business.

471
00:59:35,033 --> 00:59:37,433
Yeah, it's none of your business.

472
00:59:37,433 --> 00:59:40,266
It's our business with these two beauties.

473
00:59:40,266 --> 00:59:42,999
Sweetie, so you're Toktaeng?

474
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,200
Want to come with us to our table? My treat.

475
00:59:46,366 --> 00:59:51,599
Pardon me,
today we're together

476
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:55,400
and I'll take care of the bill.

477
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,866
Maybe next time, if so

478
01:00:08,433 --> 01:00:10,033
What's the matter?

479
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,766
Do you have any problem with my juniors?

480
01:00:25,366 --> 01:00:26,732
Yeah?

481
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:48,400
What now?

482
01:00:48,933 --> 01:00:49,899
Do you know, young master

483
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,400
How precious your blood is?

484
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,966
Here, have them.

485
01:00:58,466 --> 01:01:02,066
Wait Sun, do you dislike Juno that much?

486
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:05,066
Nothing goes as planned.

487
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:13,633
Young master!

488
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,433
