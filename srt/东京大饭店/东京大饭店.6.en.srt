1
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:06,773
The announcement is next month.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,542
Chef Tango. We're tough, you know.

3
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:11,878
So are we.

4
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,185
This is getting interesting.

5
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:26,860
{\an8}Why'd we have to come all the way here?

6
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:29,295
{\an8}The incident three years ago
with the peanut oil...

7
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:31,564
{\an8}I know it was Shohei's mistake.

8
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:37,037
So that's what this is?

9
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:39,873
That's why he went to work for you.

10
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,875
-I didn't threaten him.
-I know that.

11
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:46,246
He couldn't work at my restaurant while
hiding the truth from Kyono and Aizawa.

12
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:48,782
That's why he came to you.

13
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,652
Shohei chose me, not you.

14
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,059
What's your plan?

15
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:03,263
I can't work at that restaurant
while I'm hiding the truth.

16
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:07,567
Shohei, if you're
going to quit French cuisine...

17
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:09,736
I'm not quitting.

18
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,506
I want to work at the restaurant

19
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,475
where I can make the best food I can.

20
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,312
In the restaurant judging,

21
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:24,117
the disciple that you raised
could become my secret weapon.

22
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:32,525
I don't know if he'll be of that much use,

23
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:34,727
but, to be honest,

24
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,332
I'm kind of looking forward
to see what kind of food

25
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,234
you guys can come up with.

26
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,005
-He's here.
-Sorry I'm late.

27
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:47,140
What did Tango say?

28
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,175
Nothing much.

29
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,413
He said he's excited
for the Tokyo Olympics.

30
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,814
No he didn't.

31
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,119
Why did Shohei go to Gaku?

32
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,622
It was his own decision.

33
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,758
What? After all that work we did together?

34
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:07,594
What a traitor.

35
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,231
He's been close to Tango
since they were in Paris.

36
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,299
That's right. He got worked hard by Obana,

37
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,435
so Tango often listened to his complaints.

38
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:16,369
I see.

39
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:19,405
Either way, he isn't quitting
French cuisine after all.

40
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:24,110
That's right.
Shohei Hirako will be back at it.

41
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,915
-Alright, let's go.
-Okay.

42
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,984
-Take the cart back.
-Okay.

43
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:37,157
ONE MONTH UNTIL TOP RESTAURANTS 50 RANKING

44
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,795
<i>This year's Top Restaurants 50.</i>

45
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:47,800
The award ceremony will be held in Tokyo,
which has attention from the Olympics.

46
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:52,071
The controversial Grand Maison Tokyo,
run by Natsuki Obana

47
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,908
<i>has been selected as a candidate, right?</i>

48
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:57,177
It was chosen by gourmets around the world

49
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:59,779
and members of the food
and beverage industry.

50
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,748
You'll have to ask them.

51
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,051
<i>The Top Restaurants 50 competition</i>

52
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:07,820
could be called a preliminary round
for Michelin reviews.

53
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:10,256
One of the most prestigious
awards in the world.

54
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,859
Does that mean we might be grouped in

55
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,528
with restaurants like El Bulli,
Noma and Francescana?

56
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:18,731
I don't know about that,
but it's a big deal.

57
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,702
Does this mean that
after all the fuss about Mr. Obana

58
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,237
we have a chance at a comeback?

59
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,505
It's not a chance.

60
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,641
If we make the ranking,
gourmets from around the world

61
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,110
and industry members
will come to eat here.

62
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:33,880
With that, Grand Maison Tokyo

63
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,784
will become a world-famous restaurant
overnight.

64
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:44,057
Shohei improved the lamb. Give it a try.

65
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,065
It's not just smoked.

66
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:55,568
I wrapped it in kombu
before grilling it to make it soft.

67
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:59,172
<i>I smoked it with straw for fragrance,</i>

68
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,541
and added bamboo shoots
and a flower kimchi.

69
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:05,745
I think the umami of the kombu
could be more present,

70
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,047
but this is a good start.

71
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,351
How is it, Mr. Eto?

72
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,154
Yeah. Not bad.

73
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,290
You've improved.

74
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:19,826
I'm glad I called you here.

75
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:25,431
-Thank you.
-Got it, guys?

76
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:31,004
Top Restaurant officials
will be visiting us in the coming month.

77
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,207
Our food and our service
can still be improved.

78
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,177
Let's aim to be the first Tokyo
restaurant to break the top 20!

79
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:39,512
Oui, chef!

80
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:44,050
Don't tell me you're not interested
in the Top Restaurants 50?

81
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:47,954
I don't like having my dishes criticized

82
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,423
by pompous foodies
who think they're critics.

83
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,357
This again?

84
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,493
-Are you a child?
-He is.

85
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:56,362
We don't have time
to think like that, Obana.

86
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:00,733
These are orders from the head chef.

87
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,136
With all our might,

88
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,773
we will fight for the Top Restaurants 50.

89
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,676
-Then we change the menu.
-Huh? Again?

90
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,378
But we only have a month.

91
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,314
One dish with seasonal ingredients.

92
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,316
Seasonal? What will you change?

93
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,019
Why do you want to change the fish menu?

94
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:22,422
We both liked the <i>uni</i> gratin, right?

95
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:26,459
That's true, but Japan has
the best fish in the world, right?

96
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,696
We want the world
to know our restaurant, right?

97
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:33,433
That is true.
No other country puts in as much effort

98
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,935
into eating every kind
of raw fish like Japan.

99
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,438
But then we'll have to make a dish

100
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,907
that fully shows off
the deliciousness of fresh fish.

101
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:42,575
That's exactly it.

102
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,410
I like your style, Chef Grandma!

103
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,213
-Watch your mouth, Gramps sous-chef.
-Welcome!

104
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,449
-Hello!
-What do you recommend today?

105
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:52,819
We've got some great mackerel
from Miyagi Prefecture.

106
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:55,088
-How big are they?
-At least four kilograms.

107
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:57,590
-Can I take a look?
-Sure. One mackerel!

108
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:00,193
Mackerel?

109
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,861
That's mackerel, right?

110
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,197
It's written as "spring fish."
Is it in season in spring?

111
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,632
In winter, before the spawning season,

112
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,935
the females become fatty and delicious.

113
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:13,206
-You know everything.
-You know nothing at all.

114
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:14,941
Here you are. What do you think?

115
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,110
-It's huge.
-This one is 4.9 kilograms. The best.

116
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,647
This looks great. We'll take two.

117
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,517
They're 10,000 yen a piece.

118
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,619
-Lowest price?
-You can take 'em for 13,000.

119
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,155
Alright! Get these in the truck!

120
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:34,961
So you'll be renewing
the seafood menu next?

121
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:39,198
Since most of the voting members
are foreigners,

122
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,534
fish dishes will be the key to winning.

123
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:43,970
Chef Tango.

124
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,608
I poached the grouper
in a pumpkin seed broth,

125
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:51,811
and added a walnut, beech herb
and malted barley sauce.

126
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,886
The style is too similar
to what you can get in any other country.

127
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,622
I see.

128
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,024
How about you, Shohei?

129
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,227
Give it a try.

130
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,531
<i>This is monkfish papillote
wrapped in fig leaves</i>

131
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,100
<i>and steamed in mushroom and seaweed broth.</i>

132
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,937
A mix of flavors
from the kombu and monkfish.

133
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,138
It has impact.

134
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,993
Let's work on this.

135
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,029
Thank you.

136
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:47,567
Chef Tango.

137
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:53,172
I'll contact a food researcher
and gather ideas for a fish dish.

138
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,507
Thank you.

139
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:57,210
This is grilled tripe.

140
00:07:57,276 --> 00:08:02,114
On top, we have a mixture
of dill and chervil. Enjoy.

141
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:07,820
-Obana, is the kitchen okay?
-What?

142
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,324
We've been getting more customers lately.

143
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,892
We need more hall staff.

144
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,227
I'll leave it to you.

145
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,296
-Mr. Kyono, table four.
-Right.

146
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,433
-How's the cold soup, Moe?
-Almost ready.

147
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,969
Why do I have to help
with things other than desserts?

148
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,905
I'll take over, Moe. Thanks.

149
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,807
Thank you Mr. Aizawa, I'm saved.

150
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,109
I wish Chef Hirako were here.

151
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,012
Don't worry Moe,
I'll evolve into a super sub...

152
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,146
Don't touch that, Serita.

153
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:38,150
You're not ready yet
to touch the customers' food.

154
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:48,794
Chef, please acknowledge me.
Look at this perfect cutting.

155
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,996
It's better than Shohei's.

156
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,103
Serita, bring me a soup plate.

157
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,172
Okay.

158
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,378
FOR CUTTING PRACTICE

159
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,721
FROM ETO
CAN YOU COME TO GAKU TONIGHT?

160
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:18,291
<i>Grand Maison Tokyo
is making a fish dish, too?</i>

161
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:21,928
Perfect. Get me the recipe for that dish.

162
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,130
You're going to copy it?

163
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,700
Recipes don't have copyrights.

164
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,403
The recipe for an omelette
cooked in butter

165
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:32,305
has been copied worldwide countless times.

166
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,974
When you put it that way...

167
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:39,111
The biggest difference between
Gaku and Grand Maison Tokyo

168
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:40,279
is financial strength.

169
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,816
Even if we make the same food
with the same recipe,

170
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,953
we'll win with our finer ingredients.

171
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,261
We'll let you work here
if you continue the good work.

172
00:09:55,328 --> 00:10:00,066
Starting your career
at a high-class restaurant

173
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,401
is the quickest path to success.

174
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,504
So? Let's hear it.

175
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:09,208
Come on now.

176
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,616
Oh? What are you doing here?

177
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:17,917
Nothing.

178
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,219
-Wait.
-Let go of me.

179
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,523
You really are a hard worker.

180
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,726
You've been doing 5 mm dicing.

181
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:27,927
None of your business.

182
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,596
What are you doing here yourself?

183
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,466
Everyone's talking about you.

184
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:36,502
I'm sick of it.

185
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:50,282
{\an8}25 DAYS UNTIL TOP RESTAURANTS 50

186
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,956
<i>Ms. Kanna? You mean the
food writer Ms. Kanna Kuzumi?</i>

187
00:10:57,023 --> 00:11:01,060
That's right.
She has a lot of knowledge about food,

188
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,629
so I think she might be a good addition.

189
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:06,365
We've been getting more customers too.

190
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,237
-Let's ask her.
-I'll contact her right away.

191
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,272
-Good morning.
-Morning.

192
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:15,541
You're here too, Kyono?

193
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,143
Yeah, talking about hall staff.

194
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,546
I think we found a good person.

195
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,152
Would you like some, Mr. Kyono?

196
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:32,024
I'm alright. I already ate.

197
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,927
-Okay.
-Thanks for the food.

198
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,395
Let's eat.

199
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,065
Oh, about the mackerel,

200
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:42,468
smoking or aging it might work well.

201
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,604
Maybe unlike a carpaccio or something,

202
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,840
it might be better slightly cooked.

203
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:51,444
I thought maybe we could
cook it as a meunière...

204
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,513
-No, not meunière.
-Don't be so negative.

205
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,549
We won't know until we try.

206
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:58,784
That will make it lose its freshness.

207
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,988
Those things can be adjusted.
Don't worry about it.

208
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,791
The cooking process can?

209
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,060
-Yes.
-Look at you.

210
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,962
I'm telling you it'll work out.

211
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:13,966
Well then, we'll have to compare
our cooking and see whose is better.

212
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,135
-Fine.
-What is it?

213
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,903
Oh, it's nothing.

214
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:20,973
You want some food after all?

215
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:25,311
Yeah, maybe I'll have something after all.

216
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:27,246
I'll make one more for you.

217
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,354
-What is it?
-It's nothing.

218
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,956
I was just thinking that looks good.

219
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,859
-Want it?
-No.

220
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,894
-Mine is...
-I haven't touched it.

221
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,763
-Hurry up.
-Mine's over there.

222
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:46,599
No, I want to drink this first anyway.

223
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,467
I'll eat the one she's making.

224
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:52,805
This is Kanna.
She's been reporting on our restaurant.

225
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:56,609
She'll be working here as hall staff.

226
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:59,411
She speaks English and French
and knows a lot about food.

227
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,148
She's also a certified sommelier.

228
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:05,017
-She's just what we need.
-That's great.

229
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:08,487
I still have a lot to learn
and will need your help,

230
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:11,157
but I promise to do my best
to smile and stay positive.

231
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:12,458
Thank you for the opportunity.

232
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:13,826
Welcome to the team.

233
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,968
Oh, also, here's my resume.

234
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:25,337
Thanks for bringing this.

235
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,975
Could I have a look at the kitchen?

236
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:38,450
It's an honor to work with you, Mr. Obana.

237
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:43,122
Actually, ever since Escofille,

238
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,925
I've been a big fan of your cooking.

239
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,261
Thank you for your patronage.

240
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:53,532
Watch your back. He's quick with a knife
and even quicker with women.

241
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,135
-Move your hands, not your mouth.
-Sorry.

242
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,703
He doesn't look that way.

243
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,072
He minds his manners when he's cooking.

244
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:03,075
Let me know if you need anything.

245
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:06,245
We don't want to lose
a valuable talent like yours.

246
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,914
-You're kind. Thank you very much.
-Not at all.

247
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,252
-What if she's better than you?
-Whatever, I'm older.

248
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:16,522
-You can't even make a staff meal.
-Yes I can.

249
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,324
Nice to meet you.

250
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,427
You too.

251
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,829
I'm glad she's here.

252
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,798
Indeed.

253
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,067
Is something wrong?

254
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:29,602
No, I'm fine.

255
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,042
Sojiro Kuzumi?

256
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:46,485
<i>It's you that holds the grudge, no?</i>

257
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,025
Okay, let's choose
who'll make the staff meal today.

258
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,661
-Draw one, please.
-Pardon me!

259
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:01,667
Let me make the staff meal today.

260
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,503
I wanna eat something good.

261
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,273
Don't worry.
I've been working here too all this time.

262
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,446
-Okay, you're up.
-Really?

263
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,549
-Alright!
-Good luck.

264
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,051
-Seaweed salt.
-Oh, right.

265
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,628
EGG

266
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,697
RICE

267
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:40,706
CARROT, ONION, ZUCCHINI,
RED PEPPER, SALT, PEPPER

268
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,255
The meal is ready!

269
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,960
Five-millimeter veggie fried rice.

270
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,828
-Dig in.
-That's a lot.

271
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,566
-Pardon me.
-Thank you.

272
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,569
-Looks good.
-Thanks for the food.

273
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,137
Thank you.

274
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:15,240
This is awful.

275
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:21,013
If you use a freshly sharpened knife,
the metal taste gets in the food.

276
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:22,948
Oh, I see.

277
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,150
Using our bodies as much as we do,

278
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:28,620
do you really think we
only want veggies and rice?

279
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:32,191
But the rice is nice and crisp, no?

280
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:38,764
Clean up.

281
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,902
-I'll make something.
-Moe, none for me, please.

282
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,939
-I have to get Amelie.
-That time already?

283
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,608
-Be careful.
-Thanks. I'll be back soon.

284
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,043
Alright, see you soon.

285
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,711
-Be safe.
-Sure.

286
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,380
Let's see...

287
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:04,223
Wow, this is great.

288
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,227
What's wrong? Drink as much as you like.

289
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,431
Why'd you invite me here?

290
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,767
Me? It's just...

291
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,204
I thought you might be feeling down.

292
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:23,075
No, I'm fine.

293
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,246
-What?
-Nothing.

294
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,950
Shohei was just like that at first, too.

295
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,186
Shohei this, Shohei that.

296
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,789
Why don't you just hire him?

297
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,191
Sorry, I'm not trying to compare you.

298
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,759
It just happens. Forgive me.

299
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,127
Thank you.

300
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:46,965
It doesn't matter. I'm no good anyway.

301
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,070
I'm not skilled or talented
like everyone else.

302
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,708
Talent takes time to be understood.

303
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,111
In cooking, you see,

304
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:03,782
everyone has to start
not knowing if they're good or not.

305
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:08,821
But with effort and practice,
by building your skills,

306
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,424
you become aware of your own talents.

307
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,399
So what should I do?

308
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,002
Rinko and Obana won't say it,

309
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,572
but they're watching you.

310
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,542
Maybe it's that.

311
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:36,014
They don't want you to be someone
that just follows orders.

312
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,051
Maybe that's what they think.

313
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,888
<i>Those two, you know,</i>

314
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:46,325
<i>put in more effort
and hard work than anyone.</i>

315
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,536
-Roasting it is best.
-Definitely.

316
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,206
We made plenty of failures, too.

317
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:04,743
But now we know that roasting is best,
so I'd say it was worth it.

318
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,880
This is the best one.

319
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,782
We can confidently recommend
it to our guests.

320
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:14,586
The fish might benefit from a simple sauce
to bring out the flavor.

321
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,889
Let's ask Mr. Aizawa
what he thinks will work.

322
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:17,823
Sure.

323
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,226
But the problem...

324
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,230
...is the heat.

325
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,903

Alright.

329
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,644
Sorry.

330
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:40,812
See you later.

331
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,049
-You're not coming?
-I...

332
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:45,884
-I've got an errand.
-An errand?

333
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,920
It's nothing important.

334
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,523
-Be safe.
-See you later.

335
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:54,493
Alright.

336
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,199
Excuse me.

337
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,034
What is it? Forget something?

338
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,336
No. Um...

339
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,039
-Can I work here with you?
-What?

340
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:09,308
I want to learn how to fillet a mackerel.

341
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,375
Please!

342
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,344
What a pain.

343
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,547
Please!

344
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:24,122
-You'll start by cleaning.
-Okay!

345
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,259
-I'll make a thin one.
-Okay.

346
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:40,472
You have to put your hips
into it at a fish market.

347
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,947
-Here's the thin one.
-Okay.

348
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,549
-And the thick one.
-Great.

349
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,262
Ready?

350
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:10,736
Okay.

351
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,576
Too much heat.

352
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:20,279
The skin doesn't look
crunchy enough, either.

353
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,547
Should we keep it in the pan longer?

354
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,950
Let's add ten seconds.

355
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,319
Mackerel has a lot
of moisture to begin with,

356
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,955
so it's probably better to use
more salt at first.

357
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:31,690
-Let's try again.
-Okay.

358
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,866
When filleting into three pieces,
you follow the bones.

359
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:44,703
Don't overdo it.
Let the knife do the work. Got it?

360
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,638
-Yes.
-Look!

361
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:48,774
Check this out.

362
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,413
About two minutes.

363
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,084
-It's been about two minutes.
-Okay.

364
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,854
Should we set it to one minute?

365
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:05,824
This oven is a bit finicky.

366
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:18,370
-How's this?
-Good.

367
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:19,571
Almost there.

368
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,049
Go along the bones.

369
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:38,256
Carefully now. Good.

370
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:39,825
You're getting good.

371
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,802
Fennel, celery and Italian parsley.

372
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:53,505
Dill and capers. And what's this?

373
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:55,173
-Pomelo?
-Pomelo?

374
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:57,376
Crystal pomelo.

375
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:59,077
<i>I made a light sauce</i>

376
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:02,280
<i>to preserve the delicate flavor
of the rare mackerel.</i>

377
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:03,749
Well done, Mr. Aizawa.

378
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:04,649
And for sides?

379
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,852
It'll depend on how it's done each day,

380
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:10,188
but I'm thinking of
using a pan-seared tardivo.

381
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:13,058
-Shall we try?
-I hope it's a good match.

382
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,695
Serita, clean this up.

383
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:20,065
-Got it.
-I'll try roasting it again.

384
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,133
Sounds good.

385
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:26,037
Yum.

386
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,677
Crystal... pomelo...

387
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,981
Give it a try.
Even the throwaway parts are good.

388
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:44,055
-It's so good!
-Right? The whole fish is good.

389
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,459
{\an8}FIFTEEN DAYS UNTIL TOP RESTAURANTS 50

390
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:48,427
{\an8}Okay.

391
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,496
Everyone, come here please.

392
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:54,132
-Over here.
-Okay.

393
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,468
Wow.

394
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:59,838
Roasted mackerel with pomelo sauce.

395
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,307
We let the fatty female mackerel

396
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,776
sit out for one day to distribute the fat

397
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,445
and concentrate its umami.

398
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:09,281
The skin is crunchy,
and the center is cooked rare.

399
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:15,120
Wow! It's amazing.

400
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:17,255
It's roasted but almost raw in the middle.

401
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:19,758
Your pomelo sauce was perfect, Mr. Aizawa.

402
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:24,429
I wanted to try a girolle mushroom
and white wine sauce, too.

403
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,632
-How is it?
-It's out of this world.

404
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,634
Kyono?

405
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:33,638
I think we can serve it
to our guests with confidence.

406
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:35,574
-Great.
-Thank you.

407
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,310
Ouch!

408
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:42,113
Chef Rinko, see if we have
a wine to pair with this.

409
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,016
-Okay.
-Obana too. Get to it.

410
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,486
It's so good.

411
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:58,630
-I can help, Mr. Aizawa
-It's fine, I got it.

412
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:01,867
-I know how to do it.
-Get out of his way.

413
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:04,970
Moe, do we have more salt somewhere?

414
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:06,037
We do.

415
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,075
Alright.

416
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:18,517
At least carry one.

417
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:22,420
-Hey, Serita.
-What are you doing?

418
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,223
It's perfect, right?

419
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,059
-Oh no.
-Look.

420
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:30,161
It looks like Mr. Aizawa's cuts, right?

421
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,933
I think I did pretty good.

422
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,468
You fool. It's totally wrong.

423
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:39,437
-It's the same.
-We can't serve this.

424
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,707
It's the same. Why can't you...

425
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:45,911
I'm doing my best here!

426
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,180
What knife did you use?

427
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:04,095
You're not ready for this restaurant yet.

428
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,404
Fine. I'm done.

429
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,941
Cutting veggies here is a waste of time.

430
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,843
Then I quit myself!

431
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,586
Carry on.

432
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:32,090
-Mr. Aizawa.
-It's okay.

433
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:33,658
We have more.

434
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:46,204
Here. Like I promised.

435
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,839
Study notes?

436
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:50,008
I wrote that so no one would find out.

437
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,043
Don't worry about it.

438
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:58,049
You can skip that part.

439
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:00,185
It's in the back.

440
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:08,994
I just quit that damn restaurant.

441
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:11,963
Just like you said.

442
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:17,402
The only way to get good
is to work at a good restaurant.

443
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,073
It's my pleasure to work with you.

444
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:26,945
Understood. I'll put the word out.

445
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:30,115
You're really going to hire that punk kid?

446
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,282
Of course not.

447
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,423
It's up to you now.

448
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:45,964
Hey.

449
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,301
What are you doing here?

450
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:52,103
I thought I'd pay your severance.

451
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:56,474
But we're struggling
with cash flow right now.

452
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:58,209
I don't need it.

453
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:01,246
Instead of that,

454
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:04,916
I'll get you a good meal.

455
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:20,632
MONKFISH, BUTTER

456
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:27,072
LEMON THYME, KARATACHI, KOMBU

457
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:33,144
MISO

458
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:38,883
Plating it.

459
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:03,241
This is it.

460
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:04,976
Yes.

461
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:06,945
Alright!

462
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,785
-We'll have Mr. Eto try it tomorrow.
-Okay.

463
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,862
{\an8}10 DAYS UNTIL TOP RESTAURANTS 50

464
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:27,332
{\an8}This is a bone-on poached monkfish
with lemon thyme, butter and liver.

465
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:30,535
Monkfish and liver on the same plate?

466
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:33,338
Please try it with the miso sauce.

467
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:42,413
Simple and refined,

468
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,283
with complex tastes and flavors.

469
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,418
It's incredible.

470
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,488
Shall we add it to the menu?

471
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:52,724
-Not yet.
-Why?

472
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:56,995
With the idea I got
from a food researcher,

473
00:29:57,061 --> 00:30:00,131
<i>I've ordered Kakitani
to make a fish dish as well.</i>

474
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:03,101
I'd like to compare the two first.

475
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:04,736
Thanks for waiting.

476
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:19,818
Fatty mackerel with only the sides cooked?

477
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:20,985
A roast?

478
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:22,187
The outside is fragrant,

479
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:25,590
but the center is rare.
It's complimented with a pomelo sauce.

480
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,563
It looks simple,
but I think this wonderful dish

481
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:33,264
will become a unique Gaku staple.

482
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:35,433
Go ahead.

483
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:37,702
Give it a try.

484
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:48,379
This is...

485
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:56,588
Here's your amuse.
Please eat directly with your hand.

486
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,791
Take your time. Enjoy.

487
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,993
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

488
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,228
I'll show you to your seat.

489
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,335
Right this way.

490
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:14,539
Thank you.

491
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:21,646
Chef Tango!

492
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:28,920
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

493
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,388
Thank you for coming.

494
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:34,659
I have voting rights, you know.
Of course I'm here.

495
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,394
Please enjoy your meal.

496
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,997
This is a goat's milk bavarois.

497
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:40,798
Thank you.

498
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:54,612
How is it?

499
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:57,215
It's great.

500
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:02,587
Somehow, even more delicious than usual.

501
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:07,859
I sample all of our dishes myself, too,

502
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:10,695
our food is different
than other restaurants.

503
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:13,398
In each of the dishes we serve,

504
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:18,770
the cooks have added a part of their soul.

505
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,707
That's why good food

506
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,610
is made even better

507
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,111
when it's for the customer.

508
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:31,449
Sorry, I'm talking too much.

509
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:33,217
Please take your time.

510
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,771
-Let's make the fish.
-Oui, chef.

511
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:00,945
-Let's make the new fish dish!
-Oui, chef!

512
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:23,701
Make Linda's dishes perfect.

513
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:33,811
Roast mackerel with pomelo sauce.

514
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:50,495
It's superb.

515
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,335
-Thank you.
-Great work.

516
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,771
You must be so busy.

517
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:01,606
We're doing very well.

518
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:05,476
He's been helping us as well.

519
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,514
I'm Gaku's new sous-chef, Shohei Hirako.

520
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:11,449
Have we met before?

521
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,721
I used to work
at a place called Escofille.

522
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:21,192
That's right.

523
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,162
Perhaps it's thanks to you

524
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:27,498
the food reminded me
of Escofille's heyday.

525
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:30,368
Sorry, that's rude of me.

526
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:34,305
The fish was absolutely unique
and wonderful.

527
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:36,374
Thank you.

528
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:40,011
Thank you for the meal.

529
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:45,817
Serita.

530
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,720
Thanks for coming today.

531
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:52,290
Of course. I'll pay.

532
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,026
We won't accept your money.

533
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:59,530
We served you food
that we can't serve our guests.

534
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,305
The roast mackerel.

535
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,175
Compared to the test product,

536
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,778
I felt like it had a smell.

537
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:20,384
So you noticed?

538
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:23,521
We used your fillet.

539
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:29,227
If you fillet with a knife you used
to cut pungent vegetables,

540
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:32,763
<i>that residue will transfer to the fish
and degrade its flavor.</i>

541
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:33,998
Remember that.

542
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,103
That's why you said mine was different?

543
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,539
I know you asked the fishmonger

544
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:44,308
to teach you how to cut a fillet.

545
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:49,480
But that's just basic knowledge.

546
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:55,686
The place you work
is trying to get three stars.

547
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:59,323
Don't take food lightly.

548
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,737
-Forgive me!
-Hey.

549
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,941
I betrayed you all.

550
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:21,145
I sold your recipe to Mr. Eto at Gaku.

551
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,215
I was being paid to spy.

552
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,150
I can't believe it.

553
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,251
I'm sorry.

554
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,488
Listen.

555
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:35,826
Don't you know what will happen
if you give that recipe away?

556
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:41,132
They said they would use better mackerel.

557
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,568
That's why

558
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:48,606
if they got the recipe,
Grand Maison Tokyo would lose.

559
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:53,578
I've made a mess of all your effort.

560
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,981
I'm sorry.

561
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,859
You're so naive.

562
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:13,197
They can't copy the dishes
we put so much thought into.

563
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:14,865
When you're at this level,

564
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:17,735
a recipe doesn't guarantee results.

565
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:19,937
The best chefs

566
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:22,807
<i>don't worry about their
recipes getting out.</i>

567
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:26,644
<i>Because they know they can
make it better than anyone.</i>

568
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:27,712
Go ahead.

569
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:33,017
-This is...
-It's no good.

570
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:35,720
The umami from the fat isn't there.

571
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,322
It hasn't been aged right.

572
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:42,026
The heat is all wrong.
This is nothing but a fried fish!

573
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,895
But I followed the recipe perfectly.

574
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:46,664
What should we do, Mr. Eto?

575
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,934
<i>We'll serve the monkfish.</i>

576
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:56,974
It's superb.

577
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:59,910
Based on the condition of the fish,

578
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:02,046
the recipe has to be adaptable.

579
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,615
The drying time,
the temperature of the oven.

580
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:07,485
Even the temperature
and humidity outdoors.

581
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:10,921
If you think you can copy it, just try!

582
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:13,291
It's not just for the mackerel roast.

583
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:17,461
The pressed eggplant
and the roast venison too,

584
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:21,232
none of our dishes can be copied.

585
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,368
We don't mess around here.

586
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:28,439
There are plenty who try to copy us.

587
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,475
But if you want three stars,

588
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:35,846
you have to make the real thing yourself.

589
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,184
So which are you, Serita?

590
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:44,522
What kind of chef do you want to be?

591
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:48,359
You've got to decide for yourself.

592
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:11,782
Um...

593
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:17,555
Can I try making the staff meal again?

594
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:21,092
Please.

595
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:30,901
Alright.

596
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:41,278
<i>Even the throwaway parts are good.</i>

597
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:43,180
-It's so good!
-Right?

598
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,483
<i>The whole fish is good.</i>

599
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:49,687
EGG

600
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:58,162
RICE, SESAME OIL, SALT, PEPPER, SOY SAUCE,
CARROTS, ONIONS, ZUCCHINI, MACKEREL

601
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:28,592
-Here you are.
-Thanks for the meal.

602
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:47,511
Yum. This is great.

603
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:51,248
It's great.
The flavor of the mackerel comes through.

604
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,585
-Thank you.
-The flavor could use work.

605
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:56,387
The heating was uneven.

606
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,289
It might not need zucchini.

607
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:00,758
It could use more color.

608
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:06,397
Even so, I can tell that you used
all of your skill and experience

609
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:11,936
to create a dish that would make us happy.

610
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:31,021
-Thank you.
-Thanks for the meal.

611
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:32,857
Cut the mackerel after you clean up.

612
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:36,060
-What?
-It's fine right?

613
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:37,027
Of course.

614
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:41,232
-Check on him, Mr. Aizawa.
-Are you sure?

615
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:43,000
Can I really stay?

616
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:46,237
You're the prep cook, right?

617
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:58,415
That was tasty.

618
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:15,065
Thank you.

619
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:26,377
I've been reminded,
since cooking with you again.

620
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:28,746
You really are a genius, Mr. Tango.

621
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:32,583
Since the Top Restaurant survey started,

622
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,952
I've been scared every day.

623
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,856
I wake up, look in the mirror,

624
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:41,859
and somehow muster up
the strength to come here.

625
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,095
If I really were a genius,

626
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,865
I should be having more fun.

627
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:49,166
Everyone gets nervous.

628
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,269
Obana doesn't.

629
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:55,873
He always enjoyed himself.

630
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,176
I'm kind of looking forward
to see what kind of food

631
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:02,846
you guys can come up with.

632
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:06,517
<i>Even when being judged
by the world's strictest gourmet critics</i>

633
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,785
<i>he just laughed.</i>

634
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,890
Shohei, I know

635
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:15,025
that you'd rather work for Obana.

636
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:19,697
You probably came to Gaku
because you thought you could

637
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:22,166
make great dishes as a way
to pay Obana back.

638
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,636
-Mr. Tango.
-It's fine.

639
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,273
From when we were training at L'Ambroisie,

640
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,875
Obana had the power to fire people up.

641
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,412
But I've worked so hard for this.

642
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,515
<i>I can't lose to a brand new restaurant.</i>

643
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,352
<i>To a man who spent three years on the run,</i>

644
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:43,721
I refuse to lose.

645
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:48,559
-What should we do for sides tomorrow?
-Good question.

646
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,661
-How about chicory? I saw it for sale.
-Nope.

647
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:52,563
There you go again. Then what?

648
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:56,033
How about wasabi leaves? That'd be fun.

649
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:59,737
-Wasabi leaves?
-Obana's having fun.

650
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:03,774
Thanks to Ms. Rinko.
It's because she's the chef.

651
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:06,844
Obana is free to do his thing.

652
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,047
Could it be?

653
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,483
Obana at his best right now?

654
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:14,785
If he can keep it up.

655
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:23,761
{\an8}DAY OF TOP RESTAURANTS 50

656
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,496
{\an8}TOP RESTAURANTS 50

657
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:32,603
{\an8}So you're working at Grand Maison Tokyo?

658
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:35,906
{\an8}-I am.
-What's your plan?

659
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:40,110
{\an8}It depends on what happens
to the restaurant.

660
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:45,549
{\an8}<i>Obana and the Escofille crew</i>

661
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:48,419
{\an8}<i>getting their groove back
at Grand Maison Tokyo...</i>

662
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:50,254
{\an8}<i>I simply won't allow it.</i>

663
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:58,929
{\an8}We will now begin the award ceremony

664
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,532
{\an8}for 2019's Top Restaurants 50.

665
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:05,202
{\an8}Welcome to the Top Restaurants 50, 2019.

666
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,739
{\an8}It's time now to start the award ceremony.

667
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:10,474
{\an8}It's showtime!

668
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:48,112
We will get three stars!

669
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:49,613
I'm here to take Amelie with me.

670
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,814
<i>I won't give her up.</i>

671
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:53,183
{\an8}<i>Do you think a chef has time
to raise a child?</i>

672
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,586
{\an8}<i>You can't beat mom's cooking.</i>

673
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:56,820
{\an8}<i>I'm going to make a new dish.</i>

674
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:58,122
{\an8}<i>It's overwhelming work.</i>

675
00:45:58,188 --> 00:45:59,490
{\an8}It's impossible.

676
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:00,657
Welcome.

677
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:03,260
A special lunch for a princess.

678
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:04,294
<i>Have faith.</i>

679
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:05,429
<i>You'll get your family back.</i>

680
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:07,631
<i>Acknowledge that chefs aren't foolish!</i>

681
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:09,099
We will now announce the top ten.

682
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:11,001
This time, we can do it.

683
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:12,402
{\an8}<i>Dad!</i>

684
