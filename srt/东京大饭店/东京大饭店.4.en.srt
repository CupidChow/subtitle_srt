1
00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:08,008
SEVEN DAYS UNTIL THE PRE-OPENING

2
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:09,876
{\an8}An open kitchen, huh?

3
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:12,645
{\an8}I want diners to enjoy
a vibrant view of cooking.

4
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:13,613
What about the menu?

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,915
Just the chef's recommended course.

6
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:19,786
Including appetizers, there are a total
of ten dishes, and no à la carte options.

7
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:23,656
{\an8}How presumptuous
to not let the customers choose.

8
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:26,559
Aren't there any floor staff?

9
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:28,228
I'll handle the floor by myself.

10
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:30,563
The kitchen staff will also be serving.

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,035
The best dishes will be served
directly by the chefs.

12
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:38,371
Is she really such a gourmet?

13
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:42,008
Restaurants praised by Linda have
their reservations booked for a year.

14
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:46,046
But also, many famous places
closed after poor reviews.

15
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:47,480
That's no joke.

16
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:50,650
So Mr. Obana, who dated
such an amazing person...

17
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,319
He's just a chef who likes women.

18
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,287
I see.

19
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:55,688
You're doing the pre-opening, right?

20
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:59,859
You'll be inviting people
who supported you and Chef Rinko, right?

21
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:02,062
-Yes.
-Could you invite me as well?

22
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:02,896
Pardon?

23
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:06,933
I'll feature it in Marie Claire Dining.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,268
I'll write it.

25
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,184
How about it? Head chef Rinko Hayami.

26
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:30,590
It'll be crowded on opening day
so I'll invite you on another day.

27
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:33,093
Kyono, can you save a spot for me?

28
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,095
Of course.

29
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:38,965
-Then, I'll invite you.
-Mr. Obana!

30
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,103
I'm glad. I'm looking forward to it.

31
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:52,712
What'll we do? Suddenly,
our pre-opening has become a fateful day.

32
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,881
It's exciting and good.

33
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,650
If we receive a poor review,
our restaurant might close.

34
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:59,018
Why did you invite her?

35
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:03,656
I don't trust critics
who brag about their knowledge of food.

36
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:07,727
They often collude with restaurants
and distort evaluations for money.

37
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,895
Then it's even worse.

38
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,064
But Linda is different.

39
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:16,102
She's a true gourmet
who genuinely loves cooking.

40
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:20,673
If we provide good food and service,
she'll give a good review.

41
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,876
You seem to hold her in high regard.

42
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:27,347
If the head chef keeps running away
like this, we won't get three stars.

43
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:28,681
I'm not running away!

44
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,219
But geez...

45
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,957
Because of you, we have to do this!

46
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,794
But there's a problem.

47
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:43,830
The dessert.

48
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:46,166
What? Isn't it already complete?

49
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,735
Linda places a lot of
importance on dessert.

50
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,571
Let's try to improve it in a week.

51
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,339
There's no time for that.

52
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:54,774
We're already short-staffed...

53
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:55,775
NEW STAFF (CHEF DE PARTIE)
HIKARU KAKITANI

54
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,443
If we work overnight, we'll manage.

55
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,580
If you keep doing things your way,
no one will follow.

56
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,882
Kakitani, you don't have to do it.

57
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,920
It's true that we can't run a restaurant
with just us.

58
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:09,022
We'll get more chefs
before the pre-opening.

59
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:12,192
Then, there's someone I want to bring in.

60
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:20,700
-Sorry for coming repeatedly.
-What do you want?

61
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:24,070
Mr. Obana says
there's someone he wants to recruit.

62
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,706
-Really?
-Looks like you're needed.

63
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:47,594
Moe Matsui, right?

64
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,529
Oh! You were here before.

65
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:53,399
We're opening
a three-star French restaurant.

66
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,069
Would you like to be the pastry chef?

67
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:57,136
Huh?

68
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,241
If it's this one, you'll do it.

69
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,744
If it's this one, you'll do it.
Which one is it?

70
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,313
Huh?

71
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:11,718
{\an8}-Thank you.
-Good job.

72
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:15,255
Félicitations, Tango, congratulations.

73
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:16,289
Linda.

74
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:21,527
I came from Paris just to see you.

75
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,264
The real reason you came to Japan
is because of Obana, right?

76
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:29,235
You've been a huge fan
of Obana since long ago.

77
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:34,841
Is that so? I was the first
to recognize your skills.

78
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,178
Did you come to help his restaurant?

79
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:40,713
As if.

80
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:46,052
The repercussions of that lunch
didn't only hurt Escofille.

81
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:51,157
<i>I recommended that restaurant
to the government.</i>

82
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:56,629
When allergenic ingredients were used,
my reputation was also ruined.

83
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,699
Did you come for revenge?

84
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:07,307
You're not the type to let personal
feelings affect your evaluations.

85
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:15,448
I'm Moe Matsui.
I'm here today for a visit.

86
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,850
{\an8}I'm thinking of having her
be the pastry chef.

87
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:18,751
{\an8}SIX DAYS UNTIL THE PRE-OPENING

88
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,453
{\an8}I'm completely in favor!

89
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,023
{\an8}It's not decided yet.
We need to hear Ms. Moe's opinion too.

90
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,892
Who are you, lady?

91
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:28,861
I'm the head chef!

92
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:30,496
Totally unexpected!

93
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,666
What kind of dishes does this place make?

94
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:39,439
We use Japanese ingredients
to bring out the natural flavors.

95
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,873
Here's our menu.

96
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,676
For dessert, there's meringue ice cream
and Mont Blanc.

97
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:47,146
I'm confident in the meringue,
but I plan to improve the Mont Blanc.

98
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:48,181
I'd like to taste it.

99
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,386
This is the Mont Blanc.

100
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,425
It's really delicious!

101
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,828
Can you match this level?

102
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,635
Honestly, the appearance is lacking.

103
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:14,006
It's not something
you'd want to take photos of.

104
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:17,176
-It's lacking in finesse.
-That's harsh.

105
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:21,314
Finesse? Less experienced people
often say that.

106
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,282
Here.

107
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:29,922
Confectionery Competition Rookie Award.
World Pastry Design Award.

108
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,492
-You won the Loir Award at 25?
-Unbelievable.

109
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,793
-Yes.
-What is that?

110
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,928
Pâtisserie Herbe,
the famous shop in Daikanyama?

111
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,431
I got bored and quit after six months.

112
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,401
Boulangerie Node, Chef Motoki,
Anterose Aoyama.

113
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,569
They're all famous places.

114
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,939
So why are you working
at that buffet place?

115
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:50,443
Well, I wanted to make
various things at once.

116
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,413
-That's impressive!
-Experience doesn't matter.

117
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,616
You need to be able
to make delicious food.

118
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:02,054
So, can you make a dessert
better than this?

119
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:10,596
Do you have chestnuts?

120
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:12,932
You'll make it now?

121
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:16,302
Not right now, but I can manage
in about five hours.

122
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:19,972
It took us over a month to make this.

123
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,842
Honestly, time doesn't matter.

124
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:27,013
No matter how hard they try,
people without talent will never succeed.

125
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,849
Talented chefs can create
delicious food right away.

126
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:37,990
It doesn't matter how hard you try
if you can make something delicious.

127
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:38,891
That's true.

128
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:43,296
But since that's hard to achieve
for most people,

129
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:46,999
chefs around the world
struggle with all their might.

130
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:50,970
But I can do it.

131
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,041
I can make a dessert
with more finesse than anyone here.

132
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,845
-I see.
-Yes.

133
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:05,751
They're hiring a young woman
from a hotel to be their pastry chef.

134
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,955
How do you know so much about them?

135
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,824
This industry is small.

136
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,760
Stop being so underhanded.

137
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,263
Aren't we allies?

138
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,098
Once again...

139
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,336
Let's join hands
and win that three-star rating!

140
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:24,403
Got it?

141
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,476
It's done. Here's the Mont Blanc!

142
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,312
What are you doing?

143
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:37,350
I upload photos of desserts I make
to see how people react.

144
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,584
It'll get a lot of likes.

145
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:42,321
The thinly stretched
sugar decoration is unique.

146
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,727
It's delicious.

147
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,330
-You made it quickly.
-Thank you.

148
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:52,832
-But...
-This is no good.

149
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:53,633
Huh?

150
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:54,767
You've let me down.

151
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:59,839
Wait a minute, what's wrong with this
perfect Mont Blanc?

152
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:03,576
We're not a pâtisserie specializing
in desserts or a hotel buffet.

153
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:09,382
In French cuisine, desserts play
a crucial role in finishing the course.

154
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:10,917
This doesn't fulfill that role.

155
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:14,320
But it's prettier and more refined
than the other one.

156
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,056
If you want to brag,
then do it at your own shop.

157
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,859
I see, you don't want to admit defeat.

158
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:24,931
I admit, the appearance is excellent.

159
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:29,135
But the liqueur flavor is too strong,

160
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,203
and despite using chestnuts,

161
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,707
the flavor and fragrance
of those chestnuts are missing.

162
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,809
That's a fatal flaw.

163
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,913
That's...

164
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:46,719
The concept of Grand Maison Tokyo
is to bring out the taste

165
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,555
and aroma of Japanese ingredients.

166
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:53,326
That doesn't belong on our menu.

167
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:55,394
Then I'll make it again.

168
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:58,631
We don't have time to keep testing you.
We'll improve it ourselves.

169
00:09:58,698 --> 00:09:59,699
What should we do?

170
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,568
-Then I'll make it too.
-What?

171
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:05,671
If my dessert tastes better,
put it on the menu.

172
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,974
-I decline.
-You can leave now.

173
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,208
You called me, didn't you?

174
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,777
I already told you, you let me down!

175
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,013
So try my dessert again!

176
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,283
Now, now. If she wants to,
let her make it again.

177
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,220
I want to try it too,
so bring it before the pre-opening.

178
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:24,924
Okay.

179
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:33,099
What do you think?

180
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:37,036
She has the skills
to back up her arrogance.

181
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:41,107
The innovative design
is something Obana lacks.

182
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:44,910
<i>There was a distinct feminine cuteness.</i>

183
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,647
The look of desserts
can make a place popular.

184
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:51,117
So we might need her design sense.

185
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:55,388
But if the head chef and sous-chef
both say no, then it's no good.

186
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,590
She didn't clean up anything
before she left.

187
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,327
But what if she makes a better dessert?

188
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:04,196
It might be tough with her current skills.

189
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:08,601
You never know what might happen
with a good mentor.

190
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,102
No way.

191
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:16,375
Even if we make something better,
Mr. Obana won't admit defeat.

192
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,044
I don't think that's true.

193
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,880
I've never been acknowledged by Mr. Obana.

194
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,749
He only acknowledges his own cooking.

195
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:26,819
{\an8}THREE YEARS AGO, ESCOFILLE

196
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:30,456
The consommé is too strong
and overpowers the lobster.

197
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,658
Try harder.

198
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:40,099
But Shohei, weren't you surprised
when you returned to Tokyo?

199
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,202
You were only just a trainee under Obana,

200
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:48,407
but when you joined the hotel,
you were better than the other chefs.

201
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:55,715
In the three years and six months
at Escofille, you grew the most.

202
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:59,452
You're now the head chef
responsible for the hotel restaurant.

203
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:03,823
How about it?

204
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:06,559
Don't you want to see?

205
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:15,367
How well the current you will fare
against Natsuki Obana?

206
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,008
This is our menu.

207
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:28,114
What kind of dish would you add
to the end of this course?

208
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:34,286
Nice! This'll get so many likes.

209
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,223
-Is that a new dessert?
-Huh?

210
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,327
No, it's just something I'm working on...

211
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:42,561
Wait a minute.

212
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,366
You think you'll beat Mr. Obana with this?

213
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,267
Huh?

214
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,470
You're a skilled chef, but...

215
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:53,906
Don't take cooking lightly.

216
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,908
Chef Hirako, what are you saying?

217
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:59,879
Desserts in a French restaurant
are part of the course.

218
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:03,415
They play an important role
in finishing the meal.

219
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:06,685
Have you looked at this menu?

220
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,021
It's not just Mr. Obana.

221
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:12,158
Multiple professional chefs
got together with their ideas

222
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:15,594
and spent time failing repeatedly
until they finally decided on that menu.

223
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,430
After these incredible dishes,

224
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:22,434
you can't just serve
this Mont Blanc drowned in liqueur.

225
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:26,238
You really are his apprentice.
You sound just like him.

226
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,742
I'm not his apprentice.
If we're doing this, we have to win.

227
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,643
What?

228
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,611
You can't win alone, so I'll help.

229
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:36,182
Who are you to decide that?
This is my competition.

230
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:37,416
This is our competition.

231
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:40,386
Answer me.

232
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,489
Oui, Chef...

233
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,357
{\an8}We'll go to one more place.

234
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:46,759
{\an8}FOUR DAYS UNTIL THE PRE-OPENING

235
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:47,660
{\an8}To buy more?

236
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,228
{\an8}Where did you park?

237
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,830
Go right!

238
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:51,564
Here it is.

239
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,165
There are so many types.

240
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,767
What are you going to buy?

241
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,468
-I'm picking yours.
-What?

242
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,437
You'll need your own knife soon.

243
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,507
What?! Are you finally acknowledging me?

244
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,244
I'm glad I worked hard.

245
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,047
I'll take this one.

246
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,717
Choose a petty knife.
Didn't you see me looking at them?

247
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:13,419
Those are the petty knives?

248
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,688
Then I'll take this one.

249
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,089
Try holding it.

250
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:20,059
When cutting, your fingers
shouldn't touch the blade.

251
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:24,630
Omiya and Namiki will handle
the hall and ingredients.

252
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,898
We're counting on you.

253
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,536
The table numbers
are one, two, three, four.

254
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:31,904
The large table is five.

255
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,739
Four mains for table five.

256
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:34,807
Oui, Chef.

257
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:38,010
-Be careful, it's dangerous.
-That's too narrow.

258
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:41,714
The flow between tables
six and seven is crowded.

259
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,149
-Should we widen it?
-Would that be better?

260
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,486
A personal knife is really different.

261
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,622
Treat your kitchen tools with care.

262
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:53,259
-And take good care of them.
-Don't worry, I'm doing that.

263
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,594
Because I was acknowledged by Mr. Obana.

264
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,566
-Hey!
-You startled me!

265
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,869
Don't just throw it away.
We could still use it.

266
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,170
Sorry.

267
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,108
It reminds me of when you taught Shohei.

268
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:10,910
If this was back then, I'd be kicking him.

269
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:16,048
I remember after being told off by Obana,
he made a dish with discarded vegetables.

270
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,316
Shohei's cheap dish.

271
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:18,550
Yes, that's it.

272
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:22,755
If you add fruit or vinegar,
the flavor of chestnuts disappears.

273
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:27,092
But without other ingredients,
it's just chestnuts.

274
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,696
There must be a way
to bring out the chestnut flavor.

275
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:34,833
Theoretically, dairy products
should be perfect for chestnuts.

276
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:38,904
This is it.

277
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,106
Not the shell. It's inedible.

278
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:45,311
We might be able to extract
the aroma and flavor. Let's try.

279
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,618
I'LL BE WORKING LATE, GO TO BED FIRST

280
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,930
{\an8}I want to bring out a bit more
of the chestnut aroma.

281
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,732
{\an8}TWO DAYS UNTIL THE PRE-OPENING

282
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,601
Can we make people taste
a different side of chestnuts?

283
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,839
How about using chestnut shell?

284
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:17,743
Interesting. The astringency could
enhance the sweetness of the chestnuts.

285
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,877
Let's try it.

286
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:19,778
Obana.

287
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:23,148
Look. Ms. Moe posted
a new chestnut dessert.

288
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,052
They're using chestnut shell
to bring out the aroma.

289
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:30,289
How did she come up with such an idea?

290
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,358
Ah! Maybe...

291
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:36,095
The only one who makes cheap dishes
with discarded ingredients is him.

292
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:39,131
A hotel buffet chef
sure has a lot of time.

293
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:43,302
Is it the guy named Shohei helping her?

294
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,540
Damn it...

295
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:02,054
<i>The astringency of the shell is there,
but can we bring out the chestnut more?</i>

296
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,390
<i>Did we overuse the sugar
to capture the tannins?</i>

297
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:09,028
No, the astringency is balanced,
but I want to enhance the aroma.

298
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:19,271
-Let's roast the chestnut shell.
-Roast it?

299
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:22,141
Then it might give off a nutty aroma.

300
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,592
{\an8}ONE DAY UNTIL THE PRE-OPENING

301
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,696
-This is it!
-Chestnuts!

302
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,534
It's completely different.

303
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,169
It's delicious.

304
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,171
Good.

305
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:56,408
This is amazing!
Like my mouth is filled with chestnuts!

306
00:17:56,475 --> 00:18:00,079
I'll leave the plating to you.
Is the recipe ready?

307
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:01,146
Huh?

308
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:02,414
It's your dish.

309
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:05,017
Yes, with this, I'm sure I can beat him.

310
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,518
Then go now.

311
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,087
At this late hour?

312
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:12,191
If it's those people,
they'll still be preparing.

313
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:27,072
{\an8}18 HOURS UNTIL THE PRE-OPENING

314
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,554
It seems almost done, but what's missing?

315
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:44,556
It's done.

316
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:55,000
It's a Mont Blanc. Please try it.

317
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,903
You took out the caramel.

318
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,554
You used roasted chestnut shell?

319
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:19,158
Yes, but why?

320
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:26,031
You managed to use
the aroma of roasted chestnuts.

321
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:33,739
It was created in an instant
with intuition and inspiration...

322
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:35,007
How is it?

323
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,716
Can you make 24 servings
for tomorrow's dinner?

324
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:48,820
I want to add this to our menu.
Can you do it?

325
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:56,495
That'll be easy.

326
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:57,863
Then let's do it.

327
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:00,132
What about the consommé?

328
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,234
We should add more red currant.

329
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,468
Moe, good job.

330
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,772
-Please do well tomorrow.
-Okay.

331
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,473
Also, pass this along.

332
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,177
Where did you put it?

333
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,012
Isn't it there?

334
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,084
It's delicious.

335
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:19,985
Serita.

336
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,588
Mr. Kakitani, what are you doing?

337
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,257
I'm heading home.
Did you just finish work?

338
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,692
Yes.

339
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:31,063
I'm a chef now but they had me
cleaning the exhaust fan until this late.

340
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:37,603
Tomorrow is the pre-opening.
I wonder how it will turn out.

341
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,306
I'm looking forward to it.

342
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:52,384
{\an8}PRE-OPENING DAY

343
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:05,631
Good morning.

344
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:10,202
You look pretty good.

345
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:11,637
Right?

346
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,477
It's gold?

347
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:21,179
Silver...

348
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,983
Damn Kyono... He used different colors.

349
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:28,587
You really hate losing?

350
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,056
Did you sleep well?

351
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,125
Yeah.

352
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:37,829
Well...

353
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,499
Shall we start?

354
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:45,437
Oui, Chef.

355
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:53,845
We have 24 guests today.

356
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:56,748
Mr. Sugita at table five
cannot eat celery,

357
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,818
and Mr. Kano at table ten
cannot drink alcohol.

358
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:02,721
The table flowers are dianthus flowers.

359
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,323
Their meaning is "boldness"

360
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:10,195
as a tribute to Ms. Rinko, who risked
everything to open this restaurant.

361
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,832
Ms. Rinko, please.

362
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,974
Somehow, we've reached this day.

363
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,144
It's thanks to all of you.
Thank you very much.

364
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:27,746
We haven't done anything yet.

365
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,384
That's right.
Ms. Linda will come today and...

366
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:38,423
If she gives a harsh review,
this place might close down.

367
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:43,995
But let's serve the dishes
we've prepared just as we've planned.

368
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:45,597
For the guests...

369
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,468
Let's make sure
they enjoy our masterpiece.

370
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:57,843
And one more thing,

371
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:00,178
I'll set the rules for Grand Maison Tokyo.

372
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:05,317
Whenever someone greets a guest
in the dining area,

373
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:08,086
let's all greet them together.

374
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,822
The same for when a guest is leaving.

375
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:15,827
It's an open kitchen, so
you'll be in the same space as the guests.

376
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,130
Let's serve with heartfelt hospitality!

377
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:19,364
Oui, Chef!

378
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:24,836
Let's serve the best dishes
and the best service,

379
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,738
just like always!

380
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:27,906
Let's do this!

381
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,777
Moe, relax!

382
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:33,879
Just focus on the dessert.

383
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,081
It'll be easy.

384
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,516
PRE-OPENING

385
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,222
-Thank you for waiting.

386
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:45,457
Welcome.

387
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,592
-Thank you.
-Be careful, it's steep.

388
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:55,233
I heard my pastry chef
is making the dessert.

389
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,636
Thank you for coming. Please, go ahead.

390
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:02,207
Welcome. I'll take care of your bag.

391
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,242
Thank you for coming.

392
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:05,811
I'm looking forward to it.

393
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:07,479
I'll take your coat over here.

394
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:14,486
Welcome!

395
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,188
Welcome!

396
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,058
All the guests have arrived.

397
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:24,162
Orders coming in.
Today's course is for 24 people.

398
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:26,398
Oui, Chef!

399
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:41,880

-Tables two and seven.

00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,264
Serita, please do the dishes.

Understood.

405
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,235

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,682

413
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:52,651
-Ready.
-I'll do the plating.

414

00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,126

Here.

429
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:23,942
Now, prepare the fish dish
before the main course.

430
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:26,444
Kakitani, bring out the sea urchin.

431
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,616
-Serita, call him.
-Yes.

432
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:34,586
Ms. Rinko!

433
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,088
Mr. Kakitani is missing!

434
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,292
Mr. Aizawa, please bring the sea urchin.

435
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,794
Got it.

436
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:47,732
Ooh la la!

437
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,302
It hasn't been prepared at all.

438
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,672
But Mr. Kakitani said he did it...

439
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:55,507
How could this happen?!

440
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:59,177
How could this happen?!

441
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:00,812
He's not answering his phone.

442
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:03,848
What about the guests?

443
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,853
Waiting more than 15 minutes
is unacceptable. What should we do?

444
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:22,467
We'll have to apologize
to the guests and remove this dish.

445
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,735
We can make it possible!

446
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:28,873
I won't remove one dish.

447
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:31,943
Everyone, help out.

448
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:35,447
-I'll help too.
-Don't touch it.

449
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,585
-Remove the innards.
-Okay.

450
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:49,794
Would you like more wine?

451
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:55,467
It's been handled.

452
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:57,402
Good job.

453
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,971
They won't be able to serve the fish.

454
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:03,108
Now Ms. Linda's harsh criticism
is coming for sure.

455
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,882
-Aizawa, fill this once you've washed it.
-Oui.

456
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,751
When will the next dish come out?

457
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,453
It'll be out soon.

458
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,598
Did something happen?
The fish dish is late.

459
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:29,567
There's a problem.
Preparing the sea urchin is taking time.

460
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:31,636
Are you preparing it now?

461
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,205
Won't you help?

462
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,173
What?

463
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,875
If you help, we can make it.

464
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,710
Don't be ridiculous.

465
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,078
Please!

466
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:42,213
Mr. Obana doesn't need me.

467
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,016
Then show that you're needed.

468
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:51,523
Obana is just too stubborn to admit it.

469
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:55,093
I know that he wants you here the most.

470
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,676
I'm helping so we can get to the dessert.

471
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,213
Where's the disinfectant?

472
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,514
It's over here.

473
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,586
-Serita.
-Yes?

474
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,787
Take this over there.

475
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:25,690
Shohei?

476
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,793
I'll put it here.

477
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,598
Don't remove the roe from the shell.

478
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,533
You don't need to tell me.

479
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,543
Amazing...

480
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:47,979
Serita, the tray and tweezers.

481
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:50,548
Yes, understood.

482
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,554
-Serita, take this.
-Yes.

483
00:30:56,621 --> 00:31:02,994
Shohei hated doing menial tasks
and wanted to be promoted quickly.

484
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:06,764
So he practiced preparation
more than anyone else.

485
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:10,702
Ms. Moe, focus on your task.

486
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:11,603
Yes.

487
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:38,096
-Chef.
-It's ready.

488
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:40,231
-The seasoning is done.
-I'll plate it.

489
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:41,132
Oui, Chef.

490
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:03,087
Thank you for waiting.

491
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:06,324

It's not gamey at all.

499
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:15,159
-Let's start from table five.
-Yes.

500
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:18,963
Excuse me.

501
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:20,865
Meringue ice cream.

502
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,400
Meringue ice cream.

00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:04,836
Thank you.

512
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:14,011
Thank you for visiting us today.

513
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:19,951
The fish dish was a bit delayed,
but the first day is always hectic.

514
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:21,185
Good work today.

515
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:24,355
Um, how did you like the dessert?

516
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:28,526
We worked hard to improve it for you.

517
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:29,794
For me?

518
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:34,866
Could you share your thoughts with
the person in charge of the dessert?

519
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:38,069
Sure.

520
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:44,442
Go.

521
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,750
The first dish that came out
was the meringue ice cream.

522
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:56,320
<i>It was misted with a strong brine.</i>

523
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:58,422
<i>The taste changed each time I ate it.</i>

524
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:02,226
The appearance was simple, but it was fun
and interesting till the end.

525
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:06,631
But the Mont Blanc à ma façon...

526
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:12,937
It was magnificent.

527
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,174
It was even better.

528
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:20,378
Did you use chestnut shell?

529
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:23,848
The roasted richness and astringency

530
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:27,451
were a great idea to enhance
the chestnut flavor and taste.

531
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:33,090
The aftertaste was refreshing,
making it a perfect finish.

532
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:36,994
Most of all,
the presentation was beautiful.

533
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:41,933
It was a great meal.

534
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:42,967
Thank you.

535
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,535
Thank you.

536
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:46,404
I'll be right back.

537
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,552
Your cooking has changed.

538
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,790
You, the selfish chef

539
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:10,294
who ruined the summit
and disappeared without a word to me...

540
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,631
Has there been a change of heart?

541
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:20,738
I think you might be mistaken.

542
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:27,812
That isn't my cooking.
It's Chef Rinko Hayami's food.

543
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:35,253
You hold her in quite high regard.

544
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,092
I hope you visit again.

545
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:49,934
Do you think I'll keep this place open?

546
00:37:53,404 --> 00:38:00,177
If I know Linda Machiko Richard,
she never lies about taste.

547
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:03,614
Take care.

548
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,996
It seems that
Ms. Moe's Mont Blanc was better.

549
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:25,169
Seems that way.

550
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:29,907
Mr. Obana acknowledged it.

551
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:33,377
I'm sorry!

552
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:43,220
Saying it was easy was a lie.

553
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:48,426
Actually, that Mont Blanc...

554
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,764
was a recipe created
with all of Chef Hirako's efforts.

555
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,569
Really? I see.

556
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:05,276
How hard you two worked was evident
the moment it touched my lips.

557
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,243
No.

558
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:10,214
I only made the shape.

559
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:15,286
I committed a big sin against all of you

560
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:18,189
who worked so hard for today.

561
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:22,259
I'm truly sorry.

562
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:27,465
But that Mont Blanc
was delicious and beautiful.

563
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:30,634
That's why Chef Rinko served it.

564
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:36,707
But diners don't care
about how much effort we put in.

565
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:41,846
The Mont Blanc made diners happy.

566
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:46,217
That's all that matters.

567
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,327
I said I could do this and that
with intuition...

568
00:39:58,562 --> 00:39:59,563
I'm sorry.

569
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:06,237
I...

570
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,174
want to study more.

571
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,078
I want to work harder.

572
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:17,848
So...

573
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:24,021
Please let me work here.

574
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:26,590
Please.

575
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:37,835
What will you do?

576
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:54,552
Our place will be quite tough.

577
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,527
-Thank you.
-Let's do our best.

578
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:25,749
It's identical to our recipe.
Shohei really is your apprentice.

579
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:30,054
What do you mean?
We use hazelnuts so ours is much better.

580
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,622
That's a matter of taste.

581
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:36,694
The presentation was enjoyable too.
Ms. Rinko made the right call.

582
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:40,231
Aren't you going to hire Shohei?

583
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:46,070
Your interest in Moe
was because of Shohei, wasn't it?

584
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:48,072
That's something he has to decide.

585
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:52,409
Thank you! You really saved us.

586
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:59,550
I finally understand
why Mr. Obana didn't acknowledge me.

587
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,887
I was just simply...

588
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:07,291
unable to make delicious dishes.

589
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:09,960
Try harder.

590
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:16,267
Obana said

591
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:19,970
that the quiche is a lot better.

592
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:22,406
What?

593
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:24,241
The quiche you improved.

594
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:26,911
He said the almonds were a great idea.

595
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,118
I see.

596
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:47,264
THANKS TO CHEF HIRAKO
WE MADE THE BEST DESSERT!

597
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:55,706
Yo.

598
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,143
Mr. Kakitani, why did you
suddenly disappear?

599
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:01,078
I have someone to introduce to you.

600
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:02,846
Huh?

601
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:06,350
Good evening.

602
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:08,819
Here is my card.

603
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,361
-Mr. Eto, you're the one bothering us...
-This contains 100,000 yen.

604
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:22,566
I'll pay you monthly if you give me
your new recipes and information.

605
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:26,070
You're frustrated because
of your tiny pay and late hours.

606
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:30,307
And you can't even
touch the ingredients, right?

607
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:31,208
Don't touch it.

608
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:36,914
Forget about the hard work.
Use this to blow off some steam.

609
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:38,749
Here, take it.

610
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:42,052
I'm telling you to take it.

611
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:05,809
<i>"Japan's rich..."</i>

612
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:08,145
<i>"Using Japan's rich ingredients,</i>

00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:14,652
"May shape new gastronomic..."

615
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:15,753
How do we translate this?

616
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:16,854
"Trends"?

617
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,956
"May shape new..."

618
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:21,458
{\an8}"...gastronomic trends."

619
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:23,861
{\an8}It's high praise.

620
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:27,831
{\an8}<i>The article about
Grand Maison Tokyo is creating a stir.</i>

621
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:29,967
{\an8}<i>The retweets have already
exceeded 30,000.</i>

622
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:30,868
{\an8}I see.

623
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:41,345
{\an8}Linda evaluated us properly.

624
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,615
{\an8}You should read to the end.

625
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:45,649
{\an8}<i>What?</i>

626
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:48,986
{\an8}<i>At the end, it mentions that Obana,
who caused</i>

627
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:55,959
{\an8}the allergy incident three years ago
in Paris, took the position of sous-chef.

628
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,367
{\an8}Why include something like that?

629
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:06,737
{\an8}<i>Perhaps the perpetrator who
introduced allergens three years ago...</i>

630
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:08,172
{\an8}VIOLENT CHEF

631
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:09,907
{\an8}...may strike again.

632
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:12,109
{\an8}You've been following them.
What do you think?

633
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:13,677
{\an8}<i>I think I've figured it out.</i>

634
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:16,113
{\an8}Who is it?

635
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:19,349
{\an8}The person who envies
Natsuki Obana the most.

636
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:35,199
{\an8}-Are you Mr. Natsuki Obana?
-Geez...

637
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:39,837
{\an8}I'd like to discuss the incident
in Paris three years ago.

638
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:43,574
{\an8}Who are you?

639
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:47,911
{\an8}I absolutely cannot
let that restaurant fail.

640
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:49,947
{\an8}-We'll sell curry.
-Curry?!

641
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:52,316
<i>Grand Maison Tokyo
is getting flamed online.</i>

642
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:54,351
I'm quitting the hotel and French cuisine.

643
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,152
You're helping me.

644
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:59,690
<i>If customers won't come to us,
how about we take it outside to sell?</i>

645
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:02,493
Wildly Delicious B-Grade Three-Star Curry!

646
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:05,295
<i>Grand Maison Tokyo isn't going anywhere.</i>

647
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:07,064
<i>Sell, sell. Sell as much as possible.</i>

648
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:09,233
This is getting interesting.

649
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,970
{\an8}<i>-Rinko!
-Call an ambulance!</i>
