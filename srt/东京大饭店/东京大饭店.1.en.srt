00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,417
{\an8}PARIS, FRANCE, 2015

2
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,157
{\an8}DAY OF THE FRANCE-JAPAN SUMMIT LUNCH

3
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:39,239
There are ten guests from France
and eight from Japan.

4
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:42,842
Minister Dejean of France
is allergic to nuts.

5
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:45,445
-Shohei, are there any nuts?
-They've been removed!

6
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:47,814
Today's flowers are daisies.

7
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:51,251
They're France's national flower
and also familiar to Japan.

8
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,892
Then, let's provide
the best cuisine and service.

9
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,493
As always!

10
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:02,762
Just like always.

11
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,085
Why all the fuss?

12
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,032
Hello.

13
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,068
-Hello, Chef.
-Hello.

14
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,939
Hello. Wash this.

15
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,613
Keep going.

16
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:55,482
-Does it look alright?
-Yes.

17
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,186
Why did you shell them?

18
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,621
They're easier to handle this way.

19
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,857
Do that in your own shop.

20
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:05,658
Again!

21
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:09,128
-But if we start now...
-They arrive in 30 minutes!

22
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:11,731
-What should we do?
-It may look bad but taste...

23
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,666
No! It must be done my way.

24
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:14,701
There's no time!

25
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,237
Get out.

26
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,141
What are you doing? Get out!

27
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,546
-Shohei, bring the sea urchin.
-There's no time.

28
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,293
They are arriving soon.

29
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,361
Got it.

30
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,840
Mr. President, this way please.

31
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,347
No!

32
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,725
-Okay?
-Okay!

33
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:13,626
Keep going!

34
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:22,835
-Here it is.
-Thank you.

35
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:49,429
All the guests have arrived.

36
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,067
I can't believe it.

37
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,035
We made it.

38
00:03:58,871 --> 00:03:59,739
Let's start!

39
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,741
Alright, Chef!

40
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:13,152
It's impromptu but not bad.

41
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:15,521
Hurry up.

42
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:20,994
We seasoned urchin with squid, buckwheat
and oil, and topped it with clam sauce.

43
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,068
Two plates are out.

44
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,134
THREE YEARS LATER

45
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,602
{\an8}INTERVIEW AT A MICHELIN
THREE-STAR RESTAURANT

46
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,671
{\an8}-Ms. Rinko Hayami.
-Yes.

47
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,173
You're almost 50 years old.

48
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:12,712
There are many young chefs
full of enthusiasm.

49
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:17,317
Age doesn't matter in cooking.

50
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,653
Thank you.

51
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,223
Why are you applying to us now?

52
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:28,294
Sorry, but...

53
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:30,997
My French is not very...

54
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,232
Bring someone who speaks Japanese.

55
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,076
Crap...

56
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:50,283
-The money!
-Excuse me!

57
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,785
What the...

58
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:56,989
There he is!

59
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,093
I can't believe this!

60
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,228
I want to work at this restaurant because...

61
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:38,831
She's Japanese.

62
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,402
I want to earn a Michelin star.

63
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:45,138
So, I came from Japan to start over

64
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:48,474
at the three-star restaurant, L'Ambroisie.

65
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,478
Are you seeking fame?

66
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,013
Yes.

67
00:06:56,315 --> 00:07:00,119
But is a Michelin star that important?

68
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:04,223
Isn't there something
more important in cooking?

69
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,658
That just sounds nice.

70
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:09,429
It's easy to say
Michelin stars don't matter...

71
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,597
but that's...

72
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:16,068
just an excuse
from chefs who can't earn stars.

73
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,905
But you haven't earned a star.

74
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:21,707
No matter how big you talk...

75
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:27,447
Why are you so obsessed with Michelin?

76
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:32,018
If you aim for newer
and tastier dishes as a French chef,

77
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,788
it's natural to aim for Michelin stars.

78
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,157
Taste standards vary by person.

79
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:43,663
To determine the best dish,
you need an objective standard.

80
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,265
In today's culinary world,

81
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:53,239
the most respected
and trusted standard is Michelin.

82
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,542
Then...

83
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,214
I have to compete for Michelin stars.

84
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:04,350
Please!

85
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:07,220
Test me.

86
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,601
As you wish.

87
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:25,605
Let's see your skills.

88
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,940
What about the other three?

89
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,242
Send them away.

90
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:30,443
Wait, that's not fair!

91
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,946
I don't want people
in my kitchen who scoff at others.

92
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:37,350
Please leave. Hurry up.

93
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,785
-Have a nice day, goodbye.
-Don't touch me.

94
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,054
-Sir, please...
-Excuse me!

95
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:44,557
Can I also have an interview?

96
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,627
Hello.

97
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,363
Mr. Villefort, please!

98
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,267
Please hire me again.

99
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:55,935
I'm begging you!

100
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:59,372
You're the only one I trust.

101
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,073
Please!

102
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,508
Let me cook.

103
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,877
There's no place for you here anymore.

104
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,581
Sir! Sir!

105
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:11,450
Sir!

106
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,723
-Wait!
-Get out!

107
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,710
Rinko!

108
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,914
Make an appetizer
that suits our restaurant.

109
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,951
-You have 30 minutes.
-Okay.

110
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:48,921
Use any ingredients you like.

111
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,891
Leo, it's a test. Help her.

112
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:52,825
Yes, Chef.

113
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,321
What is it?

114
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:35,501
-What are you doing?
-The test is an appetizer, right?

115
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:42,141
-I used to work here.
-What?

116
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:48,080
So, I know the chef's preferences
and the restaurant's concept.

117
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,683
Make an étuvée of langoustine.

118
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,451
In a pot with garlic and oil...

119
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,487
This is my test...

120
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:57,623
If you really want to work here,
make it my way.

121
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,659
Then you'll definitely get hired.

122
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:50,076
Use this nasturtium oil.
It's simple but goes very well.

123
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:56,215
-Why are you helping...
-Because there's no place for me here.

124
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:04,623
Good luck. If you get hired,
it's 100 euros for coaching.

125
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,658
Please leave!

126
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:10,663
It's a langoustine étuvée.
Make it exactly as I said.

127
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:13,733
Damn it!

128
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,267
Hey! Wait!

129
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,870
That trash is still here.

130
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,707
He looks familiar...

131
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:23,976
It's Natsuki Obana.

132
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,612
The Natsuki Obana from Escofille?

133
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:32,885
After that incident, he became a wreck.
No one wants to hire him.

134
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:38,691
<i>He's always causing trouble
with debt collectors and women.</i>

135
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,962
So, have you decided on the dish?

136
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:45,898
Yes.

137
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,349
You're eating my leaves?

138
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,952
I thought they would go well
with the fish dish.

139
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:09,989
Thank you.

140
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:17,129
So, you are Natsuki Obana from Escofille?

141
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,538
That's right, the 100 euros.
You passed, right?

142
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:28,541
You came to pay me.
Japanese people are so honest.

143
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:29,775
I failed.

144
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,343
No way.

145
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,345
<i>I made Foie Gras Poêlé.</i>

146
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,116
<i>It's the dish I'm best at.</i>

147
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:40,553
Idiot.

148
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,291
They said it has the basics
and tastes good but...

149
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,396
-The taste is one-dimensional.
-I understand.

150
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:55,000
They said I lack the experience
to work in their restaurant.

151
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:59,138
Everyone at L'Ambroisie is capable
of running their own restaurant.

152
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,608
But they praised one thing.

153
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,811
The nasturtium oil you made.

154
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:10,282
See? You should have done
what I told you to do.

155
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:15,654
The oil you made in 30 seconds

156
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:19,024
was better than my 30 years of cooking!

157
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,428
-Do you know how frustrating that is?
-I don't.

158
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:25,931
-Was it a lack of effort?
-I did my best!

159
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:32,805
I spent all day in the kitchen.
My hands are covered in blisters.

160
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:37,209
I would ache all over at night
because I worked so hard at cooking.

161
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,780
On holidays, I would visit farmers
to check the ingredients.

162
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:47,853
I spent all my salary going out to eat,
living a life obsessed with cooking.

163
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,022
For 30 years!

164
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,625
If you want to rant, do it elsewhere.

165
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,861
I'm here to taste your cooking!

166
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,297
What?

167
00:14:58,797 --> 00:14:59,798
Excuse me!

168
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,500
I'd like langoustine étuvée.

169
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,402
He will make it.

170
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:04,436
What do you mean?

171
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:08,507
I brought the ingredients,
and I'll pay 100 euros.

172
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,781
Let me eat a dish that
a three-star restaurant would approve of.

173
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,820
-Sir.
-Yes?

174
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:26,091
Can I use your kitchen?

175
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,227
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

176
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:37,129
This oil is simple but interesting.

177
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,331
Why didn't you use it?

178
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:40,899
<i>You're not accepted.</i>

179
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:42,368
<i>We don't need you.</i>

180
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,851
Langoustine étuvée.

181
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,721
Steamed langoustine.

182
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:06,625
Finished with nasturtium and saffron oil.

183
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,526
Bon appétit.

184
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:33,619
It's delicious...

185
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,227
It's so...

186
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:44,897
delicious!

187
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,937
Oh, come on, it's not something
to cry about, is it?

188
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,044
Why...

189
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:07,486
Why can't I make this?

190
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:47,359
-How did it feel?
-What?

191
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:51,763
When you got a Michelin star,
how did it feel?

192
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,366
Don't shout, it's embarrassing.

193
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:57,269
-It's the blood.
-Blood?

194
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:01,373
-Yeah.
-The lineage of the place I trained at.

195
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,310
Of course, I don't care about
Michelin stars either!

196
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:09,081
I'd like to say that working like crazy
for it is foolish!

197
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,483
But...

198
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:16,388
-Saying that means it's over.
-You sound like an old man.

199
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:20,225
Wait, what do you really think?

200
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:24,196
Didn't you say it in your interview?

201
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:31,303
"The most respected
and trusted standard is Michelin!" Right?

202
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:37,376
Honestly, I used to admire you.

203
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:42,281
Natsuki Obana, the Japanese chef
who earned two stars in France!

204
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,984
People said three stars
weren't just a dream for you!

205
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:48,887
But then...

206
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,358
You messed up.

207
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,698
That incident three years ago at
the summit with the allergic ingredient.

208
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,200
-Are there any nuts?
-They've been removed!

209
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:06,638
It was widely reported in Japan.

210
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:12,077
"The chef who ruined the important summit,
Natsuki Obana is a disgrace to Japan."

211
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:16,582
Hello, I'm a disgrace to Japan.

212
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:21,687
People who never even tasted your food
kept badmouthing you.

213
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:23,288
What?

214
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:28,360
I once visited Escofille with my mom.

215
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,395
<i>I still remember it.</i>

216
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:33,865
<i>The main dish was oxtail
braised in red wine sauce.</i>

217
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:38,370
<i>Oxtail marinated in red wine,
cognac, and mirepoix sauce.</i>

218
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:41,707
Stuffed with foie gras,
chestnuts, and croutons.

219
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:46,545
Seared just to brown the outside,
locking in the umami.

220
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,248
Then slowly baked in an oven at low heat.

221
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:52,284
The sauce was a marinade
with mignonette, right?

222
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,553
Wait a minute, what?

223
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,958
How do you know the recipe so precisely?

224
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,427
I've never taught anyone...

225
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,531
I'm confident in my palate.

226
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:12,070
Just by tasting, I can identify
the ingredients and cooking methods used.

227
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,140
But that's not enough.

228
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:17,943
I also aimed for stars.

229
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:26,318
But after 10 years in Tokyo,
I didn't earn even one star.

230
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:32,924
Then my mother, who lived with me,
passed away and I closed the restaurant.

231
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:40,032
But I couldn't give up
on the Michelin stars.

232
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:45,270
So I came to Paris to a three-star
restaurant to start over from scratch.

233
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:51,810
But after eating your langoustine étuvée,
I realized something.

234
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,148
Lineage doesn't matter.

235
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:00,352
I don't have the talent to...

236
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,790
earn stars.

237
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,894
Some dreams

238
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:13,865
are unattainable
no matter how hard you try...

239
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,471
Thank you,

240
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:22,641
for helping me realize that...

241
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,556
That's such a waste!

242
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,099
-Do you have any money?
-Not for you!

243
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:49,434
Would you like to open
a restaurant with me?

244
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:51,370
What?

245
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:58,310
I can't work at a Michelin-starred place,
but you want stars.

246
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:04,583
So you can open a restaurant,
and we can earn stars together.

247
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:07,953
But...

248
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:12,157
Together, let's create the best
grand maison in the world.

249
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:21,099
I'll make sure you earn those stars.

250
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:41,052
THE GOAL IS THE BEST
GRAND MAISON IN THE WORLD!

251
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:47,759
WHAT WILL THE MAN WHO LOST EVERYTHING
GAIN BY COOKING?!

252
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,408
What am I doing?

253
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:11,683
Including the flight, it's 300,000 yen.
I'll repay you when business goes well.

254
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:13,885
Hey.

255
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,755
What about living expenses?
Do you have a place?

256
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:19,224
It'll take six months
to open a restaurant.

257
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,460
I'll figure it out. Let's eat something.

258
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:26,431
Then, how about sushi, tempura, or udon?

259
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:28,767
No, I have a question...

260
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:35,574
Chez Yoshizumi in Nishi-Azabu
and Logis et Fleurs in Shirokane.

261
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,742
I confirmed that
an inspector was there last week.

262
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:41,146
Michelin representatives
will come this week.

263
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,083
There are 100,000 restaurants in Tokyo.

264
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,521
Last year, only 230 earned stars.
That's only 0.2%.

265
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:52,991
Of those, 55 were French,
and only three received three stars.

266
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:58,363
The only Japanese French restaurant
with three is Quintessence in Shinagawa.

267
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,365
No other restaurant
has achieved this since.

268
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:03,835
Who will lead the next generation
of French cuisine in Tokyo?

269
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:06,505
It's us.

270
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,642
Gaku, which earned
one star in its first year,

271
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:13,345
will earn three stars in two years.

272
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:18,517
Of course, being number one in Tokyo
will mean a special bonus.

273
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:22,320
But!

274
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:27,225
Never forget that once you earn stars,
you must never lose them.

275
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:33,532
If you lose a star,
the restaurant is completely finished.

276
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:39,037
Yes, there's a risk
that we can lose a star.

277
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:41,540
But we've been preparing for a year,

278
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,310
not to keep them, but to gain more.

279
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:48,747
We'll prove that
we're number one in Tokyo.

280
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:51,516
Let's earn those three stars together!

281
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,318
Oui, Chef!

282
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:59,491
Mr. Kyono, did you get information
on the inspectors?

283
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:04,496
It's a couple, one of them is a foreigner,
and they appear to be over 30 years old.

284
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:14,205
-I'm Hayami, I have a reservation.
-We're expecting you, please come in.

285
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,475
This is the best
French restaurant in Tokyo now.

286
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:22,147
If you know this place, you know
the cutting edge of French in Tokyo.

287
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:26,785
They have one star, but people say
they could get three stars this year.

288
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,594
Who is the chef?

289
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:39,497
World-renowned Chef Manabu Tango.

290
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:41,766
His taste and style are top-notch.

291
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:45,136
Tango will have a hard time
getting three stars.

292
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,772
-You know him?
-Yes...

293
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,041
Thank you for coming today...

294
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:50,942
Kyono!

295
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:52,944
Obana.

296
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:57,515
What's going on?
Why are you at Tango's restaurant?

297
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:00,652
Mr. Kyono!

298
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:12,030
-Wait a minute...
-I'll bring the menu.

299
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:17,135
They've arrived! The Michelin inspectors
are at table seven.

300
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,371
-Keep going!
-Oui, Chef!

301
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:21,373
-What did they order?
-Yokoyama!

302
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:22,941
-Kinmedai and lamb.
-And the wine?

303
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,676
They asked for a recommendation.

304
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:26,177
I'll handle the service.

305
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,748
My research was perfect.

306
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,884
<i>Catering to Michelin's taste
for innovation,</i>

307
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:36,521
<i>I got ingredients
from the tip of South America.</i>

308
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:39,758
With Tango's and my efforts combined,
we will surely earn stars.

309
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,260
My friend... Thank you.

310
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,164
Hey.

311
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:49,234
We came at an interesting time.

312
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,402
Excuse me.

313
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:55,040
We'll have the same dishes
as that table over there.

314
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:56,441
Yes, understood.

315
00:27:58,576 --> 00:27:59,577
Watch closely.

316
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:03,715
One of them will go to the restroom.

317
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,888
The woman will drop her napkin.

318
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:16,528
-How did you know?
-They must be Michelin inspectors.

319
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:17,862
What?

320
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,931
I'll bring a new one right away.

321
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:22,400
-No one knows their identity...
-I don't, either.

322
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:26,137
But they have specific behavior patterns.

323
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:30,842
And there's always information circulating
on restaurants with stars being visited.

324
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:33,812
They must have prepared,
thinking they'd come here soon.

325
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:38,817
{\an8}<i>One star, excellent cooking worth a stop
if you're nearby.</i>

326
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:43,254
<i>Two stars, excellent cooking
worth a detour.</i>

327
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:48,460
Three stars, exceptional cuisine
worth a special journey.

328
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:53,031
Thank you for waiting,
here is the monkfish liver terrine.

329
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:57,302
We made bubbles in monkfish liver
and soy milk and froze it.

330
00:28:57,368 --> 00:29:01,639
Please enjoy it with gooseberry puree
and oil infused with sea buckthorn.

331
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:08,747
This texture is new to me.

332
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,431
Of course, it's delicious.

333
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,833
<i>Sea urchin and chanterelle.</i>

334
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,302
<i>Golden eye snapper and flower pie.</i>

335
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:38,243
<i>Only at Gaku can you taste dishes that
bring out new charms of the ingredients.</i>

336
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:42,547
LIQUID NITROGEN COOKING.

337
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:45,550
{\an8}VACUUM COOKING

338
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,919
{\an8}FLASH FREEZING COOKING

339
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:52,757
FERMENTATION COOKING

340
00:29:56,361 --> 00:30:00,198
This is a jelly-like sheet
made only from dried plum juice.

341
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:03,501
-You can eat this with your hands.
-With my hands?

342
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:08,673
If you roll it up from the front,
you can enjoy it.

343
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:11,676
Dish five is out!

344
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,580
Chef, 20 minutes until the main course.

345
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,648
-Start the lamb.
-Yes!

346
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:22,654
LAMB SHOULDER, RED KIDNEY BEAN FLOWERS,
HACKBERRY CAPERS, GREAT MULLEIN

347
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,255
The main dish is ready.

348
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,962
Here comes the showdown.

349
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:36,835
-Thank you.
-Please come again.

350
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,237
It was delicious.

351
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:42,540
-Thank you.
-Remember what you said?

352
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:46,444
That all customers are equal...
Was that a lie?

353
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:51,583
The dishes served to the inspectors
were different from what we got.

354
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:55,854
Our plating was a mess
and lacked completeness, right?

355
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:02,961
And on top of it all,
Tango's cooking has changed.

356
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,330
It felt like eating
a chemistry experiment.

357
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:06,664
Mr. Obana!

358
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:11,169
-What?
-It was actually quite good, right?

359
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:15,773
When you silently look at the ceiling,
it means you acknowledge the dish.

360
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,345
Meeting you, Kyono, was good.

361
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:24,148
I'm going to open a restaurant with her.

362
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,018
Would you like to join us?

363
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,922
If we work together, we can
surpass a place like this in a year.

364
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:36,394
You talk big, don't you?
Don't you know what happened afterward?

365
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:37,295
Hey, Kyono.

366
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:42,400
Are you satisfied with Tango's cooking
served to customers?

367
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:46,838
You said you wanted to see
the happy faces of the customers.

368
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,373
So then my cooking...

369
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:53,378
What are you doing? I'm still a customer.

370
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:57,982
Don't come again.

371
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,556
Don't even think about opening
a restaurant with him.

372
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:06,624
This guy...

373
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,529
is the worst person ever.

374
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:35,920
You're hated by a lot of people.

375
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:42,327
What are you doing?

376
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:49,000
It stings a bit
but I think it can be used.

377
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:53,204
-Do you always do this?
-What do you want for breakfast tomorrow?

378
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:55,640
-What?
-We don't have money...

379
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,610
Can I stay with you for a while?

380
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:04,449
-What?
-I'll make you delicious meals.

381
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:05,616
Hey.

382
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:09,187
Don't you mock me just because
I'm middle-aged!

383
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:11,656
What woman would let a stranger stay over?

384
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:13,257
A stranger?

385
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:17,495
We're partners
who will work at the same restaurant.

386
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:23,034
Absolutely not!

387
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:28,006
This is nice, I feel at ease.

388
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:29,874
-Don't you have friends?
-No.

389
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:31,242
-Family?
-Far away.

390
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:35,146
You can stay tonight,
but don't plan on staying...

391
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:36,147
Good night.

392
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,955
Will the Michelin rating be alright?

393
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:48,826
We provided our usual quality
of food and service.

394
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:54,132
Since the inspection is over, tomorrow,
lower the grade of the pairing wines.

395
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:59,404
Wine has the highest profit margin,
so lowering the cost will mean profit.

396
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:02,740
We are the ones picking
what wine to pair with the meals.

397
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:05,376
No one will complain
if the wine tastes a bit different.

398
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,578
-But that's...
-Mr. Kyono.

399
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:12,650
<i>Gaku is very special
among our restaurants.</i>

400
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:18,723
<i>We hired Chef Tango, who has great
pedigree, and use premium ingredients.</i>

401
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,325
We aimed for stars and expected deficits.

402
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:26,230
At least when Michelin is not involved,
you need to boost sales here too.

403
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:27,265
Good job.

404
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:05,002
-Good morning.
-Don't bother me, just get dressed.

405
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:09,574
You're really in the way.

406
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:18,950
Grilled salmon and tamagoyaki,
kabosu miso soup and shiitake mushrooms.

407
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:23,821
I'll have rice and the miso over there...
Oh, I threw them out because of mold.

408
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:26,357
I'll have the pickles.

409
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:30,761
-Why are you eating Japanese food?
-I eat Japanese food when I'm back.

410
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:38,703
Thank you for the food.

411
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,513
<i>-He's good at cooking Japanese, too.</i>
-Thank you for the food.

412
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,181
Amazing.

413
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,726
Japanese rice is the best.

414
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:05,763
<i>What will you do?</i>

415
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:11,135
We can't run a small restaurant
if we want to earn Michelin stars.

416
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:14,906
Be careful with the fire and knives
when you start.

417
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:15,907
Yes!

418
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,549
So you're alive.

419
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:28,486
I watched your recipe videos
a few times in Paris.

420
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:31,923
Are you here for an autograph?

421
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:37,094
I'm here to introduce a woman.
This is Rinko Hayami and she's single.

422
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:38,095
You...

423
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:41,399
I'm Kamehito Aizawa.
Are you a chef, Ms. Rinko?

424
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:45,002
-Huh?
-There's nothing on your nails.

425
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,640
-It's a badge of honor.
-Impressive.

426
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,510
I've decided to open
a restaurant with her.

427
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:55,646
-It's not decided yet...
-Would you like to join us?

428
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:00,451
Ms. Rinko, do you have money?

429
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:02,453
What?

430
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,556
Didn't he ask you that question first?

431
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:12,730
Indeed, Natsuki Obana
will do anything for cooking.

432
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:16,167
And he's good at charming women,
so be careful.

433
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:19,003
Won't you...

434
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:22,707
join us?

435
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:25,876
Of course, the answer is absolutely no.

436
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,748
Don't let him fool you.

437
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:43,060
Good morning.

438
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,835
-Should we go with cold dish three today?
-Two.

439
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:52,637
-Prepare for three as backup.
-Okay.

440
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:54,372
-More of the skin-side.
-Yes.

441
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:58,476
-Good morning!
-Good morning.

442
00:37:58,542 --> 00:37:59,777
-Can I take this?
-Yes.

443
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,412
I'll take it.

444
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:04,348
-Hey.
-Yes?

445
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:07,351
How many times do I have to tell you?

446
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:10,254
It's unacceptable for the newbie
to be the last one here.

447
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:12,123
I'm on time.

448
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:16,560
And I'll make sure everything is ready
before the opening.

449
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:31,709
She makes me absolutely angry.

450
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:37,315
-Hey.
-Mr. Kyono.

451
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:39,717
Mr. Obana?

452
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,355
He's planning to open a new restaurant.

453
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:46,590
Why would he open a restaurant now?

454
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:50,995
Shohei, even if he asks you to join,
make sure you refuse.

455
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:55,833
Of course,
you introduced me to this place.

456
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:59,403
-How is it?
-Going smoothly.

457
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:02,440
I'm in charge of the hotel's
buffet corner.

458
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:06,644
Really? And what about the other thing?

459
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,081
You said you were thinking
about marriage last time.

460
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:15,353
Yes... That's going smoothly too.

461
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:18,356
If you plan to have a family,

462
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:20,224
all the more reason
not to work with Obana.

463
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,260
Why are you worried?

464
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:26,464
You used to admire Obana more than anyone...

465
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,366
I've given up on that trash.

466
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:35,139
Is it Michelin?

467
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:40,544
Is it Michelin?

468
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,814
-Gaku here, how can I help you?
-No.

469
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,716
That's the reservation line.

470
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:48,219
Michelin calls come to this line.

471
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:51,956
What do you think about food?

472
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:55,559
I have nothing to say
about the chef's cooking.

473
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:59,597
I'd like to hear the opinion of Mr. Kyono
who earned two stars in Paris with Obana.

474
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:07,405
At Gaku, Owner Eto researches everything
from ingredients to cooking methods.

475
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:09,707
We make dishes solely to earn stars.

476
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:15,312
Working under the owner
means you're ultimately under Obana.

477
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:20,084
Obana can't accept
other people's opinions.

478
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:21,919
That's a great talent

479
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,256
that only you have, which Obana doesn't.

480
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:30,127
Let me know if Michelin calls.

481
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:32,897
What will you do?

482
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:37,968
We need Kyono to gather people.

483
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:39,236
Hey.

484
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:40,671
Is Mr. Kyono that important?

485
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,573
He's essential for our restaurant!

486
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:45,776
Who in the world are you?

487
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:47,344
Oh, uh, yes.

488
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:49,647
I'm Koichi Serita. I saw your job posting.

489
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:51,282
Job posting?

490
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:53,350
You did that?

491
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:55,519
Starting the best grand maison
in the world is amazing.

492
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,956
Dreaming big is my passion.

493
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:02,493
I'll dedicate my life to it.
Please hire me!

494
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,930
-First job?
-I worked at a pub for six months.

495
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:07,598
I'm good at omelet yakisoba.

496
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:09,333
-Hired!
-Really?

497
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,569
-Nice enthusiasm. Give me your number.
-Mr. Obana!

498
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:12,937
Seriously? Thank you!

499
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:17,808
But it hasn't been decided
that we will be opening a restaurant.

500
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:21,612
But we will.
We'll call you when we're ready.

501
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,514
Understood, I'll be waiting.

502
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:28,052
Let's aim for the top together. Thank you!

503
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:32,823
-We got one person.
-He's just part-time.

504
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:36,160
Find a part-time job yourself.

505
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,862
How long are you going to stay here?

506
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:52,476
KYONO

507
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:07,157
OXTAIL, PORK NECK, PIGEON WINGS,
DUCK DRUMSTICKS, CHICKEN WING TIPS

508
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:12,196
-I'll cut it.
-So fancy!

509
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:13,697
It looks amazing!

510
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:19,169
PIGEON INNARDS, GARLIC, ANISE, CARDAMOM
FENNEL, CORIANDER, WALNUT, CARAWAY, ONION

511
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,606
-Did you have fun today?
-Yeah.

512
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:35,085
Mr. Kyono, Mr. Kyono!

513
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:38,422
What's with this wine list?

514
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:39,857
The cost is reduced.

515
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:43,294
A cost ratio of 25%
on average is nonsense.

516
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,829
But the average wine cost ratio
is around 50%.

517
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:49,900
Below 25% is difficult. Lowering it more
is disrespectful to our patrons.

518
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:53,470
You're talking like a newbie.

519
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:56,140
You'll never make money like that.

520
00:42:56,206 --> 00:43:00,411
The 10-year survival rate for
high-end restaurants is just one percent.

521
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:03,480
You have to do things to survive.

522
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:08,218
Are you saying
we should deceive the customers?

523
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:11,288
It's not deception, it's for management.

524
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:14,391
I've revised the wine list,
so use this one.

525
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,527
Use it.

526
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:31,709
-Excuse me.
-Whoa!

527
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:35,346
-Sorry to startle you.
-You're the one who was with Obana...

528
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,983
I need to discuss
something about Mr. Obana.

529
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:42,219
-What's going on?
-He refuses to leave my house.

530
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:45,422
Please do something about it.
I'm begging you.

531
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:46,991
Should I eat some myself?

532
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,026
Come in.

533
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,166
-I brought him.
-Thanks, please have a seat.

534
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:57,968
What's going on?

535
00:43:58,035 --> 00:44:02,973
I see you're still the same,
helping women in trouble.

536
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:08,045
-Did you deceive me?
-No, I didn't lie.

537
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:12,316
He threatened to stay forever
unless I brought you here.

538
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:13,917
You are...

539
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:18,255
-Don't involve innocent people...
-What are you saying? We're partners.

540
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:22,059
Eat up, it's an apology meal.

541
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:23,827
An apology meal?

542
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:27,231
A chef apologizes through their cooking.

543
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:28,999
It means he doesn't
really want to apologize.

544
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,271
-Is that...
-A staff meal?

545
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,806
Yeah.

546
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:38,942
We ate this often
while studying together in Paris.

547
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,577
It's his favorite.

548
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:44,848
Did you also train
at L'Ambroisie, Mr. Kyono?

549
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:46,016
That's all in the past.

550
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:50,654
This is couscous à la maison
with five types of meat.

551
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:51,822
Bon appétit.

552
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:55,426
Have a seat.

553
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:10,641
It smells a bit.

554
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,043
How about adding some yuzu?

555
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:17,047
Don't criticize a dish full of memories.

556
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:20,951
But it's a tomato dish with spices
like anise and cardamom.

557
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:24,688
Seasoned with garlic and meat broth.

558
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:27,324
It would go well with yuzu!

559
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:31,762
-Women are different indeed.
-Men like it as it is!

560
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:34,698
That's because you were both young.

561
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:38,802
Now it would taste much better with yuzu.

562
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:42,473
And since we're eating in Japan...

563
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:45,242
-Rice would be better than couscous.
-That's nonsense.

564
00:45:48,378 --> 00:45:50,280
You can't convince him.

565
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:54,718
He never listens to anyone's opinion
about cooking.

566
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:59,790
Why did you quit being a chef, Mr. Kyono?

567
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:06,430
Let's say you're using eggs and butter.

568
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:10,267
Even if you make an omelet
with the same ingredients and method,

569
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:14,037
for some reason, the taste varies
depending on who makes it.

570
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,106
-It's really mysterious.
-Yes.

571
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:19,543
While studying in France,

572
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:24,915
I realized something after eating a dish
of an arrogant junior from Japan.

573
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:31,155
No matter how hard I tried, there were
things I could never surpass.

574
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:32,689
<i>That junior...</i>

575
00:46:32,756 --> 00:46:35,392
<i>Manabu Tango was also at L'Ambroisie.</i>

576
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,994
Lacks sweetness?

577
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,997
It's seafood, so you can add acidity
with vinegar.

578
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:43,700
<i>With such people rising up,
there was no place left for me.</i>

579
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:46,136
So I gave up being a chef.

580
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:50,774
Then he started Escofille with me.

581
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:56,747
<i>He managed the staff, accounts,
public relations, the dining hall,</i>

582
00:46:56,814 --> 00:47:03,554
<i>the wine, the paint on the restroom door,
and even the apprentices' aprons.</i>

583
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,322
<i>He managed everything perfectly.</i>

584
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:10,928
Kyono is a chef who trained with me
at L'Ambroisie.

585
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:17,034
He knows cooking better than anyone
and loves cooking like a fool.

586
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:21,839
I wanted to make Escofille

587
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:24,641
the best restaurant in the world.

588
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:31,381
I thought I could
achieve that dream with him.

589
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:37,087
There's not a man on Earth other than
Rikutaro Kyono who could make it happen.

590
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:54,204
-What's this?
-300,000 yen.

591
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:58,208
-You had that kind of money?
-You took out a loan for Escofille, right?

592
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,510
You took it all on yourself.

593
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:06,183
After I ran away, you were neck deep
in debt and asked Tango for help...

594
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:09,253
So you joined Tango's restaurant.

595
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:15,692
Settle it with this. Then we can...

596
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:16,994
Don't be ridiculous!

597
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:22,366
This isn't enough! You ruined everything!

598
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:48,292
<i>A chef is responsible for all their food!</i>

599
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:52,829
Using an ingredient that caused an
allergic reaction was your responsibility!

600
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:56,967
And if you hadn't hit that diplomat,

601
00:48:57,034 --> 00:49:01,505
<i>it would have been a minor incident and
the restaurant would've survived, but...</i>

602
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:06,977
You hit him for a trivial reason,
without thinking of others!

603
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:11,148
That's right.

604
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:14,985
I hit him because he insulted my cooking.

605
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:25,729
Do you think I could start over
with such a selfish person?

606
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,532
Right? Hey!

607
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:33,670
Running a restaurant
means entrusting your life to the chef!

608
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:37,975
Do you expect me to entrust
my life to you again?

609
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:39,176
Don't be ridiculous!

610
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:43,146
It's not just about the money!

611
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:48,385
Eto, the owner, helped me!
I need to repay that debt!

612
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:52,656
I can't quit Gaku for someone like you!

613
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:03,266
Let's give up.

614
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:07,104
It's impossible.

615
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,772
We're just beginning.

616
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:21,952
Mr. Kyono.

617
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,555
I need to talk to you.

618
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:29,926
This female chef visited our restaurant.

619
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:35,866
I heard the man
she came here with spoke to you.

620
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:38,168
Did they offer you a job?

621
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:43,974
Yes, but I declined.

622
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,876
I have work to do. Excuse me.

623
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:49,646
Why did this woman come to see you?

624
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:55,318
Who is the man that came with her?

625
00:50:58,789 --> 00:50:59,790
It was Obana.

626
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,494
Natsuki Obana.

627
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:11,201
Obana is in Tokyo?

628
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:16,573
Isn't he the allergy chef
called a disgrace to Japan?

629
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:19,576
This is very interesting.

630
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:25,282
He's thinking of opening a restaurant
with her, but that's absurd.

631
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,718
No one will work with him.

632
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:39,996
I brought you some job listings.

633
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:41,932
It's time for you to leave my house...

634
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,002
I'VE GONE TO LOOK FOR
A PLACE FOR THE RESTAURANT

635
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:54,077
I've seen you in magazines many times.

636
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,317
They called it
French home cooking by a woman.

637
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:02,119
It was delicious.

638
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:06,923
Would you like to work here?

639
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:08,692
Pardon?

640
00:52:08,758 --> 00:52:12,496
If you come here, I will teach you
all my knowledge and skills.

641
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:16,133
I plan to open a branch
in Singapore eventually.

642
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:19,769
If you do well,
I could let you run that restaurant.

643
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:27,477
Are you worried about Natsuki Obana?

644
00:52:28,745 --> 00:52:31,781
-How did you know?
-Mr. Kyono told me.

645
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,385
He said you're being deceived.

646
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:39,222
You don't need to worry about Mr. Obana.

647
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:42,526
Head-hunting is common in this industry.

648
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,729
It's standard practice.

649
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:48,598
I won't insist.

650
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:52,269
But I sincerely want to work with you.

651
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:58,308
<i>Give me some time to think about it.</i>

652
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:02,546
Do you really need to go this far?

653
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:06,616
Obana and I learned to cook
together at L'Ambroisie.

654
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:09,486
A chef with the same pedigree
in a restaurant in Tokyo

655
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:11,121
would be bad for Gaku.

656
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:15,992
But sending someone so inexperienced
as the chef of another branch...

657
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:17,861
<i>I can't agree with that.</i>

658
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:19,229
<i>It's a temporary measure.</i>

659
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:21,631
<i>There are plenty of young
and talented chefs.</i>

660
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:24,367
If she's not good enough,
you can fire her.

661
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:41,351
Welcome home.

662
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:43,820
How did you get in?

663
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:45,722
The kitchen door was open.

664
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:49,826
More importantly, I found a good place.
Let's go check it out together.

665
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:55,665
Don't come in uninvited!

666
00:53:57,968 --> 00:53:58,969
Sorry.

667
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:02,906
I really wanted to cook.

668
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:06,876
Mr. Obana,
are you looking for a part-time job?

669
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:08,111
Not yet.

670
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:11,414
I asked you to leave as soon as possible.

671
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:15,252
What kind of person do you think I am?

672
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:20,257
An old maid who lets you stay for free?
A good source of money?

673
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:24,628
You're my partner
for creating the best grand maison.

674
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:27,697
That's just a fantasy...

675
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:31,468
No one wants to work with you.

676
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:34,337
Everyone talks badly about you
wherever you go!

677
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:39,509
It's impossible to create
the best grand maison!

678
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,444
I'm a disgrace to Japan too.

679
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,047
Stop joking.

680
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:45,615
I...

681
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:51,087
have been walking this path for 30 years.

682
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:53,456
So I know

683
00:54:54,524 --> 00:54:59,462
that you couldn't really consider
an untalented chef

684
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:01,931
like me as partner...

685
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:07,604
But I respected you.

686
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:12,976
So I got excited without thinking.

687
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:20,383
But I've had enough of this fantasy.

688
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:21,918
Just now, Mr. Tango offered me a job.

689
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:30,960
He said he would hire me.

690
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:32,562
I'm going to accept his offer.

691
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:41,304
I see.

692
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:43,340
This is over.

693
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:46,576
Please leave!

694
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:10,533
When you ate the shrimp étuvée...

695
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:19,976
It's delicious...

696
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:28,284
It's so...

697
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,388
delicious!

698
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:41,097
<i>It reminded me
of when I first started cooking.</i>

699
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:47,303
<i>How happy I was just to hear
someone say it was delicious...</i>

700
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:52,542
<i>That's why I chose you as my partner.</i>

701
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:56,546
After eating my food,

702
00:56:56,613 --> 00:57:02,218
no one has ever understood it
as perfectly as you did.

703
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:06,756
You have talent.

704
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:15,131
If you have trouble at Tango's,
please discuss it with Kyono.

705
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:59,943
<i>It would go well with yuzu!</i>

706
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:01,511
That's nonsense.

707
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:05,949
You really aren't good at being honest.

708
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:20,563
Hello. This is Restaurant Gaku.

709
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:22,332
Thank you for always supporting us.

710
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:24,767
Yes.

711
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:27,570
I see.

712
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:31,407
Understood. Goodbye.

713
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:37,547
From Michelin.

714
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:39,115
The stars?

715
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:42,018
They gave us two stars!

716
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:45,088
Hooray!

717
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,024
Let's celebrate today.

718
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:51,528
Even though we're not open yet,
one drink won't hurt!

719
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:54,230
Everyone, great job!

720
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:59,302
We didn't get three stars, but two
in two years is a great achievement.

721
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,437
Take pride in two stars and work hard!

722
00:59:01,504 --> 00:59:03,139
Oui, Chef!

723
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:11,614
You came at the perfect time.

724
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:15,685
We just got a call from Michelin.
We got two stars.

725
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:21,457
I see. Congratulations.

726
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:24,260
Have you decided?

727
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:25,695
Yes.

728
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:29,465
Everyone, we have a new colleague.

729
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:30,833
Welcome.

730
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:36,673
What is this?

731
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:40,643
It's ten million yen.

732
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:44,747
With this...
I'm paying off Mr. Kyono's debt.

733
00:59:45,481 --> 00:59:48,384
-Ms. Rinko!
-If it's not enough, I'll pay more.

734
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:50,720
-What are you talking about?
-I've come to...

735
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:54,190
take Mr. Kyono from this restaurant.

736
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:59,862
That's quite a joke.
Do you think this will be tolerated?

737
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:03,266
Head-hunting is common in this industry.

738
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:07,303
-It's a standard practice.
-How dare you take me lightly?

739
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:10,573
Don't underestimate me
because I'm a woman.

740
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,508
Just because you're paying off his debt,

741
01:00:12,575 --> 01:00:17,480
do you think Mr. Kyono will
go with an unknown chef like you?

742
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:22,685
Mr. Kyono, you wouldn't be so foolish
as to return to that man, would you?

743
01:00:24,153 --> 01:00:24,988
No.

744
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:30,393
I know how frustrated you were
when you had to give up being a chef.

745
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:36,032
I've always been obsessed with stars.

746
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:40,503
I believed if I worked hard enough,
I'd get a star.

747
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:45,541
But when I ate Mr. Obana's shrimp étuvée,

748
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:50,113
I felt an insurmountable
difference in skill.

749
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:52,882
And I decided to quit being a chef.

750
01:00:54,717 --> 01:00:56,052
Then he said,

751
01:00:57,186 --> 01:00:58,554
"We can earn the stars together."

752
01:00:58,621 --> 01:01:00,456
<i>We can earn stars together.</i>

753
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:03,159
Let's create the best
grand maison in the world.

754
01:01:03,226 --> 01:01:04,861
Together...

755
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:08,965
let's create the best
grand maison in the world.

756
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,735
What nonsense is this?

757
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:16,239
You sound like students
opening a food stall at a festival.

758
01:01:21,377 --> 01:01:25,648
Hearing those words made me want to try.

759
01:01:27,116 --> 01:01:30,453
You know better than anyone
how Mr. Obana is, right?

760
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:35,958
Natsuki Obana's cooking
has the power to move people.

761
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:44,167
<i>Honestly, like you said, Mr. Kyono,
Mr. Obana is the worst.</i>

762
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:47,937
<i>He's reckless, does things half-heartedly
and never listens to anyone's opinion.</i>

763
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:53,042
<i>But I think he's just clumsy.</i>

764
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:57,413
<i>A person who is rotten to the core</i>

765
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:01,217
<i>can't make such delicious food!</i>

766
01:02:01,284 --> 01:02:03,886
-I'm really sorry.
-Who did this?

767
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,195
It's all my responsibility.

768
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:15,865
Hand over the work visas
and passports of the staff.

769
01:02:16,499 --> 01:02:18,601
Most of them are immigrants, right?

770
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:20,536
Have you assessed their ideologies?

771
01:02:20,603 --> 01:02:21,838
What do you mean by that?

772
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:25,041
They could be planted terrorists.

773
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:28,678
Are you suspecting my staff?

774
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:34,283
There might be someone
linked to such organizations.

775
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:36,853
Say that again!

776
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:42,658
Don't act so high and mighty
with such rotten thinking!

777
01:03:02,678 --> 01:03:06,215
<i>Honestly, I don't know how it'll turn out.</i>

778
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,117
But I can tell you this.

779
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:10,119
Every dish served at our restaurant

780
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:14,957
will be something you can recommend
to diners with confidence.

781
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:22,064
I promise to only make dishes
you can proudly present to diners.

782
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:24,834
You know nothing about management!

783
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:29,338
Mr. Kyono, would you start
a restaurant with me and Mr. Obana?

784
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:30,373
Mr. Kyono!

785
01:03:30,439 --> 01:03:33,009
Please lend us your strength. I beg you!

786
01:03:33,075 --> 01:03:36,779
Mr. Kyono, you know
what kind of person he is.

787
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:04,574
This is trespassing!

788
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:06,275
What?

789
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:09,779
You didn't go to Tango's?

790
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,347
You're one to talk!

791
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:17,386
You knew that leaving that dish
would bring me here.

792
01:04:18,387 --> 01:04:22,525
-Crafty old man.
-Stupid old woman who came knowingly.

793
01:04:26,495 --> 01:04:28,030
There's one more.

794
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:29,632
One more?

795
01:04:37,673 --> 01:04:39,308
I'm not here for you.

796
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:43,646
Ms. Rinko paid off the debt.

797
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:46,616
I'm going to work for her now.

798
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:55,691
I did good, right?
You should try complimenting people.

799
01:04:58,928 --> 01:04:59,929
Say it out loud.

800
01:05:02,531 --> 01:05:05,501
Is this place about 40 <i>tsubo</i>?
What's the rent?

801
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,003
-500,000 yen.
-Cheap.

802
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:08,671
Isn't it too far from the station?

803
01:05:09,772 --> 01:05:12,575
Ah, I see.

804
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:14,644
But rather than accessibility...

805
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:18,681
A place to enjoy food away from daily life

806
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:21,817
suits our restaurant better, right?

807
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:26,722
Right, customers who come
will definitely return.

808
01:05:27,523 --> 01:05:30,126
We'll offer cuisine and service
that make this possible.

809
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:33,596
What will the restaurant's name be?

810
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:34,664
Me?

811
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:37,700
We couldn't have started without you.

812
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,769
You should decide.

813
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:44,807
Grand Maison Tokyo.

814
01:05:44,874 --> 01:05:49,312
-And the concept?
-The world's best grand maison in Tokyo!

815
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:52,014
-I guess that's fine.
-What's with that tone?

816
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:55,051
You'll really get the stars, right?

817
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:56,152
What do you mean?

818
01:05:56,218 --> 01:05:58,721
You're the one who'll get the stars.

819
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:02,525
The head chef of Grand Maison Tokyo
is Rinko Hayami.

820
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:05,161
-Obana...
-We can't use my name.

821
01:06:05,227 --> 01:06:09,532
And I promised I'd help you get stars.

822
01:06:10,266 --> 01:06:13,002
So I'll get my first star in Tokyo...

823
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:14,203
Three stars.

824
01:06:15,204 --> 01:06:16,706
The goal is three stars.

825
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,743
No way, no way...

826
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:21,811
No!

827
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:25,414
Rinko Hayami's restaurant
Grand Maison Tokyo

828
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:29,251
will be the new three-star
French restaurant.

829
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:43,933
{\an8}Fresh and good.

830
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,901
{\an8}Next is the red fish?

831
01:06:47,603 --> 01:06:49,071
<i>Yes?</i>

832
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:52,942
{\an8}-I'm Kuzumi.
-You're a famous food journalist, right?

833
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:56,379
I'm preparing a feature on
restaurants opening in Tokyo next year.

834
01:06:56,445 --> 01:07:00,983
I came today to introduce myself.
I look forward to working with you.

835
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:03,652
{\an8}-Hello?
<i>-This is Kuzumi.</i>

836
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:06,589
{\an8}<i>I heard Natsuki Obana
is really opening a restaurant.</i>

837
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:08,290
{\an8}Really?

838
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:10,559
{\an8}Not tired after all that?

839
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:13,896
{\an8}<i>The nut incident 3 years ago?</i>

840
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:15,431
{\an8}That was an attempted murder.

841
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:20,069
{\an8}<i>Someone deliberately put
allergic ingredients in there.</i>

842
01:07:20,936 --> 01:07:23,606
{\an8}Someone will try to take him down again.

843
01:07:25,741 --> 01:07:29,145
{\an8}The person called a disgrace to Japan
is buying ingredients in Tokyo.

844
01:07:29,845 --> 01:07:31,914
{\an8}-Who is he?
-Just someone I know.

845
01:07:31,981 --> 01:07:33,682
{\an8}How is Mr. Kyono doing?

846
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:38,621
{\an8}You're lavishly indulging
in chemical experiments.

847
01:07:38,687 --> 01:07:40,756
{\an8}-Where did you get that?
-We got two stars.

848
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:46,529
{\an8}You're happy now that
you've gotten to where I am?

849
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:47,563
{\an8}Not because of that.

850
01:07:48,264 --> 01:07:51,734
{\an8}I earned two stars here in Tokyo
where evaluation

851
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:53,602
{\an8}is stricter than in Paris.

852
01:07:57,873 --> 01:07:58,974
{\an8}I look forward...

853
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:02,311
{\an8}to the new challenge you bring.

854
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:04,947
I'm looking forward to it too.

855
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:08,317
The next Michelin review...

856
01:08:19,695 --> 01:08:21,564
You're being treated like baggage?

857
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:24,300
This one dish has that much value!

858
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:26,602
I really want to open this restaurant.

859
01:08:26,669 --> 01:08:28,304
Do it like your life depends on it!

860
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:30,106
<i>I have to pick her up,
so I can't join you.</i>

861
01:08:30,172 --> 01:08:33,642
<i>Obana will definitely aim for stars.
He'll aim for three stars to surpass me.</i>

862
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:35,144
{\an8}Let's make the best dish together!

863
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:36,645
{\an8}-Yes!
-Not "Yes."
