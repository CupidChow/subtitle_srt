00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:08,675
{\an8}THREE YEARS AGO
PARIS, ESCOFILLE

2
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:10,677
Thank you.

3
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,080
It's from Michelin.

4
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:18,151
We got two stars.

5
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:19,819
Two stars again?

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,589
Two stars is plenty good.

7
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:36,903
Why are you happy about that?

8
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:44,310
Two stars.

9
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:47,480
-Do you think that's enough?
-O-Obana...

10
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,883
-Do you think that's enough?
-Calm down, Obana!

11
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,919
Of course we're all upset!

12
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:00,593
The staff meal is ready.

13
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:04,097
Hachis Parmentier
with chestnuts and mushrooms.

14
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,698
Wow! Looks great.

15
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:10,270
Cheer up everyone! Back at it!

16
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,505
Come on, let's do our best!

17
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:30,590
{\an8}-Are you Mr. Natsuki Obana?
-Geez...

18
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:34,127
{\an8}Do you know what caused the food
to be contaminated with allergens?

19
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:35,361
No, I do not.

20
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:38,565
Some believe
your staff did it intentionally.

21
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:39,499
Impossible.

22
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:42,802
There is also a rumor that
you're the culprit,

23
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,806
since you abandoned your restaurant
and went missing.

24
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:49,209
If it's the culprit you're looking for...

25
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:52,979
it's me.

26
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,214
So you admit it?

27
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,682
It's not an admission,

28
00:01:55,748 --> 00:02:00,019
but I do take full responsibility
for the dishes served at Escofille.

29
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:03,223
-That's in the past now.
-You're starting a new restaurant.

30
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,925
Are you worried many people
may not want to eat your dishes?

31
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,328
Even if some people don't,
it doesn't matter.

32
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:11,264
-Sorry, I have to be getting to work.
-You mean they don't have to eat it?

33
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,466
-Please wait.
-Just a few more questions.

34
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:16,836
<i>Perhaps the perpetrator who
introduced allergens three years ago...</i>

35
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,305
<i>may strike again.</i>

36
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:25,311
It's Ms. Linda.

37
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:28,915
It must be her. She's using your name
to try and shut us down.

38
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,183
Good morning.

39
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,985
Oh, good morning.

40
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:34,487
It's fine.
She complimented the food, right?

41
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:37,824
How are you so carefree?
We'll be opening soon.

42
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,860
What will we do if no one comes?

43
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:45,899
-Good work.
-Chef Hirako!

44
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,234
This is the place Matsui went to.

45
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:49,569
TERRORIST CHEF NATSUKI OBANA
OPENS RESTAURANT IN TOKYO

46
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:50,870
Can you believe it?

47
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,139
Wow. I feel bad for her.

48
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,408
They shouldn't even think
about three stars

49
00:02:56,976 --> 00:03:00,213
Natsuki Obana and Grand Maison Tokyo
are getting flamed online.

50
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,881
They're finished.

51
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:04,250
Do you really have the time
to care about that?

52
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:09,122
The Top Restaurants 50 are chosen
by votes from foodies

53
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,224
and professionals around the world.

54
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:16,829
We've been featured in a magazine,
so I'm sure they'll be visiting us.

55
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:20,833
That's exactly why we've hired
new cooks to bring our ratings up.

56
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,204
Kakitani has been a big help.
But we'll need more.

57
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,974
Mr. Nishigori! This is Tango, our chef.

58
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:28,875
Thank you.

59
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,210
{\an8}GRAND OPENING DAY

60
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,712
{\an8}Thank you for calling,
this is Grand Maison Tokyo.

61
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,682
Yes, from 7 p.m.

62
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:39,219
Yes. Oh, I understand.

63
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:42,722
The legendary three-star French restaurant
Grand Maison Tokyo.

64
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,726
What a glamorous debut.

65
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,265
-Shall we sing a song?
-No!

66
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:08,615
I'll pay you monthly if you give me
your new recipes and information.

67
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,816
<i>I'm telling you to take it.</i>

68
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,086
Serita!

69
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,022
-Yes.
-Himo peppers.

70
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,824
Right. Himo peppers.

71
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,460
You had a full house
on the first day, right?

72
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,930
Yes. With regular customers
from my previous restaurant,

73
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,165
and Mr. Kyono's acquaintances.

74
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,901
They canceled
as smoothly as the tide going out.

75
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:31,504
Well, who'd want to pay 20,000 yen

76
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,440
to eat the food of a chef
that caused an incident?

77
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:37,176
I'm so glad Ms. Moe is here.

78
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:39,979
We seem to be very like-minded.

79
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,582
Don't lump us together.
You're still an apprentice.

80
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:43,950
I've been here longer.

81
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,223
Someone came!

82
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,793
Welcome.

83
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,894
Welcome.

84
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:57,497
Only one group?

85
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,766
It doesn't matter. Do your best.

86
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,369
So arrogant.
This is all your fault you know.

87
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,772
Move your hands, not your mouth.

88
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:07,774
Wow.

89
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,409
Did you see the article?

90
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:11,678
THE OWNER AND CHEF IS RINKO HAYAMI

91
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,814
At your request,
I personally vouched for a loan

92
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:18,418
with the credit union
for Grand Maison Tokyo.

93
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,021
I believe I told you to sever ties

94
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:25,491
with that terrible restaurant in Paris
you used to work at.

95
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,427
Are you trying to use me?!

96
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,229
You're breaking up with Miyu.

97
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:34,000
-Father.
-I'm running in the next election.

98
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,503
I can't have
untrustworthy people around me.

99
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,005
It wasn't terrible.

100
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,776
Escofille was a fantastic restaurant.

101
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,082
You're not recording this, are you?

102
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:50,316
What are you saying?

103
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:52,452
You should know.

104
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,755
I know the manager
of your hotel quite well.

105
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,123
Be prepared.

106
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,426
-Don't talk like that.
-Very well.

107
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:02,462
Shohei?

108
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,131
-Pardon me.
-Shohei, wait.

109
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,866
Shohei, wait!

110
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:09,736
-Shohei!
-Wait, ma'am.

111
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:11,137
Out of my way.

112
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,038
-Shohei!
-Wait!

113
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,395
{\an8}FOR STAFF MEALS

114
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,063
{\an8}FOR STAFF MEALS

115
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,064
CONSOMMÃ‰

116
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,401
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,082
Any customers today?

118
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,623
Hey, Shohei.

119
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,258
-Come in.
-Shohei.

120
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,727
Here to celebrate the opening?

121
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,996
How many dinner guests
did you have last night?

122
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:10,897
What?

123
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:16,969
Mr. Obana and this restaurant
are being criticized because of Escofille.

124
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:22,375
Our grand opening had
two groups, four guests in total.

125
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,811
Only two groups at a high-end restaurant?

126
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,379
Don't worry about it.

127
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,448
Oh. Since you're here,
why don't you say hi?

128
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:29,682
Go on.

129
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,154
Shohei.

130
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,558
What are you doing here?

131
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,593
He's worried about you.

132
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:44,764
Don't worry about us.
You have your own restaurant.

133
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,799
-You're the head chef, right?
-Wait.

134
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:47,700
Want something to drink?

135
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,268
Oh, Ms. Ebina?

136
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,974
So you're planning on quitting the hotel
and working here, aren't you?

137
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,076
Shohei? You're quitting the hotel?

138
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,311
Who is that?

139
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,745
You're Mr. Obana, right?

140
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,981
It's your fault.

141
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,283
-Hey, Miyu.
-It's your fault things came to this.

142
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,954
I have no idea what you're talking about.

143
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,525
If you hadn't invited Shohei here,
we could have been happy.

144
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,393
-Stop! Don't touch me!
-Huh?

145
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,862
I know everything.

146
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:19,265
That you and Ms. Matsui worked
night after night making Mont Blanc.

147
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,501
-That's...
-You say it was for work.

148
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:24,937
But you left me.
It had nothing to do with the hotel.

149
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,240
You did it all for this restaurant!

150
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,574
Just apologize, Shohei.

151
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,142
I get it now.

152
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:33,446
He was working on his own accord.

153
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,881
It has nothing to do with us.

154
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,282
That's not all.

155
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,350
The money for this restaurant.

156
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,818
What? Money?

157
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,687
-Shohei asked my father for a favor.
-Miyu, we're leaving.

158
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:44,357
To get a loan from the credit union.
Stop! Let go!

159
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:48,394
So the reason Mr. Shiose from
Josai Credit Union came to eat here...

160
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,029
That was because of Shohei?

161
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,664
Did you ask him, Obana?

162
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,099
Of course not.

163
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,467
It was you.

164
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,902
-What?
-It's all your fault! All of it!

165
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:58,771
-If only you weren't around!
-Miyu!

166
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,273
-It's all your fault!
-I understand.

167
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,975
-It's all your fault!
-Forgive me.

168
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,612
-Calm down, Miyu.
-Just stop.

169
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,855
Is she okay?

170
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,890
She calmed down and took a taxi home.

171
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,459
-Why didn't you see her home?
-Obana.

172
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:23,262
I'm terribly sorry for the trouble.

173
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,566
It looks like she was angry
about the Mont Blanc.

174
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:27,667
I'm sorry.

175
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:34,006
Thank you. You've been a big help.

176
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,341
It's nothing.

177
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,976
Ms. Rinko, listen.

178
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,744
Remember when Mr. Eto interfered

179
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,213
and we weren't able to purchase
game meat under our name?

180
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,150
-Yes.
-We used Shohei's name to purchase it.

181
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,052
The venison thigh?

182
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:47,954
Thank you.

183
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,557
Hotel chefs sure have a lot of spare time.

184
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:52,458
Watch it.

185
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:55,127
So, Shohei. What'll you do now?

186
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,530
I'm planning to quit the hotel.

187
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,466
I'm sorry even though you introduced me.

188
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,702
That's fine. But what do you plan to do?

189
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,670
I'll go back and help out at home.

190
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,606
Back home? At the dumpling factory?

191
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:07,540
Yes.

192
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,609
Shohei.

193
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,546
You're really quitting French cuisine?

194
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,115
Yes.

195
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,018
What's gotten into you?

196
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,220
You wanted three stars, didn't you?

197
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,290
Then come work for us.

198
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,158
Oh! I agree!

199
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,226
-Me too!
-Me too!

200
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,128
-No.
-Me... huh?

201
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,464
Mr. Obana.

202
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:35,201
We have no space
for unmotivated employees.

203
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:39,505
We'll be closed in a month
if we keep wasting food like this.

204
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:42,274
That's... true, but...

205
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,710
But this is all Natsuki Obana's fault.

206
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,278
What will you do?

207
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,347
You're really pissing me off.

208
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:54,587
If customers won't come to us,

209
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,623
how about we take it outside to sell?

210
00:10:58,591 --> 00:10:59,458
What?

211
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:03,262
You mean like a food truck or something?

212
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,830
No, no, not like that.

213
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,499
Something better than that.

214
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:07,967
-Like a food festival?
-That!

215
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:12,672
Perfect.
We'll sell curry at a food festival.

216
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,474
-Curry?!
-We can use these leftovers.

217
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,343
Just add spice and it'll be curry.

218
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:19,578
-Nice idea.
-Serita!

219
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:23,015
Shouldn't we just order less?

220
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:26,919
Are you serious?
Not having enough ingredients

221
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,221
when a customer orders is much worse.

222
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,123
Don't you think it's better

223
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,393
if we find a way to get more people
to eat the food we make?

224
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,129
We make good food here.

225
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,737
We're aiming to be the best
in the world, right?

226
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:48,007
That's right. I came here
to get three stars, too.

227
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,109
If you don't like it I'll do it myself.

228
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,879
But, Shohei! You're helping me.

229
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:55,514
-What?
-You just told him no.

230
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:59,185
I said no to the restaurant.
He can help at the festival.

231
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,554
That's so inconsiderate.

232
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,122
You can't do that.

233
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:05,357
No. I'll do it.

234
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:06,659
You will?

235
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,761
Mr. Aizawa and Mr. Kyono have
been a big help in the past.

236
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,597
I'd be happy to help
this restaurant in any way.

237
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,166
-Excuse me.
-Welcome.

238
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,268
Where is the coriander?

239
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:19,472
-It's in the back over there.
-Back there?

240
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,743
We'd like Indian cumin
and the freshest cardamom you have.

241
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,313
How does Shohei know all of that?

242
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,950
He spent a lot of time
at the markets in Paris.

243
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,119
Even so,

244
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:37,056
we're aiming for three-star French.
Why do we have to make curry?

245
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:41,427
Do you think he ever feels remorse
for making people do what he says?

246
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,796
I do. That's why he chose curry.

247
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:48,100
Obana never served lunch at Escofille.

248
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,770
He says top chefs don't sell cheap dishes.

249
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:54,039
And now he's going to sell
casual food at a food festival.

250
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,010
He'll do anything to keep
his restaurant open.

251
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,678
Why doesn't he just say so?

252
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,314
Why not apologize and ask for help?

253
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:04,483
He's such a pain.

254
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,751
He really is.

255
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,288
Let's use a lot of coriander.

256
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,224
Why? Japanese people prefer

257
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,760
European style more than Indian.

258
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:15,761
That's not true!

259
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,296
We don't need it.

260
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:20,166
What are you doing?
Shohei and I will make it.

261
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:21,500
I want to help!

262
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,036
-We're all in this together.
-Don't buy it.

263
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:25,938
-We got this already, right?
-Yes.

264
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:33,946
Roasting bones before simmering
them brings out more flavor.

265
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,615
Venison loin doesn't simmer well
so I'll do it sep...

266
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:37,683
Do it separately.

267
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,185
Yes.

268
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,056
VENISON SHANK

269
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,658
-I'll fry it up.
-Okay.

270
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,863
LARD, CARDAMOM, CUMIN, CORIANDER
CINNAMON, CHILI PEPPERS, BLACK PEPPER

271
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,265
BAY LEAF, GARLIC, GINGER,
CELERY, ONION, CARROTS

272
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:00,806
VENISON FOND

273
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:01,740
That's hot...

274
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,246
FLOUR, CURRY POWDER, CORIANDER POWDER,
CUMIN POWDER, BUTTER

275
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,514
-Pour it in.
-Right.

276
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,249
-Thank you.
-Sure.

277
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,289
Okay.

278
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,029
European-style curry.

279
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,365
What a rare sight.

280
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:30,669
I've never seen Obana and Shohei
cook together like that before.

281
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:36,041
They used to work together, but Shohei
was always stuck doing menial tasks.

282
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:37,343
-Shall we taste it?
-Sure.

283
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,244
Ms. Rinko.

284
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,516
It's delicious!

285
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,419
You combined venison and goat's milk.

286
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:49,255
What a great idea!

287
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,523
I'm good at using leftovers.

288
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,960
Hey, everyone come try it!

289
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:58,631
Bon appÃ©tit.

290
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,207
So good!

291
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,776
This flavor for only 1,000 yen?
What a deal.

292
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,212
Is this going to make us any money?

293
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,315
-It has kind of a nostalgic taste.
-It really does.

294
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,184
I used to make a similar dish
for the staff at Escofille.

295
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,186
How is it? Do you remember?

296
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,188
What? Not at all.

297
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,158
If we make a ton of this
for the food festival,

298
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,093
we'll stink up the restaurant.

299
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,195
-We should make it at home.
-My house?

300
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,665
This is the kitchen layout.

301
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,501
-I see.
-It's pretty narrow, right?

302
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:48,080
Herb-grilled tongue steak.

303
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,682
Spicy fried chicken.

304
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,550
Excuse me, coming through.

305
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,720
-This looks like the real deal.
-We're here!

306
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,623
Excuse me, coming through.

307
00:15:58,223 --> 00:15:59,291
Sorry, we're late.

308
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,061
What's up with this tent?

309
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,330
It was plain white
so I made it more stylish.

310
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:07,066
-Three-star curry will go viral.
-That's so lame.

311
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,401
What will you name the shop, Mr. Kyono?

312
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:14,239
Well, I want to advertise
for Grand Maison Tokyo but I guess not?

313
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,140
I know.

314
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:19,878
How about "Limited-Time Super-Rare Wildly
Delicious B-Grade Three-Star Curry"?

315
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:20,779
Awful.

316
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,214
Come on.

317
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,249
I'll make an official Instagram account.

318
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,118
Let's make a Twitter account, too.

319
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,252
Let's do this.

320
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,988
I'll serve the customers.

321
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:31,156
You make the food
and try not to show your face.

322
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:33,692
-You make me sound like a criminal.
-You were!

323
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,860
What'd you say?

324
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:36,528
Did you just take a picture?

325
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,899
Venison curry, come and get it!

326
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,335
-Ready Matsui? Putting it down.
-Sure.

327
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,271
Thank you. That'll be two thousand yen.

328
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,073
How about some venison curry?

329
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,942
-One venison and one cheese.
-Thanks.

330
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,544
-One venison, one cheese!
-Thank you!

331
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,246
Shohei sure is fired up.

332
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,515
Venison curry here!

333
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:59,151
He must be happy to be working
with Obana again.

334
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,455
Sorry, I have to go pick up Amelie.

335
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,257
Omiya! Take care of it.

336
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,693
Pardon me. Excuse me.

337
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:15,267
Yum!

338
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:18,504
Wow. This is really great!

339
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,905
Thank you.

340
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,941
-I'll post it on Instagram.
-Great! Thanks!

341
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:25,978
Now might be a good time
to restock our change.

342
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,547
-Want me to go?
-Would you? Thanks a lot.

343
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,417
Oh.

344
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,986
What a surprise.

345
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,755
I see you've opened
a school festival food stand.

346
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,257
Mr. Eto? Why are you here?

347
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,460
This event is run by a friend of mine.

348
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,262
Would you like to try some?

349
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:44,463
No thank you.

350
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,365
Look at that.

351
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:49,201
You've got these kids working hard.

352
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:53,705
Working for a restaurant
with no future isn't any fun.

353
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:57,743
But if you cook up leftovers,
you can make curry.

354
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:01,814
Good luck.

355
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,349
Thank you very much.

356
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,086
-Venison curry here!
-Come and get it!

357
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:09,321
Venison curry for sale!

358
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,590
-This looks great.
-Sure does.

359
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:16,061
That quiche has a great almond fragrance.

360
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,263
Mr. Tango! Please try some.

361
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,264
-I'd love to.
-Thanks.

362
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:26,238
I heard you're helping out
at Obana's place?

363
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,508
A little bit, I guess.
But not at the restaurant.

364
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:33,712
You'll be working there soon, I assume.
At the Grand Maison Tokyo.

365
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,749
No. I'm quitting the hotel
and French cuisine.

366
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,151
Why?

367
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:45,090
Well, come eat at Gaku sometime.

368
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,159
We'll celebrate your new job.

369
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,695
I cut it a little thicker for you.

370
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:51,230
Thanks. Looks great.

371
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,939
-Do you have a minute?
-What is it?

372
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,474
Mr. Kyono, forgive me.

373
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,979
We sold all that curry
but still only three groups here.

374
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:08,447
And they were all foreigners.

375
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:12,384
No Japanese customers will come
with bad reviews like that.

376
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,286
-Aizawa.
-You scared me.

377
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:17,055
-Do we still have celery?
-Yeah, plenty.

378
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:20,759
-We'll use it as a side dish tomorrow.
-Right.

379
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,763
We have to do the food festival
again tomorrow?

380
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,566
-I'm sore.
-Everyone.

381
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,868
Go home. I'll finish up here.

382
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:33,038
Mr. Aizawa, hurry on back to Amelie.

383
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:36,275
Thanks. Don't push yourself too hard,
Chef Rinko.

384
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,876
-I won't.
-Nice work today.

385
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,511
Good work today.

386
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,121
Are you okay?

387
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,456
Why don't you take a break?

388
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,959
You're getting up there, old lady.

389
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,995
You're one to talk, old man.

390
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:58,997
-Chef Rinko.
Yes?

391
00:19:59,064 --> 00:19:59,998
Do you have a moment?

392
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:04,102
Omiya and Namiki
have expressed their desire to resign.

393
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,804
I'm sorry.

394
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:09,541
Honestly, I can't keep going like this.

395
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:13,712
Understood.

396
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:15,981
Thank you for your help.

397
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,685
Mr. Kyono. Their paychecks up to today,
please.

398
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,587
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

399
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,627
We aren't getting many customers yet,

400
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,396
so we'll be fine without them.

401
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,733
Yeah, sure.

402
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,605
We have no reservations
for tomorrow either.

403
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:56,054
-Do you live here, Mr. Obana?
-Don't get any weird ideas.

404
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:57,556
I let him use my garage.

405
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:00,359
He only has access
to the kitchen and toilet.

406
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,527
We've been trying to get him out.

407
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:06,231
I have no choice
until the restaurant is back on track.

408
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,500
-Shohei.
-Yes?

409
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,068
-Gimme a hand.
-Sure.

410
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,639
You better not burn it.

411
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:14,640
Right.

412
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:18,977
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to change and wash up.

413
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,979
Wash up in the garage?

414
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:21,980
It's good enough.

415
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,285
Sorry, Shohei.

416
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,086
He's working you too much.

417
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,591
It must be hard for you too, Ms. Rinko.
Working with a guy like that.

418
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:34,993
It's the worst.

419
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,662
Although it hurts to admit it...

420
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,235
this is really good.

421
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:47,272
There were a lot of kids
at the festival today, right?

422
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,575
He decided to make a few adjustments

423
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,478
and cut the veggies into smaller pieces.

424
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,915
<i>It's not as spicy, either.</i>

425
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,383
It's so cold!

426
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:03,722
I have no respect for him as a person.

427
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,892
But with him,

428
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:10,829
I really believe
I can get a Michelin star.

429
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:18,603
We should be able to
carry these by ourselves.

430
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,739
I'll put them down here just to be safe.

431
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:22,441
-Mr. Kyono.
-Yes?

432
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:25,911
How much money is left?

433
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:27,312
What's gotten into you?

434
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:30,782
Aren't you struggling?

435
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,619
You don't need to worry about that.

436
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,954
Tell me the truth.

437
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:41,360
We'll be okay.

438
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:45,097
Grand Maison Tokyo isn't going anywhere.

439
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:47,999
I promise.

440
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:49,568
I'll protect it.

441
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:55,841
Yum.

442
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:00,512
Yesterday's curry
tastes even better as leftovers.

443
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,381
Because it's been stored overnight.

444
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:05,350
-Maybe not the most hygienic.
-Yeah.

445
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,021
I hope it sells.

446
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:12,591
Yeah.

447
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,768
We'll make it work, right?

448
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,541
Our food is delicious.

449
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,346
We haven't done anything wrong.

450
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,082
Yeah.

451
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,084
We're ready.

452
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,052
-Let's eat first.
-We already started.

453
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:44,055
-Thanks for the food.
-I bet the leftovers are even better.

454
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,992
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

455
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:49,795
-I'll drive.
-You've hardly slept.

456
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:50,962
Neither have you.

457
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,130
Sorry, no license here.

458
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:53,632
You're useless.

459
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,735
I'll drive. I'm still young.

460
00:23:58,203 --> 00:23:59,337
Don't you say that.

461
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:01,773
You really just dug your own grave.

462
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,509
There's a super long line.

463
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,812
-Whoa. Wait.
-Two people? Here you are.

464
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:08,747
How many today?

465
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,016

What is it?

470
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,861

Sell, sell. Sell as much as possible.

479
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:44,749
Right!

480
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,685
Put the stockpot in front.

481
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:48,920
-Here you are.
-Thank you!

482
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,923
-We'll need to restock the roux soon.
-Okay.

483
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,059
-We're almost completely out.
-Put this in front.

484
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,661
-Add more rice until we run out of meat.
-Okay.

485
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:58,196
One more venison curry.

486
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:00,098
Venison, then cheese.

487
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,566
We need more rice.

488
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:04,503
-Rice. Got it. Here you are.
-Thank you.

489
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:07,272
-We're almost out of rice.
-One more cheese and venison.

490
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:09,307
Shohei, we need spoons.

491
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:12,444
-Two venison curries.
-Coming up.

492
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,712
Thank you!

493
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,317

495

-What?
-Help him.

496
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:27,425
I see.

497
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,830
The reservation at 8 p.m. for Yamaoka
has been canceled.

498
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:32,731
Got it.

499
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:35,300

Wow!

Check it out.

508
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,198
Would you taste this for me?

509
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:09,734
-Can I try too?
-Sure.

510
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:12,037
It feels like it's missing something.

511
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:14,072

523
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:49,240
Ms. Rinko, forgive me. Amelie has a fever.

524
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:51,676
-Go on home, then.
-Thanks. I'm leaving early.

525
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:53,979

526
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,414
Yeah. I'm fine.

527
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,189
Have a drink.

528
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:08,059
Serita, get the loin for me.

529
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,227
The loin, right.

530
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,096
Loin.

531
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,834
<i>A wine festival, even on your day off?</i>

532
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,502
I'd love to cover it.

533
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:18,503
Very well.

534
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:24,309
I'm sorry for the inconvenience
caused by Ms. Linda's article.

535
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,812
I feel responsible.

536
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:30,582
You don't need to apologize, Ms. Kanna.

537
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:31,583
So...

538
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:35,954
why did Ms. Linda put
Mr. Obana's name in the article?

539
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:37,555
<i>Ms. Linda is</i>

540
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:41,426
<i>still searching for the culprit of
the allergen incident three years ago.</i>

541
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:44,029
<i>She thought that by
including Mr. Obana's name,</i>

542
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:46,965
the culprit might
decide to make a move again.

543
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:48,033
Make a move?

544
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:51,469
They might come to
get in Mr. Obana's way again.

545
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:55,306
Are you saying this might
happen at my restaurant again?

546
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:57,976
Or perhaps, the opposite.

547
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,112
The opposite?

548
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,515
Perhaps they regret what they did.

549
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:06,084
Maybe if they see Mr. Obana working hard,

550
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,453
they'll confess their crime.

551
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:13,224
Ms. Linda will show no mercy
for the culprit.

552
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,195
Grand Maison Tokyo is receiving
more criticism than I thought.

553
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:20,098
We'll see if Obana can
work his way out of this.

554
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:22,801
<i>The restaurant will close
if they don't get customers.</i>

555
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,036
What will happen will happen.

556
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:28,506
More importantly, if you find
the culprit, let me know right away.

557
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,075
What do you plan on doing?

558
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:34,979
I'll make sure they can't survive
in the restaurant world.

559
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,815
<i>What's your plan, Kanna?</i>

560
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:41,886
-Me?
-<i>It's you that holds the grudge, no?</i>

561
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,192
Fancy seeing you here.

562
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:48,493
Thank you.

563
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,494
How was it?

564
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:51,996
Simply incredible.

565
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,099
<i>Colorful, and surprising.</i>

566
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:56,701
<i>All the flavors were refined and profound.</i>

567
00:28:56,768 --> 00:29:00,939
I can tell you put as much effort
into the flavor as the presentation.

568
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:01,940
And the lamb?

569
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,010
Hey, can you make us some coffee?

570
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:09,147
-What would you change?
-Me?

571
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:11,750
The sauce, perhaps.

572
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:15,386
Listen, Shohei.

573
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:18,223
We're having a sous-chef test soon.

574
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,425
Would you like to try?

575
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,494
Don't be silly.

576
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,363
I told you, I'm done with French cuisine.

577
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:27,866
Have you forgotten, Shohei?

578
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:31,770
In Paris when you tried
to cut ties with Escofille,

579
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:34,773
you said you'd do anything
to study under Obana.

580
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:39,844
I've long wondered about that.

581
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:42,514
You were always infatuated with him.

582
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,583
But even when he started
a restaurant with Aizawa and Kyono,

583
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,653
you didn't join them
at Grand Maison Tokyo.

584
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,954
Why is that?

585
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,857
And when the incident three years ago

586
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:56,227
threatened to close his restaurant,
you decide to go help

587
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,530
and claimed you were
quitting French cuisine.

588
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,198
Shohei.

589
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:02,967
Was it you?

590
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:06,104
Did you contaminate
the food with nuts three years ago?

591
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:13,444
Shohei.

592
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:15,280
Was it you?

593
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:19,117
Did you contaminate
the food with nuts three years ago?

594
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,075
This isn't my recipe.

595
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:46,044
Who did it? What's in there?

596
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,312
Who's in charge here?

597
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:48,980
Very well.

598
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:51,382
Let's talk.
I need to ask you some questions.

599
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,326
What's your plan?

600
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:03,795
I'll quit the hotel.

601
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:07,031
And before I cause any trouble
for my friends...

602
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:10,368
I plan on revealing
what I did three years ago.

603
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:12,170
And you think that will save
Grand Maison Tokyo?

604
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:13,538
Thanks for the meal.

605
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:15,306
Is this what you want?

606
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:19,210
You'll never work in French cuisine again
if you admit it.

607
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,213
You'll never work in fine dining again.

608
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,515
You'll be completely shut out.

609
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,886
Think of the times you claimed
French cuisine as king.

610
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:30,455
Are you really sure you want to lose this?

611
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,760
When I ate Grand Maison Tokyo's course,

612
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:39,864
I knew it had to be experienced
by more people.

613
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:46,404
That restaurant has the potential
to get three stars.

614
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:51,075
I absolutely cannot
let that restaurant fail.

615
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:54,445
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

616
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:56,014
One thousand yen please.

617
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,017
-I'm going to check on the others.
-Okay.

618
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:06,424
<i>Ms. Linda will show no mercy
for the culprit.</i>

619
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,495
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

620
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:12,463
-What's next?
-Thank you.

621
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,898
-One order of pinchos.
-Sure.

622
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:16,200
Thanks for waiting.

623
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,316
THREE STARS IS AT THE WINE FESTIVAL

624
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,152
DELICIOUS FINGER FOOD FROM THREE STARS

625
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:36,087
I ask for your cooperation.

626
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:38,957
You wouldn't want to suffer
reputational damage.

627
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:40,825
The sous-chef test is...

628
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:42,226
Yes, excuse me.

629
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,594
How's it looking?

630
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:45,863
I think we've assembled the best.

631
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:54,839
Thank you!

632
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,142
Pardon me.

633
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:05,283
I'm sorry.
This shop will no longer be serving food.

634
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,485
What?

635
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:10,154
Hold on. You're halting sales? Why?

636
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:12,557
-We've received a complaint.
-What?

637
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:15,593
Customers were worried
about the legitimacy of this shop.

638
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:17,996
That's...

639
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:21,866
I believe the infamous
Mr. Natsuki Obana is here, isn't he?

640
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,303
You were the ones hiding it.

641
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:29,107
Sorry folks, this shop is closed.

642
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:31,642
-What?
-Excuse me.

643
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:32,877
Don't touch that!

644
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:35,213
Obana!

645
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:38,349
Get out!

646
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:40,718
Obana!

647
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:49,761
Rinko!

648
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:54,866
Rinko!

649
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:57,468
Ms. Rinko!

650
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,970
Someone, call an ambulance!

651
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,571
Do you have a phone on you?

652
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:02,373
I just got lightheaded.

653
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:04,942
I just need a break.

654
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,044
I'll help.

655
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:07,712
Thank you.

656
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:09,280
You take this.

657
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,952
THREE STARS CLOSED FOR BEING SKETCHY

658
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,089
THREE STARS CRIMINAL CHEF NATSUKI OBANA

659
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:33,237
IT'S GRAND MAISON TOKYO

660
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:34,505
POISON RESTAURANT

661
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,981
Hey, what are you doing?

662
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,150
Preparing for tomorrow.

663
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:49,687
What's the point? No one will come.
We can't even go to festivals.

664
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:50,755
This is the end.

665
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:51,756
No, it's not.

666
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:56,661
Don't you think
it's pointless to keep trying

667
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:58,529
as long as you're here?

668
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:11,175
It was me.

669
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:18,516
I did it.

670
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:20,485
Three years ago.

671
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,289
I mixed allergens into the food.

672
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:27,758
It was me.

673
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:32,497
Don't be silly, Mr. Kyono.

674
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:33,397
Ms. Kanna.

675
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,468
Tell the public it was me.

676
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,138
I'll resign at once.

677
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:41,706
Please.

678
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:47,145
I hurt everyone. This is all my fault.
I caused you so much trouble.

679
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:48,746
What's wrong with you?

680
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:49,814
It was me.

681
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:51,449
I did it.

682
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:53,251
-It wasn't you!
-It was me!

683
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:58,956
There's still...

684
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,294
a chance to save the restaurant.

685
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,331
-Please understand.
-You're wrong.

686
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:08,332
I did it!

687
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,935
-No, you didn't!
-It was me!

688
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:14,005
This restaurant can't afford to lose you!

689
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:15,573
Don't you know that?

690
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,942
-That's you!
-Obana, listen to me!

691
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,076
Excuse me.

692
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:21,445
You two geezers.

693
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:28,553
Can you stop with
the over-exaggerated buddy fight please?

694
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,888
You're not kids anymore.

695
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,392
And stop deciding things by yourselves.

696
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,294
I'm the head chef here.

697
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,966
Who cares about three years ago?

698
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,635
The source of the contamination,

699
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,772
finding the culprit, the reason.

700
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:52,143
Saying you punched someone,
are a terrorist, or a criminal.

701
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,778
Who cares what they say?

702
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:57,348
No one has to eat anything
if they don't want to.

703
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:06,457
We're making delicious food now.

704
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:09,060
The customers who eat it

705
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:11,729
are happy.

706
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,865
We're not doing anything wrong.

707
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:17,768
Isn't that right?

708
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,110
Yeah.

709
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:30,881
One day soon,

710
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:35,253
our food,

711
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,054
and our service

712
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:39,390
will resonate with our customers.

713
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,465
-Listen.
-Shohei.

714
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:51,802
Eat and go home.

715
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:55,973
-What?
-You've been very cooperative.

716
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:59,310
I'll make something.

717
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:08,386
OXTAIL, GARLIC, ONION, CARROTS, CELERY,
SHALLOTS, RED WINE, COGNAC

718
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:29,273
COW TAIL IN RED WINE WITH MUSHROOMS,
CHESTNUT AND CROUTONS

719
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:34,645
GRUYÃˆRE CHEESE, PARSLEY

720
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:01,872
The staff meal is ready.

721
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:08,279
Hachis Parmentier
with chestnuts and mushrooms.

722
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,313
Wow! Looks great.

723
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,248
Why are you talking like that?

724
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:13,484
Hachis Parmentier
with chestnuts and mushrooms.

725
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:14,552
Wow! Looks great.

726
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,559
-Mr. Obana...
-Let's eat.

727
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:38,642
The recipe.

728
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:41,212
You changed it.

729
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:43,814
Yeah.

730
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,352
Peanut oil.

731
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:55,860
Yeah.

732
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:02,032
It was my mistake.

733
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:04,535
Mr. Obana.

734
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:06,337
The festival was so fun.

735
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:09,573
You know...

736
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:15,479
I believe French cuisine
still has infinite potential.

737
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,151
Who knows when someone
will make something amazing?

738
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:24,488
Or when a new three-star place
will emerge?

739
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:31,228
That's the dream of us chefs.

740
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:36,167
Let's do our best!

741
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:22,112
<i>That time,</i>

742
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:26,484
<i>the staff meal you made saved me.</i>

743
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:35,726
Shohei Hirako's cooking
has the power to move people.

744
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:41,932
That rare talent is yours and yours alone.

745
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,569
-I'm sorry.
-Don't say a thing.

746
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:48,072
Just one thing.

747
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:51,709
You're not quitting French cuisine.

748
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:14,231
-You scared me.
-Wait. Look at this.

749
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:17,968
-Whoa.
-What?

750
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:20,871
Ms. Rinko. It's our online reservations.

751
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:25,342
-What?
-Is this us?

752
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:28,345
I just searched our name. This is crazy.

753
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:31,148
-Are we being bashed again?
-Not this time.

754
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,484
In the Top 50 Restaurant candidate list...

755
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:35,553
Gaku.

756
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:36,453
And...

757
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:44,261
Look. It's us.

758
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:48,065
-What?
-Huh?

759
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:50,634
-I want pork!
-Hey, wait!

760
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:55,706
This is the place.

761
00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:59,476
-It's cute.
-This is it. Nice place.

762
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:00,377
Welcome.

763
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:02,813
We don't have a reservation.

764
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:06,317
No problem. I'll show you to your seat.

765
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:20,664
Looks like it resonated.

766
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:23,834
We did it.

767
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:28,706
It really is the staff from Three Stars!

768
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:32,576
Are children allowed here?

769
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:33,777
All are welcome.

770
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:34,845
Yay!

771
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:37,014
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

772
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:39,950
Welcome to Grand Maison Tokyo. Come in.

773
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:42,319
Just one? May I have your name, please?

774
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:44,588
-Yamamoto.
-Just a moment please.

775
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:11,115
Thank you!

776
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:29,867
{\an8}-Thank you for your patronage.
-Thank you.

777
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,138
{\an8}Good morning.

778
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:36,073
{\an8}It's Kakitani.

779
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:39,309
{\an8}<i>This is just the preliminary
round for Michelin.</i>

780
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:43,447
{\an8}<i>Unlike stars, restaurant rankings
are clearly indicated.</i>

781
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:48,218
{\an8}I know that, but I don't know
what you have up your sleeve, Mr. Eto.

782
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:52,856
{\an8}This time, it'll be a competition
based solely on the restaurant's merits.

783
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,593
{\an8}Let's make it clear who's better.

784
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:01,065
{\an8}The announcement is next month.

785
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:03,834
{\an8}Chef Tango. We're tough, you know.

786
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:05,736
{\an8}So are we.

787
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:30,294
{\an8}Shohei.

788
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,370
{\an8}This is getting interesting.

789
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,076
{\an8}Let's beat them.

790
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:47,745
{\an8}<i>Grand Maison Tokyo.</i>

791
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:49,947
{\an8}You'll have to make the real thing.

792
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:51,515
<i>Let's become a world-famous restaurant.</i>

793
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,383
Show them we're the best in Tokyo!

794
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:54,251
Oui, Chef!

795
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:57,154
<i>I want to show the world
the joys of fresh fish.</i>

796
00:45:57,221 --> 00:45:58,555
<i>Obana is at his best.</i>

797
00:45:58,622 --> 00:45:59,456
If he can keep it up.

798
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:01,358
You're not ready for this restaurant yet.

799
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,327
Then I quit myself!

800
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:06,230
Talent takes time to be understood.

801
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:08,932
<i>They can't copy the dishes
we put so much thought into.</i>

802
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:09,967
Thank you!
