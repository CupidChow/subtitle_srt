00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:07,207
{\an8}DAY OF THE JAPAN-US SUMMIT LUNCH

2
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:10,110
{\an8}-Shohei, where are the nuts?
-They're gone!

3
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:14,647
<i>Three years ago at the summit
was an incident allergic ingredients...</i>

4
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:19,652
<i>The chef ruined an important meeting.
Obana is a disgrace to Japan.</i>

5
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:24,224
Who did it? What was added?

6
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:27,861
Let's create the best
grand maison in the world.

7
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:31,297
I'll make sure you earn those stars.

8
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,700
-Will you join me?
<i>-Is Mr. Kyono important?</i>

9
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,535
<i>He's essential for our restaurant.</i>

10
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:38,405
I've come to take Mr. Kyono from you.

11
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:41,908
It's not because of you.
Ms. Rinko paid off the debt.

12
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,643
I'm going to work for her now.

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,679
Hayami Rinko's restaurant
Grand Maison Tokyo

14
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,549
will be the new three-star
French restaurant.

15
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,755
{\an8}THREE YEARS AGO
PARIS, FRANCE

16
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,662
Did you think this through?

17
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,066
O-Of course.
So much so that I'm sick of eggplants.

18
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:08,601
Did you think about it
when you woke up, ate, left work,

19
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:10,570
talked to women and even in your sleep?

20
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:13,740
Have you given everything you have
and thought this through?

21
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:16,176
Can you really serve this for lunch?

22
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:20,680
-Are you okay with that?
-But...

23
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,982
-Do it like your life depends on it!
-Obana!

24
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:27,787
Enjoy your special meal.

25
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,358
This is a salad using leftover eggplant.

26
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:34,894
I thought it was okay.

27
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:37,397
He's anxious because
he's only had two stars for a while now.

28
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:40,767
He doesn't listen to people's opinions
and takes it out on subordinates.

29
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:41,801
He's the worst.

30
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:45,138
I knew that this wasn't good enough.

31
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:49,709
But I can't be like Obana.

32
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,611
He's special.

33
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:15,201
<i>Hayami Rinko's restaurant
Grand Maison Tokyo</i>

34
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,837
<i>will be the new three-star
French restaurant.</i>

35
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,240
<i>A warehouse in Meguro?</i>

36
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:25,478
Yes, they've rented an old warehouse
and plan to open a 30-seat restaurant.

37
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:31,017
Since high-end French is risky,
it'll probably be a bistro.

38
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,353
It'll be worlds apart from our place.

39
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:36,489
No, Obana will definitely aim for stars.

40
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,792
<i>He'll aim for three stars to surpass me.</i>

41
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:44,631
You have a good sense of humor.
Obana is finished.

42
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,432
What can he do now?

43
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:52,805
<i>Fifty million...
We need 50 million yen to open.</i>

44
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,174
-Serita.
-Yes?

45
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,074
You can eat now.

46
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:56,743
All right!

47
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:58,811
This won't do.

48
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:01,447
Delicious!

49
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,916
Serita, are you really sure?

50
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,953
I can't pay you because
we don't know when we'll get the funds.

51
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,254
I consider it studying.

52
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,023
What kind of meat is this?

53
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:11,024
Lamb.

54
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,894
Oh, I know the difference
between lamb and mutton.

55
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,930
Okay, which is which? What's mutton?

56
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:18,298
Just a moment.

57
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:22,802
As expected, there's a limit
to what I can do with such a poor kitchen.

58
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,038
-The fire is too weak.
-But you know...

59
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:28,208
Why only use premium ingredients
for developing dishes?

60
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:31,077
You can't make good food
without good ingredients.

61
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:35,848
But only using luxury ingredients
from France is conservative.

62
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:39,052
Will you draw on plates with sauce, too?
Your way of thinking is Rococo.

63
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:42,288
Are you calling me old?
I studied the latest cuisine in Paris.

64
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:46,492
You're old. Trends changed
while you were hiding from creditors.

65
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,661
-You're behind the times.
-I'm thirsty.

66
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,164
That's enough.
I'll figure out the menu on my own.

67
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,866
You really don't listen.
We'll go bankrupt before that happens!

68
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:57,470
Kyono said he would
come up with the money somehow.

69
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:58,871
Oh, hey.

70
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:00,707
-Welcome back.
-Thanks.

71
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,743
Roti made with lamb.

72
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,313
Right! Lamb is a young sheep.
And mutton is an adult sheep.

73
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:09,415
Want some, Mr. Kyono?

74
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:13,119
I'm fine. It's better for you
to eat so you can learn.

75
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,120
Thank you.

76
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,922
Mr. Kyono, how did it go?

77
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:20,960
No good. Even Aoba Bank refused.

78
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,462
What's taking you so long?

79
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:26,099
It was so easy
when we opened Escofille in Paris.

80
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,468
The situation is different now.

81
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,670
Is there a problem?

82
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,373
-No, not really...
-What?

83
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,677
Tell us. We can't have
a good restaurant without honesty.

84
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,780
That's right, please tell us everything.

85
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:41,814
Actually...

86
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:48,054
To open a fine French restaurant,
they needed the name of a famous chef.

87
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,893
-Obana Natsuki.
-As if I could give them your name.

88
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,996
I suppose my name isn't good enough...

89
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,465
Sorry, I did talk about your achievements...

90
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:02,735
If only you were more famous...

91
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:07,874
If I were famous, I wouldn't work with
an old chef called the disgrace of Japan.

92
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,309
-What?
-Old man.

93
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,011
What's the disgrace of Japan?

94
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:15,148
-Serita, clean up after you eat.
-What will you do?

95
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,383
She's taking on your debt, right?

96
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,852
We're running out of time, too.
I'll make it work.

97
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,254
What will you do?

98
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,658
I'll bring in a famous chef.

99
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:33,766
I had no idea he was this popular...

100
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,603
His videos became popular
and publishers noticed him.

101
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,907
-It's his third book already.
-"The Prince of Video Recipes"?

102
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:44,944
But these are very interesting.
Simple combinations but well thought out.

103
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,715
Right? Aizawa has always been good
at combining ingredients.

104
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:51,317
Right? Even you relied on him often.

105
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:52,418
Not really...

106
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:53,886
Next, please.

107
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:58,725
{\an8}SIMPLE 500 YEN RECIPES

108
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:01,227
Thank you.

109
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:07,300
As if you could get three stars
with just 500 yen...

110
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,568
Should I call security?

111
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,937
Hello, I'm back.

112
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,606
Sorry, we're not here to interfere.

113
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:14,774
Mr. Kyono, what's this?

114
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,443
Well... A lot happened.

115
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,045
I came to ask you a favor.

116
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,213
I won't do it!

117
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:24,317
What if I told everyone
that three years ago,

118
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,920
this prince worked at a notorious place
that caused a huge incident?

119
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:30,189
Are you threatening me
with your own mistake?

120
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:33,092
-Let's grab a meal after this.
-I have another appointment.

121
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,028
-Is it a woman?
-<i>Oui</i>.

122
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,097
Sign the book already.

123
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:40,600
Thank you.

124
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,771
-Dad!
-Come here! Hi!

125
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:45,805
Is she your daughter?

126
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:47,974
-Amelie! Amelie, right?
-You know her?

127
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,942
She visited Escofille.

128
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:54,714
Do you remember me?
Maybe you were too young to remember.

129
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:57,517
Amelie, they're Dad's friends. Say hello.

130
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,451
Hello.

131
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:05,725
I have to pick her up every day,
so I can't join your restaurant. Got it?

132
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,863
You liked raspberry jelly, right?

133
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,066
So you do remember.

134
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:18,271
You used to eat it with red sauce
smeared all over your mouth.

135
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,139
Who here wants to do that again?

136
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,109
Want me to make it for you?

137
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,777
-Really?
-Yeah.

138
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,980
Only if you take us to your home.

139
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:30,983
Dad, is that okay?

140
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:31,884
What?

141
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,958
It's the first time since elementary
school that my son brought friends home.

142
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,560
Sorry for the mess.

143
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,862
No problem, excuse me.

144
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,464
The kitchen is nice!

145
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,034
Fitting for the Prince of Video Recipes.
It's amazing!

146
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,002
I renovated it for work.

147
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,804
Do you use this for making recipes?

148
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:53,940
Yes, sort of.

149
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:57,143
He's always making something
late into the night.

150
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,581
He seems to be working harder than before.

151
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,318
This is the camera... Is it recording?

152
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,488
So this is how you film videos.

153
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:09,922
Stop messing around.

154
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:13,059
If you'd like, please stay for dinner.

155
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,961
Mom, he'll leave after he makes jelly.

156
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:18,831
It's fine! They came all this way.

157
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:23,536
We have plenty of ingredients
but no one to eat them, it's troublesome.

158
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,171
-Then I'll stay.
-Read the room.

159
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,772
Oh! Then I'll cook.

160
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,874
Oh my...

161
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,343
Though I might not be as good as your dad.

162
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,813
Don't hold back
and tell her what you want to eat.

163
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,748
She's a chef.

164
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,951
I want hamburger steak.

165
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,487
Hamburger steak? Roger that!

166
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:43,155
This is great.

167
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,437
Bon appétit.

168
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,073
Isn't it too hot? This is fine.

169
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:10,283
It's been a while
since I've seen Amelie so happy.

170
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,388
By the way Aizawa, where's Elise?

171
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,726
She's his wife and Amelie's mother.

172
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,598
She left as soon as Escofille closed.

173
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:26,799
Why?

174
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:31,804
She probably had a lot of built-up
resentment from raising our child alone.

175
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,442
"She burst into tears."

176
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:39,245
<i>She left a note asking me
to take care of Amelie.</i>

177
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,581
<i>She worked as an accountant, right?</i>

178
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,383
<i>I went to her office,
but she had already quit.</i>

179
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:49,755
I contacted her family,
but they didn't know where she was either.

180
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,693
Then why did you come back to Japan?
You could have worked in Paris.

181
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,762
It was hard raising her alone
in a foreign country.

182
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:00,533
Then...

183
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,101
You know...

184
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,737
-You could work with us...
-I told you, no.

185
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:08,107
The head chef will be Rinko.
It won't end up like Escofille.

186
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:12,812
When we returned to Japan,
I made a promise to Amelie.

187
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:17,350
That I would take her
to and from daycare every day.

188
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:23,756
She doesn't cry much anymore,
but I'm sure she's still holding back.

189
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,860
I can't break that promise.

190
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:32,098
I see, that's why you have a job
where you can leave on time.

191
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:37,803
With dinner service, you wouldn't be able
to go pick her up from daycare.

192
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:43,909
But in the end, you really do love it.

193
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,478
Love what?

194
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,849
You're still cooking, aren't you?

195
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,026
You never say it's delicious, do you?

196
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,364
Aizawa.

197
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,968
You don't have to work with us.

198
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:12,938
But can you at least lend us your name
as a consulting chef?

199
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,340
Just my name?

200
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:17,777
We need a famous chef's name
to get a loan.

201
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,746
Just on paper.
Of course, we'll pay a consulting fee.

202
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:21,847
Mr. Kyono...

203
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:25,017
I know it's an unreasonable request,
but I...

204
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:29,055
I really want to open this restaurant.

205
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:33,959
It's embarrassing to admit,
but I can't get a loan with my name alone.

206
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,529
I promise not to inconvenience you!

207
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:37,663
Please!

208
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:44,937
You idiots... The name doesn't matter.

209
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:49,108
If you're the head chef,
believe in your cooking and fight for it.

210
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:52,178
But to get a loan...

211
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:57,516
If he lends his name,
he will definitely want to cook himself.

212
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:00,653
Lending just his name
is out of the question.

213
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:08,394
Why talk to someone so unmotivated?
We don't need Aizawa.

214
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:12,098
-Obana!
-Instead, will you hire me?

215
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,499
What?

216
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:17,770
A successful chef
would need an assistant, right?

217
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,839
-What are you up to?
-Nothing.

218
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:24,610
I have to earn some money
because of this scary woman.

219
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,853
Alright everyone, the pasta
seems to be ready, so take it out.

220
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,187
Okay.

221
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:37,890
Don't burn yourself.

222
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,592
What kind of cream do we use for this?

223
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,427
Store-bought fresh cream is fine.

224
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,896
This also works well.

225
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,397
What is that?

226
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:46,665
This is truffle.

227
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:49,235
Hey... Hey, wait a minute!

228
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:50,136
Excuse me.

229
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:51,871
What's going on?

230
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,707
Don't just bring in ingredients.
This is my class.

231
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,675
This cooking would be laughed at in Paris.

232
00:12:56,742 --> 00:13:02,181
This is Japan, and you should know people
tend to avoid expensive ingredients here.

233
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:03,015
Times have changed.

234
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,851
But tastes don't change that quickly.

235
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:07,887
-Mr. Aizawa.
-Yes?

236
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,688
My husband bought this on a work trip.

237
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,525
No, I can't accept it.

238
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:19,165
Then how about we drink
this wine with everyone?

239
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:23,936
Mr. Aizawa and I will each make
a dish that goes well with this wine.

240
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:25,337
Hey...

241
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:31,043
The concept is
a simple and delicious dish, right?

242
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:35,681
I'll make something in five minutes
using only today's ingredients.

243
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:38,484
Please compare the two dishes.

244
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,592
Then, it's an impromptu snack
you can make in five minutes.

245
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,400
Ready...

246
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:56,302
Start!

247
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,811
POTATOES, OLIVE OIL, SALT

248
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:12,051
GARLIC, ONION, BACON

249
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,520
COD ROE, BUTTER

250
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:19,325
MILK, MATCHA, KOMBUCHA

251
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:21,460
TRUFFLE

252
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,697
MATCHA CREAM CHEESE SPAGHETTI

253
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,167
ROASTED POTATOES WITH COD ROE AND TRUFFLE

254
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,504
How is it?

255
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,874
Mr. Aizawa's dish goes well with the wine.

256
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,343
-Thank you.
-Mr. Aizawa wins.

257
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,346
-Thank you.
-It's really delicious.

258
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,516
Why?

259
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,754
Why is Mr. Aizawa's dish tastier?

260
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,523
-Wait, Obana...
-Even if you use truffles...

261
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,691
The taste is too ordinary...

262
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,260
-"Ordinary"?
-Putting matcha in pasta...

263
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,362
It's a fun idea, Mr. Aizawa.

264
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,232
Indeed, it suits the Japanese palate.

265
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,334
Thank you.

266
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,077
The Japanese palate...

267
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:50,749
We need 50 million yen without collateral.

268
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:53,385
You haven't eaten anything yet, have you?

269
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,121
Thank you.

270
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,191
-Are you revising the business plan?
-Yes.

271
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,694
Obana is right.

272
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,564
Instead of bringing in a famous chef,

273
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:10,135
what I needed to do was find someone
who believes in our cooking.

274
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,537
Let's eat.

275
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,772
-I'm sorry.
-For what?

276
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:19,078
If I were a more famous chef,
we wouldn't have this setback...

277
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:22,614
Don't be silly.
No one is famous from the start.

278
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:25,985
It's delicious.

279
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:31,924
It's more fun to build a famous restaurant
with such a talented chef.

280
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:36,195
But if you become famous,
you'll have to raise my salary.

281
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,632
Here, eat up.

282
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:47,840
There are no more banks
that will listen to you, is there?

283
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:53,212
Actually, there's one person.

284
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,082
<i>A credit union employee who helped me
get loans for a restaurant.</i>

285
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,951
<i>His name is Mr. Shiose.</i>

286
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,754
<i>He has no interest in cooking,</i>

287
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,090
<i>but he's skilled
in restaurant management and finances.</i>

288
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,926
<i>He makes judgments
based on accurate numbers.</i>

289
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:11,063
A perfect business plan
might convince him to give us a loan.

290
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:15,734
If you knew someone like that,
why haven't you already met with him?

291
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,971
I didn't want to rely on him if possible.

292
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,373
Mr. Kyono.

293
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,613
Why did you return to the place you quit?

294
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,887
Today, I'm here
to ask a favor of both of you.

295
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:36,955
A favor?

296
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:41,226
The truth is, I'm struggling
to raise funds to open a new restaurant.

297
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:46,732
So as a last hope,
I'm planning to consult with Mr. Shiose.

298
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,667
He's our bank's representative.

299
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:55,074
I was only able to meet Mr. Shiose
thanks to the two of you.

300
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,211
Relying on him for the new restaurant
would be disloyal.

301
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,716
I apologize for asking
such a favor after quitting.

302
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:10,923
But would you allow me to consult
with Mr. Shiose about a loan?

303
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,058
Do as you wish.

304
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,294
Is it alright?

305
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:22,134
It's up to Mr. Shiose himself
to decide who he lends money to.

306
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,437
We have no right to interfere.

307
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:39,952
Mr. Tango.

308
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:44,389
I won't just quietly sit on my hands
after what he did!

309
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:52,131
You want 50 million yen without collateral
to be repaid in five years?

310
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:55,834
Yes, the expected average spend
per customer is 25,000 yen.

311
00:18:55,901 --> 00:19:00,572
The food cost ratio is 35%, and after
deducting rent, utilities, and labor,

312
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:04,176
we'll make about 3,000 yen profit
per customer.

313
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:08,847
At 80% capacity, we'll make 90,000 yen
a day, which is enough to repay the loan.

314
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,517
Ms. Hayami, you're the head chef, correct?

315
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:17,456
Yes, I'm not a famous chef
who can draw customers just with my name,

316
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:20,526
{\an8}but my previous place
was profitable for ten years.

317
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:24,329
{\an8}Moreover, we had customers
who particularly loved my cooking.

318
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:25,564
{\an8}Your reorder rate?

319
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:29,835
I haven't calculated it precisely,
but probably 80% were regulars.

320
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:38,310
Understood.
I'll discuss it with my superior.

321
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,946
-Really?
-Mr. Kyono and I go way back.

322
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:42,447
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

323
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,150
But I have one condition.

324
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:47,152
What is it?

325
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:50,589
Lower the food cost ratio by about 10%.

326
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:57,196
You mean reduce
the cost of ingredients a bit more?

327
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:01,900
A plan that fails if 80% of the seats
aren't filled is problematic.

328
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:04,036
Can you adjust it?

329
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,339
Understood.

330
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,809
I'll discuss it
with the chef and resubmit it.

331
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:15,514
Obana, how long are you staying?

332
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,616
I'm the Prince's assistant, aren't I?

333
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,084
Got it!

334
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:23,021
You wanted to stay here
and cook in a proper kitchen?

335
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,424
I don't know what you're talking about.

336
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:29,228
That's right, Amelie. I made this for you.

337
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:31,129
It's pudding.

338
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:34,533
Raspberry sauce pudding that Amelie likes.

339
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,202
-After you finish...
-Don't do things without asking.

340
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,271
-It looks delicious.
-Right?

341
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:42,674
Let him stay. He livens up the place.

342
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,675
What?

343
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:44,977
Right?

344
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:46,645
That's right, Dad.

345
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,347
Hear that, Dad?

346
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,883
He uses too many expensive ingredients.

347
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,621
If we use domestic ingredients
instead of French, we can reduce costs.

348
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,690
The problem is whether he'll agree.

349
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,626
We need to talk business.

350
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,227
I want to reduce ingredient costs...

351
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,229
-I won't reduce them.
-We have to!

352
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:07,666
Josai Credit Union
might lend us 50 million yen.

353
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,735
But we have to lower the cost ratio.

354
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:13,372
But in a three-star restaurant,
you need high-end ingredients.

355
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,339
Cut something else.

356
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:15,741
What should I cut?

357
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:18,443
Figure it out. That's not the issue now.

358
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,745
Hey, where are you going?

359
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:22,514
I'll stay at Aizawa's
to work on the dishes.

360
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:25,050
The kitchen there is much better.

361
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,986
Money is the priority if we want to open.

362
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,689
French cuisine in Paris
might not be good for Tokyo.

363
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,960
I need to research flavors
we can create in Japan. Bye.

364
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,106
He really doesn't listen to others.

365
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:49,374
I'm hungry.

366
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,410
Then I'll make something.

367
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,911
Please don't.

368
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:57,115
It's okay, cooking helps clear my mind.

369
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:01,687
Is there anything you'd like to eat?
Should I make pasta?

370
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,228
-Matsui.
-Yes?

371
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:11,496
Oh, this is educational.

372
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:15,434
-Finish your work first.
-It'll be done soon! Just a moment!

373
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,103
Do you know Mr. Kamehito Aizawa?

374
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,038
His choice of ingredients is interesting.

375
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:37,189
Prince, don't you get sad
making such modest dishes?

376
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,892
When I returned from Paris,

377
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:46,298
I tried to impress with complex sauces,
using herbs and spices like at Escofille...

378
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:48,667
but it didn't work at all.

379
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:49,568
Why not?

380
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,038
French cuisine
is originally royal cuisine.

381
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:57,075
They like elaborate plating
and complex cooking methods.

382
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,544
But in Japan,
where ingredients are of a high quality,

383
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:02,280
people prefer simple dishes
that highlight the raw materials.

384
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:04,616
So, we should serve raw fish
in French cuisine?

385
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:09,488
You can't win using fresh fish in Tokyo
where there are top sushi places...

386
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:14,893
So I decided to compete with
combinations of ingredients and care...

387
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,495
Who do you think you're lecturing?

388
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:21,032
It's hard to upload recipes every day.

389
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:23,435
Of course, it's better than
when I was at Escofille.

390
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:25,937
Do it like your life depends on it!

391
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,442
<i>I had to meet the demands
of a demonic instructor.</i>

392
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:32,344
You never met my demands!

393
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,847
Yes. You're right.

394
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:46,691
The chef insists
he won't lower the food cost ratio.

395
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:50,529
Let's cut initial cost
by using second-hand tableware...

396
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,199
Oh, no...

397
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,176
Use fresh cream in the sauce.
And vinegar and black pepper...

398
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:08,046
My apologies. Our restaurant
is not a high-end French place.

399
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:11,683
We offer dishes
that diners can enjoy casually.

400
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,852
If you don't like it, we have other...

401
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,654
Of course, I'm trying them all.

402
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:20,959
What's going on?

403
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,427
Shohei, I'm sorry.

404
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:27,165
Actually, I decided to open
a shop with Obana.

405
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:31,002
What are you saying?
You told me to refuse.

406
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:35,841
I owe Ms. Rinko Hayami,
so I'm opening a shop with her again...

407
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,342
I don't understand!

408
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:41,012
How can you work with someone
who caused so much trouble?

409
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:48,119
Ms. Rinko and Obana
are aiming for three stars in Tokyo.

410
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,490
That shop will surely change Tokyo...

411
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:55,026
No, it'll change French cuisine
all over the world.

412
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:56,194
Let's start!

413
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:59,531
People from around the world
will come and be impressed.

414
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:03,401
The moment they taste the food we serve,
their lives will change.

415
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:07,005
I thought I might see such a miracle.

416
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:13,245
Mr. Kyono told me about you, Mr. Hirako.

417
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,349
Among the assistants at Escofille,
you were the fastest.

418
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:20,118
<i>With you, the kitchen ran smoothly.</i>

419
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:22,587
Please leave.

420
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:24,823
Alright.

421
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:29,094
I'll go soon.
I just came to apologize to you.

422
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:33,665
Excuse me.

423
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:34,566
Yes?

424
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:35,600
Who made this?

425
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:37,369
Oh, me.

426
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,006
Then who is the dessert chef?

427
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:44,576
-I made everything.
-What's your name?

428
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,778
-Matsui...
-What?

429
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,346
-M... Moe Matsui.
-Ms. Matsui?

430
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:51,349
-What...
-You're making her uncomfortable.

431
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:53,184
-I just asked her name.
-Sorry.

432
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:57,422
Shohei, rethink the quiche dough.
It lacks fragrance.

433
00:25:57,489 --> 00:26:00,759
-And use fresh cream in the sauce!
-Enough! Let's go.

434
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:04,195
Ms. Matsui, the pudding was great.
Seriously.

435
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:05,764
-Please stop.
-Let's go.

436
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:07,766
Who are they?

437
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:09,067
Don't worry about it.

438
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:11,469
I also think the quiche needs improving...

439
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:14,072
That's up to me. Focus on your work.

440
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,446
<i>It suits the Japanese palate.</i>

441
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:24,849
<i>Even if you use truffles,
the taste is too ordinary...</i>

442
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:33,258
<i>It suits the Japanese palate.</i>

443
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:36,895
<i>Even if you use truffles,
the taste is too ordinary...</i>

444
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:43,768
BLACK PEPPER, VINEGAR

445
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:45,003
FRESH CREAM

446
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,845
SOY SAUCE

447
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:57,682
MISO

448
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,589
YUZU

449
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:07,092
WASABI

450
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,533
ONION, GARLIC, GINGER, SOY SAUCE
SAKE, MIRIN, VINEGAR

451
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:19,504
Then...

452
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,145
Ow...

453
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:33,151
Thank you for visiting us today.

454
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:37,188
Branch manager,
this is complimentary from the owner.

455
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:40,358
No, we can't receive this
from a loan customer.

456
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,193
Refusing would be rude.

457
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:46,197
You have many customers
since you got the two stars.

458
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:49,467
Thanks to that,
we're fully booked for six months.

459
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,336
Michelin is the best.

460
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,338
Excuse me.

461
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,106
Let me introduce you.

462
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,909
This is Manabu Tango, the two-star chef.

463
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:01,112
Welcome. How do you find the food?

464
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:06,151
I don't know much about cooking,
but it's delicious.

465
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:07,719
Please come again.

466
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:11,389
If you need a table,
I'll arrange it immediately.

467
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:12,824
How about for a marriage anniversary?

468
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:17,262
Thank you.
I do need to treat my family sometimes.

469
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:18,797
Shiose, how about you?

470
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:22,000
I would appreciate it.

471
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:24,936
I'll excuse myself. Have a good time.

472
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:31,509
As expected of a two-star restaurant,
the head chef is excellent.

473
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:35,847
In the end, the restaurant's success
depends on the chef.

474
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:41,286
Speaking of chefs,
there is something I'd like to discuss...

475
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,075
You stayed up all night at your age?

476
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:12,250
In Paris, I mastered
over 100 types of butter and herbs...

477
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:16,921
Now I'm starting over
with miso and soy sauce.

478
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:18,656
Isn't it funny?

479
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:22,727
So, what did you make?

480
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:27,065
I have a favor to ask you...

481
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,302
Good morning.

482
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:33,805
Tonight at eight.

483
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:34,706
Okay.

484
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,578
Ms. Ebina, in charge of hospitality?

485
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,248
You could be more confident...

486
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:45,650
Shohei!

487
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:47,485
Mr. Aizawa.

488
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:49,921
The Prince of Video Recipes?

489
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:51,256
Hey, Matsui!

490
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,359
-A handshake! A handshake...
-Don't be noisy!

491
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:56,261
Thank you.

492
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,863
You should be nicer to your girlfriend.

493
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,666
It's not like that. What's up?

494
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,737
Obana asked me to give this to you.

495
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,506
Why are you doing this for him?

496
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:13,745
Are you also opening shop
with Mr. Obana and Mr. Kyono?

497
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:15,947
I'm not.

498
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:17,749
I thought so.

499
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:20,752
If I didn't bring this,

500
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:26,624
he threatened to spread word that
I worked at the disgraceful Escofille.

501
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:28,193
He's the worst.

502
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:29,294
But what is this?

503
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:34,465
It's probably gravy sauce
for our roast beef.

504
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:38,102
Is he an idiot?

505
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:41,372
<i>We are a buffet. Cost is our top priority.</i>

506
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:45,343
<i>We have to make somewhat tasty food
using cheap ingredients.</i>

507
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:49,514
<i>We can't blindly pursue flavor
like Mr. Obana.</i>

508
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:51,883
<i>He wanted you to check it.</i>

509
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,084
<i>Check?</i>

510
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:56,254
<i>If his cooking is suitable
for today's Japan.</i>

511
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:01,693
He wanted you,
who work at a hotel, to check.

512
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,061
You're kidding.

513
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:06,898
It does sound like a joke, right?

514
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:09,901
Mr. Obana never listens to others.

515
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:12,604
He's using us because he's desperate.

516
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:17,175
Anyway, I've delivered the sauce.
Take care.

517
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:39,397
We significantly reduced
the costs for opening.

518
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,866
First, this is the design...

519
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:44,569
Sorry, but we can't give you the loan.

520
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:46,738
What?

521
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:47,639
Why?

522
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:52,076
It seems that Mr. Natsuki Obana
is involved with this place.

523
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,078
I've heard rumors.

524
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:58,016
I heard that Kyono, who worked for us,
is trying to open a place.

525
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,653
A chef named Natsuki Obana is involved.

526
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,623
I suggest that you look into this.

527
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:11,496
Mr. Obana rose to sous chef at
the three-star L'Ambroisie in Paris...

528
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:15,166
But three years ago,
he was arrested for an incident

529
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:19,637
involving allergenic substances
and assault at the France-Japan summit.

530
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:23,274
But he makes excellent dishes...

531
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:26,044
Then why didn't you mention
Mr. Obana's name?

532
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:33,284
You were worried that mentioning him
would negatively affect the shop, right?

533
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:36,487
We can't give a loan
to a business with such risks.

534
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,826
Who would want to visit a place
with such a chef?

535
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:56,107
Welcome.

536
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:06,617
This'll go well with that.

537
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,835
You're right. It's delicious.

538
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,069
I'm glad to hear that.

539
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:28,706
I'm Obana.

540
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:30,675
What? Mr. Obana...

541
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:36,147
I was arrested for an incident involving
allergenic substances and assault.

542
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:37,949
I'm a disgrace to Japan.

543
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:42,720
Don't worry! There's no poison in it.

544
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:43,888
Wait. That's...

545
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:50,128
The bonito broth pairs well with it.

546
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,030
What's this about?

547
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:57,835
I will complete one of the dishes
for our menu in a week.

548
00:33:58,436 --> 00:33:59,537
Would you try it?

549
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,173
You're very confident.

550
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:07,512
But frankly, with your name,
customers won't come.

551
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:12,316
Don't customers come for the dish,
not the chef's name?

552
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:15,720
I've granted loans to many restaurants,

553
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,624
but I have no interest in cooking.
I only believe in numbers.

554
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:24,562
Unfortunately,
no matter how delicious your dish is,

555
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:27,231
I can't give a loan based on taste.

556
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:29,600
Excuse me.

557
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,948
Hey!

558
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:51,756
-How was my sauce?
-I threw it away.

559
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,193
-Was it the right taste?
-I didn't eat it!

560
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:58,896
{\an8}You... I stayed up all night to make that!

561
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:01,199
{\an8}By the way, what happened with the loan?

562
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:05,837
{\an8}It didn't work. It's difficult with
someone who has a criminal record.

563
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:10,975
{\an8}I created a dish and wanted him
to taste it but he was inflexible.

564
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,611
Pathetic.

565
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:19,350
A chef who aimed to be the best in Paris
is now treated like baggage?

566
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:24,822
More importantly...

567
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:29,827
Would someone like you,
who made dishes with unusable ingredients,

568
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,196
really throw that sauce away?

569
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:35,066
You, who cherish ingredients
more than anyone else.

570
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:38,202
I'm not who I used to be.

571
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:41,739
I don't have time
to talk to a disgraced chef.

572
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:04,929
-Excuse me, the appetizer...
-I've eaten, so I'll just drink.

573
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:08,499
You can eat a little. I'm sorry.

574
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:12,803
My secretary did some research on you
without my permission.

575
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,672
What?

576
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:16,941
When you were in Paris,

577
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:21,045
you worked at the restaurant where
that incident occurred three years ago.

578
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:22,046
What?

579
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:26,984
The restaurant involved in the double
incident at the France-Japan summit lunch

580
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:30,087
where allergenic substance
contamination was found.

581
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:31,489
Double incident...

582
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:33,958
Where the chef was arrested for assault?

583
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,794
-Were you hiding it?
-I'm sorry.

584
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:37,895
It's a past I want to forget.

585
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:40,831
If you want to join my family,

586
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,735
you must completely
sever ties with that restaurant.

587
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:51,409
In the political world, you never know
what might come back to haunt you.

588
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:52,810
You're being sensitive.

589
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,012
There's even a rumor
that it wasn't an accident,

590
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:59,217
but a deliberate act of terrorism using
allergenic substance contamination.

591
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:00,851
Terrorism?

592
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:04,855
You weren't involved, right?

593
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:07,592
Of course not.

594
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:11,295
Since Miyu has made up her mind,
you will become my son-in-law.

595
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:17,668
From now on, if you have any troubles,
discuss them with me.

596
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:21,906
Thank you.

597
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,110
Why don't you try another place?

598
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:31,983
We don't have capital,
so we can't use public institutions.

599
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:36,120
No private institution will lend
50 million yen without collateral.

600
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:38,356
Do you have any sponsors?

601
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:41,659
If you know someone who can
even lend 50 million yen, tell us.

602
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:45,129
"Tell us."

603
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,764
You know...

604
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,835
How about your mother's insurance money?

605
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:51,969
It's gone.

606
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,774
Did you use it to pay off my debts?

607
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:01,245
You used such precious money...

608
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:06,384
It's nothing.

609
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,885
What? Just tell me.

610
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:08,819
No...

611
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:15,192
How about mortgaging this house?

612
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:16,861
-What?
-Not this house.

613
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,399
I will never give anyone this house.

614
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:25,436
That's enough, Obana.

615
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,139
What did I do...

616
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,110
-Serita.
-Yes?

617
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:34,945
The tea is weak and lukewarm.

618
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:37,915
I'm sorry. We're trying to cut costs...

619
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,318
It ruined the taste of the pickles.

620
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:42,186
I'm sorry.

621
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,459
Hold on, it's Mr. Shiose.

622
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:52,396
Hello, this is Kyono.

623
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:55,032
Yes.

624
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,968
I understand. Goodbye.

625
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,871
-What's going on?
-Obana, you...

626
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,576
Did you tell Mr. Shiose
to try a dish from our restaurant?

627
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,712
I only made a gentle suggestion.

628
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:10,948
What on earth did you do?!

629
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,616
He said he'll try it in a week.

630
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:13,617
Great.

631
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:18,122
Does that mean he'll consider the loan
based on the taste of the dish?

632
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,091
Probably.

633
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:23,160
-Well done!
-Make up your mind.

634
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:26,330
This is definitely our last chance.

635
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,133
Let's make the best dish together!

636
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,568
-Yes!
-Not "Yes."

637
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:32,570
It's impossible with this kitchen.

638
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:34,605
Aizawa, we're really sorry!

639
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,675
When it's all over, take Obana and leave.

640
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:39,977
-Thank you!
-Shh!

641
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:44,648
Anyway, the problem is the ingredients.

642
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:49,153
To lower the cost ratio,
we should use cheap ingredients.

643
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,857
Then, maybe an appetizer
instead of the main dish?

644
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:54,759
The appetizer defines the course.

645
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:58,963
It's the flagship dish so it should use
the most impactful ingredients.

646
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:00,164
I've already decided.

647
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:04,335
But let me tell you in advance,
no expensive ingredients.

648
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,470
Yeah. Let's use eggplant.

649
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:07,905
Eggplant?

650
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:14,211
But don't you only use luxury ingredients?

651
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:16,247
Isn't eggplant too plain?

652
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:18,516
Japanese eggplants have many varieties

653
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:22,420
and their texture and aroma
are much better than European ones.

654
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:25,289
And they are cheap.

655
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:27,792
Then it's decided.

656
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,834
Take a picture first.

657
00:40:58,722 --> 00:40:59,790
No more for me...

658
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,361
Isn't there a fresher eggplant?

659
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:08,899
The elasticity and gloss are excellent!
Look at the thorns on the stem.

660
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,905
It smells like green apple.

661
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,241
The moisture content is perfect.

662
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,210
This makes the grade. Thank you.

663
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:23,747
Excuse me, we'll take 5 kg of this!

664
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,416
Yes, understood.

665
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,652
May I take this oxalis with me?

666
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:30,488
-That's just a weed.
-How much?

667
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:31,722
It's free, right?

668
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:32,756
Take however much you want!

669
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,225
Thank you!

670
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:36,227
What are you going to do with it?

671
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:41,732
It has good acidity,
and ingredients grown in the same soil...

672
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:43,734
pair well together.

673
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:47,805
-I'll take the fried ones.
-Okay.

674
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:51,742
-It's boiling now.
-Thank you.

675
00:41:57,915 --> 00:41:58,716
It's done.

676
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,818
Did you burn yourself?

677
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:02,520
It should be fine.

678
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:03,554
I think.

679
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,123
This texture is better.

680
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:10,227
-How is it?
-The boiled one is not good.

681
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:12,830
I agree.

682
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:14,598
How about the one who got burned?

683
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,202
-I'm going out.
-See you.

684
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:29,847
Two, four, six, eight here.

685
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:32,850
I see, this won't do.

686
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:37,054
-Raise it a bit more.
-A bit more...

687
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:40,357
A bit more?

688
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,860
You can be more bold.

689
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:44,962
Kyono, it's done.

690
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:46,196
You finished early today.

691
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:49,300
Good, this one looks beautiful too.

692
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:27,938
Aizawa, what do you think?

693
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:28,872
What?

694
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:32,910
You can give us some ideas.

695
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:51,895
How about chocolate?

696
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,130
Chocolate?

697
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:57,668
I see... Mole sauce.

698
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:11,382
I'll go buy some liver.

699
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:15,552
-Should I go?
-It's fine.

700
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:35,439
Maybe I put in too much.
Damn it, what am I doing?

701
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:40,577
Don't rush, let's stay calm.

702
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,513
One more time!

703
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:48,652
WHITE LIVER, BRINE, CORIANDER
PEPPERGRASS, BAY LEAF, THYME, CARDAMOM

704
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:53,524
CACAO NIB, EGG WHITE, COCOA, FLOUR
GRANULATED SUGAR

705
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:54,892
OXALIS, AMARANTH, PURSLANE, BINDWEED
LEMON JUICE, SALT, OLIVE OIL

706
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:56,927
Take a picture.

707
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,295
I'm tired.

708
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:33,063
{\an8}DAY OF THE TASTING

709
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:35,466
{\an8}-What are you doing?
-Let's eat this first.

710
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:37,601
This is not the time to eat.

711
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:41,438
You can't fight on an empty stomach.
Hurry up and eat.

712
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:46,510
Thank you for the meal.

713
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:55,252
Thank you for the meal.

714
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:08,198
This was Mom's best dish.

715
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:16,974
It might puzzle people
if it's served at a restaurant.

716
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,845
But it's a taste you never get tired of.

717
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:27,117
I'm an illegitimate child.

718
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:30,821
Mom kept waiting in this house
she got as payment...

719
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:35,626
for the man who came once a week.

720
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:36,794
A pathetic life, right?

721
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:44,768
But recently, I've started
to think of my mom as amazing.

722
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:50,707
She dressed up
and cooked for that one person.

723
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:53,544
She clung desperately to this house...

724
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:59,216
She lived life based on her convictions.

725
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:02,853
So that's why!

726
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:09,159
That's why the nukadoko
in this house is so wonderful.

727
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:17,301
Because it's my mom's secret nukadoko
that attracted the one she loved.

728
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,310
Thank you for the meal.

729
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:29,646
Wait, you already finished?

730
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:31,748
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

731
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:40,524
What is it? Isn't the tasting soon?

732
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:45,329
<i>Yes, I called to apologize
for what happened last time.</i>

733
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:46,230
What?

734
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:49,733
I'm sorry for asking you
to lend us your name.

735
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:54,037
I know you're not that kind of chef,
but I was desperate.

736
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:56,240
Don't worry about that.

737
00:47:56,306 --> 00:48:00,611
You take responsibility
for the dishes you're involved with.

738
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:03,180
So, won't you come and see?

739
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:07,517
<i>We couldn't have made
that eggplant dish without you.</i>

740
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:10,654
<i>Come see how it's evaluated.</i>

741
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:17,361
Mr. Kyono, you're becoming more brazen.

742
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:20,597
Am I becoming like Obana?

743
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,068
Welcome.

744
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:27,437
What is all this?

745
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:31,808
We haven't signed the contract yet,
but the owner rented it to us.

746
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:35,679
I wanted to convey the atmosphere
as much as possible.

747
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:38,115
Tasting in an empty warehouse...

748
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:39,149
Please, have a seat.

749
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:47,624
It's part of the 20,000 yen course meal.
Please enjoy.

750
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:49,526
Would you like a drink?

751
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:50,427
Water's fine.

752
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:51,995
Understood.

753
00:49:12,015 --> 00:49:14,384
It's a pressé made with
eggplant and white liver.

754
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:52,823
What is the thin and crispy part?

755
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:55,792
It's a burnt chocolate dough with cocoa.

756
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:56,960
<i>Chocolate?</i>

757
00:49:57,027 --> 00:50:02,432
In South America, they use mole sauce,
which combines chocolate and spices,

758
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,401
typically for eggplant dishes.

759
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,771
I thought it might go well
with Japanese eggplants.

760
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:09,973
How is it?

761
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:14,378
It's delicious.
I've never had anything like it.

762
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:24,087
But even so,

763
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:27,324
I can't lend you 50 million yen.

764
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:28,125
Mr. Shiose.

765
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,994
What I believe in are numbers.

766
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:33,730
Taste cannot be collateral.

767
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:37,667
There are numbers.

768
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:42,839
We had planned to use ingredients
from a three-star eatery in Paris

769
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:47,344
but ultimately decided against it.

770
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:50,380
Grand Maison Tokyo

771
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:53,683
will have French cuisine
using Japanese ingredients.

772
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:55,585
Japanese ingredients?

773
00:50:55,652 --> 00:51:00,624
That dish uses Senryo eggplant
from Nagano Prefecture,

774
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:03,794
white liver from Iwate's horned chicken,

775
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:08,298
and the oxalis was
obtained for free from a farmer.

776
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:11,768
The cost of ingredients
for one plate is about 500 yen.

777
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:13,103
Five hundred yen?

778
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:15,772
Instead, we put in great care.

779
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:23,046
The eggplant is marinated
in sherry vinegar, salted, and cooled.

780
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:28,151
The white liver
is deodorized very slowly with cardamom.

781
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:36,193
The dough is slowly baked to prevent
the burnt smell from harming the aroma.

782
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,995
That's how we will compete.

783
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:44,668
With the combination
of ingredients and invisible care.

784
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:46,369
With the chef's ideas...

785
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:49,840
And the chef's strength.

786
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:55,612
This is the new business plan.

787
00:51:56,746 --> 00:52:01,051
We've improved the cost ratio
but maintained diner satisfaction.

788
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:02,385
How is it?

789
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:06,089
You might be able
to reduce ingredient costs,

790
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:10,227
but care and ideas come with labor costs.

791
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,162
We will try our best to manage.

792
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:14,965
How much effort did you put
into making this?

793
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:19,069
To make ten dishes of this level,

794
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,571
and to create new ones for each season,

795
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:24,975
you all know very well
how much labor is needed.

796
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:29,646
Your staff will be exhausted
and you might not sustain the place.

797
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,950
I can't lend to
a business with such risks.

798
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:45,896
Take this.

799
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:48,265
It's the deed to my house.

800
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:50,800
Ms. Rinko!

801
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:53,403
Use my house and land as collateral.

802
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,805
So, please lend us the money.

803
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:58,675
But you said
you'd never give up the house.

804
00:52:58,742 --> 00:52:59,509
It's okay.

805
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:01,011
Do you know what this means?

806
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:05,482
If the restaurant fails,
you'll lose your house and land.

807
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:07,184
Are you prepared for that?

808
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:15,392
This appetizer was made by a stubborn chef
who has never listened to anyone,

809
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:21,331
but he gave up his beliefs
and listened to an old colleague.

810
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:28,205
This one dish has that much value!

811
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:34,244
I...

812
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:38,748
trust this dish and the staff...

813
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:41,418
of this restaurant.

814
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:45,822
Excuse me, but I've already
assessed the asset value.

815
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:51,294
Based on the posted price
and value of nearby properties,

816
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:55,232
the house and land are worth
45 million yen at most.

817
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,000
You're 5 million yen short.

818
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,401
-Hey...
-Obana!

819
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:01,771
However, I'll handle
the 5 million yen somehow.

820
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,343
I'll do my best to persuade my boss.

821
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:10,046
I thought without collateral,
you couldn't lend us money.

822
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,115
I'm a human being.

823
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:16,886
When I eat delicious food,
my heart can be moved as well.

824
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,630
Thank you.

825
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:30,634
Thank you very much!

826
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:35,505
It's delicious.

827
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:37,707
It's delicious!

828
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:40,510
It's tasty.

829
00:54:51,154 --> 00:54:52,155
-Here.
-Yes.

830
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:56,993
As expected, this time too...

831
00:54:57,727 --> 00:55:01,398
It seems like we were thoroughly
used by Mr. Obana again.

832
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:02,999
Used?

833
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,834
Yes.

834
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:08,338
He definitely knew that

835
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:13,977
I would put my house as collateral
once the eggplant pressé was complete.

836
00:55:14,544 --> 00:55:16,846
But it was your decision in the end.

837
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:19,816
You're a chef I want to follow for life.

838
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:25,388
<i>Besides, Obana probably
wasn't that interested in the loan.</i>

839
00:55:25,455 --> 00:55:26,356
What?

840
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:29,993
He might have made that dish
with another purpose.

841
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:38,168
An unaccompanied middle-aged man
is just suspicious.

842
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:44,074
You don't want to taste
the eggplant pressé?

843
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:47,010
I know what it tastes like.

844
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:51,748
I tried the mole sauce
for the lunch menu three years ago.

845
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:54,818
<i>But I never thought to combine</i>

846
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:59,255
<i>the crisp dough
with the texture of fresh eggplant.</i>

847
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:02,859
You remembered

848
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:07,597
that I couldn't meet
your expectations three years ago.

849
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:09,799
That's why you used eggplant, right?

850
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:15,472
I chose eggplant
simply because it was in season.

851
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:20,510
I have to pick up my child.

852
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:22,178
Aizawa.

853
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:32,355
I never thought to use chocolate.

854
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:36,126
Thank you.

855
00:56:58,648 --> 00:56:59,616
See you.

856
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:05,989
Amelie!

857
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,024
Thank you.

858
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:13,563
We've finally got it! Our castle!

859
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:18,635
{\an8}We'll be busy setting up the interior
and kitchen, and getting the tableware.

860
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:20,470
{\an8}-Dream big!
-Serita!

861
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:22,071
{\an8}-Take this.
-Yes.

862
00:57:22,138 --> 00:57:24,808
{\an8}Practice cutting vegetables
into 5mm slices.

863
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:27,911
{\an8}-First step to becoming a chef.
-Fail and you're fired.

864
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:30,547
{\an8}I'm a man who meets expectations.

865
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:34,517
{\an8}But I'm surprised that
Mr. Shiose came to eat.

866
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:39,456
{\an8}I asked him, and it turns out
the head office instructed him to come.

867
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:40,156
{\an8}What?

868
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:43,827
{\an8}They told him to decide
after tasting our dish.

869
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:47,430
{\an8}But how did the head office know?

870
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:48,832
{\an8}Exactly.

871
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:52,802
{\an8}My dad called to say the loan
for the restaurant got approved.

872
00:57:53,336 --> 00:57:54,304
{\an8}I see.

873
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:56,539
{\an8}-Hello.
-Good morning.

874
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:02,045
{\an8}I'll improve the gravy sauce and redo
the quiche dough, so get ready.

875
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,112
{\an8}Understood.

876
00:58:08,918 --> 00:58:10,954
{\an8}I see.

877
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:15,725
{\an8}What is this?

878
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:19,195
{\an8}Mr. Shiose from Josai Credit Union called,

879
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:21,798
{\an8}and he's canceling
his anniversary reservation.

880
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:25,168
{\an8}-What happened?
-I asked, and it turns out...

881
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:29,472
{\an8}He's going to Grand Maison Tokyo instead.

882
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:30,707
{\an8}Grand Maison Tokyo?

883
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:32,242
{\an8}It's Obana's restaurant.

884
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:35,411
{\an8}Huh.

885
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:37,881
{\an8}I see.

886
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:43,553
It'll fit two refrigerators
of this type, right?

887
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:44,621
Two?

888
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,222
They'll fit, but...

889
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:47,490
We should have two.

890
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:49,158
Then the budget won't work!

891
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:52,095
Yes, yes, all the equipment
is second-hand.

892
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:53,997
Don't say second-hand.

893
00:58:54,063 --> 00:58:55,465
We don't have the budget!

894
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:59,936
{\an8}I understand that.
But we don't need that information now.

895
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:02,038
Welcome to Grand Maison Tokyo.

896
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:03,673
{\an8}It's a great opportunity!

897
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:04,941
{\an8}Will you judge us?

898
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:07,844
{\an8}<i>-They're having a showdown?</i>
-We'll see his serious side.

899
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:09,145
{\an8}<i>Let's try everything.</i>

900
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,947
{\an8}<i>I'll make the best dish.</i>

901
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:13,116
{\an8}Let's combine my ideas with the chef's.

902
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:14,484
{\an8}It was hard inside and out.

903
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:15,952
{\an8}Be quiet.
