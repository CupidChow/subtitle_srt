=Episode 7=

3
00:03:16,048 --> 00:03:17,328
What is this now?

4
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:21,527
Wait.

5
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:23,527
Isn't it the decoy mechanism

6
00:03:23,527 --> 00:03:25,127
described in my grandpa's notes

7
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:26,768
designed to scare people off?

8
00:03:30,448 --> 00:03:31,527
Well... Miss Fairy,

9
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:33,967
mind if I borrow your friend's knife?

10
00:03:34,768 --> 00:03:35,768
I won't touch you.

11
00:03:44,087 --> 00:03:44,608
Go.

12
00:04:48,168 --> 00:04:49,327
Didn't attack me?

13
00:04:50,007 --> 00:04:51,088
It isn't a decoy mechanism.

14
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:03,168
Sir,

15
00:05:05,048 --> 00:05:06,488
I never touched your wife.

16
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:09,488
I'll think of something, okay?

17
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:10,887
Just give me more time.

18
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:40,247
Pangzi! Pangzi!

19
00:05:40,728 --> 00:05:41,807
Who's calling me?

20
00:05:46,687 --> 00:05:47,567
Young man,

21
00:05:47,687 --> 00:05:48,567
it's you.

22
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:50,247
Hurry. Find a way

23
00:05:50,408 --> 00:05:51,687
to get me down!

24
00:05:52,608 --> 00:05:53,648
What're you doing?

25
00:05:53,744 --> 00:05:54,887
Flirting during a crisis?

26
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,088
Keep out of it.

27
00:05:56,288 --> 00:05:57,648
Help me pry her off.

28
00:05:59,127 --> 00:06:00,088
Get me down first

29
00:06:00,088 --> 00:06:01,127
before I can help you.

30
00:06:02,887 --> 00:06:04,048
Hurry! Hurry up!

31
00:06:04,207 --> 00:06:05,767
- Wait.
- My blood pressure's spiking.

32
00:06:06,968 --> 00:06:08,367
I'll throw this up. Catch it.

33
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,648
Great! Great!

34
00:06:09,648 --> 00:06:10,408
One, two, three.

35
00:06:10,408 --> 00:06:11,207
No, no!

36
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:12,327
Stop!

37
00:06:12,528 --> 00:06:13,447
My stance's wrong.

38
00:06:13,447 --> 00:06:14,408
Let me adjust.

39
00:06:16,807 --> 00:06:17,887
Okay.

40
00:06:17,887 --> 00:06:19,048
One, two, three.

41
00:06:19,048 --> 00:06:19,848
No good!

42
00:06:19,848 --> 00:06:21,127
Wait. I'm not ready.

43
00:06:22,168 --> 00:06:23,327
Let me count.

44
00:06:23,488 --> 00:06:24,168
Come on.

45
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:25,247
One.

46
00:06:26,207 --> 00:06:28,088
Two.

47
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:29,567
Three!

48
00:06:31,327 --> 00:06:32,408
Great.

49
00:06:33,007 --> 00:06:33,648
Wait.

50
00:06:39,928 --> 00:06:40,928
Are you okay, Pangzi?

51
00:06:41,728 --> 00:06:43,288
What kind of place is this?

52
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:46,567
It hurts.

53
00:06:47,327 --> 00:06:48,048
I'm not okay.

54
00:06:49,288 --> 00:06:50,807
This looks like an altar.

55
00:06:51,168 --> 00:06:53,048
We've been dragged
to the center of the kiln.

56
00:06:53,767 --> 00:06:55,288
We need to find a way to escape.

57
00:06:55,528 --> 00:06:56,648
Too many ghost hands here.

58
00:06:56,648 --> 00:06:57,608
Actually,

59
00:06:57,807 --> 00:06:58,608
you're right.

60
00:06:58,608 --> 00:06:59,088
Wait.

61
00:06:59,088 --> 00:07:00,767
Have you noticed
that after we came down,

62
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,687
those ghost hands didn't dare follow?

63
00:07:04,288 --> 00:07:05,048
Exactly.

64
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:06,648
They attacked fiercely

65
00:07:06,887 --> 00:07:08,848
like pitcher plants capturing prey,

66
00:07:09,168 --> 00:07:11,247
but only dare
to drain us slowly in the air.

67
00:07:12,207 --> 00:07:13,928
This place must have defenses,

68
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:15,887
repelling the ghost hands.

69
00:07:26,367 --> 00:07:28,608
Then let's stay here for now.

70
00:07:28,608 --> 00:07:29,848
It might be safer.

71
00:07:30,608 --> 00:07:32,007
Don't look at his face!

72
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:33,648
I'm not. I'm not looking.

73
00:07:34,048 --> 00:07:35,007
What's wrong?

74
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:37,897
I never expected King Shang of Lu

75
00:07:38,408 --> 00:07:39,807
to look like this.

76
00:07:41,447 --> 00:07:42,567
This is King Shang of Lu?

77
00:07:43,687 --> 00:07:44,648
You must be kidding.

78
00:07:44,648 --> 00:07:46,007
Lying on the altar like that,

79
00:07:46,447 --> 00:07:47,648
this must be him.

80
00:07:48,207 --> 00:07:49,488
Green-Eyed Fox Corpse.

81
00:07:49,807 --> 00:07:50,728
What?

82
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,288
What is Green-Eyed Fox Corpse?

83
00:07:54,687 --> 00:07:55,848
Legends say

84
00:07:56,528 --> 00:07:59,088
it's a rare congenital deformity.

85
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:02,367
The ancients treated
such deformities as divine,

86
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:04,048
believing them to be spirit-connected.

87
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:07,488
At birth,

88
00:08:08,127 --> 00:08:09,648
they appear normal.

89
00:08:10,088 --> 00:08:11,488
But during puberty,

90
00:08:11,488 --> 00:08:14,608
their faces get pointy

91
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:16,608
and their eyes turn thin.

92
00:08:16,807 --> 00:08:19,247
Then they begin to fear the sunlight,

93
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:22,127
hiding in dark, cold places.

94
00:08:22,648 --> 00:08:24,488
Their bodies shed skin repeatedly,

95
00:08:24,767 --> 00:08:26,367
turning blue-black entirely.

96
00:08:26,848 --> 00:08:29,007
King Shang of Lu has this fox face too.

97
00:08:30,528 --> 00:08:33,087
Does it mean
that he had this deformity too?

98
00:08:37,648 --> 00:08:38,648
Could it be

99
00:08:40,847 --> 00:08:42,687
that he grew twisted
because he was deformed

100
00:08:43,487 --> 00:08:44,727
from childhood?

101
00:08:46,807 --> 00:08:47,768
Young man,

102
00:08:48,368 --> 00:08:50,447
the Green-Eyed Fox Corpse
is extremely sinister.

103
00:08:50,768 --> 00:08:52,248
They say just one look at its face

104
00:08:52,248 --> 00:08:53,327
will infect you,

105
00:08:54,528 --> 00:08:56,807
turning you into their likeness.

106
00:08:57,888 --> 00:08:58,888
Just now,

107
00:08:59,368 --> 00:09:01,288
you didn't look at them, did you?

108
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,888
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

109
00:09:04,888 --> 00:09:06,888
I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it.

110
00:09:06,888 --> 00:09:08,168
I truly didn't mean it.

111
00:09:08,487 --> 00:09:10,128
I didn't mean it.

112
00:09:10,128 --> 00:09:11,248
I didn't mean it.

113
00:09:11,248 --> 00:09:12,288
You won't change.

114
00:09:12,528 --> 00:09:13,687
I just made that up.

115
00:09:17,928 --> 00:09:19,567
This young lady's quite pretty.

116
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:22,327
Wait, I should call her granny instead.

117
00:09:22,807 --> 00:09:24,128
Are you out of your mind?

118
00:09:25,008 --> 00:09:27,048
Speaking of which, what's your name?

119
00:09:28,087 --> 00:09:29,768
I've already introduced myself.

120
00:09:31,248 --> 00:09:32,327
I'm Wu Xie.

121
00:09:33,087 --> 00:09:33,807
Wu,

122
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,128
look at this granny here.

123
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:37,288
She's been lying here for millennia,

124
00:09:37,847 --> 00:09:39,207
yet her skin remains intact.

125
00:09:39,807 --> 00:09:42,087
The preservation method
could be commercial gold.

126
00:09:42,087 --> 00:09:43,128
Stop the nonsense.

127
00:09:43,807 --> 00:09:45,888
Help me pry her off first.

128
00:09:47,248 --> 00:09:49,008
Maybe she fancies you.

129
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:51,727
Harder.

130
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:52,768
One, two, three.

131
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:02,888
She is so strong.

132
00:10:03,184 --> 00:10:05,552
I could hear bones cracking,
but she still wouldn't let go.

133
00:10:05,768 --> 00:10:06,687
I've got an idea.

134
00:10:07,368 --> 00:10:08,727
Move your head back.

135
00:10:09,048 --> 00:10:10,048
No way! Don't!

136
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:11,327
What're you doing?

137
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:12,687
Are you going to chop her?

138
00:10:13,327 --> 00:10:14,528
What if there's poison?

139
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:15,847
She's done nothing,

140
00:10:15,847 --> 00:10:17,168
but you try to chop her arm off.

141
00:10:17,447 --> 00:10:18,327
Does that seem right?

142
00:10:20,447 --> 00:10:23,048
You're quite the gallant one, huh?

143
00:10:23,048 --> 00:10:24,528
Stop the nonsense. Find a solution.

144
00:10:26,847 --> 00:10:27,567
Fine.

145
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:29,528
I will find a way.

146
00:10:32,607 --> 00:10:33,327
Listen.

147
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,648
If corpses remain undecayed after death,

148
00:10:36,008 --> 00:10:38,327
there must be
a unique preservation technique.

149
00:10:39,008 --> 00:10:40,368
When you came down earlier,

150
00:10:40,528 --> 00:10:42,487
did you notice anything unusual?

151
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:47,408
Oh, right.

152
00:10:47,607 --> 00:10:49,207
There seems to be something
in her mouth.

153
00:10:58,207 --> 00:10:59,248
Look.

154
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:00,768
How tragic.

155
00:11:00,768 --> 00:11:01,727
Shoving such a big key

156
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:02,847
into such a small mouth.

157
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:04,368
She must be suffering.

158
00:11:05,048 --> 00:11:05,928
I bet

159
00:11:05,928 --> 00:11:07,768
she'll let go if you remove the key.

160
00:11:16,288 --> 00:11:17,567
Are you scared?

161
00:11:18,288 --> 00:11:19,344
You do it if you are not.

162
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:20,176
Fine, I'll do it.

163
00:11:22,607 --> 00:11:23,928
Wait, you're so close together.

164
00:11:23,928 --> 00:11:25,447
How do I reach between you?

165
00:11:25,447 --> 00:11:26,408
Then stop yapping.

166
00:11:26,408 --> 00:11:27,528
I'll handle it myself.

167
00:11:27,928 --> 00:11:29,687
Fine. Handle it yourself then.

168
00:11:49,128 --> 00:11:49,847
Stop!

169
00:11:50,008 --> 00:11:50,807
Wu Xie,

170
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:52,087
this level of mechanism

171
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:53,207
is beyond your skills.

172
00:11:53,648 --> 00:11:54,928
One touch could kill you.

173
00:11:55,327 --> 00:11:56,567
Don't act recklessly.

174
00:11:58,248 --> 00:11:58,967
Third Uncle.

175
00:12:00,248 --> 00:12:01,207
You can see me?

176
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:02,487
Where are you?

177
00:12:03,327 --> 00:12:04,687
I'm below the steps.

178
00:12:05,087 --> 00:12:06,447
I'll explain later.

179
00:12:07,248 --> 00:12:08,727
Now, follow my instructions.

180
00:12:09,248 --> 00:12:10,847
Tilt the corpse's head down.

181
00:12:11,288 --> 00:12:12,408
Use your thumb

182
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:13,768
to press her throat,

183
00:12:13,768 --> 00:12:14,967
and slap the back of her head.

184
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:15,928
Remember.

185
00:12:15,928 --> 00:12:17,368
You must press her throat firmly.

186
00:12:17,368 --> 00:12:19,128
Or she'll swallow the key.

187
00:12:41,368 --> 00:12:42,687
What's this?

188
00:12:48,008 --> 00:12:48,847
Wu Xie,

189
00:12:49,408 --> 00:12:51,048
there's a fat guy with you, right?

190
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:52,408
Yes.

191
00:12:52,687 --> 00:12:54,487
Did you find anything odd about him?

192
00:13:00,727 --> 00:13:01,727
Not really.

193
00:13:02,768 --> 00:13:03,607
Listen carefully.

194
00:13:03,847 --> 00:13:05,168
Let me tell you something.

195
00:13:05,288 --> 00:13:06,168
Don't panic.

196
00:13:06,168 --> 00:13:07,528
The person before you

197
00:13:07,528 --> 00:13:09,008
isn't the real Pangzi.

198
00:13:09,807 --> 00:13:11,528
The real one is with our team.

199
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:13,768
Pan Zi and Da Kui are interrogating him.

200
00:13:14,447 --> 00:13:15,967
So you need to stay alert.

201
00:13:19,207 --> 00:13:20,727
T-That's impossible.

202
00:13:20,928 --> 00:13:22,288
I've encountered

203
00:13:22,487 --> 00:13:24,288
similar experiences when I was young.

204
00:13:24,592 --> 00:13:26,336
Just now, he was urging you

205
00:13:26,336 --> 00:13:28,336
to put your hand
into that female corpse's mouth,

206
00:13:28,336 --> 00:13:28,976
right?

207
00:13:29,528 --> 00:13:30,847
He was trying to harm you.

208
00:13:31,408 --> 00:13:32,607
What should I do now?

209
00:13:33,888 --> 00:13:35,008
No matter what he says,

210
00:13:35,207 --> 00:13:36,408
don't believe any of it.

211
00:13:37,168 --> 00:13:37,967
Right now,

212
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:39,727
look around for anything useful nearby.

213
00:13:39,727 --> 00:13:40,528
Quick!

214
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:57,368
What are you doing?

215
00:13:58,248 --> 00:13:59,567
How dare you

216
00:14:00,768 --> 00:14:02,727
lie to me?

217
00:14:08,207 --> 00:14:09,008
What are you doing?

218
00:14:22,888 --> 00:14:23,768
Stay back!

219
00:14:24,248 --> 00:14:25,008
Stay back!

220
00:14:25,168 --> 00:14:25,928
Stay back!

221
00:14:26,168 --> 00:14:26,928
Stay back!

222
00:15:39,408 --> 00:15:40,248
Pangzi.

223
00:15:44,888 --> 00:15:45,648
Pangzi.

224
00:15:45,928 --> 00:15:46,607
Pangzi.

225
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:50,967
Don't look into his eyes.

226
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:09,288
This isn't right.

227
00:16:32,087 --> 00:16:32,928
Wu.

228
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:34,048
What?

229
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:36,288
Did I strangle her?

230
00:16:37,327 --> 00:16:38,888
You nearly strangled me.

231
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:42,288
What do you mean?

232
00:16:42,687 --> 00:16:43,648
Just now,

233
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,087
we were hallucinating.

234
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:51,567
Was I strangling you this whole time?

235
00:16:54,687 --> 00:16:55,847
Sorry, bro.

236
00:16:56,487 --> 00:16:57,967
I genuinely didn't realize...

237
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:04,928
Why does my head hurt so bad?

238
00:17:06,687 --> 00:17:08,128
Why does my head hurt so bad?

239
00:17:13,088 --> 00:17:14,568
There's even a lump here.

240
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,568
You fell on the ground earlier.

241
00:17:25,928 --> 00:17:26,608
No.

242
00:17:27,007 --> 00:17:28,447
I landed on my left side.

243
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:29,848
Why is there a lump on the right?

244
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:32,727
I must've been hit by something.

245
00:17:33,808 --> 00:17:35,487
When did we start the hallucination?

246
00:17:35,608 --> 00:17:37,007
And why did we start hallucinating?

247
00:17:38,328 --> 00:17:39,727
Since we're here,

248
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:41,527
it should be
after going down the platform.

249
00:17:41,808 --> 00:17:42,848
Could it be related

250
00:17:42,848 --> 00:17:44,608
to looking at the Green-Eyed Fox Corpse?

251
00:17:44,608 --> 00:17:45,808
I don't know either.

252
00:17:46,447 --> 00:17:48,207
But there must be
a more logical explanation.

253
00:17:48,336 --> 00:17:50,192
We couldn't have shared
the same hallucination.

254
00:17:50,192 --> 00:17:50,967
Well...

255
00:17:51,328 --> 00:17:53,047
Maybe it's related
to the elixir he took?

256
00:17:53,888 --> 00:17:55,487
Anyway, just stop looking at him.

257
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:04,432
- Just in time,
- Your box...

258
00:18:04,432 --> 00:18:05,207
come take a look.

259
00:18:07,368 --> 00:18:08,568
Quick. Hurry up.

260
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,648
Quick.

261
00:18:09,648 --> 00:18:11,088
W-What should I look at?

262
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,328
Do you see this hole here?

263
00:18:14,168 --> 00:18:15,047
What about it?

264
00:18:16,168 --> 00:18:17,007
Take this.

265
00:18:21,408 --> 00:18:22,288
Doesn't this look like

266
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:23,928
a key?

267
00:18:24,287 --> 00:18:26,128
Doesn't it look a bit new?

268
00:18:27,248 --> 00:18:27,984
Just now,

269
00:18:27,984 --> 00:18:30,668
in the hallucination, Third Uncle
said to slap the back of her head.

270
00:18:31,047 --> 00:18:31,888
Should we slap it?

271
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,767
You'd trust words from a hallucination?

272
00:18:37,247 --> 00:18:38,368
This box

273
00:18:38,568 --> 00:18:39,888
is probably a fake.

274
00:18:39,888 --> 00:18:40,727
This craftsmanship

275
00:18:40,727 --> 00:18:42,487
was developed in Germany
a few years ago.

276
00:18:43,648 --> 00:18:44,608
Where have you seen it?

277
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:46,328
Panjiayuan's full of them.

278
00:18:49,447 --> 00:18:50,608
Then I'll take it out.

279
00:18:53,088 --> 00:18:53,727
Fake.

280
00:18:54,287 --> 00:18:55,287
It should be fake.

281
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:13,648
Look. There's a silk thread.

282
00:19:20,128 --> 00:19:22,247
There's something in her belly?

283
00:19:28,048 --> 00:19:31,120
(Mechanism explanation)

284
00:19:32,608 --> 00:19:34,287
Didn't expect it's really a mechanism.

285
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:37,487
Be careful.

286
00:19:37,487 --> 00:19:38,608
There should be

287
00:19:38,608 --> 00:19:40,128
a hidden crossbow mechanism inside.

288
00:19:40,808 --> 00:19:41,608
The ancients

289
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,368
loved placing

290
00:19:43,848 --> 00:19:45,088
crossbows in corpses.

291
00:19:45,648 --> 00:19:47,687
They'd connect the mechanism
with golden threads.

292
00:19:48,328 --> 00:19:49,888
If tomb raiders didn't know it

293
00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:52,007
and remove everything
from the corpse's mouth,

294
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:54,168
they'd inevitably snap the threads,

295
00:19:55,047 --> 00:19:56,088
triggering the crossbow

296
00:19:56,088 --> 00:19:57,088
in her belly.

297
00:19:57,408 --> 00:19:59,047
Bows would pierce through the corpse.

298
00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:00,247
At that moment,

299
00:20:00,247 --> 00:20:01,568
with people standing close,

300
00:20:02,207 --> 00:20:03,207
there's no way to dodge.

301
00:20:03,888 --> 00:20:05,128
So we must not

302
00:20:05,928 --> 00:20:07,608
break these golden threads.

303
00:20:08,128 --> 00:20:09,767
We can only

304
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:12,007
snap it softly.

305
00:20:13,848 --> 00:20:14,487
Done.

306
00:20:14,928 --> 00:20:15,967
How'd you know that?

307
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:16,687
I'm good, right?

308
00:20:17,368 --> 00:20:18,568
How did her hands let go?

309
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:21,608
Is she trying to...?

310
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:31,447
Are you okay?

311
00:20:36,648 --> 00:20:37,287
Wu,

312
00:20:38,247 --> 00:20:39,608
didn't you say snapping the thread

313
00:20:39,608 --> 00:20:41,088
wouldn't trigger the mechanism?

314
00:20:41,767 --> 00:20:43,888
Did you snap it wrong?

315
00:20:45,487 --> 00:20:47,088
If this is a defense mechanism,

316
00:20:47,608 --> 00:20:49,447
that means the contents of this box

317
00:20:49,447 --> 00:20:50,687
are incredibly valuable.

318
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:54,007
It'll be at least the Gui Seal.

319
00:20:55,328 --> 00:20:56,487
But that's not right.

320
00:20:56,848 --> 00:20:58,247
How would an ancient mechanism

321
00:20:58,247 --> 00:21:00,047
be connected

322
00:21:00,047 --> 00:21:01,007
to a German-made key?

323
00:21:08,888 --> 00:21:10,527
Actually, we could leave now.

324
00:21:11,808 --> 00:21:14,368
The real Gui Seal must've been taken.

325
00:21:14,487 --> 00:21:15,967
They left a fake here

326
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:17,967
to mislead anyone who came after.

327
00:21:18,848 --> 00:21:19,608
Where's the key?

328
00:21:19,608 --> 00:21:20,608
Right here.

329
00:21:33,287 --> 00:21:34,328
Did you use enough force?

330
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,568
I almost snapped it in half.

331
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,928
The key shape matches perfectly.

332
00:21:42,928 --> 00:21:44,287
Why won't it open?

333
00:21:46,487 --> 00:21:48,007
It must've been made by amateurs.

334
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:49,007
It's missing parts.

335
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:57,687
What's happening?

336
00:22:11,007 --> 00:22:11,808
Wu.

337
00:22:12,608 --> 00:22:13,888
It's just decomposition.

338
00:22:16,648 --> 00:22:18,128
You scared me to death.

339
00:22:22,168 --> 00:22:24,368
I never thought the key
had preservation properties.

340
00:22:25,088 --> 00:22:26,207
That shot earlier

341
00:22:26,207 --> 00:22:27,287
must've pierced her belly.

342
00:22:27,608 --> 00:22:29,608
Air got inside
and sped up decomposition.

343
00:22:30,447 --> 00:22:31,408
Wait, Pangzi.

344
00:22:31,888 --> 00:22:33,408
Is something missing here?

345
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:35,967
There really is...

346
00:22:36,368 --> 00:22:38,088
Where's the fox corpse?

347
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:39,888
When did it disappear?

348
00:22:41,687 --> 00:22:43,047
Could it be that King Shang of Lu

349
00:22:43,527 --> 00:22:44,648
is alive?

350
00:22:46,128 --> 00:22:47,928
Did his immortality elixir work?

351
00:22:51,128 --> 00:22:52,328
Be careful.

352
00:22:58,967 --> 00:22:59,848
Pangzi,

353
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:01,368
this place is too sinister.

354
00:23:01,608 --> 00:23:02,287
Hurry. Let's go.

355
00:23:02,287 --> 00:23:03,328
Hurry up.

356
00:23:07,168 --> 00:23:08,168
Be careful.

357
00:23:09,247 --> 00:23:09,808
Go.

358
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:10,928
Hurry, Pangzi.

359
00:23:12,888 --> 00:23:13,767
- Go.
- Go.

360
00:23:27,088 --> 00:23:28,247
Wu Xie!

361
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:30,767
Wu Xie, where are you?

362
00:23:31,247 --> 00:23:32,408
Is that Wu Xie?

363
00:23:32,727 --> 00:23:33,727
Wu Xie!

364
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:37,128
Can you hear me?

365
00:23:38,328 --> 00:23:39,608
Young Third Master!

366
00:23:41,207 --> 00:23:42,487
What?

367
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:43,727
It's safe here.

368
00:23:43,727 --> 00:23:44,727
Just call out.

369
00:23:45,608 --> 00:23:46,527
What?

370
00:23:47,007 --> 00:23:48,687
Third Uncle, what are you saying?

371
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:51,007
Wu Xie!

372
00:23:51,608 --> 00:23:53,408
What?

373
00:23:59,088 --> 00:24:01,168
Stay there and wait for us, okay?

374
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:04,007
Third Uncle, what are you saying?

375
00:24:04,007 --> 00:24:04,928
Wu Xie!

376
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:07,408
Don't leave that passageway!

377
00:24:07,408 --> 00:24:08,967
There's Tianxin Rock up there.

378
00:24:08,967 --> 00:24:10,447
The snake cypress can't pass through.

379
00:24:11,207 --> 00:24:12,408
What?

380
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:16,128
Stay over there!

381
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:18,808
Speak louder!

382
00:24:18,808 --> 00:24:20,648
I can't hear you!

383
00:24:22,888 --> 00:24:23,767
Behind you!

384
00:24:23,888 --> 00:24:25,287
Watch your back!

385
00:24:26,408 --> 00:24:27,207
What?

386
00:24:27,527 --> 00:24:28,767
What are they saying there?

387
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,047
I can't hear a single word.

388
00:24:32,568 --> 00:24:33,727
I can't hear them either.

389
00:24:33,727 --> 00:24:34,527
Behind you!

390
00:24:34,648 --> 00:24:36,007
Watch your back!

391
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:53,368
Young Third Master,

392
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:54,487
get out of the way!

393
00:24:54,888 --> 00:24:55,687
Oh, no.

394
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:57,128
It's controlling him.

395
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:57,848
Get up.

396
00:24:58,487 --> 00:24:59,168
Come on.

397
00:24:59,608 --> 00:25:00,247
Draw the bow.

398
00:25:05,928 --> 00:25:06,568
What's wrong?

399
00:25:06,568 --> 00:25:07,767
Why are you frozen?

400
00:25:11,568 --> 00:25:13,136
Dazzled by my handsome face, right?

401
00:25:14,727 --> 00:25:16,328
Pangzi, don't move.

402
00:25:16,608 --> 00:25:17,447
What?

403
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:19,368
There's something on your back!

404
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,967
Loose!

405
00:25:38,928 --> 00:25:40,007
Got him!

406
00:25:40,007 --> 00:25:40,928
Take care of Pan Zi.

407
00:25:40,928 --> 00:25:41,767
I'll go first.

408
00:26:06,568 --> 00:26:07,328
Wu Xie.

409
00:26:09,128 --> 00:26:09,928
Wu Xie.

410
00:26:10,928 --> 00:26:11,727
Wu Xie.

411
00:26:13,727 --> 00:26:14,447
Third Uncle.

412
00:26:17,888 --> 00:26:18,888
What's wrong with you?

413
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:20,088
Are you okay?

414
00:26:20,648 --> 00:26:21,368
I'm fine.

415
00:26:25,368 --> 00:26:26,928
You really reek.

416
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,207
Good that you're okay.

417
00:26:30,007 --> 00:26:30,727
Third Uncle,

418
00:26:30,928 --> 00:26:32,287
it's too sinister.

419
00:26:32,487 --> 00:26:33,848
Just one glance and I was trapped.

420
00:26:34,128 --> 00:26:35,128
I couldn't move at all.

421
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:37,608
Third Uncle,
just now in the hallucination,

422
00:26:37,608 --> 00:26:39,047
you almost killed me.

423
00:26:39,687 --> 00:26:40,967
Then how do you know

424
00:26:41,447 --> 00:26:43,207
that I'm not a hallucination now?

425
00:26:47,088 --> 00:26:47,767
Impossible.

426
00:26:48,048 --> 00:26:49,447
You looked so disgusted with me.

427
00:26:49,447 --> 00:26:50,808
You couldn't be a hallucination.

428
00:26:51,168 --> 00:26:52,408
Who is not disgusted with you?

429
00:26:57,568 --> 00:26:58,247
Third Uncle,

430
00:26:58,608 --> 00:26:59,888
Pan Zi's shot was amazing.

431
00:27:00,015 --> 00:27:01,415
It pierced right through his bones.

432
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:03,007
How did he do it?

433
00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:04,447
It's not the arrow's power.

434
00:27:04,608 --> 00:27:07,287
His skull bones had already crumbled.

435
00:27:07,287 --> 00:27:08,088
Third Uncle,

436
00:27:08,287 --> 00:27:09,527
don't look at his eyes.

437
00:27:09,888 --> 00:27:10,447
Yes.

438
00:27:10,888 --> 00:27:11,568
Don't look.

439
00:27:19,287 --> 00:27:20,207
No problem.

440
00:27:20,608 --> 00:27:21,967
His eyes are fake.

441
00:27:24,568 --> 00:27:25,848
They were made of stone

442
00:27:26,368 --> 00:27:27,888
and embedded later.

443
00:27:28,888 --> 00:27:30,527
What trapped you in hallucinations

444
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:31,727
was this hexagonal bell.

445
00:27:31,727 --> 00:27:32,767
It's broken now.

446
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:36,888
This bell again.

447
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,447
Thought it was
a daytime corpse resurrection.

448
00:27:41,928 --> 00:27:43,007
From our perspective,

449
00:27:43,007 --> 00:27:44,808
Pangzi was carrying him while walking.

450
00:27:45,287 --> 00:27:46,967
You must've been influenced
by the fox mask

451
00:27:46,967 --> 00:27:48,727
and the bell's psychological suggestion.

452
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:51,687
Did you have close contact
with him earlier

453
00:27:54,128 --> 00:27:55,848
and then inhaled hallucinogenic powder?

454
00:28:02,408 --> 00:28:03,047
What?

455
00:28:03,328 --> 00:28:04,128
Third Uncle,

456
00:28:04,447 --> 00:28:06,168
we inhaled it multiple times.

457
00:28:06,287 --> 00:28:08,287
Then why did Pangzi and I

458
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:10,128
share the same hallucination?

459
00:28:11,727 --> 00:28:13,808
Do you know mass hallucinations?

460
00:28:14,128 --> 00:28:15,447
Because of identical bells?

461
00:28:15,447 --> 00:28:16,608
Half right.

462
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:18,168
You

463
00:28:18,527 --> 00:28:19,608
have remarkable resilience.

464
00:28:19,767 --> 00:28:22,207
You survived
after being haunted by this.

465
00:28:22,408 --> 00:28:23,848
Show your gratitude to the heavens.

466
00:28:24,527 --> 00:28:25,447
I've got it.

467
00:28:25,648 --> 00:28:26,848
This is a poison-eagle.

468
00:28:27,767 --> 00:28:29,487
The mask looks like a fox,

469
00:28:29,487 --> 00:28:31,247
but it actually represents an eagle.

470
00:28:32,527 --> 00:28:35,168
Poison-eagle's a monster
from the Classic of Mountains and Seas.

471
00:28:35,168 --> 00:28:35,808
Legend says

472
00:28:35,808 --> 00:28:37,727
its cry induces hallucinations.

473
00:28:37,727 --> 00:28:40,328
Actually, no such creature exists.

474
00:28:40,328 --> 00:28:41,207
The ancients used

475
00:28:41,687 --> 00:28:42,527
an eagle-shaped bell

476
00:28:42,527 --> 00:28:44,624
to mimic its call and worship

477
00:28:44,624 --> 00:28:45,456
the heavens.

478
00:28:46,368 --> 00:28:46,967
How's that?

479
00:28:46,967 --> 00:28:47,687
All matched.

480
00:28:47,687 --> 00:28:49,287
What matched?

481
00:28:49,287 --> 00:28:50,287
Impressive.

482
00:28:51,128 --> 00:28:52,767
You look like a fool.

483
00:28:53,687 --> 00:28:54,928
Poison-eagle?

484
00:28:54,928 --> 00:28:56,287
Read some science books.

485
00:28:57,552 --> 00:28:59,088
Don't laugh. He's talking about you.

486
00:28:59,408 --> 00:29:00,207
Third Master!

487
00:29:00,207 --> 00:29:01,767
Enough jokes. Pan Zi's here.

488
00:29:02,287 --> 00:29:03,287
He saved your life.

489
00:29:03,287 --> 00:29:04,207
Go kowtow to him.

490
00:29:08,928 --> 00:29:10,736
- Pan Zi.
- Young Third Master.

491
00:29:10,736 --> 00:29:12,128
- Are you okay?
- I'll take this.

492
00:29:12,247 --> 00:29:13,727
Third Master asked you to kowtow.

493
00:29:13,727 --> 00:29:14,608
Do it now.

494
00:29:14,928 --> 00:29:15,848
I absolutely will.

495
00:29:16,207 --> 00:29:17,527
If not for your shoot earlier,

496
00:29:17,527 --> 00:29:18,648
I'd be dead meat.

497
00:29:19,128 --> 00:29:20,207
You brat.

498
00:29:21,527 --> 00:29:22,967
Don't celebrate too soon.

499
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,368
It's not over yet.

500
00:29:27,928 --> 00:29:28,687
Bro,

501
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:31,608
thanks for saving us just now.

502
00:29:34,687 --> 00:29:35,928
How did you get out?

503
00:29:36,287 --> 00:29:37,608
I'm tough to kill.

504
00:29:41,007 --> 00:29:41,928
Those vines

505
00:29:41,928 --> 00:29:43,007
are so terrifying?

506
00:29:44,568 --> 00:29:46,168
We've got a secret weapon.

507
00:29:47,808 --> 00:29:48,888
Let me show you.

508
00:29:49,128 --> 00:29:50,727
- They're terrified of this.
- Come on.

509
00:29:51,447 --> 00:29:52,447
Stone?

510
00:29:52,447 --> 00:29:54,207
The vines fear this stone?

511
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,808
This stone's called Tianxin Rock.

512
00:29:58,687 --> 00:30:00,287
It's specifically used to suppress

513
00:30:00,487 --> 00:30:02,888
the creature
called Nine-Headed Snake Cypress.

514
00:30:03,967 --> 00:30:04,808
Look.

515
00:30:05,648 --> 00:30:07,088
The snake cypress parasites

516
00:30:07,088 --> 00:30:08,767
on that giant tree over there.

517
00:30:09,527 --> 00:30:10,568
There's a tree there?

518
00:30:11,088 --> 00:30:12,007
Look closer.

519
00:30:12,168 --> 00:30:13,408
The fog's clearing.

520
00:30:22,608 --> 00:30:24,447
Good heavens!

521
00:30:25,047 --> 00:30:26,967
Something's moving in the tree.

522
00:30:29,007 --> 00:30:30,527
These are Nine-Headed Snake Cypresses?

523
00:30:32,527 --> 00:30:34,687
There seems to be something
hanging beneath them.

524
00:30:36,328 --> 00:30:37,007
They're...

525
00:30:38,207 --> 00:30:39,648
They're corpses.

526
00:30:41,487 --> 00:30:43,207
