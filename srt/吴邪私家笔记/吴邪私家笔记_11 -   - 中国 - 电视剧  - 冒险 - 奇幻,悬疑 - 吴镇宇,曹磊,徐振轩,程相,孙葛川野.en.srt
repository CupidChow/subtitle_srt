00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:44,144
=Episode 11=

3
00:01:54,436 --> 00:01:55,796
You know the location?

4
00:02:07,037 --> 00:02:08,036
Are you sure it's here?

5
00:02:09,732 --> 00:02:10,256
Yes.

6
00:02:16,117 --> 00:02:17,077
Yong.

7
00:02:18,476 --> 00:02:19,436
What's wrong, boss?

8
00:02:20,036 --> 00:02:22,357
Tell the captain to go
full speed to these coordinates.

9
00:02:22,357 --> 00:02:23,156
Got it!

10
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:25,117
Thank you.

11
00:02:25,117 --> 00:02:26,277
You may return to rest now.

12
00:02:26,636 --> 00:02:27,357
Great.

13
00:02:27,957 --> 00:02:30,196
I saw plenty of fish at the bow earlier.

14
00:02:30,876 --> 00:02:31,876
I'll pick a big one.

15
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,237
How about stone-pot fish for dinner?

16
00:02:34,896 --> 00:02:35,997
Pickled fish is fine too.

17
00:02:35,997 --> 00:02:37,476
I'm getting hungry too.

18
00:02:50,517 --> 00:02:51,397
Wang,

19
00:02:52,557 --> 00:02:54,557
I'm not criticizing you,
but you youngsters today

20
00:02:55,277 --> 00:02:58,196
have absolutely
terrible safety awareness.

21
00:02:58,196 --> 00:02:59,237
When boarding a ship,

22
00:02:59,517 --> 00:03:01,596
you should put on
life jackets immediately.

23
00:03:02,277 --> 00:03:03,636
As the saying goes,

24
00:03:03,837 --> 00:03:06,876
better safe than sorry.

25
00:03:06,876 --> 00:03:08,277
Enough nonsense.

26
00:03:08,357 --> 00:03:09,436
Life jackets?

27
00:03:09,436 --> 00:03:11,876
The thing you're wearing
isn't a real life jacket.

28
00:03:11,876 --> 00:03:12,517
You know?

29
00:03:12,636 --> 00:03:14,716
It's technically called a buoyancy vest.

30
00:03:15,117 --> 00:03:16,117
Not life jacket at all.

31
00:03:16,957 --> 00:03:18,156
If you're so scared of dying,

32
00:03:18,316 --> 00:03:20,957
put on the heavy rapid-flow vest.

33
00:03:21,316 --> 00:03:22,316
Got it?

34
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:23,596
What?

35
00:03:23,797 --> 00:03:25,397
The one with leg straps

36
00:03:25,596 --> 00:03:26,997
looping through the crotch.

37
00:03:27,756 --> 00:03:28,476
Alright.

38
00:03:29,316 --> 00:03:30,397
Wasted breath.

39
00:03:42,237 --> 00:03:44,357
(I noticed something very strange.)

40
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:46,797
(Ms. Wenjin documented many events.)

41
00:03:46,797 --> 00:03:48,876
(They totally contradict
what Third Uncle said.)

42
00:03:51,237 --> 00:03:53,036
(According to Ms. Wenjin's notes,)

43
00:03:53,397 --> 00:03:55,756
(Third Uncle kept
helping them plan routes)

44
00:03:56,156 --> 00:03:58,756
(and guided them to valuable resources.)

45
00:03:59,957 --> 00:04:01,677
(Even Ms. Wenjin didn't anticipate)

46
00:04:02,436 --> 00:04:03,517
(how deeply Third Uncle)

47
00:04:03,517 --> 00:04:05,237
(understood maritime navigation.)

48
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:09,677
(Throughout this journey,)

49
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,277
(Sanxing's contributions to the team)

50
00:04:12,397 --> 00:04:14,436
(were far more crucial
than my role as captain.)

51
00:04:15,036 --> 00:04:16,956
(His familiarity with the Ru Sea area.)

52
00:04:18,237 --> 00:04:19,477
(His route planning)

53
00:04:19,477 --> 00:04:21,276
(saved us significant time.)

54
00:04:22,157 --> 00:04:23,997
(Surprisingly, Sanxing was more skilled)

55
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,196
(than us marine research students.)

56
00:04:27,196 --> 00:04:28,477
(From him,)

57
00:04:28,997 --> 00:04:29,997
(I learned many things)

58
00:04:29,997 --> 00:04:31,956
(beyond classroom teachings.)

59
00:04:32,717 --> 00:04:33,717
(His courage)

60
00:04:33,836 --> 00:04:34,797
(and decisiveness)

61
00:04:35,357 --> 00:04:37,276
(always calmed me during panic.)

62
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:38,836
(Yet regarding Sanxing,)

63
00:04:39,117 --> 00:04:40,636
(I sometimes feel)

64
00:04:40,636 --> 00:04:42,237
(he's utterly inscrutable,)

65
00:04:42,636 --> 00:04:44,557
(like this very ocean.)

66
00:04:45,477 --> 00:04:47,276
(He's right before my eyes,)

67
00:04:47,756 --> 00:04:49,237
(yet endlessly unfathomable.)

68
00:04:51,956 --> 00:04:54,717
(Sanxing shows constant care,)

69
00:04:55,597 --> 00:04:56,956
(yet sometimes)

70
00:04:57,396 --> 00:04:59,157
(vanishes unpredictably.)

71
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,917
Are you looking for me?

72
00:05:07,797 --> 00:05:10,076
You disappeared early morning.
Where were you?

73
00:05:15,756 --> 00:05:16,677
You...

74
00:05:17,636 --> 00:05:18,797
Close your eyes.

75
00:05:33,237 --> 00:05:34,436
I went to find this.

76
00:05:35,677 --> 00:05:36,396
I wanted

77
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:39,276
to preserve this sea forever.

78
00:05:43,917 --> 00:05:45,997
(This shell is dry.)

79
00:05:46,237 --> 00:05:49,516
(Sanxing, what are you hiding?)

80
00:05:53,677 --> 00:05:55,797
(Chen Wenjin's notes)
(Back then, Third Uncle told me)

81
00:05:55,997 --> 00:05:58,636
(Ms. Wenjin wanted to explore
deep-sea resources,)

82
00:05:59,117 --> 00:06:01,316
(but actually he was the one
who insisted.)

83
00:06:02,717 --> 00:06:03,636
Sanxing,

84
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:07,436
I agree this expedition goes too far.

85
00:06:09,756 --> 00:06:11,717
We're inadequately equipped too.

86
00:06:13,876 --> 00:06:15,836
We've gathered sufficient findings.

87
00:06:18,117 --> 00:06:20,516
Maybe we should go back.

88
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:21,917
Go back?

89
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:23,600
No.

90
00:06:24,157 --> 00:06:25,276
We can't go back.

91
00:06:25,956 --> 00:06:26,597
Wenjin,

92
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:29,117
this is an exceptionally
rare opportunity.

93
00:06:29,237 --> 00:06:30,876
Compared to previous discoveries,

94
00:06:31,037 --> 00:06:33,076
if we find oil this time,

95
00:06:33,316 --> 00:06:34,997
it'll shock the whole nation.

96
00:06:34,997 --> 00:06:36,557
I don't care about that.

97
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:38,357
Of course, I know.

98
00:06:39,157 --> 00:06:39,956
But you need to know

99
00:06:39,956 --> 00:06:41,836
how significant this is.

100
00:06:41,997 --> 00:06:43,516
You know this perfectly well.

101
00:06:44,956 --> 00:06:45,997
Trust me,

102
00:06:47,196 --> 00:06:47,997
okay?

103
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,516
(I have a terrible suspicion.)

104
00:06:54,157 --> 00:06:55,436
(It seems Third Uncle)

105
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:58,076
(had been deliberately leading them
to that sunken ship.)

106
00:07:05,516 --> 00:07:06,076
(Hurry!)

107
00:07:06,836 --> 00:07:08,836
(Everyone, suit up
and get in the water!)

108
00:07:08,836 --> 00:07:09,836
- Okay!
- Let's go!

109
00:07:51,917 --> 00:07:54,997
Let's thank Comrade Wu Sanxing.

110
00:07:54,997 --> 00:07:55,917
Clap for him!

111
00:07:58,196 --> 00:07:59,357
(Why did Third Uncle claim)

112
00:07:59,357 --> 00:08:01,316
(that Ms. Wenjin led them
to the shipwreck?)

113
00:08:01,557 --> 00:08:03,037
(Why did he lie to me?)

114
00:08:03,396 --> 00:08:04,516
(Who was telling the truth,)

115
00:08:04,516 --> 00:08:05,876
(him or Ms. Wenjin?)

116
00:08:08,756 --> 00:08:11,677
(What exactly happened back then?)

117
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,956
(Will this trip)

118
00:08:28,597 --> 00:08:30,316
(give us answers?)

119
00:08:41,516 --> 00:08:42,317
What are you doing?

120
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:45,636
Still awake?

121
00:08:52,276 --> 00:08:53,276
Enjoying the view?

122
00:08:56,756 --> 00:08:57,717
Feeling gloomy again?

123
00:08:58,317 --> 00:08:59,077
Got dumped.

124
00:09:02,896 --> 00:09:04,516
I'll go back to sleep
if you keep silent.

125
00:09:04,957 --> 00:09:05,916
I'm really sleepy.

126
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,117
If someone

127
00:09:10,756 --> 00:09:12,957
you deeply trust lies to you,

128
00:09:14,756 --> 00:09:15,876
what would you do?

129
00:09:17,796 --> 00:09:18,717
Lie to you?

130
00:09:23,756 --> 00:09:25,396
Did you lose anything?

131
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:28,676
Not really.

132
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,197
Then who cares?

133
00:09:36,756 --> 00:09:38,837
If he lied,

134
00:09:40,437 --> 00:09:41,636
maybe he has

135
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:44,597
certain hidden reasons.

136
00:09:46,676 --> 00:09:48,197
Of course.

137
00:09:48,477 --> 00:09:49,477
He lied,

138
00:09:49,477 --> 00:09:50,756
so there must be reasons.

139
00:09:55,837 --> 00:09:56,756
Pangzi,

140
00:09:58,477 --> 00:10:00,437
have you always been like this,

141
00:10:00,636 --> 00:10:02,916
carefree about everything?

142
00:10:11,396 --> 00:10:14,597
Not entirely carefree,

143
00:10:18,237 --> 00:10:19,796
but I

144
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,636
don't care about the stuff

145
00:10:21,756 --> 00:10:23,477
others obsess over.

146
00:10:24,317 --> 00:10:25,117
Well...

147
00:10:25,837 --> 00:10:28,357
Your thirst for truth
is just too fierce.

148
00:10:36,477 --> 00:10:38,036
I was like you in my youth,

149
00:10:38,197 --> 00:10:39,477
craving all knowledge,

150
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,276
insatiably curious.

151
00:10:42,237 --> 00:10:43,717
But gradually, I learned

152
00:10:45,197 --> 00:10:46,156
it's useless.

153
00:10:47,957 --> 00:10:51,317
Look. Many people just love

154
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,556
to look far ahead,

155
00:10:56,237 --> 00:10:57,556
always planning for the future,

156
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,556
as if they could figure out

157
00:11:01,636 --> 00:11:02,916
the whole truth of the world.

158
00:11:03,516 --> 00:11:04,676
It's exhausting, isn't it?

159
00:11:05,477 --> 00:11:06,997
Why not just take it easy?

160
00:11:09,516 --> 00:11:11,437
After losing a good friend,

161
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:14,556
I suddenly realized

162
00:11:15,997 --> 00:11:17,264
our dozens of years of lives

163
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,556
feel long

164
00:11:20,676 --> 00:11:23,036
and significant

165
00:11:23,197 --> 00:11:24,676
to us,

166
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:26,676
but to our world

167
00:11:27,717 --> 00:11:29,077
and even the universe,

168
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,556
we're just cosmic dust.

169
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,516
So stop overcomplicating life.

170
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:38,117
Now,

171
00:11:38,717 --> 00:11:40,437
I focus only

172
00:11:40,717 --> 00:11:42,036
on what matters in front of me.

173
00:11:50,437 --> 00:11:51,837
Everyone lies.

174
00:11:53,437 --> 00:11:55,197
Lies aren't always evil.

175
00:11:57,437 --> 00:11:59,756
Sometimes,

176
00:12:00,717 --> 00:12:01,796
they're white lies.

177
00:12:07,077 --> 00:12:10,437
Besides, would truth

178
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,237
definitely bring you joy?

179
00:12:13,876 --> 00:12:14,796
Not necessarily, right?

180
00:12:15,796 --> 00:12:18,317
Some like veggies,

181
00:12:18,477 --> 00:12:20,077
others meat.

182
00:12:21,756 --> 00:12:23,796
But me?

183
00:12:24,717 --> 00:12:26,756
I thrive on delicious junk food.

184
00:12:33,156 --> 00:12:35,477
Because that makes me happy.

185
00:12:37,636 --> 00:12:39,117
Where did you get this?

186
00:12:39,117 --> 00:12:41,997
I'm a walking vending machine.

187
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:46,077
Wu,

188
00:12:48,276 --> 00:12:51,197
I know this liar matters to you.

189
00:12:54,237 --> 00:12:55,396
Listen to me.

190
00:12:55,717 --> 00:12:56,916
Relax your mind.

191
00:12:58,676 --> 00:12:59,597
Find joy.

192
00:13:04,516 --> 00:13:05,756
Have a good sleep.

193
00:13:07,876 --> 00:13:10,156
Eat well and sleep well.

194
00:13:11,317 --> 00:13:12,036
Good night.

195
00:13:29,219 --> 00:13:30,288
(Can you buy my goods?)

196
00:13:32,516 --> 00:13:33,717
Just buy it.

197
00:13:34,197 --> 00:13:35,117
Help her.

198
00:13:37,197 --> 00:13:38,997
We'll buy everything. All of them.

199
00:13:38,997 --> 00:13:40,077
We'll take them all.

200
00:13:41,317 --> 00:13:42,276
Give me the change.

201
00:13:42,717 --> 00:13:43,837
No change needed.

202
00:13:46,197 --> 00:13:47,276
Why buy this?

203
00:13:47,997 --> 00:13:48,796
Do you know

204
00:13:48,796 --> 00:13:50,796
that they're not real deaf-mutes?

205
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,077
Then why did you buy it
knowing she's fake?

206
00:13:55,477 --> 00:13:57,317
Then tell me, are those flowers
real or fake?

207
00:14:00,276 --> 00:14:00,837
They're real.

208
00:14:01,197 --> 00:14:01,876
Exactly.

209
00:14:01,997 --> 00:14:03,437
Are you buying flowers or her?

210
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:06,796
Does her authenticity affect you?

211
00:14:11,876 --> 00:14:13,317
(This soup is delicious.)

212
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:14,276
(Come on.)

213
00:14:14,597 --> 00:14:15,676
(Come on. Quick.)

214
00:15:35,796 --> 00:15:37,237
What's the situation now?

215
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:38,957
Tell me straight. Can you handle it?

216
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:44,997
We really need to go.

217
00:15:44,997 --> 00:15:46,077
The storm is too strong.

218
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:47,036
The boat will capsize.

219
00:15:47,036 --> 00:15:48,676
Boss, bad news!

220
00:15:48,676 --> 00:15:50,077
The rope's stuck!

221
00:15:54,636 --> 00:15:56,796
Go ahead. Rain harder!

222
00:15:56,796 --> 00:15:58,036
Drown me!

223
00:16:43,396 --> 00:16:45,756
When will this end?

224
00:16:51,597 --> 00:16:52,556
Mr. Wu!

225
00:16:52,756 --> 00:16:53,676
Mr. Wu!

226
00:16:54,276 --> 00:16:55,197
The boat's fixed!

227
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,156
What?

228
00:16:56,156 --> 00:16:57,756
The boat's fixed!

229
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:58,756
Fixed?

230
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:00,156
What's fixed?

231
00:17:00,556 --> 00:17:01,717
The boat's fixed!

232
00:17:01,717 --> 00:17:02,876
Great!

233
00:17:12,276 --> 00:17:13,197
What are you doing?

234
00:17:13,437 --> 00:17:14,516
There's a storm ahead.

235
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:15,637
Are you going in?

236
00:17:16,917 --> 00:17:18,316
If we turn back now,

237
00:17:18,477 --> 00:17:19,756
the boat will surely capsize.

238
00:17:20,397 --> 00:17:21,717
Going in gives us a chance.

239
00:17:22,276 --> 00:17:23,796
I've seen storms like this before.

240
00:17:23,957 --> 00:17:24,836
Trust me.

241
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:26,917
Trust me.

242
00:17:28,596 --> 00:17:29,516
Fine.

243
00:17:29,637 --> 00:17:31,076
I'll gamble with you this once.

244
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:35,677
Let's go!

245
00:18:36,877 --> 00:18:37,957
We're here.

246
00:18:53,556 --> 00:18:54,556
So beautiful.

247
00:18:57,677 --> 00:19:01,316
Only after the storm comes the rainbow.

248
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:04,677
Are you sure this is the place?

249
00:19:13,796 --> 00:19:14,677
Wait a bit more.

250
00:19:15,836 --> 00:19:16,717
Wait a bit more.

251
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:31,957
She's out.

252
00:19:32,076 --> 00:19:32,957
She's out!

253
00:19:38,997 --> 00:19:39,796
Found it?

254
00:19:40,997 --> 00:19:42,197
Found it!

255
00:19:44,437 --> 00:19:45,637
Found it!

256
00:19:46,836 --> 00:19:48,076
Let's go now.

257
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:00,116
Let's roll.

258
00:20:22,997 --> 00:20:23,877
Dear sea!

259
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,596
I'm coming!

260
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,796
Whose corpse was that just now?

261
00:23:40,516 --> 00:23:41,356
Ning,

262
00:23:41,556 --> 00:23:42,836
whose corpse was that just now?

263
00:23:45,756 --> 00:23:46,756
Wu,

264
00:23:46,796 --> 00:23:50,197
breathe this 500-year-old air.

265
00:23:50,917 --> 00:23:52,036
Feel it.

266
00:23:52,036 --> 00:23:53,076
Come on, kid.

267
00:23:53,717 --> 00:23:57,076
Do you know why there's air here?

268
00:23:59,516 --> 00:24:01,917
This ship was deliberately scuttled

269
00:24:01,917 --> 00:24:02,997
and sunk to the seabed.

270
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:05,276
The path we took coiled upward.

271
00:24:05,957 --> 00:24:07,477
It should also be part of the design.

272
00:24:07,717 --> 00:24:08,957
The ship's creator

273
00:24:08,957 --> 00:24:10,477
used atmospheric pressure principles

274
00:24:10,717 --> 00:24:12,316
to expel seawater from the hull.

275
00:24:12,516 --> 00:24:13,516
That's why

276
00:24:13,637 --> 00:24:15,076
there's residual air inside.

277
00:24:15,677 --> 00:24:16,957
Not bad.

278
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:17,836
Something's fragrant.

279
00:24:18,796 --> 00:24:20,036
Do you smell that?

280
00:24:27,477 --> 00:24:28,752
It's Forbidden Woman's Scent.

281
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:32,477
Forbidden Woman's Scent?

282
00:24:34,036 --> 00:24:35,036
Forbidden Woman

283
00:24:36,036 --> 00:24:37,677
is a legendary goddess,

284
00:24:38,036 --> 00:24:39,836
whose bones emit fragrance

285
00:24:39,836 --> 00:24:40,836
that confuses ghosts

286
00:24:41,596 --> 00:24:42,836
and banishes them.

287
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:45,072
In ancient times,

288
00:24:45,957 --> 00:24:48,316
some cultures used
her images as talismans.

289
00:24:49,437 --> 00:24:50,356
This fragrance

290
00:24:50,796 --> 00:24:52,556
must come from ancient blended incense.

291
00:24:52,717 --> 00:24:54,276
Isn't it just moxa?

292
00:24:55,596 --> 00:24:56,836
Don't touch anything.

293
00:24:56,848 --> 00:24:58,736
We'll notify
the Cultural Relics Bureau later.

294
00:25:00,356 --> 00:25:02,596
What're these stone blocks for?

295
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:05,276
They're ballast stones

296
00:25:05,756 --> 00:25:06,917
to weigh the ship down

297
00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:08,237
from surfacing.

298
00:25:10,957 --> 00:25:12,076
Well, Ms. Ning?

299
00:25:12,356 --> 00:25:14,556
I told you we need Wu.

300
00:25:14,796 --> 00:25:15,796
He's Mr. Know-It-All,

301
00:25:15,917 --> 00:25:16,677
right?

302
00:25:16,677 --> 00:25:17,796
Right? Am I right?

303
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:19,437
Pangzi, you're bullying again.

304
00:25:20,836 --> 00:25:21,877
You guys.

305
00:25:22,957 --> 00:25:24,157
Get out of the water first.

306
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:25,717
What's the hurry?

307
00:25:25,717 --> 00:25:27,036
L-Let's soak a bit longer.

308
00:25:27,197 --> 00:25:28,516
Come on. Keep soaking!

309
00:25:29,437 --> 00:25:30,717
A high hypothermia risk here.

310
00:25:30,717 --> 00:25:31,877
Get out and change now.

311
00:25:35,717 --> 00:25:36,477
Come on.

312
00:25:36,957 --> 00:25:38,237
The last one.

313
00:25:40,596 --> 00:25:42,356
I really start to love diving.

314
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:44,717
Alright.

315
00:25:46,596 --> 00:25:47,516
What's wrong?

316
00:25:47,717 --> 00:25:49,157
Whose corpse was that just now?

317
00:25:50,276 --> 00:25:51,237
That was my crew member.

318
00:25:51,397 --> 00:25:52,556
Let's not discuss this now.

319
00:25:57,712 --> 00:25:59,600
Carbon dioxide levels here
are dangerously high.

320
00:25:59,877 --> 00:26:01,157
At this concentration,

321
00:26:01,397 --> 00:26:02,596
within ten hours,

322
00:26:02,957 --> 00:26:04,397
we'll reach lethal thresholds.

323
00:26:04,756 --> 00:26:06,276
So we need to speed things up

324
00:26:06,276 --> 00:26:07,677
and find your Third Uncle quickly.

325
00:26:08,836 --> 00:26:10,556
No wonder I'm feeling suffocated.

326
00:26:11,957 --> 00:26:13,036
Professor Zhang.

327
00:26:14,756 --> 00:26:15,997
Did you find anything?

328
00:26:16,477 --> 00:26:17,556
On our way here,

329
00:26:17,556 --> 00:26:19,957
I've been carefully
observing our surroundings.

330
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:20,957
Based on my expertise,

331
00:26:20,957 --> 00:26:22,356
this ship

332
00:26:22,677 --> 00:26:24,596
is at least six centuries old.

333
00:26:25,237 --> 00:26:27,116
Judging by cabin dimensions,

334
00:26:27,437 --> 00:26:28,437
I conclude

335
00:26:28,437 --> 00:26:29,756
the entire ship

336
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:32,237
has over 200 compartments

337
00:26:32,756 --> 00:26:34,516
with excellent waterproofing.

338
00:26:34,516 --> 00:26:36,316
I think they must've used

339
00:26:36,316 --> 00:26:38,237
watertight bulkhead technology.

340
00:26:39,036 --> 00:26:39,877
Baldy,

341
00:26:40,437 --> 00:26:42,957
give useful intel for tracking people.

342
00:26:43,116 --> 00:26:43,997
Ignoramus!

343
00:26:44,197 --> 00:26:45,197
Says the incompetent one!

344
00:26:51,356 --> 00:26:51,917
Come look.

345
00:26:51,917 --> 00:26:53,076
You scared me.

346
00:26:53,076 --> 00:26:54,036
Stop being jumpy.

347
00:27:00,157 --> 00:27:01,076
Footprint?

348
00:27:04,997 --> 00:27:06,637
This is a fresh footprint.

349
00:27:07,477 --> 00:27:08,796
Could be your Third Uncle's?

350
00:27:09,316 --> 00:27:10,437
Didn't you say

351
00:27:10,437 --> 00:27:12,276
he went down ten days ago?

352
00:27:12,677 --> 00:27:13,596
But this footprint

353
00:27:13,596 --> 00:27:15,076
looks freshly made anyway.

354
00:27:17,157 --> 00:27:18,677
Is there something else here?

355
00:27:20,877 --> 00:27:21,516
Pangzi.

356
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:23,957
Get over here.

357
00:27:27,477 --> 00:27:29,116
This footprint is small.

358
00:27:29,677 --> 00:27:30,397
Let me smell it.

359
00:27:33,356 --> 00:27:34,596
Based on its smell,

360
00:27:35,596 --> 00:27:37,717
it is some kind of marine creature

361
00:27:38,637 --> 00:27:40,356
hiding in this ballast stone.

362
00:27:40,877 --> 00:27:42,596
Hence, the ballast stone moves.

363
00:27:46,717 --> 00:27:47,717
As the ancients say,

364
00:27:48,157 --> 00:27:50,796
of thirty-six stratagems,
retreat's best.

365
00:27:51,596 --> 00:27:52,397
Retreat.

366
00:27:57,356 --> 00:27:57,877
Run!

367
00:27:58,276 --> 00:27:59,024
Run.

368
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,437
It blocked the only exit.

369
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:04,316
I'm not blind.

370
00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:05,516
Move aside.

371
00:28:07,836 --> 00:28:08,637
What should we do?

372
00:28:09,116 --> 00:28:10,477
There are only two options now.

373
00:28:11,036 --> 00:28:11,836
The first one

374
00:28:12,116 --> 00:28:13,197
is to fight this thing.

375
00:28:13,717 --> 00:28:14,677
The second,

376
00:28:16,116 --> 00:28:17,157
we just retreat.

377
00:28:18,116 --> 00:28:18,997
Choose one.

378
00:28:20,556 --> 00:28:22,356
I must complete my corporate mission.

379
00:28:26,276 --> 00:28:27,197
We outnumber it

380
00:28:27,437 --> 00:28:28,756
and we have weapons. No fear.

381
00:28:29,516 --> 00:28:30,356
Okay!

382
00:28:30,677 --> 00:28:32,556
Go!

383
00:28:32,556 --> 00:28:34,076
- You have the blade. You go first.
- Go!

384
00:28:34,076 --> 00:28:35,477
Fine! I'll go!

385
00:28:35,477 --> 00:28:35,997
Go!

386
00:28:35,997 --> 00:28:36,596
Move!

387
00:29:41,116 --> 00:29:42,316
So cowardly, huh?

388
00:29:42,316 --> 00:29:43,316
You're the cowardly one.

389
00:30:23,717 --> 00:30:24,516
So vast?

390
00:30:28,717 --> 00:30:29,796
Run so far?

391
00:30:32,316 --> 00:30:33,477
Don't you think

392
00:30:33,796 --> 00:30:35,836
this thing's guiding us?

393
00:30:35,997 --> 00:30:37,596
What creature would be so kind?

394
00:30:37,596 --> 00:30:39,637
I've only heard
of dolphins leading the way.

395
00:30:40,356 --> 00:30:41,796
Hey, that's my line.

396
00:30:42,157 --> 00:30:43,356
I was about to say it.

397
00:30:43,596 --> 00:30:45,437
This little thing rolls

398
00:30:46,397 --> 00:30:48,036
like an RC car.

399
00:30:48,516 --> 00:30:50,197
Where's it taking us?

400
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:51,316
Enough speculation.

401
00:30:51,556 --> 00:30:52,796
The mood's set.

402
00:30:53,316 --> 00:30:54,516
Let's just follow it.

403
00:30:54,957 --> 00:30:56,756
Whether we follow it or stay here,

404
00:30:56,756 --> 00:30:58,637
the end will be the same anyway.

405
00:31:01,157 --> 00:31:02,356
It's too dangerous.

406
00:31:02,796 --> 00:31:03,877
We'll do it.

407
00:31:04,516 --> 00:31:05,477
Wu,

408
00:31:06,276 --> 00:31:07,397
let's go.

409
00:31:43,197 --> 00:31:44,076
There's a mechanism.

410
00:31:45,397 --> 00:31:46,836
Don't move.

411
00:32:20,276 --> 00:32:20,816
Run!

412
00:32:34,397 --> 00:32:35,276
Pangzi!

413
00:32:35,637 --> 00:32:37,116
I'm hit by an arrow!

414
00:32:37,276 --> 00:32:38,116
Pangzi!

415
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:40,556
I'm done for.

416
00:32:40,556 --> 00:32:41,516
Pangzi.

417
00:32:41,516 --> 00:32:42,237
Wu Xie,

418
00:32:42,237 --> 00:32:43,116
help me!

419
00:32:49,917 --> 00:32:51,356
Wu Xie, help me!

420
00:32:51,356 --> 00:32:51,997
Pangzi!

421
00:32:51,997 --> 00:32:52,796
Wu Xie!

422
00:32:53,197 --> 00:32:54,076
What are you doing?

423
00:32:54,316 --> 00:32:55,036
Ning!

424
00:32:55,677 --> 00:32:56,637
Ning!

425
00:32:57,957 --> 00:32:58,796
Let him go!

426
00:33:00,036 --> 00:33:00,677
Ning!

427
00:33:00,877 --> 00:33:01,756
What are you doing?

428
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:05,917
Ning!

429
00:33:11,596 --> 00:33:12,237
Ning!

430
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,877
Let go! Let go of me!
