00:01:41,566 --> 00:01:43,593
=Episode 2=

3
00:02:09,424 --> 00:02:11,162
(I've finally embarked on the journey.)

4
00:02:12,688 --> 00:02:13,643
(In Grandpa's notes,)

5
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,562
(those fascinating stories)

6
00:02:16,144 --> 00:02:17,243
(made me fantasize)

7
00:02:17,243 --> 00:02:18,882
(about this journey.)

8
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:22,562
(I wonder if I will encounter)

9
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,456
(that many bizarre things
as Grandpa did.)

10
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,762
(But I have a strong premonition)

11
00:02:39,344 --> 00:02:42,523
(that my life
is now beginning a new chapter)

12
00:02:42,928 --> 00:02:44,842
(with this journey.)

13
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,803
(I want to record)

14
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,368
(what I see and feel in this journey)

15
00:02:52,368 --> 00:02:53,683
(like Grandpa did.)

16
00:02:54,602 --> 00:02:58,562
(Will it be an interesting story?)

17
00:03:43,363 --> 00:03:44,336
Third Uncle.

18
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:48,162
Who is that guy?

19
00:03:48,882 --> 00:03:50,442
Why is he acting like a mute?

20
00:03:50,643 --> 00:03:51,882
Don't underestimate him.

21
00:03:52,203 --> 00:03:53,523
He's quite agile.

22
00:03:54,096 --> 00:03:55,888
Can he really help at this young age?

23
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,923
In this world,

24
00:03:59,152 --> 00:04:00,523
some people like to brag,

25
00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:02,282
some keep a low profile,

26
00:04:03,024 --> 00:04:05,520
and some are clueless
about who they are.

27
00:04:06,128 --> 00:04:07,683
What kind of person are you?

28
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,642
Wait, Third Uncle.

29
00:04:34,544 --> 00:04:36,723
Hi, I'm Wu Xie.

30
00:04:53,392 --> 00:04:54,768
This way, everyone.

31
00:04:54,768 --> 00:04:57,442
Yang, are you a full-time guide here?

32
00:04:57,968 --> 00:04:59,123
People visit here often?

33
00:04:59,472 --> 00:05:00,603
Yes.

34
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,680
Young people nowadays

35
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,202
love exploring mountains.

36
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:03,683
Is that so?

37
00:05:03,824 --> 00:05:04,336
We're here.

38
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:05,243
Already?

39
00:05:05,243 --> 00:05:05,840
Yes.

40
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,603
This is the final stretch.

41
00:05:09,872 --> 00:05:11,843
No vehicles or roads ahead.

42
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,040
We need to take a boat

43
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,202
to reach the cave you mentioned.

44
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,762
Where's the boat?

45
00:05:20,272 --> 00:05:21,168
Just wait.

46
00:05:22,642 --> 00:05:25,123
Lv Dandan!

47
00:05:27,283 --> 00:05:28,803
The boatman's name is Lv Dandan?

48
00:05:28,803 --> 00:05:30,322
What a peculiar name.

49
00:05:31,683 --> 00:05:32,843
Dandan!

50
00:05:38,283 --> 00:05:39,632
Why is there a dog?

51
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:41,723
Are we supposed to ride the dog?

52
00:05:41,723 --> 00:05:43,202
How could we ride a dog?

53
00:05:43,202 --> 00:05:45,840
The dog is our messenger.

54
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:50,562
What?

55
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,322
Lv Dandan.

56
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,522
The dog told me

57
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:00,642
it's still early.

58
00:06:00,912 --> 00:06:02,243
The boatman isn't ready yet.

59
00:06:02,442 --> 00:06:03,562
Let's rest for a while.

60
00:06:03,562 --> 00:06:05,243
Amazing!

61
00:06:05,243 --> 00:06:06,800
You understand dog language?

62
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,082
Okay.

63
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,968
I think it's around two o'clock already.

64
00:06:13,968 --> 00:06:15,792
That guy is still not ready to work yet?

65
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,072
Can he be that slack off?

66
00:06:17,456 --> 00:06:19,803
He's the only boatman here.

67
00:06:19,952 --> 00:06:21,360
He works

68
00:06:21,683 --> 00:06:23,123
whenever he wants to.

69
00:06:23,536 --> 00:06:24,923
Even the village chief

70
00:06:25,232 --> 00:06:27,216
can't do anything about him.

71
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,880
Get someone else then.

72
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,096
Someone more diligent.

73
00:06:30,096 --> 00:06:31,312
We'd love to,

74
00:06:31,696 --> 00:06:33,163
but you outsiders don't know.

75
00:06:33,163 --> 00:06:34,522
The Mountain God

76
00:06:34,522 --> 00:06:36,043
only likes him.

77
00:06:36,043 --> 00:06:38,064
Others go there and never return.

78
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,472
Only he can

79
00:06:39,472 --> 00:06:40,720
go in and out safely.

80
00:06:41,008 --> 00:06:41,936
It's eerie.

81
00:06:42,448 --> 00:06:44,522
How can such a strange thing happen?

82
00:06:45,424 --> 00:06:46,992
Did others who enter the cave

83
00:06:46,992 --> 00:06:47,920
get devoured?

84
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,402
That cave devours people?

85
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:50,832
Elders in the village

86
00:06:50,832 --> 00:06:52,816
say a snake monster lives inside,

87
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:54,832
and the boatman's ancestors

88
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:56,723
once saved the snake monster's life,

89
00:06:56,723 --> 00:06:58,082
so he can enter the cave safely.

90
00:06:58,082 --> 00:06:58,762
A snake monster?

91
00:06:58,762 --> 00:06:59,472
Eerie.

92
00:06:59,568 --> 00:07:00,562
A rumor, I guess.

93
00:07:00,592 --> 00:07:02,683
Anyway, young explorers who've entered

94
00:07:03,152 --> 00:07:04,442
never made it back.

95
00:07:07,664 --> 00:07:09,776
The routes in the cave must be complex,

96
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:11,056
trapping them forever.

97
00:07:11,184 --> 00:07:12,496
Where were

98
00:07:12,496 --> 00:07:14,128
the boatman's ancestors from,

99
00:07:14,128 --> 00:07:15,163
Yang?

100
00:07:15,163 --> 00:07:16,683
I don't know.

101
00:07:17,363 --> 00:07:18,762
That's long, long ago!

102
00:07:19,363 --> 00:07:20,442
I don't know.

103
00:07:20,848 --> 00:07:22,363
Why do you smell so bad?

104
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:27,760
Haven't you taken a bath?

105
00:07:27,888 --> 00:07:29,562
Didn't you just come out of the river?

106
00:07:33,243 --> 00:07:34,123
Lv Dandan.

107
00:07:34,283 --> 00:07:34,923
Come here.

108
00:07:34,923 --> 00:07:36,082
This dog is off.

109
00:07:36,843 --> 00:07:37,803
Go...

110
00:07:38,123 --> 00:07:39,123
Go fetch the boat.

111
00:07:47,024 --> 00:07:47,632
What?

112
00:07:47,632 --> 00:07:48,522
Third Master.

113
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,683
The dog smells wrong.

114
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,712
Right. It's stinky.

115
00:07:54,096 --> 00:07:55,536
This dog eats bat dung.

116
00:07:57,776 --> 00:07:59,163
The old man is suspicious too.

117
00:07:59,163 --> 00:08:00,642
He's been stalling.

118
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:03,088
I think he's waiting for something.

119
00:08:04,272 --> 00:08:06,163
Probably waiting for the sun to set.

120
00:08:06,384 --> 00:08:08,656
That boatman eats bat dung too.

121
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:10,640
Maybe people who eat bat dung

122
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,762
can't handle summer heat,

123
00:08:13,936 --> 00:08:16,243
and have to come out at cooler times.

124
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,448
If I'm right,

125
00:08:20,016 --> 00:08:20,816
that is

126
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,512
a wet cave.

127
00:08:37,872 --> 00:08:38,672
Third Uncle.

128
00:08:44,176 --> 00:08:44,976
Third Uncle.

129
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,376
What exactly is a wet cave?

130
00:08:51,952 --> 00:08:53,008
Not sure.

131
00:08:53,603 --> 00:08:55,282
But on a past expedition,

132
00:08:55,443 --> 00:08:57,363
I entered a cave

133
00:08:57,522 --> 00:08:59,042
that was used

134
00:08:59,216 --> 00:09:01,424
by Japanese to bury massacre victims.

135
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:04,272
It was full of corpses.

136
00:09:05,168 --> 00:09:06,323
All we did is

137
00:09:06,323 --> 00:09:10,522
to tie poultry and dogs
to the bamboo raft.

138
00:09:11,248 --> 00:09:12,528
Then

139
00:09:12,528 --> 00:09:13,882
mount a camera on it.

140
00:09:14,802 --> 00:09:15,792
Slowly

141
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:16,944
send the raft

142
00:09:16,944 --> 00:09:19,152
into the cave.

143
00:09:24,368 --> 00:09:26,608
(We used long cables.)

144
00:09:27,344 --> 00:09:29,296
(But when cables ran out,)

145
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,402
(the raft still didn't come out.)

146
00:09:32,592 --> 00:09:34,256
(It drifted away somewhere.)

147
00:09:35,376 --> 00:09:37,264
(We tried pulling it back.)

148
00:09:38,128 --> 00:09:39,312
(But after a few pulls,)

149
00:09:40,912 --> 00:09:42,563
(the raft flipped suddenly.)

150
00:09:45,296 --> 00:09:46,802
(At the end of the video,)

151
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,688
(there occurred half a creepy face)

152
00:09:49,296 --> 00:09:50,736
(on the screen.)

153
00:09:53,488 --> 00:09:54,563
What was

154
00:09:54,563 --> 00:09:55,802
that exactly?

155
00:09:57,762 --> 00:09:58,576
Later, I discovered

156
00:09:58,576 --> 00:10:00,203
it was just a monkey.

157
00:10:02,203 --> 00:10:04,203
Know how ancient people handled it?

158
00:10:05,642 --> 00:10:07,762
They'd feed people

159
00:10:07,762 --> 00:10:09,843
bat dung daily

160
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,882
for three to six months.

161
00:10:13,802 --> 00:10:16,002
What's bat dung exactly?

162
00:10:16,963 --> 00:10:18,203
Just as its name implies.

163
00:10:21,603 --> 00:10:23,963
Anyway, eating bat dung

164
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,936
can make people

165
00:10:25,936 --> 00:10:28,363
smell like bats.

166
00:10:29,008 --> 00:10:30,384
Then they'd enter.

167
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,282
Even ghosts couldn't tell

168
00:10:34,282 --> 00:10:36,203
if they are human or ghosts.

169
00:10:37,042 --> 00:10:39,152
So, only boatmen

170
00:10:40,002 --> 00:10:41,200
can enter the cave

171
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,843
because they eat bat dung.

172
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:45,042
He's eaten it,

173
00:10:45,776 --> 00:10:47,216
but we haven't.

174
00:10:48,762 --> 00:10:50,384
It's superstition,

175
00:10:50,896 --> 00:10:53,328
but we still need be cautious.

176
00:10:53,808 --> 00:10:55,952
This cave is probably dangerous.

177
00:11:00,144 --> 00:11:01,162
Scared?

178
00:11:02,448 --> 00:11:03,568
Not really.

179
00:11:03,888 --> 00:11:04,976
No.

180
00:11:07,056 --> 00:11:08,642
Admit it if you're scared.

181
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,243
You can stay.

182
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:12,944
I'm fine.

183
00:11:14,992 --> 00:11:16,042
Young Third Master.

184
00:11:23,504 --> 00:11:25,008
Are you dumb?

185
00:11:27,216 --> 00:11:29,843
Eating bat dung is no big deal.

186
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,843
Third Master was fooling you.

187
00:11:33,232 --> 00:11:35,203
Is eating bat dung common?

188
00:11:39,402 --> 00:11:41,443
Let me tell you something.

189
00:11:42,762 --> 00:11:43,723
Do you know

190
00:11:44,882 --> 00:11:46,723
there's a prison

191
00:11:47,363 --> 00:11:48,522
in Mobei Manledan?

192
00:11:49,682 --> 00:11:51,282
If the inmates

193
00:11:51,282 --> 00:11:52,882
want to escape,

194
00:11:52,882 --> 00:11:54,522
they have to do so

195
00:11:54,762 --> 00:11:56,363
as three people.

196
00:11:56,642 --> 00:11:57,762
Do you know why?

197
00:11:57,762 --> 00:11:58,672
Why?

198
00:12:00,144 --> 00:12:02,762
The prison is built deep

199
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:05,402
(in a snow mountain.)

200
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,203
Nonsense.

201
00:12:08,882 --> 00:12:10,512
Mobei has no snow mountains!

202
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:13,200
I can tell you didn't
learn geography well.

203
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,736
Mobei's highest peak

204
00:12:14,736 --> 00:12:17,243
is with an altitude of 5,881 meters.

205
00:12:17,648 --> 00:12:18,320
Right.

206
00:12:18,544 --> 00:12:19,696
Three people escape,

207
00:12:20,752 --> 00:12:21,872
(with no equipment)

208
00:12:22,288 --> 00:12:23,536
(or food.)

209
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,608
If one of them collapses...

210
00:12:26,608 --> 00:12:27,243
Tell me,

211
00:12:27,243 --> 00:12:28,624
what should the other two do?

212
00:12:33,168 --> 00:12:33,872
Eat him.

213
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:35,408
If they don't, they'll die.

214
00:12:35,843 --> 00:12:36,723
Right?

215
00:12:36,752 --> 00:12:38,162
After it, they can keep going

216
00:12:38,352 --> 00:12:40,443
until another one collapses.

217
00:12:40,522 --> 00:12:41,762
Then the last person eats him.

218
00:12:43,723 --> 00:12:44,682
(In the end,)

219
00:12:44,843 --> 00:12:47,363
only one person can survive.

220
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,040
I wonder how you heard

221
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,642
such a disgusting story.

222
00:12:54,642 --> 00:12:56,203
It's not disgusting at all.

223
00:12:56,483 --> 00:12:58,083
Because I

224
00:12:59,402 --> 00:13:01,402
was the one who survived.

225
00:13:02,802 --> 00:13:04,443
Really?

226
00:13:05,392 --> 00:13:06,483
It's true.

227
00:13:12,304 --> 00:13:13,136
Pan Zi.

228
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,443
How many more times

229
00:13:15,802 --> 00:13:17,203
would you tell this story?

230
00:13:17,328 --> 00:13:19,216
You tell the same old story every time.

231
00:13:19,696 --> 00:13:22,256
But your version today
differs a bit from what I heard

232
00:13:22,352 --> 00:13:23,728
before.

233
00:13:24,048 --> 00:13:25,904
I think you have changed.

234
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:28,240
Third Master.

235
00:13:28,464 --> 00:13:29,648
What's different?

236
00:13:30,384 --> 00:13:31,522
Have I changed?

237
00:13:32,048 --> 00:13:32,912
Wait.

238
00:14:10,352 --> 00:14:11,312
The boat is here.

239
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:12,784
Come on.

240
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:13,744
Time to board the boat.

241
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,376
Remember the rules.

242
00:14:48,048 --> 00:14:48,944
In the cave,

243
00:14:48,944 --> 00:14:50,483
keep your voices low.

244
00:14:50,483 --> 00:14:51,536
Don't look into the water

245
00:14:51,888 --> 00:14:54,363
and never speak ill of the Mountain God.

246
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,963
How long will it take to pass through?

247
00:14:58,963 --> 00:15:00,243
Five minutes at best.

248
00:15:00,528 --> 00:15:02,123
The current is flowing fast,

249
00:15:02,123 --> 00:15:03,042
so it goes quickly.

250
00:15:04,048 --> 00:15:05,168
What about at worst?

251
00:15:05,584 --> 00:15:06,922
The water

252
00:15:07,642 --> 00:15:09,200
flows downstream sometimes,

253
00:15:09,563 --> 00:15:11,402
so when we enter,

254
00:15:11,402 --> 00:15:12,802
we are going against the current.

255
00:15:13,072 --> 00:15:14,192
That takes longer,

256
00:15:14,512 --> 00:15:15,882
about 15 minutes.

257
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,424
There are many bends inside.

258
00:15:17,424 --> 00:15:18,282
It's dangerous.

259
00:15:18,483 --> 00:15:19,856
And it's complete dark inside,

260
00:15:19,856 --> 00:15:21,168
so we won't see a thing.

261
00:15:21,424 --> 00:15:22,843
Stay alert.

262
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:25,162
But for him,

263
00:15:25,162 --> 00:15:26,443
with over a decade's experience,

264
00:15:26,563 --> 00:15:28,642
he relies on his ears.

265
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,443
Anyway,

266
00:15:31,443 --> 00:15:32,963
follow my rules exactly.

267
00:15:36,176 --> 00:15:38,002
Can we use flashlights?

268
00:15:39,376 --> 00:15:40,688
It's okay.

269
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:42,576
Never shine them on the water,

270
00:15:42,843 --> 00:15:43,843
or you'll regret it.

271
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:44,816
Why?

272
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,512
Water ghosts?

273
00:15:47,762 --> 00:15:49,162
That's nothing.

274
00:15:49,162 --> 00:15:51,083
What's in there is unimaginable.

275
00:15:51,203 --> 00:15:52,402
If you're brave enough,

276
00:15:52,402 --> 00:15:53,360
take a look yourself.

277
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,576
I don't know either.

278
00:15:54,576 --> 00:15:55,632
If you're lucky,

279
00:15:55,632 --> 00:15:57,264
you'll just see dark water.

280
00:15:57,264 --> 00:15:58,608
If unlucky,

281
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:01,963
you'll get scared!

282
00:16:02,363 --> 00:16:03,443
Have you seen them?

283
00:16:03,824 --> 00:16:04,656
Me?

284
00:16:04,976 --> 00:16:06,128
Never.

285
00:16:11,056 --> 00:16:11,792
Third Master.

286
00:16:12,816 --> 00:16:14,288
Can we trust this guy?

287
00:16:14,384 --> 00:16:16,592
He's full of spooky tales.

288
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,682
They're all suspicious.

289
00:16:19,216 --> 00:16:20,603
Once we enter,

290
00:16:20,603 --> 00:16:22,203
they might do unexpected things.

291
00:16:22,512 --> 00:16:23,563
Stay alert.

292
00:17:09,803 --> 00:17:11,523
This cave is so narrow.

293
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:13,323
This is spacious.

294
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,256
There's a stretch ahead

295
00:17:14,288 --> 00:17:15,563
even lower than here.

296
00:17:15,563 --> 00:17:16,592
This is spacious?

297
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:17,843
Yes.

298
00:17:18,032 --> 00:17:18,682
A small cave.

299
00:17:18,682 --> 00:17:20,283
If robbers attack here,

300
00:17:20,523 --> 00:17:21,843
we have nowhere to escape.

301
00:17:51,568 --> 00:17:52,496
Third Master.

302
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,608
This cave isn't ordinary.

303
00:17:58,288 --> 00:17:59,216
This cave

304
00:18:00,336 --> 00:18:01,936
has a history spanning over a century.

305
00:18:03,363 --> 00:18:04,962
Explosives won't work here.

306
00:18:06,224 --> 00:18:08,048
It appears to be man-made.

307
00:18:08,784 --> 00:18:10,323
Man-made?

308
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,816
It would take 100 people
over ten years to carve this.

309
00:18:14,576 --> 00:18:16,882
Why did that just to dig a cave?

310
00:18:18,192 --> 00:18:18,960
Yang,

311
00:18:19,376 --> 00:18:20,560
where does this path lead?

312
00:18:21,296 --> 00:18:22,576
There's a mountain ahead

313
00:18:22,672 --> 00:18:24,682
where legend says a deity resides.

314
00:18:25,283 --> 00:18:26,763
A path built for a deity.

315
00:18:27,242 --> 00:18:28,162
Possibly.

316
00:18:28,363 --> 00:18:30,416
But earlier you mentioned

317
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,728
this place has a snake monster?

318
00:18:32,016 --> 00:18:34,288
Why didn't the deity
vanquish the snake monster?

319
00:18:34,832 --> 00:18:36,336
I don't know.

320
00:18:36,336 --> 00:18:38,162
These are legends passed down by elders.

321
00:18:38,363 --> 00:18:40,363
I can't say if they are true.

322
00:18:40,803 --> 00:18:41,803
You made that up, right?

323
00:19:02,162 --> 00:19:03,083
Who?

324
00:19:05,682 --> 00:19:06,682
Stop it.

325
00:19:08,283 --> 00:19:09,242
Scared?

326
00:19:13,603 --> 00:19:14,922
There are five of us,

327
00:19:15,123 --> 00:19:16,283
and they only have two.

328
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,402
If we start fighting,

329
00:19:18,682 --> 00:19:19,962
we might not lose.

330
00:19:20,843 --> 00:19:22,563
If they actually attack,

331
00:19:23,642 --> 00:19:24,922
they must have some tricks.

332
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,363
You're pretty sharp.

333
00:19:31,523 --> 00:19:32,922
Top student indeed.

334
00:19:36,283 --> 00:19:37,563
What are you two talking about?

335
00:19:41,043 --> 00:19:42,043
Young Third Master

336
00:19:43,202 --> 00:19:44,202
is extraordinary.

337
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,088
He faces such conditions
on the first expedition

338
00:19:47,088 --> 00:19:48,242
without breaking down.

339
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,442
Nice.

340
00:19:50,442 --> 00:19:51,440
Young Third Master.

341
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,882
Do you still remember

342
00:19:52,882 --> 00:19:54,482
your first field work?

343
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:55,600
In my memories,

344
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,912
early when I was in my diapers,

345
00:19:56,912 --> 00:19:58,384
I started working with Third Master.

346
00:19:58,384 --> 00:19:59,248
Cut the crap.

347
00:19:59,248 --> 00:20:00,603
If you started before me,

348
00:20:00,803 --> 00:20:01,882
I'd have been

349
00:20:01,882 --> 00:20:03,043
changing your diapers!

350
00:20:03,043 --> 00:20:04,016
Don't worry.

351
00:20:04,016 --> 00:20:04,962
When you're old,

352
00:20:04,962 --> 00:20:06,283
I'll return your favor.

353
00:20:14,563 --> 00:20:15,323
He means

354
00:20:15,323 --> 00:20:16,368
you should stop talking.

355
00:20:16,368 --> 00:20:17,523
Stop talking.

356
00:20:17,523 --> 00:20:19,083
It will cause trouble.

357
00:20:19,563 --> 00:20:20,363
Trouble?

358
00:20:20,442 --> 00:20:21,642
What kind of trouble?

359
00:20:21,843 --> 00:20:23,722
I'd like to see what trouble comes.

360
00:20:27,242 --> 00:20:28,083
Listen.

361
00:20:28,642 --> 00:20:29,763
Someone is talking.

362
00:21:20,922 --> 00:21:21,682
Where are they?

363
00:21:21,962 --> 00:21:22,882
What?

364
00:21:23,722 --> 00:21:24,682
Where are the two?

365
00:21:24,682 --> 00:21:25,523
What happened?

366
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,384
Pan Zi.

367
00:21:26,384 --> 00:21:27,120
What happened?

368
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,523
I don't know.

369
00:21:28,722 --> 00:21:30,123
I heard no splash.

370
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:31,722
Wait,

371
00:21:31,803 --> 00:21:32,682
did we all zone out

372
00:21:32,682 --> 00:21:33,722
for a moment?

373
00:21:34,123 --> 00:21:35,952
They can't just vanish.

374
00:21:35,952 --> 00:21:36,688
Oh no!

375
00:21:36,688 --> 00:21:38,832
Without their smell of bat dung,

376
00:21:38,832 --> 00:21:39,856
we'd be in trouble.

377
00:21:39,856 --> 00:21:40,882
They must be hiding.

378
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,242
Sit! You'll capsize the boat.

379
00:21:44,784 --> 00:21:45,763
Listen.

380
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,000
The strange noise stopped.

381
00:22:01,584 --> 00:22:02,603
Be careful.

382
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,952
Third Master.

383
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:29,552
What's in the water?

384
00:22:58,603 --> 00:22:59,922
Look at his fingers.

385
00:23:00,563 --> 00:23:02,083
These are no ordinary fingers.

386
00:23:04,656 --> 00:23:08,752
This is the Twin-Finger Tomb Probing
from ancient Chinese martial arts.

387
00:23:08,752 --> 00:23:10,283
Developing such martial arts

388
00:23:11,363 --> 00:23:13,242
takes decades of training.

389
00:23:28,642 --> 00:23:29,882
This is it earlier.

390
00:23:30,003 --> 00:23:31,123
It's a water beetle.

391
00:23:31,682 --> 00:23:32,603
You squashed it

392
00:23:32,603 --> 00:23:33,722
before I interrogate it!

393
00:23:33,763 --> 00:23:34,962
This isn't a water beetle,

394
00:23:35,162 --> 00:23:36,202
but a corpse beetle.

395
00:23:36,363 --> 00:23:38,563
These are omnivorous creatures.

396
00:23:40,722 --> 00:23:42,083
I bet there are

397
00:23:42,642 --> 00:23:45,003
many more of them upstream.

398
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:47,563
Third Master.

399
00:23:47,682 --> 00:23:48,962
I guess these corpse beetles

400
00:23:49,242 --> 00:23:50,323
don't bite living people?

401
00:23:52,162 --> 00:23:52,962
They don't, usually.

402
00:23:53,402 --> 00:23:54,162
But when starving,

403
00:23:54,922 --> 00:23:55,803
they will.

404
00:23:55,803 --> 00:23:56,922
Do you know about hyenas?

405
00:23:56,922 --> 00:23:58,402
They usually eat carrion when hungry.

406
00:23:58,682 --> 00:23:59,922
But when starving,

407
00:24:00,043 --> 00:24:01,442
they'll even attack buffalo.

408
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,722
Then why are they

409
00:24:05,003 --> 00:24:06,563
loitering around here?

410
00:24:08,283 --> 00:24:09,482
The carrion in the cave

411
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,283
are all consumed?

412
00:24:12,043 --> 00:24:13,882
They were probably fleeing earlier.

413
00:24:14,402 --> 00:24:15,402
Fleeing?

414
00:24:16,563 --> 00:24:18,123
Something's approaching,

415
00:24:18,803 --> 00:24:19,962
and it's something big.

416
00:24:20,482 --> 00:24:21,642
What is that?

417
00:24:21,803 --> 00:24:23,043
Explain yourself.

418
00:24:23,242 --> 00:24:24,202
Let's not dwell on

419
00:24:24,202 --> 00:24:25,202
what that thing is.

420
00:24:25,202 --> 00:24:26,323
We should get out.

421
00:24:26,523 --> 00:24:27,722
We have been here not long.

422
00:24:27,722 --> 00:24:28,922
It's not too late to go back.

423
00:24:28,922 --> 00:24:29,763
I agree.

424
00:24:29,763 --> 00:24:30,843
Let's retreat first.

425
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:32,162
We can cross the mountain.

426
00:24:32,162 --> 00:24:33,363
We might lose a few days,

427
00:24:33,363 --> 00:24:34,363
but I think it's okay.

428
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,523
Bro.

429
00:24:38,682 --> 00:24:39,763
Any thoughts?

430
00:24:41,482 --> 00:24:43,123
They're certain we can't escape.

431
00:24:43,123 --> 00:24:44,323
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean?

432
00:24:45,456 --> 00:24:46,608
The exit is blocked.

433
00:24:52,162 --> 00:24:54,123
Third Master,
we could retrieve the cattle

434
00:24:54,123 --> 00:24:55,763
and push the luggage back.

435
00:24:55,763 --> 00:24:56,642
Fine. You try it.

436
00:24:56,642 --> 00:24:58,442
The cattle can't even stand on the boat.

437
00:24:58,642 --> 00:24:59,803
They knew

438
00:24:59,803 --> 00:25:01,083
they can trap you here.

439
00:25:02,922 --> 00:25:04,043
I didn't expect

440
00:25:04,043 --> 00:25:05,642
to be fooled by two village fools!

441
00:25:06,202 --> 00:25:07,123
Third Master.

442
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:09,402
We underestimated them.

443
00:25:09,603 --> 00:25:10,803
They're capable.

444
00:25:11,563 --> 00:25:13,003
Not them,

445
00:25:13,003 --> 00:25:14,563
but this place.

446
00:25:16,523 --> 00:25:17,843
They're sure

447
00:25:18,523 --> 00:25:20,642
this place can finish us.

448
00:25:43,882 --> 00:25:44,944
Third Master.

449
00:26:49,904 --> 00:26:50,800
Pan Zi!

450
00:26:51,248 --> 00:26:52,763
Pan Zi!

451
00:26:55,536 --> 00:26:56,336
Pan Zi!

452
00:26:56,496 --> 00:26:57,083
Pan Zi!

453
00:27:05,922 --> 00:27:06,803
Young Third Master.

454
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,288
Wu Xie.

455
00:27:34,962 --> 00:27:35,722
Wu Xie.

456
00:28:20,368 --> 00:28:21,296
