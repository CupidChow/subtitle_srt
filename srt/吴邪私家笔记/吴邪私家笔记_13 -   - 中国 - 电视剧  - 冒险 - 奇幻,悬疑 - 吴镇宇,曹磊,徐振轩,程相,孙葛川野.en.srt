00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,952
=Episode 13=

3
00:01:47,652 --> 00:01:48,691
What are these?

4
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,931
Twelve hands?

5
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,452
Are there six people inside here?

6
00:01:55,972 --> 00:01:57,972
They drowned together while bathing?

7
00:01:58,892 --> 00:02:00,372
There's only one person here.

8
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:02,291
One person?

9
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:04,252
Look carefully at her heads.

10
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:05,291
Notice anything?

11
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:10,332
These aren't actually her heads.

12
00:02:10,772 --> 00:02:12,252
They're just growths on her body.

13
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:14,532
Look closely.

14
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:16,411
She indeed has twelve arms.

15
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:18,812
A human with twelve arms?

16
00:02:19,532 --> 00:02:20,731
Is that still human?

17
00:02:21,212 --> 00:02:23,092
It's clearly some sort of insect.

18
00:02:23,532 --> 00:02:24,972
Theoretically speaking,

19
00:02:25,731 --> 00:02:28,691
someone with congenital
chromosomal abnormalities

20
00:02:28,812 --> 00:02:30,691
would have
severely underdeveloped organs.

21
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:32,291
How could she grow this large?

22
00:02:34,092 --> 00:02:34,851
If you ask me,

23
00:02:34,851 --> 00:02:37,372
there's an easy way to figure this out.

24
00:02:37,372 --> 00:02:39,291
Let's hurry back to that room we were in

25
00:02:39,652 --> 00:02:41,451
and bring all those clay pots here.

26
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:43,171
When we bail out this water,

27
00:02:43,492 --> 00:02:45,932
we'll see what's really underneath.

28
00:02:46,092 --> 00:02:47,092
And look.

29
00:02:47,731 --> 00:02:49,611
There seems to be a stone slab
down there.

30
00:02:50,411 --> 00:02:52,212
We can take it out too.

31
00:02:52,492 --> 00:02:53,372
Maybe

32
00:02:54,052 --> 00:02:55,571
we can find something unexpected.

33
00:02:56,451 --> 00:02:57,252
Makes sense.

34
00:02:58,972 --> 00:02:59,851
Since we came down,

35
00:02:59,932 --> 00:03:01,252
we haven't seen a single word.

36
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:04,411
If I could read the inscription
on this stone slab,

37
00:03:04,611 --> 00:03:06,252
we might piece together some clues.

38
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:07,851
That would greatly help

39
00:03:07,851 --> 00:03:08,932
our next steps.

40
00:03:09,891 --> 00:03:10,451
Alright.

41
00:03:11,252 --> 00:03:12,171
No time to waste.

42
00:03:12,372 --> 00:03:13,332
Let's move quickly

43
00:03:13,332 --> 00:03:14,691
before the mechanisms reset.

44
00:03:15,372 --> 00:03:15,891
Let's go.

45
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:32,532
Let me check if our precious air tanks

46
00:03:32,532 --> 00:03:33,372
have returned.

47
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:34,052
Any luck?

48
00:03:34,972 --> 00:03:35,411
Well,

49
00:03:35,571 --> 00:03:36,212
nope.

50
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:38,891
Alright.

51
00:03:39,571 --> 00:03:40,731
We'll have to bail the water.

52
00:03:47,652 --> 00:03:48,451
So heavy.

53
00:03:49,492 --> 00:03:50,532
This might work.

54
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:00,252
This one.

55
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:06,972
Let's go.

56
00:04:07,332 --> 00:04:09,011
Why stare at the stone?

57
00:04:09,171 --> 00:04:10,052
Let's go.

58
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,611
These murals tell a story.

59
00:04:13,891 --> 00:04:15,212
Their construction craftsmanship

60
00:04:15,212 --> 00:04:16,851
rivals the Yong Imperial Palace itself.

61
00:04:18,972 --> 00:04:22,371
But the designs
don't look Central Plains-style.

62
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:24,491
I can't decipher them.

63
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:25,692
Pangzi,

64
00:04:25,972 --> 00:04:27,012
do you think...

65
00:04:30,452 --> 00:04:31,371
Pangzi?

66
00:04:32,931 --> 00:04:33,772
Pangzi?

67
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,092
Good heavens.

68
00:08:52,812 --> 00:08:53,891
Darn you, Pangzi!

69
00:08:54,131 --> 00:08:55,651
You scared me half to death!

70
00:09:15,771 --> 00:09:16,651
Where...

71
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:18,412
Where were you guys?

72
00:09:22,092 --> 00:09:22,932
We...

73
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:26,611
We got chased off by a monster.

74
00:09:27,412 --> 00:09:27,972
A monster?

75
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:30,651
You saw a monster too?

76
00:09:33,251 --> 00:09:34,412
You saw it too?

77
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:38,052
Was it covered in white fur?

78
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:40,011
Fast-moving with tiny hands?

79
00:09:40,292 --> 00:09:41,292
White fur? No.

80
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:43,332
Then what did you see?

81
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,572
I saw something

82
00:09:48,531 --> 00:09:49,972
human-shaped.

83
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,212
It launched

84
00:09:51,251 --> 00:09:52,731
from the spring instantly.

85
00:09:53,172 --> 00:09:54,452
But it definitely wasn't human.

86
00:09:55,212 --> 00:09:56,092
It's over two meters.

87
00:09:56,292 --> 00:09:57,371
Freakishly tall.

88
00:10:01,172 --> 00:10:02,011
Xiaoge,

89
00:10:02,212 --> 00:10:04,172
this place feels wrong.

90
00:10:06,092 --> 00:10:08,731
Why are there so many monsters here?

91
00:10:09,731 --> 00:10:10,572
Sea monkeys.

92
00:10:10,572 --> 00:10:11,491
What monkeys?

93
00:10:12,491 --> 00:10:13,292
Sea monkeys?

94
00:10:13,292 --> 00:10:13,932
Who keeps them?

95
00:10:13,932 --> 00:10:14,771
They actually exist?

96
00:10:15,491 --> 00:10:16,491
Stop talking.

97
00:10:16,692 --> 00:10:17,932
We need to get out now.

98
00:10:18,371 --> 00:10:18,891
Okay.

99
00:10:19,172 --> 00:10:20,052
Wait.

100
00:10:20,292 --> 00:10:22,692
I just locked that sea monkey

101
00:10:22,692 --> 00:10:23,771
outside this door.

102
00:10:23,851 --> 00:10:25,572
I'm not sure if it's left yet.

103
00:10:25,731 --> 00:10:28,491
We'll leave as soon
as the elevator activates.

104
00:10:31,891 --> 00:10:32,491
Pangzi.

105
00:10:33,452 --> 00:10:35,292
What did you run into earlier?

106
00:10:46,531 --> 00:10:47,371
Let's go.

107
00:10:49,092 --> 00:10:50,812
Why stare at the stone?

108
00:10:53,371 --> 00:10:54,212
I'm leaving first.

109
00:10:58,972 --> 00:11:00,292
It reeks here.

110
00:11:00,531 --> 00:11:01,251
Here.

111
00:11:06,572 --> 00:11:09,692
Remember, there's a step here.

112
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,332
Go down.

113
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:19,531
Wu!

114
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:20,851
Wu Xie!

115
00:11:21,731 --> 00:11:22,292
Wu!

116
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:23,251
Stop shouting.

117
00:11:23,531 --> 00:11:24,371
He can't hear you.

118
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:25,812
Then what do we do?

119
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:27,292
Wu!

120
00:11:35,092 --> 00:11:36,251
I get it.

121
00:11:36,452 --> 00:11:36,972
To you,

122
00:11:36,972 --> 00:11:38,972
since we're already trapped
in the elevator,

123
00:11:40,452 --> 00:11:41,651
as long as it doesn't move,

124
00:11:42,531 --> 00:11:43,651
none of us can leave.

125
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:47,771
Fine.

126
00:11:48,651 --> 00:11:49,851
I agree with your plan.

127
00:11:51,771 --> 00:11:52,731
Let's get to work.

128
00:11:54,371 --> 00:11:55,851
I've been thinking.

129
00:11:56,412 --> 00:11:58,011
One of us has to go down there.

130
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:03,851
After you.

131
00:12:12,452 --> 00:12:13,692
Is this even a problem?

132
00:12:15,972 --> 00:12:16,891
I'm telling you,

133
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:19,412
I

134
00:12:20,131 --> 00:12:21,731
have seen some real action.

135
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:25,212
Back in the day...

136
00:12:33,812 --> 00:12:35,972
After we drained all that water,

137
00:12:36,692 --> 00:12:38,011
we hauled that thing up.

138
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:39,692
Xiaoge,

139
00:12:41,932 --> 00:12:42,972
look at her.

140
00:12:43,692 --> 00:12:46,052
She has a swollen belly.

141
00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:49,491
Could she have been pregnant?

142
00:12:54,092 --> 00:12:57,011
What's this swollen part then?

143
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:06,572
What's wrong, Xiaoge?

144
00:13:14,011 --> 00:13:15,851
What's written here?

145
00:13:16,052 --> 00:13:17,131
Wu's not around.

146
00:13:17,932 --> 00:13:19,292
I can't read these characters.

147
00:13:20,452 --> 00:13:21,011
Xiaoge,

148
00:13:22,251 --> 00:13:23,452
do you recognize these?

149
00:13:26,052 --> 00:13:27,491
A hole is under this stone tablet.

150
00:13:28,251 --> 00:13:29,452
Under it?

151
00:13:30,412 --> 00:13:31,292
How'd you know that?

152
00:13:40,572 --> 00:13:42,092
Well... There really is a hole.

153
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:44,572
It's man-made.

154
00:13:47,292 --> 00:13:48,572
Could it be dug

155
00:13:49,651 --> 00:13:51,131
by Wu's third uncle?

156
00:13:54,812 --> 00:13:55,932
That doesn't make sense.

157
00:13:58,332 --> 00:13:58,891
But

158
00:13:59,011 --> 00:14:00,611
why dig a hole here?

159
00:14:01,851 --> 00:14:03,131
Unless they encountered

160
00:14:03,131 --> 00:14:04,251
the same situation as us

161
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:06,692
and tried to leave through here?

162
00:14:21,972 --> 00:14:22,891
What's wrong, Xiaoge?

163
00:14:23,692 --> 00:14:24,692
Pangzi, don't move.

164
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:39,611
Xiaoge!

165
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:40,212
What's that?

166
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,452
Pangzi, run!

167
00:14:42,611 --> 00:14:43,052
Xiaoge,

168
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:43,972
I'll help you!

169
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:15,812
Then we just kept swimming

170
00:15:15,812 --> 00:15:16,412
and swimming

171
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:18,052
until we surfaced.

172
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,371
Then we saw you,

173
00:15:19,611 --> 00:15:20,491
scaring me to death.

174
00:15:20,771 --> 00:15:22,812
Why didn't you mention
how you scared me?

175
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:27,212
So you only saw a hand?

176
00:15:28,412 --> 00:15:29,212
What do you mean?

177
00:15:30,731 --> 00:15:33,452
Are you calling me a coward?

178
00:15:33,611 --> 00:15:34,491
Xiaoge's good, right?

179
00:15:35,932 --> 00:15:37,771
Even he turned tail
and ran from that thing.

180
00:15:38,092 --> 00:15:40,371
You think I'd play hero for no reason?

181
00:15:41,011 --> 00:15:42,812
Speaking of which, I have a question.

182
00:15:42,972 --> 00:15:44,692
What exactly was that thing?

183
00:15:45,332 --> 00:15:46,771
Is it that terrifying?

184
00:15:47,092 --> 00:15:48,611
It's a small-clawed otter.

185
00:15:48,611 --> 00:15:50,052
Possibly mutated.

186
00:15:50,052 --> 00:15:52,812
It lurks in putrid, damp places.

187
00:15:53,932 --> 00:15:55,172
If we kill it,

188
00:15:55,452 --> 00:15:57,131
it releases toxic gas.

189
00:15:57,251 --> 00:15:58,412
So running was smart.

190
00:15:58,692 --> 00:15:59,452
No argument here.

191
00:16:04,212 --> 00:16:05,491
That means

192
00:16:07,292 --> 00:16:09,011
the tunnel you came through

193
00:16:09,572 --> 00:16:11,052
leads to this pool?

194
00:16:14,011 --> 00:16:15,212
Then why...

195
00:16:17,771 --> 00:16:18,932
What's the point of this?

196
00:16:30,491 --> 00:16:31,651
Is he losing his mind?

197
00:16:40,131 --> 00:16:40,932
Wu,

198
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,611
why are you staring at the stone again?

199
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,332
I forgot to mention earlier.

200
00:16:48,052 --> 00:16:50,292
I think the carvings
on these ballast stones

201
00:16:50,812 --> 00:16:52,412
are narrative paintings.

202
00:16:52,452 --> 00:16:53,251
What?

203
00:16:54,011 --> 00:16:54,812
Narrative paintings.

204
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:56,052
Of what story?

205
00:16:59,731 --> 00:17:00,692
It's indeed a story.

206
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:02,812
Were they building

207
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:03,972
something?

208
00:17:03,972 --> 00:17:05,051
I don't understand this.

209
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,251
- Don't block my view.
- This guy was pretentious.

210
00:17:10,771 --> 00:17:12,091
Everyone was facing forward.

211
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:14,212
Only he was facing the other way.

212
00:17:14,811 --> 00:17:15,932
Facing the sea,

213
00:17:16,932 --> 00:17:18,011
awaiting spring blossoms?

214
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:19,571
Who is he?

215
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:22,771
I guess

216
00:17:22,972 --> 00:17:24,612
this one carved on the stone

217
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:27,412
must be the shipwreck's owner.

218
00:17:27,531 --> 00:17:28,372
Why?

219
00:17:28,571 --> 00:17:30,412
Look at this part.

220
00:17:30,972 --> 00:17:33,452
The architectural techniques shown here

221
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:34,531
resemble those from here.

222
00:17:35,172 --> 00:17:36,251
And he designed many

223
00:17:36,251 --> 00:17:37,452
peculiar mechanisms.

224
00:17:37,652 --> 00:17:39,091
The design

225
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,972
is similar to the elevator here.

226
00:17:42,011 --> 00:17:42,972
You mean this?

227
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:44,932
There's some resemblance.

228
00:17:45,412 --> 00:17:46,132
Then what?

229
00:17:47,852 --> 00:17:48,652
However,

230
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:52,212
that actually narrows down
who it could be.

231
00:17:52,612 --> 00:17:54,452
What are you talking about?

232
00:17:54,692 --> 00:17:56,372
How does that narrow it down?

233
00:17:56,372 --> 00:17:57,731
Because master craftsmen back then

234
00:17:57,731 --> 00:17:58,771
were actually rare.

235
00:17:59,652 --> 00:18:00,372
First,

236
00:18:00,652 --> 00:18:01,811
it was six centuries ago.

237
00:18:02,452 --> 00:18:03,251
Second,

238
00:18:03,771 --> 00:18:04,852
he needed to be qualified

239
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:05,972
to construct

240
00:18:06,011 --> 00:18:07,932
a project rivaling
the Yong Imperial Palace.

241
00:18:08,692 --> 00:18:09,531
Third,

242
00:18:09,531 --> 00:18:12,372
he needed expertise
in fengshui and mystical arts.

243
00:18:14,571 --> 00:18:17,291
To meet all three criteria,

244
00:18:18,452 --> 00:18:20,091
he could only be...

245
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:20,972
Wang Zanghai.

246
00:18:21,531 --> 00:18:21,932
Right.

247
00:18:22,011 --> 00:18:22,811
Wang Zanghai.

248
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:24,571
Who's that?

249
00:18:25,251 --> 00:18:26,412
You scared me.

250
00:18:26,811 --> 00:18:28,331
Wang Zanghai was an extraordinary man.

251
00:18:29,091 --> 00:18:30,412
His mastery of fengshui

252
00:18:30,412 --> 00:18:32,132
was unparalleled.

253
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:33,291
Back then,

254
00:18:33,531 --> 00:18:35,972
(he was ordered to design
the entire Yong Imperial Palace)

255
00:18:36,852 --> 00:18:38,811
(and several major cities as well.)

256
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,731
(A single command from him)

257
00:18:43,932 --> 00:18:46,331
(could make entire cities
vanish overnight.)

258
00:18:47,932 --> 00:18:51,172
By the Mandate of Heaven,
the Emperor decrees.

259
00:18:51,612 --> 00:18:53,251
Appoint Chief Constructor

260
00:18:53,452 --> 00:18:55,972
and Master Carpenter
of the Imperial Palace,

261
00:18:56,331 --> 00:18:57,412
Wang Zanghai,

262
00:18:57,652 --> 00:18:59,731
(Imperial Edict)
as the Left Vice Minister of Works.

263
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,372
He's granted second-rank status

264
00:19:01,491 --> 00:19:04,331
with a first-rank official salary.

265
00:19:04,731 --> 00:19:06,412
So it is decreed.

266
00:19:11,536 --> 00:19:12,656
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

267
00:19:12,656 --> 00:19:13,488
Slow down!

268
00:19:13,488 --> 00:19:14,692
Fly it higher!

269
00:19:16,932 --> 00:19:18,212
Higher!

270
00:19:19,312 --> 00:19:20,848
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty, be careful!

271
00:19:20,848 --> 00:19:21,840
- Slow down!
- A little higher!

272
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,771
- Your Majesty!
- Slow down!

273
00:19:23,212 --> 00:19:23,731
Your Majesty!

274
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:24,091
Higher!

275
00:19:24,091 --> 00:19:25,932
(I've read some texts by him.)

276
00:19:26,172 --> 00:19:27,932
(About his works on fengshui.)

277
00:19:28,852 --> 00:19:30,892
They contain insights
into cosmic secrets,

278
00:19:30,892 --> 00:19:32,251
profound beyond measure.

279
00:19:34,531 --> 00:19:35,531
(But unfortunately,)

280
00:19:36,011 --> 00:19:36,731
(most of those)

281
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:38,531
(weren't preserved by his descendants.)

282
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:40,972
(The majority were lost.)

283
00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:43,091
But consider,

284
00:19:43,531 --> 00:19:44,612
such a man

285
00:19:45,011 --> 00:19:47,011
could build a ship

286
00:19:47,331 --> 00:19:48,771
that resists decay for millennia.

287
00:19:50,172 --> 00:19:51,212
Totally effortlessly.

288
00:19:51,892 --> 00:19:52,731
You are right.

289
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,531
Never imagined

290
00:19:55,892 --> 00:19:58,372
an architect could do all this.

291
00:19:59,212 --> 00:20:00,692
But these are just my speculations.

292
00:20:01,972 --> 00:20:03,852
If we could find any written records,

293
00:20:04,011 --> 00:20:05,531
I could confirm if my speculations

294
00:20:05,531 --> 00:20:06,852
are right or wrong.

295
00:20:09,571 --> 00:20:10,452
Didn't you say

296
00:20:10,452 --> 00:20:12,251
the female corpse you saw

297
00:20:12,251 --> 00:20:14,771
was on top of a stone slab
with inscriptions on it?

298
00:20:15,051 --> 00:20:16,531
Do you remember what was on it?

299
00:20:16,771 --> 00:20:17,531
Don't mention it.

300
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:21,531
The sight of that white-haired monster
scared me half to death.

301
00:20:21,811 --> 00:20:23,132
How could I remember any of that?

302
00:20:26,051 --> 00:20:28,771
Speaking of the white-haired monster,
it does jog my memory.

303
00:20:29,452 --> 00:20:32,331
I keep feeling like
I've seen it somewhere before.

304
00:20:34,531 --> 00:20:35,612
Where was it?

305
00:20:39,652 --> 00:20:42,932
Do you think
that white-haired monster can swim?

306
00:21:58,051 --> 00:21:58,972
It's so deep.

307
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,251
This is a bottomless pit.

308
00:22:06,811 --> 00:22:08,731
Will there be monsters here?

309
00:22:09,091 --> 00:22:10,452
We're not in Journey to the West.

310
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,212
Look.

311
00:22:14,932 --> 00:22:16,491
If we follow these stone steps down,

312
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:19,331
there might be another path.

313
00:22:23,251 --> 00:22:24,291
Should we go check it out?

314
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:26,452
Let's go.

315
00:22:28,612 --> 00:22:29,331
Pangzi.

316
00:22:29,852 --> 00:22:30,771
Wait a second.

317
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:32,652
At least wait for the mist to clear.

318
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:33,811
It's too dangerous right now.

319
00:22:35,972 --> 00:22:37,132
I'll be fine.

320
00:22:37,811 --> 00:22:39,412
I'm just going to scout ahead.

321
00:22:40,011 --> 00:22:42,692
If there's real danger,
I'll come back up.

322
00:22:43,852 --> 00:22:44,652
Relax.

323
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:46,212
Come on.

324
00:22:46,811 --> 00:22:48,091
Be careful down there.

325
00:22:50,652 --> 00:22:51,612
It's really narrow.

326
00:23:03,972 --> 00:23:04,852
English letters here!

327
00:23:05,932 --> 00:23:07,051
You must be mistaken.

328
00:23:07,571 --> 00:23:09,372
Why would there be that
in the shipwreck?

329
00:23:10,531 --> 00:23:12,771
I might not know English well,

330
00:23:13,011 --> 00:23:15,372
but I know the alphabet.

331
00:23:16,212 --> 00:23:17,491
This is clearly English.

332
00:23:17,571 --> 00:23:18,852
Come down and see for yourself.

333
00:23:19,652 --> 00:23:21,331
Read what it says then.

334
00:23:26,132 --> 00:23:27,132
If I could read it,

335
00:23:27,132 --> 00:23:28,372
would I need you to come down?

336
00:23:28,731 --> 00:23:29,491
Enough talk.

337
00:23:29,612 --> 00:23:30,291
Get down here.

338
00:23:31,132 --> 00:23:32,731
If this isn't English,

339
00:23:32,852 --> 00:23:34,291
I'll write my surname upside down.

340
00:23:41,372 --> 00:23:43,452
Tell me loud and clear. Is it English?

341
00:23:48,132 --> 00:23:48,932
Is it?

342
00:23:48,932 --> 00:23:49,972
Yes, it is!

343
00:23:50,612 --> 00:23:51,811
I apologize, okay?

344
00:23:51,811 --> 00:23:53,051
That's more like it.

345
00:23:54,652 --> 00:23:56,892
Why are there English letters here?

346
00:23:59,491 --> 00:24:03,452
Could it be that some foreigners
came down here before?

347
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:06,011
Those foreigners!

348
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:08,212
Always stealing our treasures!

349
00:24:09,051 --> 00:24:09,972
Not necessarily.

350
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,011
Chinese people could write these too.

351
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:15,531
My theory is that

352
00:24:15,892 --> 00:24:17,892
when the previous exploration team
came down,

353
00:24:18,212 --> 00:24:19,531
they encountered dangers

354
00:24:20,011 --> 00:24:20,932
and carved these

355
00:24:20,932 --> 00:24:22,291
English letters as a warning.

356
00:24:24,612 --> 00:24:26,571
Are you saying

357
00:24:26,811 --> 00:24:28,452
it might've been
your third uncle's team?

358
00:24:29,652 --> 00:24:30,811
That crossed my mind.

359
00:24:32,051 --> 00:24:32,771
But

360
00:24:34,531 --> 00:24:36,132
if the others came down here

361
00:24:36,132 --> 00:24:38,011
while my third uncle slept,

362
00:24:39,331 --> 00:24:40,531
could there be a connection

363
00:24:41,692 --> 00:24:43,892
between their disappearance
and this place?

364
00:24:47,811 --> 00:24:49,531
I think I've been here before.

365
00:24:56,291 --> 00:24:57,531
Where's he going?

366
00:25:00,331 --> 00:25:01,132
What did he say?

367
00:25:02,652 --> 00:25:03,132
Xiaoge!

368
00:25:13,652 --> 00:25:14,412
Is he really

369
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:16,491
that person from the old photo
20 years ago?

370
00:25:20,412 --> 00:25:21,291
What did you say?

371
00:25:26,932 --> 00:25:27,892
You know what?

372
00:25:28,771 --> 00:25:30,412
This place is pitch black.

373
00:25:30,972 --> 00:25:32,051
Earlier, Xiaoge and I

374
00:25:32,051 --> 00:25:34,212
nearly drowned underwater.

375
00:25:34,412 --> 00:25:35,051
We didn't notice

376
00:25:35,051 --> 00:25:37,212
the space below is so huge.

377
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:54,852
Xiaoge?

378
00:25:57,372 --> 00:25:58,452
Why has he frozen there?

379
00:26:01,571 --> 00:26:02,372
Xiaoge?

380
00:26:47,652 --> 00:26:48,452
Xiaoge.

381
00:27:05,892 --> 00:27:07,972
What's this stone sculpture
supposed to be?

382
00:27:08,331 --> 00:27:09,972
Looks like some Hemudu tribesman.

383
00:27:11,011 --> 00:27:12,291
It's a Sea-Calming Stone Monkey,

384
00:27:13,372 --> 00:27:15,728
usually sunk at pond bottoms
to ward off evil.

385
00:27:16,251 --> 00:27:17,452
It wards off evil?

386
00:27:17,892 --> 00:27:18,932
I should be thanking it

387
00:27:18,932 --> 00:27:19,972
if it doesn't beat me.

388
00:27:58,412 --> 00:27:59,011
Sanxing!

389
00:27:59,331 --> 00:28:00,091
Stop running!

390
00:28:00,132 --> 00:28:02,491
- (Sanxing!)
- (Sanxing!)

391
00:28:03,852 --> 00:28:04,688
Come back!

392
00:28:08,491 --> 00:28:09,251
(Absolutely not.)

393
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:11,172
(Sanxing's responsible
for our team's safety.)

394
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:12,132
(He says we can't go.)

395
00:28:12,612 --> 00:28:14,384
- Zhang!
- Zhang!

396
00:28:14,384 --> 00:28:15,452
- Zhang!
- Zhang!

397
00:28:15,452 --> 00:28:16,656
- Zhang!
- What are you doing?

398
00:28:16,656 --> 00:28:18,132
- Come on, Zhang!
- We need to leave.

399
00:28:18,132 --> 00:28:18,896
