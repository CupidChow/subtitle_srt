3
00:01:54,826 --> 00:01:55,586
Wu.

4
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:58,746
Tell me.

5
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:00,946
Where did this hole come from?

6
00:02:04,985 --> 00:02:06,225
If I'm thinking it right,

7
00:02:08,105 --> 00:02:09,065
it should be

8
00:02:10,426 --> 00:02:11,545
- Xie Lianhuan.
- Xie Lianhuan.

9
00:02:14,706 --> 00:02:17,225
This guy's unbelievable.

10
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:20,785
He must be a reincarnated pangolin.

11
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,345
If he had enough time,

12
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:27,026
could he dig a tunnel to Antarctica?

13
00:02:32,706 --> 00:02:33,825
What was that just now?

14
00:02:34,785 --> 00:02:38,306
It's like an unseasoned
squirrel mandarin fish.

15
00:02:40,105 --> 00:02:41,586
That is the sea monkey.

16
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:44,345
That's the sea monkey?

17
00:02:48,065 --> 00:02:49,785
I thought you were lying before.

18
00:02:50,426 --> 00:02:51,345
It really exists.

19
00:02:52,866 --> 00:02:54,186
Wang Zanghai

20
00:02:55,026 --> 00:02:56,146
is so twisted.

21
00:02:57,225 --> 00:02:58,785
He's like a zookeeper of monsters,

22
00:02:59,426 --> 00:03:01,026
raising all kinds of weird creatures.

23
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:02,866
First sea monkeys, then Forbidden Woman,

24
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:05,706
and then white-haired monsters.

25
00:03:07,026 --> 00:03:08,586
Was he holding a party on this ship?

26
00:03:10,785 --> 00:03:11,825
Where'd he get them all?

27
00:03:12,586 --> 00:03:13,385
Poison.

28
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:14,545
What?

29
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:25,345
Remember the white hair on your back?

30
00:03:31,146 --> 00:03:32,466
Stop scaring me, okay?

31
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:33,866
I'm already terrified.

32
00:03:34,306 --> 00:03:35,945
Didn't you say the white hair was fine?

33
00:03:37,986 --> 00:03:38,986
What's going on?

34
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,746
Could the Lotus Arrows be the problem,

35
00:03:42,906 --> 00:03:44,385
making people white-haired monsters?

36
00:03:45,345 --> 00:03:46,866
No wonder those arrows weren't lethal.

37
00:03:47,986 --> 00:03:49,345
Don't scare me, Wu.

38
00:03:49,345 --> 00:03:50,266
I'm a coward.

39
00:03:51,825 --> 00:03:53,306
Will I become a white-haired monster?

40
00:03:53,306 --> 00:03:55,026
I won't end up like that, right?

41
00:03:56,065 --> 00:03:57,266
Just wild guesses.

42
00:03:58,186 --> 00:03:59,466
I was hit by arrows too.

43
00:03:59,466 --> 00:04:00,586
Does that mean I'm poisoned?

44
00:04:01,026 --> 00:04:02,065
Cut the crap.

45
00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:03,385
I found it long ago

46
00:04:03,466 --> 00:04:04,665
that you're built differently.

47
00:04:05,866 --> 00:04:06,785
I found it last time

48
00:04:07,345 --> 00:04:08,746
at the King of Lu's kiln.

49
00:04:08,746 --> 00:04:09,906
Young Third Master!

50
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:11,545
Da Kui!

51
00:04:11,746 --> 00:04:13,426
Da Kui saved you back then,

52
00:04:13,825 --> 00:04:14,864
and you're still fine.

53
00:04:17,906 --> 00:04:18,826
Xiaoge,

54
00:04:19,706 --> 00:04:20,946
what am I supposed to do?

55
00:04:22,225 --> 00:04:23,586
Are you still itching?

56
00:04:26,345 --> 00:04:28,305
My whole back's numb now.

57
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:29,665
I can't feel a thing.

58
00:04:29,665 --> 00:04:31,826
I don't know if it's pain-numb,
sore-numb,

59
00:04:31,826 --> 00:04:32,745
or itch-numb.

60
00:04:32,745 --> 00:04:33,906
It's just completely numb.

61
00:04:34,865 --> 00:04:35,665
Wait.

62
00:04:36,146 --> 00:04:38,865
Why didn't you say
it was this serious earlier?

63
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:41,985
It wouldn't have helped.

64
00:04:42,506 --> 00:04:44,545
Then why tell me now?

65
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:46,865
Now I feel worse.

66
00:04:47,425 --> 00:04:48,946
Think of something.

67
00:04:49,785 --> 00:04:51,586
There are no better solutions here.

68
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:54,626
It means we can't fix it here.

69
00:04:54,706 --> 00:04:56,345
But we might find a solution outside.

70
00:04:56,466 --> 00:04:58,626
So we need to get out fast.

71
00:04:59,185 --> 00:04:59,626
Right.

72
00:04:59,906 --> 00:05:00,745
Right, right!

73
00:05:02,506 --> 00:05:03,466
Find a way out,

74
00:05:04,105 --> 00:05:05,105
and get to a hospital.

75
00:05:08,706 --> 00:05:09,785
What are you doing?

76
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:12,506
This thing is creepy.
It needs better locks.

77
00:05:12,506 --> 00:05:13,626
Just in case.

78
00:05:14,026 --> 00:05:15,665
Don't bother with it. It's already...

79
00:05:17,425 --> 00:05:18,745
Xiaoge, what're you looking at?

80
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,672
This is Heavenly Palace on the Clouds.

81
00:05:47,105 --> 00:05:48,745
Heavenly Palace on the Clouds?

82
00:07:01,826 --> 00:07:04,545
This truly an ancient LEGO architecture.

83
00:07:09,146 --> 00:07:10,946
So intricate.

84
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,105
Even the LEGO version
is of this grandeur.

85
00:07:18,225 --> 00:07:20,066
What's the real thing look like?

86
00:07:22,865 --> 00:07:24,665
Where could it be?

87
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:28,466
Could it actually be on the clouds?

88
00:07:30,026 --> 00:07:31,745
Enough with the nonsense.

89
00:07:32,305 --> 00:07:33,826
You're corrupting Xiaoge.

90
00:07:33,826 --> 00:07:34,985
Corrupting?

91
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:36,665
Xiaoge's developing a sense of humor,

92
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:37,466
right?

93
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:38,626
Shouldn't we be happy?

94
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:39,826
Right, Xiaoge?

95
00:07:41,185 --> 00:07:42,105
Is this about me?

96
00:07:43,626 --> 00:07:44,506
What you looking at?

97
00:07:46,985 --> 00:07:48,545
How is there beef jerky here?

98
00:07:50,626 --> 00:07:51,626
Wang Zanghai.

99
00:07:54,146 --> 00:07:54,946
Wang Zanghai?

100
00:08:01,506 --> 00:08:02,665
This is a specimen?

101
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:08,906
His fingernails need trimming.

102
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:27,146
So, Xiaoge?

103
00:08:27,425 --> 00:08:28,506
Found anything?

104
00:08:29,785 --> 00:08:31,056
Something in his stomach.

105
00:08:32,866 --> 00:08:34,705
He was quite the glutton.

106
00:08:34,705 --> 00:08:35,746
He even died stuffed.

107
00:08:36,226 --> 00:08:37,106
Cut the nonsense.

108
00:08:37,945 --> 00:08:39,386
He hid something

109
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:41,386
in his own stomach before dying.

110
00:08:41,705 --> 00:08:43,465
That means it's extremely important.

111
00:08:45,185 --> 00:08:48,386
It might be crucial to everything here.

112
00:08:49,065 --> 00:08:50,026
What could it be?

113
00:08:50,146 --> 00:08:51,425
A stinking turd.

114
00:08:51,986 --> 00:08:53,026
Crucial or not,

115
00:08:53,026 --> 00:08:54,665
I don't have a third eye.

116
00:08:55,425 --> 00:08:57,026
How could I see through this?

117
00:08:57,506 --> 00:08:59,465
You said it must be important yourself.

118
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:00,746
Do you remember

119
00:09:00,944 --> 00:09:03,386
the corpse with a key
in her mouth at the King of Lu's kiln?

120
00:09:03,386 --> 00:09:04,185
Yes.

121
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:05,866
What about it?

122
00:09:07,626 --> 00:09:09,425
If this really is Wang Zanghai,

123
00:09:10,346 --> 00:09:12,106
who knew countless secret mechanisms,

124
00:09:13,266 --> 00:09:15,106
the thing in his stomach

125
00:09:15,106 --> 00:09:16,506
must be more dangerous.

126
00:09:18,386 --> 00:09:19,705
That makes sense.

127
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:22,305
So what should we do?

128
00:09:22,465 --> 00:09:24,185
Time's running tight.

129
00:09:24,185 --> 00:09:25,026
Shall we bail now?

130
00:09:25,906 --> 00:09:26,705
Let's go.

131
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:27,746
Come on, Xiaoge.

132
00:09:33,746 --> 00:09:34,626
W-Wait.

133
00:09:34,626 --> 00:09:36,185
W-What are you doing?

134
00:09:40,026 --> 00:09:41,266
What's this about?

135
00:09:42,425 --> 00:09:43,185
I don't know.

136
00:09:53,585 --> 00:09:55,465
He seemed to smile.

137
00:10:38,465 --> 00:10:39,346
This is...

138
00:10:41,945 --> 00:10:42,746
Luminous pearls.

139
00:10:47,545 --> 00:10:48,785
Oh, my!

140
00:10:49,305 --> 00:10:51,346
There are so many!

141
00:11:02,506 --> 00:11:03,506
What's this?

142
00:11:18,506 --> 00:11:19,305
Wu,

143
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,825
doesn't this mural

144
00:11:22,425 --> 00:11:23,746
look different

145
00:11:23,746 --> 00:11:24,945
from what we saw up there?

146
00:11:37,425 --> 00:11:38,185
It's true.

147
00:11:39,226 --> 00:11:41,065
The mural shows different content

148
00:11:42,185 --> 00:11:43,465
from various angles.

149
00:11:46,465 --> 00:11:47,465
Do you know why?

150
00:11:53,465 --> 00:11:55,425
This is called a shadow mural.

151
00:11:55,785 --> 00:11:56,626
The lighting

152
00:11:56,626 --> 00:11:58,506
was specially designed this way.

153
00:11:58,866 --> 00:12:00,465
Different light angles

154
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:03,825
create varying images from this diagram.

155
00:12:04,465 --> 00:12:06,785
It should also be a narrative mural.

156
00:12:07,785 --> 00:12:09,825
The central part here must be...

157
00:12:10,305 --> 00:12:11,506
Heavenly Palace on the Clouds.

158
00:12:14,465 --> 00:12:15,906
Heavenly Palace on the Clouds

159
00:12:16,386 --> 00:12:17,986
when first completed.

160
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,305
The so-called
Heavenly Palace on the Clouds

161
00:12:21,305 --> 00:12:24,065
was actually built
on an extremely high mountain peak,

162
00:12:24,465 --> 00:12:25,585
wrapped in clouds

163
00:12:26,026 --> 00:12:28,825
to create an illusion
of floating above the clouds.

164
00:12:29,906 --> 00:12:31,945
Why does this place look so familiar?

165
00:12:35,026 --> 00:12:36,746
It resembles
the Three Saints Snow Mountain.

166
00:12:38,986 --> 00:12:41,626
Could Heavenly Palace on the Clouds
be located

167
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:44,585
on Three Saints Snow Mountain?

168
00:13:10,065 --> 00:13:11,185
Let's check other parts.

169
00:13:20,906 --> 00:13:23,465
It's quite a high-standard procession.

170
00:13:25,945 --> 00:13:27,585
It's comparable to a ruler's, isn't it?

171
00:13:28,585 --> 00:13:30,106
Who could be this important?

172
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,425
Judging by the attire,

173
00:13:34,705 --> 00:13:36,065
it appears northern in style.

174
00:13:37,106 --> 00:13:39,065
It seems the Heavenly Palace's master

175
00:13:39,065 --> 00:13:40,705
was a northern noble.

176
00:13:41,705 --> 00:13:43,506
Rulers build palaces on land,

177
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:44,705
but this master

178
00:13:44,705 --> 00:13:46,425
built his on the clouds.

179
00:13:47,305 --> 00:13:49,065
He considered himself

180
00:13:49,065 --> 00:13:50,305
above rulers.

181
00:13:52,386 --> 00:13:54,626
I don't know whether his status
was higher or not.

182
00:13:55,465 --> 00:13:56,346
But look.

183
00:13:56,906 --> 00:13:58,146
Nearly all females here.

184
00:14:00,785 --> 00:14:02,986
Is this a women's kingdom?

185
00:14:24,945 --> 00:14:26,785
Let me finish singing.

186
00:14:26,906 --> 00:14:28,386
Why so much chatter?

187
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:46,746
It's stranger here.

188
00:14:49,026 --> 00:14:51,785
Why they burned the plank path?

189
00:14:51,866 --> 00:14:53,200
It took much effort to build it.

190
00:14:54,386 --> 00:14:55,346
It was probably

191
00:14:55,346 --> 00:14:57,785
to prevent outsiders
from damaging the Heavenly Palace.

192
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:58,906
Why is that?

193
00:14:59,945 --> 00:15:01,465
By destroying the only plank path,

194
00:15:01,705 --> 00:15:02,986
outsiders can't get in.

195
00:15:03,065 --> 00:15:04,545
But insiders couldn't leave either.

196
00:15:10,305 --> 00:15:11,425
Finish the story!

197
00:15:15,626 --> 00:15:16,665
I get it now.

198
00:15:16,906 --> 00:15:18,096
The fire caused an avalanche

199
00:15:18,305 --> 00:15:19,986
that buried the entire Heavenly Palace,

200
00:15:20,226 --> 00:15:23,106
along with all the procession members.

201
00:15:23,386 --> 00:15:26,026
Before the world laid eyes on it,

202
00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:28,146
it became a legend.

203
00:15:28,906 --> 00:15:29,986
That was brutal.

204
00:15:32,945 --> 00:15:34,825
Then why did he create so many murals

205
00:15:34,825 --> 00:15:36,305
to document all this?

206
00:15:36,425 --> 00:15:38,146
He still held resentment about this.

207
00:15:39,825 --> 00:15:40,785
You mean...

208
00:15:45,746 --> 00:15:46,626
Wang Zanghai.

209
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:56,305
He built such a grand Heavenly Palace,

210
00:15:56,825 --> 00:15:58,305
but never got to admire it himself,

211
00:15:58,626 --> 00:15:59,825
before it was buried by snow.

212
00:16:00,945 --> 00:16:02,626
Imagine how bitter he must have felt.

213
00:16:03,785 --> 00:16:05,906
That's why he preserved it this way

214
00:16:06,825 --> 00:16:07,986
and sank it to the seabed.

215
00:16:08,705 --> 00:16:10,705
It's specifically for people like us

216
00:16:10,705 --> 00:16:12,825
who could discover it to witness.

217
00:16:13,665 --> 00:16:15,506
The one who ordered him
to build this palace

218
00:16:15,506 --> 00:16:17,065
must have held immense power

219
00:16:17,465 --> 00:16:18,425
and prominent status.

220
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:20,506
That's why he couldn't

221
00:16:20,506 --> 00:16:22,226
show this masterpiece to the world.

222
00:16:22,465 --> 00:16:25,146
But given Wang Zanghai's
boastful nature,

223
00:16:25,906 --> 00:16:27,665
he needed future generations to see

224
00:16:28,305 --> 00:16:29,585
and acknowledge

225
00:16:30,386 --> 00:16:32,146
that among all his creations,

226
00:16:32,506 --> 00:16:35,986
there existed such a magnificent work.

227
00:16:45,866 --> 00:16:46,945
What is this?

228
00:16:46,945 --> 00:16:48,106
Why are the lights dimming

229
00:16:49,185 --> 00:16:50,256
when we guessed correctly?

230
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:54,106
Where's Xiaoge?

231
00:16:55,945 --> 00:16:56,785
Xiaoge!

232
00:16:58,305 --> 00:16:59,746
Oh, no. We lost him.

233
00:17:00,146 --> 00:17:00,945
Xiaoge!

234
00:17:06,465 --> 00:17:07,306
Xiaoge!

235
00:17:09,866 --> 00:17:10,665
Xiaoge!

236
00:17:13,786 --> 00:17:14,586
Xiaoge!

237
00:17:15,626 --> 00:17:16,465
Xiaoge!

238
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:19,225
Xiao...

239
00:17:20,866 --> 00:17:22,025
Well...

240
00:17:22,465 --> 00:17:24,386
We've been searching everywhere for you,

241
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:25,586
and here you are,

242
00:17:25,826 --> 00:17:27,665
striking poses in front of a mirror?

243
00:17:27,945 --> 00:17:28,906
What's wrong?

244
00:17:28,906 --> 00:17:29,866
Why?

245
00:17:30,866 --> 00:17:32,016
There's a hole behind this.

246
00:17:38,745 --> 00:17:39,945
How can you tell?

247
00:17:42,505 --> 00:17:43,465
Move it aside.

248
00:17:57,705 --> 00:17:58,906
Impressive.

249
00:17:59,265 --> 00:18:00,626
You've got X-ray vision?

250
00:18:17,586 --> 00:18:18,786
I've been here before.

251
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:24,505
So what memories surfaced?

252
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:26,306
This is where we entered back then,

253
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:28,826
got drugged, and lost all consciousness.

254
00:18:29,786 --> 00:18:31,025
I need to enter again.

255
00:18:31,745 --> 00:18:32,265
No.

256
00:18:35,626 --> 00:18:36,985
You believe

257
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:38,826
Third Uncle drugged you back then.

258
00:18:39,945 --> 00:18:40,745
But

259
00:18:41,346 --> 00:18:42,025
I don't think

260
00:18:42,025 --> 00:18:43,906
he had the capability
to erase your memories.

261
00:18:44,586 --> 00:18:45,465
Have you considered

262
00:18:46,265 --> 00:18:48,265
what if you lose your memories

263
00:18:48,985 --> 00:18:49,786
again inside?

264
00:18:52,826 --> 00:18:53,866
To you all,

265
00:18:54,786 --> 00:18:56,945
this is just another bizarre adventure.

266
00:18:57,745 --> 00:18:58,826
But for me,

267
00:18:59,185 --> 00:19:00,786
it's an unsolvable knot.

268
00:19:02,306 --> 00:19:03,705
I might lose my memories again.

269
00:19:04,985 --> 00:19:06,826
So I must keep chasing the truth.

270
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:08,386
Valid point.

271
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:11,225
I do understand you,

272
00:19:11,586 --> 00:19:12,705
but even if you go in

273
00:19:12,705 --> 00:19:14,705
and uncover every secret, what then?

274
00:19:15,705 --> 00:19:16,745
When the oxygen runs out

275
00:19:16,745 --> 00:19:17,546
and we all

276
00:19:17,546 --> 00:19:18,705
suffocate here,

277
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:19,665
what's next?

278
00:19:19,866 --> 00:19:21,705
All secrets will become worthless.

279
00:19:22,265 --> 00:19:23,146
Also valid.

280
00:19:25,025 --> 00:19:26,225
So what are our chances

281
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:28,066
of getting out?

282
00:19:31,265 --> 00:19:32,225
We've climbed upward

283
00:19:32,745 --> 00:19:33,465
about ten meters

284
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:35,265
since entering this structure.

285
00:19:36,586 --> 00:19:38,106
This shipwreck couldn't be this tall.

286
00:19:38,265 --> 00:19:39,626
We must be at the ceiling now.

287
00:19:40,185 --> 00:19:41,945
We just need to make a hole
in the ceiling

288
00:19:41,945 --> 00:19:43,066
when the tide goes out.

289
00:19:44,265 --> 00:19:46,146
That way, we'll likely
escape through there.

290
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:47,906
The odds are good.

291
00:19:48,945 --> 00:19:49,745
However,

292
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:52,306
once seawater rushes in,

293
00:19:52,705 --> 00:19:54,546
the entire wreck will flood.

294
00:19:55,225 --> 00:19:56,185
But don't worry,

295
00:19:56,465 --> 00:19:57,745
the site itself won't disappear.

296
00:19:57,866 --> 00:19:59,225
Just the wreck being submerged.

297
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,106
We can return better equipped

298
00:20:01,106 --> 00:20:01,985
in a few days.

299
00:20:02,386 --> 00:20:03,985
His plan sounds more valid.

300
00:20:04,106 --> 00:20:05,066
And the crucial point is

301
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:06,386
we're truly running out of time.

302
00:20:06,586 --> 00:20:08,866
Xiaoge, you need
to listen to us this time.

303
00:20:09,225 --> 00:20:10,265
This time around,

304
00:20:10,546 --> 00:20:13,386
let's first find tools
to make a hole in it.

305
00:20:14,106 --> 00:20:15,945
I think the sealing of this shipwreck

306
00:20:16,786 --> 00:20:17,945
was quite well-done.

307
00:20:18,265 --> 00:20:19,665
No leaks after all these years.

308
00:20:20,106 --> 00:20:21,386
It must be a massive project.

309
00:20:23,705 --> 00:20:24,745
Actions speak louder.

310
00:20:25,665 --> 00:20:27,306
Let's go find tools.

311
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,306
What should we use?

312
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:34,945
Use this.

313
00:20:44,146 --> 00:20:44,826
Xiaoge,

314
00:20:44,985 --> 00:20:46,306
I need to discuss three things.

315
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:49,146
First, don't suddenly disappear anymore.

316
00:20:49,505 --> 00:20:51,146
Second, stop striking poses.

317
00:20:51,465 --> 00:20:53,906
Third, quit showing off, okay?

318
00:21:33,745 --> 00:21:34,586
Xiaoge!

319
00:21:34,945 --> 00:21:35,786
Xiaoge!

320
00:21:35,945 --> 00:21:37,025
Hey! Wait for me!

321
00:21:41,306 --> 00:21:42,106
Wu Xie!

322
00:21:44,225 --> 00:21:45,066
Wu Xie!

323
00:21:52,546 --> 00:21:53,386
Wu Xie!

324
00:22:03,826 --> 00:22:04,626
What's wrong?

325
00:22:10,346 --> 00:22:11,106
Third Uncle.

326
00:22:13,106 --> 00:22:14,665
Third Uncle. Third Uncle!

327
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:16,386
Third Uncle?

328
00:22:16,386 --> 00:22:17,745
Stay back! Stay back!

329
00:22:18,465 --> 00:22:19,425
Stay back!

330
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:20,306
Still trying to run?

331
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:21,066
Stay back!

332
00:22:21,066 --> 00:22:21,705
Stop there!

333
00:22:22,185 --> 00:22:22,906
Just stay down.

334
00:22:23,146 --> 00:22:24,705
I've been chasing you this whole way.

335
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:26,146
I saved this arrow for you.

336
00:22:26,505 --> 00:22:27,786
Wu Sanxing, stay back!

337
00:22:27,786 --> 00:22:28,306
Stay back!

338
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:28,784
Wu Sanxing?

339
00:22:28,945 --> 00:22:29,626
Wu Sanxing.

340
00:22:30,306 --> 00:22:31,546
You know where Third Uncle is?

341
00:22:31,546 --> 00:22:32,705
Do you know Third Uncle?

342
00:22:33,106 --> 00:22:33,985
Tell me!

343
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:35,225
Tell me where Third Uncle is!

344
00:22:35,225 --> 00:22:36,225
Where's my Third Uncle?

345
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:36,665
Stay back!

346
00:22:36,665 --> 00:22:37,586
Wu.

347
00:22:38,386 --> 00:22:39,985
Can't you see she's not right?

348
00:23:12,705 --> 00:23:13,505
Xiaoge.

349
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:15,265
Don't you think

350
00:23:18,066 --> 00:23:19,386
she's possessed or something?

351
00:23:20,826 --> 00:23:22,505
She's probably triggered by something.

352
00:23:23,866 --> 00:23:25,386
Could she be faking it?

353
00:23:26,985 --> 00:23:28,106
There's an old saying

354
00:23:29,705 --> 00:23:32,626
that the worst poison
comes from big-eared traitors.

355
00:23:34,866 --> 00:23:35,665
So...

356
00:23:36,066 --> 00:23:36,665
Wu Xie!

357
00:23:38,906 --> 00:23:39,505
Wait.

358
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:41,546
Have you no mercy for delicate women?

359
00:23:41,826 --> 00:23:43,265
What do we do now?

360
00:23:51,985 --> 00:23:52,906
Listen.

361
00:23:54,586 --> 00:23:56,185
The flashlight's broken too.

362
00:23:57,066 --> 00:23:58,665
Show some concern for me, okay?

363
00:23:59,665 --> 00:24:01,586
Could you come carry a bag at least?

364
00:24:03,866 --> 00:24:05,025
Unbelievable.

365
00:24:05,665 --> 00:24:06,505
Have you considered

366
00:24:06,505 --> 00:24:07,826
this place would be so sinister?

367
00:24:08,945 --> 00:24:10,185
We don't have much time left.

368
00:24:10,185 --> 00:24:11,546
Maybe we should turn back.

369
00:24:13,626 --> 00:24:14,505
What's this?

370
00:24:19,505 --> 00:24:22,025
Is this a giant coral or a tree?

371
00:24:22,306 --> 00:24:23,546
Or a coral tree?

372
00:24:29,025 --> 00:24:30,705
I'll give you some friendly reminders.

373
00:24:31,306 --> 00:24:32,146
First,

374
00:24:32,465 --> 00:24:33,665
the things ahead are unknown.

375
00:24:33,665 --> 00:24:35,826
They're likely connected
to Ning's collapse.

376
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,185
Second,

377
00:24:37,425 --> 00:24:38,826
our time is really running out.

378
00:24:39,505 --> 00:24:40,906
Are you sure about going deeper?

379
00:24:42,225 --> 00:24:43,185
And third...

380
00:24:44,745 --> 00:24:46,786
Stay close. Don't fall behind.

381
00:24:50,665 --> 00:24:51,505
Perfect.

382
00:24:52,906 --> 00:24:54,826
The third one is
they'll never let you leave.

383
00:24:55,066 --> 00:24:56,066
I knew it.

384
00:25:00,546 --> 00:25:01,665
Slow down a bit.

385
00:25:01,665 --> 00:25:02,826
Thank goodness she's slim.

386
00:25:04,786 --> 00:25:06,066
What did I tell you?

387
00:25:06,586 --> 00:25:08,066
Isn't it just a coral tree?

388
00:25:15,665 --> 00:25:17,586
Isn't it th-that thing?

389
00:25:18,505 --> 00:25:19,265
Looks familiar.

390
00:25:19,265 --> 00:25:19,906
Don't touch it.

391
00:25:20,066 --> 00:25:21,168
These are hexagonal bells.

392
00:25:23,185 --> 00:25:24,346
I know.

393
00:25:25,386 --> 00:25:27,505
Aren't these in the skull
of the Green-Eyed Fox Corpse

394
00:25:27,505 --> 00:25:28,745
in the King of Lu's kiln?

395
00:25:29,505 --> 00:25:30,505
Why are they here?

396
00:25:30,505 --> 00:25:31,346
And so many of them.

397
00:25:33,505 --> 00:25:34,346
Hey, girl.

398
00:25:34,346 --> 00:25:35,985
Did you touch these earlier

399
00:25:35,985 --> 00:25:37,106
and became like this?

400
00:25:38,425 --> 00:25:39,106
It's not right.

401
00:25:40,985 --> 00:25:42,306
Could Wang Zanghai take them

402
00:25:42,465 --> 00:25:43,505
from King Shang of Lu?

403
00:25:44,705 --> 00:25:45,906
What kind of person

404
00:25:45,906 --> 00:25:47,306
was Wang Zanghai?

405
00:25:48,745 --> 00:25:50,512
He served
in the Imperial Astronomy Bureau.

406
00:25:50,665 --> 00:25:51,786
Except for fengshui,

407
00:25:52,346 --> 00:25:54,386
he was also in charge
of building the imperial tomb.

408
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,346
He was best at catching tomb raiders.

409
00:25:56,826 --> 00:25:57,866
Isn't Wang Zanghai

410
00:25:57,866 --> 00:25:59,786
the owner of this shipwreck?

411
00:26:00,786 --> 00:26:02,586
Maybe during an official mission,

412
00:26:02,665 --> 00:26:03,984
he visited the King of Lu's kiln.

413
00:26:05,306 --> 00:26:06,225
Third Uncle?

414
00:26:06,225 --> 00:26:07,786
And replicated this here?

415
00:26:21,826 --> 00:26:22,665
Wu Xie!

416
00:26:29,185 --> 00:26:30,505
Oh, no!

417
00:26:30,626 --> 00:26:31,306
Xiaoge,

418
00:26:31,306 --> 00:26:31,945
Wu Xie.

419
00:26:31,945 --> 00:26:32,465
No time.

420
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:32,866
Run!

421
00:26:32,866 --> 00:26:33,386
Run!

422
00:26:33,386 --> 00:26:33,985
Hurry!

423
00:26:49,505 --> 00:26:50,106
Wu.

424
00:26:50,705 --> 00:26:51,546
Wu Xie.

425
00:26:55,185 --> 00:26:55,945
Something's wrong.

426
00:26:56,346 --> 00:26:57,185
Something's wrong.

427
00:26:58,985 --> 00:26:59,665
Something's off.

428
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:01,146
Absolutely not right.

429
00:27:02,346 --> 00:27:02,945
Wu.

430
00:27:06,146 --> 00:27:06,906
What's wrong?

431
00:27:07,106 --> 00:27:08,306
What's happening to me?

432
00:27:09,265 --> 00:27:10,465
Why am I panting so hard

433
00:27:10,745 --> 00:27:11,945
just carrying her?

434
00:27:12,106 --> 00:27:13,465
Am I falling for her?

435
00:27:15,866 --> 00:27:17,346
My heart's racing way too fast.

436
00:27:17,465 --> 00:27:18,465
Stop your moaning.

437
00:27:18,465 --> 00:27:19,866
Your moaning's making me pant.

438
00:27:19,866 --> 00:27:20,866
I'm not lying.

439
00:27:20,866 --> 00:27:22,346
We're running out of oxygen.

440
00:27:22,906 --> 00:27:23,705
What?

441
00:27:24,546 --> 00:27:25,745
No oxygen left?

442
00:27:28,505 --> 00:27:29,306
Ning.

443
00:27:29,306 --> 00:27:31,265
Ning's bag has the oxygen gauge.

444
00:27:32,185 --> 00:27:33,066
Let me check.

445
00:27:37,546 --> 00:27:38,346
How is it?

446
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:40,705
How is it?

447
00:27:41,306 --> 00:27:42,225
Twenty minutes.

448
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:42,866
What?

449
00:27:43,386 --> 00:27:44,745
Only twenty minutes left.

450
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:47,465
Quick! Quick!

451
00:27:54,826 --> 00:27:56,425
Wu, find tools.

452
00:27:56,626 --> 00:27:57,066
Hurry!

453
00:27:57,906 --> 00:27:58,665
Wu.

454
00:27:59,626 --> 00:28:00,425
Find tools.

455
00:28:01,225 --> 00:28:02,146
Go find tools.

456
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:03,185
Didn't you say so?

457
00:28:03,626 --> 00:28:04,306
Find tools.

458
00:28:04,306 --> 00:28:04,906
We...

459
00:28:05,265 --> 00:28:06,185
We need to dig quickly.

460
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:07,146
Right. Find tools.

461
00:28:07,146 --> 00:28:07,826
Find tools.

462
00:28:09,066 --> 00:28:10,306
I will lead the charge.

463
00:28:11,025 --> 00:28:12,346
Hurry.

464
00:28:12,906 --> 00:28:13,705
Wu,

465
00:28:14,106 --> 00:28:14,906
hurry up!

466
00:28:15,586 --> 00:28:16,386
Oh, no.

467
00:28:16,705 --> 00:28:17,465
I would never...

468
00:28:18,025 --> 00:28:18,465
Oh, no.

469
00:28:18,465 --> 00:28:19,386
Die in this place.

470
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:21,346
I don't believe it.

471
00:28:33,225 --> 00:28:34,025
Pangzi!

472
00:28:34,185 --> 00:28:34,906
What's wrong?

473
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:36,586
Come look at this.

474
00:28:39,265 --> 00:28:40,066
What's wrong?

475
00:28:42,665 --> 00:28:43,465
What does this mean?

476
00:28:47,866 --> 00:28:49,066
This spot here

477
00:28:49,586 --> 00:28:51,225
was sealed with molten iron.

478
00:28:52,185 --> 00:28:54,025
Though the ceiling is the thinnest part,

479
00:28:54,745 --> 00:28:57,306
breaking through
would take over ten hours.

480
00:28:58,546 --> 00:28:59,465
We can't get out.

481
00:29:17,546 --> 00:29:18,465
All our calculations

482
00:29:19,786 --> 00:29:20,705
are useless.

483
00:29:22,866 --> 00:29:23,985
Another five minutes wasted.

484
00:29:25,786 --> 00:29:26,546
Enough of it.

485
00:29:27,025 --> 00:29:27,465
Let's go.

486
00:29:28,386 --> 00:29:29,346
Head back.

487
00:29:29,745 --> 00:29:31,346
Retrace our steps.

488
00:29:32,465 --> 00:29:33,265
Same way out.

489
00:29:40,665 --> 00:29:41,465
Fine.

490
00:29:42,665 --> 00:29:44,306
This time, I'm truly done for.

491
00:29:46,146 --> 00:29:47,465
Completely doomed.

492
00:29:50,386 --> 00:29:51,786
If only we had explosives.

493
00:29:52,146 --> 00:29:52,985
What?

494
00:29:53,185 --> 00:29:55,106
Explosives would solve everything.

495
00:29:56,745 --> 00:29:57,505
Explosives?

496
00:30:01,306 --> 00:30:02,465
Do you want roast duck?

497
00:30:14,945 --> 00:30:16,306
I know where to find some.

498
00:30:24,745 --> 00:30:25,665
What?

499
00:30:25,665 --> 00:30:27,386
Are there explosives in his stomach?

500
00:30:28,505 --> 00:30:29,705
If that's the case,

501
00:30:30,786 --> 00:30:32,265
it must have been sealed.

502
00:30:34,106 --> 00:30:35,665
Isolated from air and moisture.

503
00:30:47,985 --> 00:30:49,066
It's a Treasure Rotor.

504
00:31:22,705 --> 00:31:23,626
Are you sure?

505
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:25,225
Ready?

506
00:31:26,025 --> 00:31:28,306
Don't worry. I studied architecture.

507
00:31:29,665 --> 00:31:31,306
I can find the optimal blast point.

508
00:31:31,866 --> 00:31:32,626
It won't let

509
00:31:32,626 --> 00:31:33,586
the dome collapse.

510
00:31:34,546 --> 00:31:35,185
Okay.

511
00:31:35,705 --> 00:31:36,586
Be careful.

512
00:31:37,386 --> 00:31:38,225
Stay alert.

513
00:31:39,146 --> 00:31:40,866
Any minor impact
could trigger an explosion.

514
00:31:41,906 --> 00:31:42,826
I'll watch your back.

515
00:31:44,465 --> 00:31:45,225
Don't worry.

516
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:48,906
You can make it.

517
00:32:21,386 --> 00:32:24,265
Let's go Wu Xie. Let's go.

518
00:32:42,465 --> 00:32:44,386
Wu, why did you freeze?

519
00:32:44,786 --> 00:32:45,665
Hurry up.

520
00:32:45,665 --> 00:32:46,906
I'm running out of breath.

521
00:32:47,225 --> 00:32:48,106
I can't do this.

522
00:33:40,665 --> 00:33:41,505
Great.

523
00:33:41,665 --> 00:33:42,465
My turn.

524
00:33:47,745 --> 00:33:48,586
Secure it properly.

525
00:33:49,025 --> 00:33:49,626
Okay.

526
00:33:49,626 --> 00:33:50,505
Start kicking.

527
00:33:51,505 --> 00:33:52,106
Okay.

528
00:33:52,586 --> 00:33:53,866
I'm coming!

529
00:34:15,266 --> 00:34:16,386
Oh, my.

530
00:34:18,025 --> 00:34:19,145
Wu.

531
00:34:20,746 --> 00:34:22,505
I think I'm hallucinating.

532
00:34:23,425 --> 00:34:24,625
I thought I saw...

533
00:34:26,706 --> 00:34:27,786
I saw this thing...

534
00:34:29,945 --> 00:34:31,386
It grew a tail.

535
00:34:31,906 --> 00:34:32,826
Hallucinations?

536
00:34:33,465 --> 00:34:35,065
Then I'm hallucinating too.

537
00:34:35,826 --> 00:34:38,585
I even felt this thing

538
00:34:38,585 --> 00:34:39,226
blowing air.

539
00:34:39,226 --> 00:34:41,706
What? What's happening?

540
00:34:42,065 --> 00:34:43,545
But yours wasn't a hallucination.

541
00:34:44,465 --> 00:34:46,065
It should be an actual tail.

542
00:34:46,906 --> 00:34:48,425
You didn't hear what Xiaoge just said.

543
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:50,666
This isn't actually Wang Zanghai.

544
00:34:51,706 --> 00:34:52,465
Then who is it?

545
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,465
It's Wang Zanghai's

546
00:34:53,465 --> 00:34:55,425
animal-skin replica.

547
00:34:56,866 --> 00:34:57,545
Another monster.

548
00:34:57,545 --> 00:34:59,025
The tail behind it...

549
00:34:59,226 --> 00:35:01,786
It should be a monkey's.

550
00:35:01,945 --> 00:35:02,786
Forget it.

551
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,025
We don't have time

552
00:35:04,025 --> 00:35:05,386
to discuss what it really is.

553
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:07,386
As long as the explosives aren't damp,

554
00:35:07,465 --> 00:35:09,226
they'll blow it to pieces.

555
00:35:09,786 --> 00:35:11,105
Thank you.

556
00:35:11,306 --> 00:35:14,145
You'll need to be a human detonator.

557
00:35:16,826 --> 00:35:17,786
What are you doing?

558
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:19,985
Stop messing around. Hurry up!

559
00:35:21,145 --> 00:35:21,906
Pangzi!

560
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:23,826
Pangzi, are you okay?

561
00:36:36,985 --> 00:36:39,226
What's happening now?

562
00:36:40,545 --> 00:36:41,505
Wu?

563
00:36:41,985 --> 00:36:43,226
Wu, are you alright?

564
00:36:45,065 --> 00:36:45,866
This isn't working.

565
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,226
We need to extract it.

566
00:36:48,346 --> 00:36:49,186
How?

567
00:36:49,545 --> 00:36:50,386
Use fishing line.

568
00:36:51,186 --> 00:36:52,306
I have a fishhook.

569
00:36:53,346 --> 00:36:54,666
Why would you carry that?

570
00:36:55,226 --> 00:36:56,025
Don't mind me.

571
00:37:01,746 --> 00:37:02,465
What you doing?

572
00:37:08,105 --> 00:37:08,786
Wu!

573
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:11,465
Quick! Untie the rope! Untie it!

574
00:37:13,786 --> 00:37:14,465
Hurry!

575
00:37:16,346 --> 00:37:17,105
Don't tremble!

576
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:18,465
Untie it now!

577
00:37:19,226 --> 00:37:20,065
Hurry!

578
00:37:20,866 --> 00:37:21,425
Wu Xie!

579
00:37:30,386 --> 00:37:31,826
Come on, the hook!

580
00:37:32,346 --> 00:37:32,945
The hook!

581
00:37:37,025 --> 00:37:38,545
That sneaky girl, Ning!

582
00:37:41,186 --> 00:37:42,666
I knew she was faking.

583
00:37:42,786 --> 00:37:43,746
Take this.

584
00:37:44,505 --> 00:37:45,306
What are you doing?

585
00:37:49,826 --> 00:37:51,065
I'm seeing stars.

586
00:37:51,065 --> 00:37:52,545
What good is chasing her?

587
00:37:52,945 --> 00:37:54,186
She has oxygen tanks!

588
00:37:55,386 --> 00:37:56,585
She stole my stuff!

589
00:37:57,906 --> 00:37:59,306
There's no time left!

590
00:38:00,706 --> 00:38:02,346
She took my grandfather's notebook!

591
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,545
Who cares what she took?

592
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:07,025
Do you value your life?

593
00:38:16,826 --> 00:38:17,585
Wu!

594
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:20,105
Only five minutes left!

595
00:38:23,746 --> 00:38:24,545
Sir.

596
00:38:24,786 --> 00:38:25,746
Sorry, sir.

597
00:38:31,346 --> 00:38:32,145
Wu.

598
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:34,465
Wu!

599
00:38:35,266 --> 00:38:36,065
Wu!

600
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:46,746
Focus.

601
00:38:47,186 --> 00:38:48,145
Don't get distracted.

602
00:38:48,306 --> 00:38:49,266
Focus. Focus!

603
00:38:49,386 --> 00:38:49,985
Be gentle.

604
00:38:51,306 --> 00:38:52,866
No. My hands are shaking. You do it.

605
00:38:57,746 --> 00:38:58,545
Hurry up.

606
00:38:58,545 --> 00:38:59,505
Stop rushing me.

607
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:00,826
We're running out of time.

608
00:39:05,105 --> 00:39:06,826
How is it? Did the hook catch?

609
00:39:07,706 --> 00:39:08,105
Harder!

610
00:39:08,105 --> 00:39:08,906
It's hooked.

611
00:39:09,186 --> 00:39:09,945
Harder!

612
00:39:14,746 --> 00:39:15,666
How is it?

613
00:39:15,666 --> 00:39:17,065
Wait! It's stuck.

614
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:21,505
Pull!

615
00:39:54,786 --> 00:39:55,826
Wu Xie!

616
00:39:56,346 --> 00:39:57,226
Xiaoge!

617
00:41:21,386 --> 00:41:22,786
Xiaoge!

618
00:42:14,186 --> 00:42:14,985
Are you all right?

619
00:42:15,746 --> 00:42:16,545
I'm fine.

620
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:22,186
This...

621
00:42:22,985 --> 00:42:25,866
This isn't working properly.

622
00:42:27,505 --> 00:42:28,585
What do we do now?

623
00:42:29,105 --> 00:42:30,160
The explosion didn't work.

624
00:42:32,746 --> 00:42:35,346
Xiaoge, can you get another one?

625
00:42:43,906 --> 00:42:44,985
This is interesting.

626
00:42:45,585 --> 00:42:46,706
We're almost succeeding.

627
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:14,666
What's happening?

628
00:43:14,945 --> 00:43:16,386
This is unbelievable.

629
00:43:27,065 --> 00:43:28,186
What now?

630
00:43:28,545 --> 00:43:29,906
This isn't going as planned.

631
00:43:29,906 --> 00:43:31,425
The fish will be here soon.
