3
00:02:12,195 --> 00:02:13,116
Pangzi?

4
00:02:14,755 --> 00:02:15,635
Pangzi?

5
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:20,076
Where am I?

6
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,635
Paradise or netherworld?

7
00:02:26,595 --> 00:02:28,195
Wu, something's off.

8
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,956
These arrows feel strange.

9
00:02:32,836 --> 00:02:34,315
It doesn't hurt much.

10
00:02:34,956 --> 00:02:36,996
But why can't I move?

11
00:02:38,035 --> 00:02:39,516
Pull out a couple for me.

12
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,475
Let me check the feeling.

13
00:03:01,635 --> 00:03:02,396
Go ahead.

14
00:03:02,635 --> 00:03:03,396
It's fine.

15
00:03:23,116 --> 00:03:23,875
It's you.

16
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,475
You're still alive?

17
00:03:37,556 --> 00:03:38,796
You look familiar.

18
00:03:39,396 --> 00:03:40,676
Xiaoge?

19
00:03:44,315 --> 00:03:45,755
Impressive, Xiaoge.

20
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,715
Your acting was top-notch.

21
00:03:50,836 --> 00:03:51,595
(Third Uncle,)

22
00:03:51,715 --> 00:03:53,236
(this person looks like Xiaoge.)

23
00:03:57,396 --> 00:03:59,236
This can't be the same person, right?

24
00:04:07,236 --> 00:04:08,195
Have you

25
00:04:08,836 --> 00:04:10,836
been here before?

26
00:04:13,715 --> 00:04:14,796
Who are you?

27
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,595
Why did you...

28
00:04:15,595 --> 00:04:17,676
That woman deliberately stepped earlier.

29
00:04:18,755 --> 00:04:20,716
Seems she's not only
confident in herself,

30
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:23,195
but also wants to eliminate all of us.

31
00:04:24,315 --> 00:04:25,596
Do you think

32
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:27,435
it counts as fraud?

33
00:04:31,635 --> 00:04:32,476
Are you okay?

34
00:04:35,635 --> 00:04:37,236
You look pale.

35
00:04:43,676 --> 00:04:45,395
People like us

36
00:04:45,996 --> 00:04:47,596
get fooled often.

37
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,556
You'll get used to it.

38
00:04:49,835 --> 00:04:50,676
Well,

39
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:52,236
I was thinking,

40
00:04:53,635 --> 00:04:54,996
if she was just using us

41
00:04:54,996 --> 00:04:56,156
to get into this shipwreck,

42
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,875
is my third uncle's situation even real?

43
00:04:59,356 --> 00:05:00,315
Did my third uncle

44
00:05:00,476 --> 00:05:01,635
come down here or not?

45
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,556
Or has he already died here?

46
00:05:03,556 --> 00:05:04,195
I...

47
00:05:05,356 --> 00:05:06,195
Here's the thing.

48
00:05:07,075 --> 00:05:09,716
Did you see any traces
of your third uncle earlier?

49
00:05:12,116 --> 00:05:13,075
I can't be sure.

50
00:05:14,036 --> 00:05:15,476
Everything happened too quickly.

51
00:05:15,635 --> 00:05:17,476
Can you confirm he's alive?

52
00:05:18,996 --> 00:05:20,156
He should be.

53
00:05:20,476 --> 00:05:22,275
Can you pay the remaining fee then?

54
00:05:25,315 --> 00:05:26,395
Just kidding.

55
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,955
Do I look like someone
who'd abandon friends?

56
00:05:29,556 --> 00:05:30,996
Listen to me.

57
00:05:31,716 --> 00:05:32,996
The current situation

58
00:05:32,996 --> 00:05:34,116
is complicated.

59
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:35,116
Right?

60
00:05:35,596 --> 00:05:37,556
Finding your third uncle is crucial,

61
00:05:37,556 --> 00:05:39,315
but let's stay alive first.

62
00:05:41,116 --> 00:05:41,996
So,

63
00:05:42,596 --> 00:05:44,635
stick with us later.

64
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,755
If you spot any traces
of your third uncle,

65
00:05:46,755 --> 00:05:47,676
just speak up.

66
00:05:48,395 --> 00:05:50,435
We'll decide then.

67
00:05:52,356 --> 00:05:53,156
Okay?

68
00:05:58,635 --> 00:05:59,476
Okay.

69
00:05:59,476 --> 00:06:00,315
Perfect.

70
00:06:00,596 --> 00:06:01,195
I get it now.

71
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,476
So the most important thing now

72
00:06:04,195 --> 00:06:07,395
is whether you can help me
pull out these thorns first.

73
00:06:07,556 --> 00:06:09,635
I'm completely numbed by them.

74
00:06:10,476 --> 00:06:11,236
Come on.

75
00:06:11,435 --> 00:06:13,075
Start with this one.

76
00:06:14,515 --> 00:06:16,195
I haven't finished yet.

77
00:06:17,515 --> 00:06:19,796
Will rapid pulling leave scars?

78
00:06:28,036 --> 00:06:30,476
But why use such arrowheads?

79
00:06:31,716 --> 00:06:32,916
What are these?

80
00:06:34,156 --> 00:06:35,116
Lotus arrows.

81
00:06:36,036 --> 00:06:37,395
How do you know?

82
00:06:41,195 --> 00:06:42,955
I don't know their purpose.

83
00:06:43,395 --> 00:06:44,275
But seeing you shot,

84
00:06:44,275 --> 00:06:45,755
I recognized them as lotus arrows.

85
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,556
I can't think of an explanation.

86
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:51,236
Maybe the shipwreck's owner

87
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,116
wanted to spare us,

88
00:06:53,275 --> 00:06:54,476
making us retreat from danger.

89
00:06:55,356 --> 00:06:56,796
Does this make sense?

90
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,596
No time for speculation now.

91
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:01,875
I've been thinking.

92
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,275
If Ning is using me,

93
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:04,875
she must have other motives.

94
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,195
I saw her go through this door.

95
00:07:07,195 --> 00:07:08,116
We should go

96
00:07:08,116 --> 00:07:09,036
and capture her

97
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,236
to ask about my third uncle's situation.

98
00:07:12,156 --> 00:07:13,676
The thing in the ballast stone earlier

99
00:07:13,835 --> 00:07:15,435
told us to enter the left room first.

100
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,716
There must be a reason.

101
00:07:16,955 --> 00:07:18,356
Let's follow the procedure.

102
00:07:18,356 --> 00:07:19,356
Stay put.

103
00:07:19,796 --> 00:07:20,716
Don't wander around.

104
00:07:20,716 --> 00:07:21,356
Well,

105
00:07:21,755 --> 00:07:23,236
if we don't grab her now,

106
00:07:23,356 --> 00:07:24,356
once she gets out,

107
00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:25,835
we won't know where to find her.

108
00:07:25,835 --> 00:07:27,036
Alright.

109
00:07:27,515 --> 00:07:28,556
Stop arguing.

110
00:07:28,755 --> 00:07:30,036
Listen to me.

111
00:07:30,036 --> 00:07:31,796
Let's return to the previous room

112
00:07:32,556 --> 00:07:33,755
and hide

113
00:07:33,755 --> 00:07:35,036
all the air tanks.

114
00:07:35,596 --> 00:07:38,036
Without them, that girl can't possibly

115
00:07:38,036 --> 00:07:39,596
swim all the way back to the ship.

116
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:43,875
Enough talk.

117
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:46,996
Help me.

118
00:07:49,676 --> 00:07:50,796
Remove these arrows first.

119
00:07:56,195 --> 00:07:57,476
When I catch that girl,

120
00:07:57,476 --> 00:07:59,275
I'll turn her into a pincushion.

121
00:08:06,835 --> 00:08:07,676
Where's our gear?

122
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:13,996
Where are the air tanks?

123
00:08:14,635 --> 00:08:15,916
The air tanks are gone.

124
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,596
But I definitely moved them here myself.

125
00:08:29,996 --> 00:08:31,635
Without the diving equipment,

126
00:08:33,035 --> 00:08:34,836
we'll be trapped here forever.

127
00:08:34,836 --> 00:08:35,875
Does it mean

128
00:08:37,035 --> 00:08:38,196
there's someone else

129
00:08:38,836 --> 00:08:39,716
in here?

130
00:08:41,836 --> 00:08:42,875
Or something

131
00:08:44,076 --> 00:08:45,076
not human?

132
00:08:45,515 --> 00:08:46,275
Search the area.

133
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,076
Okay.

134
00:08:51,996 --> 00:08:53,275
Where did everything go?

135
00:09:06,076 --> 00:09:07,476
Did we enter the wrong room?

136
00:09:08,196 --> 00:09:09,395
Let's check outside.

137
00:09:09,596 --> 00:09:10,395
Let's go.

138
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,515
Told you we came the right way.

139
00:09:28,316 --> 00:09:29,596
Let me retrace.

140
00:09:29,956 --> 00:09:31,596
We emerged from that pool,

141
00:09:31,596 --> 00:09:32,755
got shot by arrows,

142
00:09:32,755 --> 00:09:33,675
and retreated back.

143
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,915
That's right. There was only one path.

144
00:09:38,515 --> 00:09:39,436
I see!

145
00:09:40,476 --> 00:09:41,316
That scheming girl

146
00:09:41,316 --> 00:09:43,716
must have dumped our equipment
into the pool!

147
00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:03,275
Wait, Pangzi.

148
00:10:04,675 --> 00:10:05,795
Something's wrong here.

149
00:10:16,956 --> 00:10:17,956
Xiaoge,

150
00:10:18,555 --> 00:10:19,915
you noticed earlier, didn't you?

151
00:10:20,356 --> 00:10:22,196
There wasn't this pillar here before.

152
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:24,515
I found the room changed
since we entered.

153
00:10:24,675 --> 00:10:26,236
You weren't paying attention.

154
00:10:26,596 --> 00:10:27,875
This jar wasn't here either.

155
00:10:28,316 --> 00:10:29,956
The ballast stones' layout is changed.

156
00:10:30,555 --> 00:10:31,915
It's as if we're in another room.

157
00:10:32,395 --> 00:10:33,116
And

158
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:35,076
look up.

159
00:10:40,116 --> 00:10:41,155
What the heck?

160
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:46,196
This isn't just

161
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,915
one intruder anymore.

162
00:10:49,476 --> 00:10:52,515
A whole renovation crew came here.

163
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,116
We don't seem

164
00:10:56,116 --> 00:10:58,076
to be in the same place anymore.

165
00:11:00,395 --> 00:11:01,875
This is a new space.

166
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,155
An entirely different location.

167
00:11:05,996 --> 00:11:07,316
What are you doing?

168
00:11:07,316 --> 00:11:08,875
Say something.

169
00:11:09,116 --> 00:11:11,275
Why are you just standing there
spacing out?

170
00:11:12,076 --> 00:11:14,035
If we can't find our gear,

171
00:11:14,035 --> 00:11:15,395
we're stuck here.

172
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:16,675
Think of a solution.

173
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:17,196
Hold on.

174
00:11:17,196 --> 00:11:18,196
We're trapped.

175
00:11:18,196 --> 00:11:19,275
Give me a minute.

176
00:11:20,755 --> 00:11:22,356
My third uncle came here back then.

177
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,795
Let me try to remember.

178
00:11:23,795 --> 00:11:25,116
Your third uncle was here?

179
00:11:25,116 --> 00:11:25,875
Why didn't you

180
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,155
mention this sooner?

181
00:11:27,675 --> 00:11:29,196
What did he say about this place?

182
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:30,476
Like...

183
00:11:30,476 --> 00:11:32,476
Can you shut up for two seconds?

184
00:11:33,356 --> 00:11:34,795
Let me concentrate.

185
00:11:37,275 --> 00:11:37,956
Fine.

186
00:11:38,996 --> 00:11:40,155
Okay, got it.

187
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:54,236
Let's all calm down.

188
00:12:01,116 --> 00:12:02,915
How can we stay calm?

189
00:12:02,915 --> 00:12:04,196
Our lives are at stake.

190
00:12:04,196 --> 00:12:05,915
Of course we're anxious.

191
00:12:06,076 --> 00:12:07,675
You understood everything earlier.

192
00:12:07,675 --> 00:12:08,596
The ballast stones,

193
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:10,196
the murals, and everything.

194
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,356
Why are you clueless now?

195
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,555
Alright, truth time.

196
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:14,915
I know nothing about here.

197
00:12:14,915 --> 00:12:16,116
Nothing.

198
00:12:16,675 --> 00:12:17,716
What I told you

199
00:12:17,716 --> 00:12:19,196
about the murals and oxygen supplies

200
00:12:19,476 --> 00:12:21,116
all came from my third uncle's stories.

201
00:12:21,476 --> 00:12:23,275
My third uncle came here 20 years ago

202
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:24,316
and faced

203
00:12:24,316 --> 00:12:25,555
what we face now.

204
00:13:35,076 --> 00:13:35,875
Third Uncle.

205
00:13:41,091 --> 00:13:42,832
Hello? Hello?

206
00:13:45,236 --> 00:13:46,316
They failed.

207
00:13:47,555 --> 00:13:50,515
No. He has already found it.

208
00:13:51,275 --> 00:13:52,515
What's next?

209
00:13:52,716 --> 00:13:55,675
Just wait. He will come to be with us.

210
00:13:56,196 --> 00:13:58,356
What exactly will you do
in that shipwreck?

211
00:13:58,996 --> 00:14:00,196
I'm not sure yet.

212
00:14:00,836 --> 00:14:02,716
I'll know when I get there.

213
00:14:04,275 --> 00:14:06,275
But you demanded huge funding.

214
00:14:06,275 --> 00:14:07,755
If you don't tell me why,

215
00:14:08,356 --> 00:14:09,996
I can't explain this to my boss.

216
00:14:13,076 --> 00:14:15,555
Compared to what you want,

217
00:14:15,716 --> 00:14:18,076
this sum should be insignificant.

218
00:14:21,956 --> 00:14:24,716
We need all the documents on that ship.

219
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,196
No problem.

220
00:14:28,436 --> 00:14:30,275
I'm after something else.

221
00:14:32,035 --> 00:14:33,236
This mission's dangerous.

222
00:14:33,395 --> 00:14:35,155
I'll send two men with you. Okay?

223
00:14:37,755 --> 00:14:38,915
No problem.

224
00:14:38,915 --> 00:14:40,555
You're the boss. It's your call.

225
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,716
His nephew is on our boat.

226
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:50,356
He will take us to the right place.

227
00:14:54,515 --> 00:14:55,476
Don't worry.

228
00:14:56,436 --> 00:15:00,116
The two guys
who went with Wu Sanxing before

229
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:02,515
have left marks.

230
00:15:03,196 --> 00:15:04,716
As soon as we get there,

231
00:15:05,356 --> 00:15:06,635
I'll know

232
00:15:06,915 --> 00:15:08,875
what he has done.

233
00:17:35,876 --> 00:17:37,396
Alright, sit down.

234
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,555
Sit down and relax.

235
00:17:40,676 --> 00:17:42,315
Why push yourself so hard?

236
00:17:43,636 --> 00:17:45,196
Taking such dangerous jobs?

237
00:17:45,196 --> 00:17:46,196
Money's hard to come by.

238
00:17:47,355 --> 00:17:48,315
True enough.

239
00:17:49,355 --> 00:17:50,676
Money's hard to come by.

240
00:17:51,795 --> 00:17:53,355
What's your boss like?

241
00:17:53,755 --> 00:17:54,996
What business is your boss in?

242
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,716
We never ask about our boss's affairs.

243
00:17:57,636 --> 00:18:00,196
I'm not interested in your boss.

244
00:18:01,236 --> 00:18:02,755
Your boss's neighbor is a foreigner.

245
00:18:02,755 --> 00:18:03,636
Remember?

246
00:18:04,075 --> 00:18:04,996
That foreigner

247
00:18:06,075 --> 00:18:07,595
is a geologist.

248
00:18:09,035 --> 00:18:09,835
There we go.

249
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:11,436
Move it. Move it.

250
00:18:11,876 --> 00:18:12,676
Okay?

251
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:14,436
Should work.

252
00:18:14,436 --> 00:18:15,595
Take it slow.

253
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:16,355
Okay.

254
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:18,595
I'm in geological exploration too.

255
00:18:18,595 --> 00:18:20,835
I've read that foreigner's paper.

256
00:18:20,835 --> 00:18:21,636
He wrote

257
00:18:22,115 --> 00:18:23,515
that if a meteorite

258
00:18:24,196 --> 00:18:26,156
strikes Earth's

259
00:18:26,515 --> 00:18:28,876
soft sedimentary plains,

260
00:18:29,035 --> 00:18:32,515
it forms annular water systems.

261
00:18:32,956 --> 00:18:34,416
That hollow structure...

262
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:35,248
You...

263
00:18:35,696 --> 00:18:37,008
Have you seen such a place?

264
00:18:37,008 --> 00:18:38,196
I've been there.

265
00:18:39,835 --> 00:18:42,115
There's an enormous tree inside.

266
00:18:43,515 --> 00:18:44,795
How to describe it?

267
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,956
It's unimaginably huge.

268
00:18:48,035 --> 00:18:49,716
Could it be due to radiation

269
00:18:49,716 --> 00:18:51,196
causing this transgenic mutation?

270
00:19:00,156 --> 00:19:01,075
Third Master,

271
00:19:01,275 --> 00:19:02,436
what's that noise?

272
00:19:03,755 --> 00:19:05,716
This ship sank centuries ago.

273
00:19:06,755 --> 00:19:08,275
How could there be other people here?

274
00:19:08,275 --> 00:19:09,636
Enough nonsense.

275
00:19:13,476 --> 00:19:14,275
Stay calm.

276
00:19:14,996 --> 00:19:15,835
You watch him.

277
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:16,755
I'll check it out.

278
00:19:31,315 --> 00:19:32,515
Why'd you follow me in?

279
00:19:32,676 --> 00:19:33,795
Take a break.

280
00:19:33,795 --> 00:19:35,716
We need to learn more from you.

281
00:20:05,515 --> 00:20:06,315
What are you doing?

282
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:07,755
Don't move.

283
00:20:08,555 --> 00:20:09,355
Stay calm.

284
00:20:09,956 --> 00:20:10,755
Stay calm.

285
00:20:11,236 --> 00:20:12,075
Calm down.

286
00:20:12,595 --> 00:20:13,876
You can stop following us.

287
00:20:15,355 --> 00:20:16,636
Wait here for our return.

288
00:20:16,636 --> 00:20:17,476
Did you hear me?

289
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,115
Did you hear me?

290
00:20:21,795 --> 00:20:22,876
Yes, Third Master.

291
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,436
When my third uncle woke up,

292
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:46,476
he discovered

293
00:21:47,196 --> 00:21:48,555
the place where he fell asleep

294
00:21:48,555 --> 00:21:50,075
and where he awoke

295
00:21:50,355 --> 00:21:51,515
were different locations.

296
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,835
Not bad, kid.

297
00:21:56,476 --> 00:21:58,436
You know quite a lot.

298
00:22:00,716 --> 00:22:01,676
Be more confident.

299
00:22:04,476 --> 00:22:06,315
What did your third uncle say
before leaving?

300
00:22:06,515 --> 00:22:07,515
Repeat it.

301
00:22:11,115 --> 00:22:12,236
He said...

302
00:22:14,156 --> 00:22:15,035
The elevator.

303
00:22:17,876 --> 00:22:19,315
That elevator had issues.

304
00:22:20,196 --> 00:22:21,075
The elevator.

305
00:22:21,436 --> 00:22:22,236
The elevator?

306
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:23,644
Yes.

307
00:22:57,315 --> 00:22:58,636
This is indeed a mechanism.

308
00:22:59,156 --> 00:23:01,156
And a remarkably simple one.

309
00:23:02,555 --> 00:23:03,636
Let me give an example.

310
00:23:03,795 --> 00:23:05,035
You'll understand instantly.

311
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:07,196
Imagine we're on the same floor.

312
00:23:07,996 --> 00:23:09,716
If I exit from the second floor

313
00:23:10,636 --> 00:23:12,515
and add another floor
below the first floor.

314
00:23:12,876 --> 00:23:14,275
When we return,

315
00:23:14,275 --> 00:23:15,676
the second floor becomes the third,

316
00:23:15,835 --> 00:23:17,315
and the first becomes the second.

317
00:23:17,315 --> 00:23:19,436
Stop with this floor-number shuffle

318
00:23:19,595 --> 00:23:20,555
and all the floors.

319
00:23:21,396 --> 00:23:22,835
Speak normally, would you?

320
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:23,916
I get it now.

321
00:23:25,355 --> 00:23:26,156
That...

322
00:23:26,755 --> 00:23:27,716
That corridor.

323
00:23:27,835 --> 00:23:29,636
The corridor is actually an elevator.

324
00:23:29,956 --> 00:23:31,196
Every time its door opens,

325
00:23:32,115 --> 00:23:33,595
it reveals a different floor.

326
00:23:33,795 --> 00:23:35,075
The rooms didn't vanish.

327
00:23:35,835 --> 00:23:37,515
They just moved elsewhere.

328
00:23:42,956 --> 00:23:44,236
So that's how it works.

329
00:23:45,196 --> 00:23:47,396
See how clear his explanation is?

330
00:23:51,476 --> 00:23:52,595
Any other questions?

331
00:23:53,236 --> 00:23:54,795
Your third uncle's account

332
00:23:54,996 --> 00:23:56,795
contradicts our experience completely.

333
00:23:57,196 --> 00:23:58,515
Haven't you noticed?

334
00:23:59,236 --> 00:24:00,716
He said he was lying in this room

335
00:24:00,956 --> 00:24:02,196
and never used the corridor.

336
00:24:02,755 --> 00:24:04,355
No matter how the floors shifted,

337
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,595
he should've stayed in the same room,

338
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:08,515
and nothing should've changed.

339
00:24:17,436 --> 00:24:18,835
You're saying

340
00:24:19,355 --> 00:24:21,755
my third uncle lied to me?

341
00:24:27,755 --> 00:24:29,115
Cheer up, Wu.

342
00:24:30,236 --> 00:24:31,315
Your third uncle lying

343
00:24:31,315 --> 00:24:33,275
is absolutely normal.

344
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:36,355
He's a grown man.

345
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:38,555
Would he admit

346
00:24:38,795 --> 00:24:41,755
he abandoned his girlfriend out of fear?

347
00:24:43,075 --> 00:24:43,795
Right?

348
00:24:44,515 --> 00:24:45,275
But he...

349
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,876
No 'buts'.

350
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:49,355
Ever been in love?

351
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:52,196
Have you felt that

352
00:24:52,476 --> 00:24:54,236
soul-crushing pain?

353
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,035
We're wasting oxygen here.

354
00:24:59,436 --> 00:25:00,075
Don't forget

355
00:25:00,075 --> 00:25:01,676
that girl mentioned earlier...

356
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,595
Carbon dioxide levels here
are dangerously high.

357
00:25:04,716 --> 00:25:06,275
At this concentration,

358
00:25:06,275 --> 00:25:07,515
within ten hours,

359
00:25:07,755 --> 00:25:09,156
we'll reach lethal thresholds.

360
00:25:09,236 --> 00:25:10,035
We've got

361
00:25:10,035 --> 00:25:11,916
only ten hours down here.

362
00:25:12,035 --> 00:25:13,676
If we keep chatting like this,

363
00:25:14,275 --> 00:25:16,835
we'll talk straight into our coffins.

364
00:25:17,835 --> 00:25:19,035
Well, I have

365
00:25:19,115 --> 00:25:20,876
three suggestions.

366
00:25:20,996 --> 00:25:23,676
First, find the missing room

367
00:25:24,196 --> 00:25:26,595
and retrieve our equipment.

368
00:25:27,035 --> 00:25:27,835
Second,

369
00:25:28,035 --> 00:25:29,396
catch that bratty girl.

370
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:31,396
She knows the mechanisms.

371
00:25:31,515 --> 00:25:33,755
She must know this shipwreck well.

372
00:25:34,355 --> 00:25:35,196
Third,

373
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,156
as Xiaoge suggested,

374
00:25:38,315 --> 00:25:39,595
chase that ballast stone.

375
00:25:40,035 --> 00:25:41,515
But I saw something

376
00:25:41,515 --> 00:25:43,156
emerge from it.

377
00:25:43,396 --> 00:25:45,196
It could be friend or foe.

378
00:25:46,835 --> 00:25:47,636
Choose.

379
00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:52,835
Though we understand

380
00:25:52,835 --> 00:25:55,515
the elevator mechanism
makes the rooms shift,

381
00:25:57,315 --> 00:25:59,315
we still don't fully understand

382
00:25:59,436 --> 00:26:00,755
its operation pattern.

383
00:26:02,315 --> 00:26:04,035
So our original room may not

384
00:26:04,315 --> 00:26:05,676
necessarily return.

385
00:26:05,676 --> 00:26:06,436
Makes sense.

386
00:26:06,436 --> 00:26:08,595
But Ning's location matches
the ballast stones.

387
00:26:09,396 --> 00:26:10,676
Should we investigate

388
00:26:11,275 --> 00:26:13,236
those two rooms first

389
00:26:13,515 --> 00:26:14,595
before deciding?

390
00:26:15,716 --> 00:26:16,636
Agreed.

391
00:26:17,515 --> 00:26:18,355
Let's go.

392
00:26:31,355 --> 00:26:32,876
Something's off.

393
00:27:15,755 --> 00:27:16,555
It's over.

394
00:27:20,835 --> 00:27:22,555
How did it become a dead end?

395
00:27:22,956 --> 00:27:23,876
Where's the door?

396
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:25,396
Speak of the devil.

397
00:27:29,196 --> 00:27:30,355
Now

398
00:27:30,795 --> 00:27:31,835
we're trapped.

399
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,035
Wu,

400
00:27:40,476 --> 00:27:41,956
prepare for

401
00:27:43,315 --> 00:27:45,916
all three options failing.

402
00:28:01,996 --> 00:28:03,196
To escape,

403
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:04,956
here are our options.

404
00:28:05,795 --> 00:28:07,956
First, retrace our path.

405
00:28:08,476 --> 00:28:09,876
But that's no longer possible.

406
00:28:10,196 --> 00:28:11,196
Our lung capacity

407
00:28:11,196 --> 00:28:12,555
can't possibly match a dolphin's.

408
00:28:13,035 --> 00:28:13,795
Second,

409
00:28:15,396 --> 00:28:17,996
let the ship naturally surface.

410
00:28:19,876 --> 00:28:21,075
You can try tossing

411
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:22,515
the ballast stones into the water.

412
00:28:22,795 --> 00:28:24,355
There are over two hundred rooms.

413
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:25,956
Try tossing them first.

414
00:28:27,716 --> 00:28:29,196
Why don't you toss them yourself?

415
00:28:30,236 --> 00:28:31,196
Who are you fooling?

416
00:28:31,196 --> 00:28:33,075
Who taught you such nonsense?

417
00:28:34,515 --> 00:28:35,315
And the third?

418
00:28:38,876 --> 00:28:40,075
The third

419
00:28:41,355 --> 00:28:43,035
and the dumbest approach is

420
00:28:45,035 --> 00:28:46,196
to dig our way out directly.

421
00:28:47,876 --> 00:28:48,956
This shipwreck

422
00:28:48,956 --> 00:28:50,916
was built with high ceilings

423
00:28:51,555 --> 00:28:53,315
to accommodate the elevator mechanism.

424
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:57,275
So we can't be too far from the surface.

425
00:28:57,876 --> 00:28:59,515
If we wait for low tide

426
00:29:00,035 --> 00:29:01,196
and dig straight through,

427
00:29:01,555 --> 00:29:02,595
we might get out.

428
00:29:03,396 --> 00:29:04,196
Alright, then.

429
00:29:05,515 --> 00:29:07,636
Stop waiting. Let's get to work.

430
00:29:08,396 --> 00:29:09,716
Not to discourage you,

431
00:29:10,595 --> 00:29:12,555
but digging when it's not low tide

432
00:29:13,436 --> 00:29:15,555
means tons of water
pouring in from above.

433
00:29:16,595 --> 00:29:18,035
We'd drown

434
00:29:18,396 --> 00:29:19,716
before escaping.

435
00:29:21,716 --> 00:29:24,355
So rash actions are out.

436
00:29:29,236 --> 00:29:30,035
Xiaoge,

437
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:32,636
any passage?

438
00:29:32,996 --> 00:29:34,515
Are we done for?

439
00:29:35,396 --> 00:29:37,115
I checked the mechanisms here.

440
00:29:37,115 --> 00:29:38,075
They're disabled.

441
00:29:38,636 --> 00:29:39,476
Come here.

442
00:29:58,835 --> 00:29:59,355
Well,

443
00:30:00,476 --> 00:30:01,595
the door's here now.

444
00:30:05,355 --> 00:30:06,396
Go in or not?

445
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:10,636
Our only choice is forward.

446
00:30:22,636 --> 00:30:23,436
Xiaoge,

447
00:30:23,876 --> 00:30:24,916
why the rush?

448
00:30:24,916 --> 00:30:25,956
Wait for us.

449
00:30:28,315 --> 00:30:29,115
Xiaoge?

450
00:30:31,156 --> 00:30:32,075
Don't use flashlights.

451
00:30:34,275 --> 00:30:35,595
Oh, no.

452
00:30:35,595 --> 00:30:36,835
Something's wrong. Very wrong.

453
00:30:37,755 --> 00:30:39,835
Coming here was a huge mistake.

454
00:30:40,196 --> 00:30:41,236
Don't move.

455
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:44,876
Xiaoge,

456
00:30:46,956 --> 00:30:48,156
I'll find a candle

457
00:30:48,156 --> 00:30:49,555
and light a corner. Okay?

458
00:30:52,275 --> 00:30:53,396
It's pitch black.

459
00:30:53,716 --> 00:30:54,996
We can't do anything properly.

460
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:56,636
I'll assist you.

461
00:30:57,595 --> 00:30:58,636
It'll be quick.

462
00:30:58,835 --> 00:30:59,956
I'm just lighting a candle.

463
00:31:01,035 --> 00:31:01,876
Let's go.

464
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:06,996
I think I mixed up the words earlier.

465
00:31:07,595 --> 00:31:09,795
It should be
'find a corner to light a candle'.

466
00:31:10,476 --> 00:31:12,515
No offense, spirits.

467
00:31:18,755 --> 00:31:19,876
Don't go out.

468
00:31:20,035 --> 00:31:20,996
Stay lit.

469
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:22,916
Don't go out.

470
00:31:23,795 --> 00:31:24,956
We're just looking around.

471
00:31:25,115 --> 00:31:25,956
Wu,

472
00:31:26,355 --> 00:31:27,795
have you noticed

473
00:31:27,795 --> 00:31:29,515
a strange smell here?

474
00:31:29,716 --> 00:31:31,236
And it's getting colder.

475
00:31:32,916 --> 00:31:34,835
Like icy air

476
00:31:35,035 --> 00:31:37,315
rising from my feet to my skull.

477
00:31:42,035 --> 00:31:43,355
Why's there a cold draft?

478
00:31:45,275 --> 00:31:46,156
Wait.

479
00:31:47,315 --> 00:31:49,115
How can there be wind underwater?

480
00:31:49,555 --> 00:31:50,275
Wu...

481
00:31:51,956 --> 00:31:53,236
Why'd you wander off?

482
00:32:03,876 --> 00:32:07,355
Buddha, please protect us.

483
00:32:07,355 --> 00:32:08,956
Please keep us safe.

484
00:32:08,956 --> 00:32:10,315
No obstacles in our path.

485
00:32:10,476 --> 00:32:15,075
Namo Amitabha Buddha.
Namo Amitabha Buddha.

486
00:32:15,275 --> 00:32:18,115
Good fortune and safety always.

487
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:19,595
Don't worry, Buddha.

488
00:32:19,595 --> 00:32:20,956
We'll burn incense every festival,

489
00:32:20,956 --> 00:32:22,275
three sticks each time.

490
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:24,035
No, we'll offer it daily.

491
00:32:24,035 --> 00:32:25,515
Wu, let's go.

492
00:32:26,035 --> 00:32:26,996
No talking.

493
00:32:27,676 --> 00:32:28,755
You weren't following.

494
00:32:28,755 --> 00:32:30,396
Now keep up.

495
00:32:34,436 --> 00:32:36,196
Look at you.

496
00:32:36,595 --> 00:32:38,035
You never listen,

497
00:32:39,035 --> 00:32:41,075
