=Episode 16=

3
00:01:47,235 --> 00:01:48,155
Xiaoge!

4
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:50,235
Pangzi!

5
00:01:51,587 --> 00:01:52,326
Hey!

6
00:01:53,515 --> 00:01:54,474
Xiaoge!

7
00:02:11,475 --> 00:02:12,475
What is that?

8
00:02:46,994 --> 00:02:48,874
Wu Xie...

9
00:07:20,075 --> 00:07:21,435
Are you done yet?

10
00:07:40,755 --> 00:07:42,115
I'll fight you!

11
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:43,834
Come out!

12
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:45,834
Come out!

13
00:09:49,594 --> 00:09:50,474
Bro,

14
00:09:51,754 --> 00:09:52,594
what's your name?

15
00:10:00,754 --> 00:10:01,994
You don't like those crackers.

16
00:10:03,315 --> 00:10:04,395
I've got beef jerky too.

17
00:10:04,795 --> 00:10:05,754
Want some?

18
00:10:42,354 --> 00:10:43,395
How dare you run!

19
00:10:43,955 --> 00:10:44,874
Run!

20
00:10:45,634 --> 00:10:46,275
Pangzi.

21
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:53,075
Why did you stop me?

22
00:10:54,234 --> 00:10:55,555
Didn't Xiaoge warn us before?

23
00:10:55,594 --> 00:10:56,594
It's highly poisonous.

24
00:10:56,594 --> 00:10:58,224
If you kill it,
you'll get us all killed!

25
00:10:59,114 --> 00:11:01,075
I tried to tie it up, see?

26
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,035
Unbelievable.

27
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:04,474
Wait.

28
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:06,675
Why'd you ditch me again back there?

29
00:11:06,754 --> 00:11:07,955
Who ditched you?

30
00:11:08,395 --> 00:11:10,035
We all moved together, didn't we?

31
00:11:12,315 --> 00:11:13,555
Weren't we just resting?

32
00:11:13,555 --> 00:11:14,955
I dozed off from that fragrance.

33
00:11:15,114 --> 00:11:17,754
That rest break was ages ago.

34
00:11:18,195 --> 00:11:20,514
Xiaoge said we're short on time.

35
00:11:20,594 --> 00:11:21,834
We barely rested

36
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:23,234
before he dragged us out.

37
00:11:23,354 --> 00:11:24,955
Remember when I told you on the way

38
00:11:25,155 --> 00:11:26,675
about getting hotpot after this?

39
00:11:28,714 --> 00:11:31,395
I saw your shadow following me.

40
00:11:32,675 --> 00:11:33,594
I'm exhausted.

41
00:11:36,315 --> 00:11:37,834
We need to keep moving.

42
00:11:39,195 --> 00:11:40,514
We just started resting.

43
00:11:42,275 --> 00:11:43,315
We're really out of time.

44
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:46,354
Wu.

45
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:49,594
Stop sleeping.

46
00:11:50,155 --> 00:11:51,114
We have to go.

47
00:11:51,315 --> 00:11:52,555
Our oxygen won't last.

48
00:11:55,474 --> 00:11:56,594
Keep up.

49
00:11:58,275 --> 00:11:59,155
Wu,

50
00:11:59,435 --> 00:12:02,075
why do I suddenly crave hotpot?

51
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,435
Do you want it?

52
00:12:03,955 --> 00:12:06,395
Let's finish this and go back.

53
00:12:06,514 --> 00:12:07,514
Hotpot together.

54
00:12:07,555 --> 00:12:08,555
That's nonsense.

55
00:12:11,155 --> 00:12:12,275
I didn't move a muscle.

56
00:12:17,555 --> 00:12:19,114
Then who was following me?

57
00:12:39,955 --> 00:12:41,234
Could it be the Forbidden Woman?

58
00:12:41,435 --> 00:12:42,234
Who?

59
00:12:44,634 --> 00:12:45,555
The Forbidden Woman.

60
00:12:45,714 --> 00:12:46,634
When you first entered,

61
00:12:46,634 --> 00:12:48,114
didn't the mural show her?

62
00:12:48,555 --> 00:12:49,594
The one with a huge belly.

63
00:12:50,075 --> 00:12:51,354
I met one on my way here,

64
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:52,514
but without a huge belly.

65
00:12:52,514 --> 00:12:53,395
Female silhouette,

66
00:12:53,395 --> 00:12:54,275
long hair,

67
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:55,795
and that fragrance resembles

68
00:12:55,795 --> 00:12:57,075
the Forbidden Woman's Scent.

69
00:12:58,435 --> 00:13:00,555
So those monsters actually exist?

70
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:04,834
Are you hurt?

71
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,155
Turn around. Let me check.

72
00:13:06,795 --> 00:13:07,315
You're fine.

73
00:13:07,315 --> 00:13:09,634
So give us full intel

74
00:13:09,634 --> 00:13:11,754
on this creature's abilities.

75
00:13:11,754 --> 00:13:13,075
We need contingency plans

76
00:13:13,155 --> 00:13:16,395
for future encounters.

77
00:13:17,275 --> 00:13:19,234
I'm still confused.

78
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:21,675
What do you mean?

79
00:13:23,555 --> 00:13:24,594
It's just...

80
00:13:26,714 --> 00:13:27,514
I...

81
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:28,874
Stop being coy.

82
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:29,634
Speak!

83
00:13:30,064 --> 00:13:31,216
I just turned and ran.

84
00:13:31,664 --> 00:13:32,432
Huh?

85
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:42,234
I'm just

86
00:13:42,234 --> 00:13:44,315
organizing our intel.

87
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:46,714
We need to fight prepared.

88
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,594
Everything happened too fast.

89
00:13:49,114 --> 00:13:50,714
She appeared right in my face.

90
00:13:52,555 --> 00:13:53,234
Leave it.

91
00:13:53,234 --> 00:13:54,555
Our priority now

92
00:13:54,555 --> 00:13:56,395
is to find a way out

93
00:13:56,555 --> 00:13:58,315
and to be fast.

94
00:14:00,234 --> 00:14:01,594
We're out of time.

95
00:14:03,354 --> 00:14:04,714
So which way now?

96
00:14:05,114 --> 00:14:06,155
You just came

97
00:14:06,275 --> 00:14:07,915
from the Twelve-Armed Corpse chamber.

98
00:14:08,594 --> 00:14:10,035
Xie Lianhuan's tunnel ends there.

99
00:14:10,555 --> 00:14:11,594
Speaking of which,

100
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:14,675
that guy's something else.

101
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:16,195
He's born to dig.

102
00:14:16,395 --> 00:14:18,555
His tunnel's way too long!

103
00:14:34,234 --> 00:14:35,155
Wu.

104
00:14:36,315 --> 00:14:37,075
Wu Xie!

105
00:14:52,555 --> 00:14:53,474
Wu Xie!

106
00:14:54,075 --> 00:14:54,955
Wu Xie!

107
00:14:57,474 --> 00:14:58,435
Pangzi.

108
00:14:59,234 --> 00:15:01,634
This tunnel zigzags upward, right?

109
00:15:01,874 --> 00:15:03,874
I think we are near the ship's top now.

110
00:15:03,955 --> 00:15:05,195
It's just collapsed.

111
00:15:05,395 --> 00:15:07,035
That's why we took this detour.

112
00:15:07,955 --> 00:15:09,114
If it hadn't collapsed,

113
00:15:09,354 --> 00:15:11,035
we might've gotten out already.

114
00:15:11,754 --> 00:15:13,275
But no worries.

115
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:14,075
Xiaoge has found

116
00:15:14,075 --> 00:15:15,555
the right position of the Life Gate.

117
00:15:45,555 --> 00:15:46,555
Found it.

118
00:15:58,234 --> 00:15:59,234
Why this gate again?

119
00:16:00,555 --> 00:16:01,474
Clueless, aren't you?

120
00:16:02,634 --> 00:16:03,395
This

121
00:16:03,594 --> 00:16:04,915
is actually the Death Gate.

122
00:16:06,514 --> 00:16:07,555
The Death Gate?

123
00:16:07,714 --> 00:16:09,234
The Eight Trigrams mirror each other.

124
00:16:10,395 --> 00:16:11,474
The real Life Gate

125
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,514
should be right opposite.

126
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:39,874
Wu Sanxing!

127
00:16:41,395 --> 00:16:42,474
What trick are you playing?

128
00:16:44,315 --> 00:16:45,195
Come out!

129
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:48,955
I know you're still here.

130
00:18:58,955 --> 00:18:59,915
Dong Jian?

131
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,435
Wang Erli?

132
00:19:05,595 --> 00:19:06,554
How's that possible?

133
00:19:10,994 --> 00:19:12,195
Don't come any closer.

134
00:19:13,314 --> 00:19:14,274
Don't come any closer!

135
00:19:18,794 --> 00:19:19,794
Wu Sanxing.

136
00:19:21,554 --> 00:19:22,554
Wu Sanxing.

137
00:19:23,274 --> 00:19:24,395
Wu Sanxing.

138
00:19:31,395 --> 00:19:32,355
Don't come any closer.

139
00:19:33,554 --> 00:19:34,514
Don't come any closer.

140
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:39,435
Wu Sanxing!

141
00:19:39,635 --> 00:19:40,714
Don't come any closer!

142
00:19:41,155 --> 00:19:42,034
Don't come any closer!

143
00:19:42,395 --> 00:19:43,395
Don't come any closer!

144
00:19:43,635 --> 00:19:44,635
Don't come any closer!

145
00:19:44,915 --> 00:19:46,155
Don't come any closer!

146
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,794
This passage keeps sloping upward.

147
00:19:51,034 --> 00:19:52,835
It seems we're heading
toward the ship's top.

148
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:53,714
Wu,

149
00:19:53,835 --> 00:19:54,635
why do I feel

150
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:55,754
since some point,

151
00:19:55,754 --> 00:19:56,912
my whole body's been itching?

152
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:59,034
And it's getting worse by the minute.

153
00:20:00,274 --> 00:20:01,195
I was itching too,

154
00:20:02,115 --> 00:20:03,115
but it's much better now.

155
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,008
Maybe the humidity here

156
00:20:05,008 --> 00:20:06,480
is causing allergies
or inflammation.

157
00:20:07,034 --> 00:20:07,675
No way!

158
00:20:08,155 --> 00:20:08,675
I'm allergic.

159
00:20:09,314 --> 00:20:10,635
I need to treat this.

160
00:20:11,115 --> 00:20:12,115
I'm so itchy.

161
00:20:12,234 --> 00:20:13,168
If this keeps up,

162
00:20:13,168 --> 00:20:14,192
it'll drive me mad.

163
00:20:14,192 --> 00:20:15,514
It's driving me up the wall!

164
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:16,432
Can you keep going?

165
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:18,074
Check me quickly!

166
00:20:18,274 --> 00:20:19,474
Hurry! Hurry!

167
00:20:23,034 --> 00:20:24,675
Hey, man. When's your last bath?

168
00:20:25,714 --> 00:20:26,474
Bath?

169
00:20:26,955 --> 00:20:28,754
That's personal privacy.

170
00:20:28,754 --> 00:20:30,034
I can't tell you.

171
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,395
Look, man.

172
00:20:31,955 --> 00:20:32,875
Listen carefully.

173
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:33,514
Don't panic.

174
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,234
Your back

175
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,074
has mold growing.

176
00:20:36,074 --> 00:20:36,875
Mold?

177
00:20:36,915 --> 00:20:38,915
Yeah, white mold.

178
00:20:38,915 --> 00:20:39,754
White mold?

179
00:20:39,915 --> 00:20:41,554
A true wonder of nature!

180
00:20:41,955 --> 00:20:42,915
Let it grow longer,

181
00:20:42,915 --> 00:20:44,435
and you'll harvest lingzhi.

182
00:20:44,435 --> 00:20:46,714
Who taught you to be so glib?

183
00:20:47,234 --> 00:20:48,155
Xiaoge,

184
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:49,232
what should I do?

185
00:20:49,232 --> 00:20:50,714
My back's growing mushrooms!

186
00:20:51,472 --> 00:20:52,528
Those are Lotus Arrows.

187
00:20:53,115 --> 00:20:53,955
Not a big issue.

188
00:20:54,395 --> 00:20:55,155
Just mild itching.

189
00:20:55,155 --> 00:20:56,714
But it's so itchy.

190
00:20:56,915 --> 00:20:57,754
I can't stand it.

191
00:20:57,955 --> 00:20:59,314
Any solutions?

192
00:21:14,994 --> 00:21:16,144
I've got toner in my bag.

193
00:21:16,144 --> 00:21:17,008
- Let me apply some.
- Okay.

194
00:21:17,008 --> 00:21:17,808
Great.

195
00:21:17,808 --> 00:21:19,248
- Come on. Let me see.
- Okay.

196
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:20,274
You're meticulous

197
00:21:20,274 --> 00:21:21,520
to carry toner with you.

198
00:21:24,048 --> 00:21:25,595
Ouch!

199
00:21:25,595 --> 00:21:27,234
That's alcohol, isn't it?

200
00:21:27,472 --> 00:21:28,880
Stop screaming like a woman.

201
00:21:29,264 --> 00:21:30,512
Have some humanity, will you?

202
00:21:30,512 --> 00:21:31,600
Let me spray some on you.

203
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,752
Be gentle.

204
00:21:34,672 --> 00:21:36,304
Oh, my God!

205
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:38,435
Look!

206
00:21:39,024 --> 00:21:39,888
Done.

207
00:21:43,728 --> 00:21:44,976
Honestly,

208
00:21:45,552 --> 00:21:46,256
it works.

209
00:21:46,704 --> 00:21:48,432
This is export-grade stuff.

210
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,488
Export-grade?

211
00:21:50,355 --> 00:21:51,280
What brand is this?

212
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,464
Get me some later.

213
00:21:52,955 --> 00:21:53,648
Xiaoge.

214
00:21:56,395 --> 00:21:57,314
It really works.

215
00:21:59,355 --> 00:22:00,115
Wu,

216
00:22:00,395 --> 00:22:02,115
your stuff smells decent. What brand?

217
00:22:03,635 --> 00:22:04,355
Pangzi.

218
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:10,714
What's that?

219
00:22:13,155 --> 00:22:14,314
Forbidden Woman?

220
00:22:17,514 --> 00:22:18,675
Monster.

221
00:22:24,016 --> 00:22:25,195
She hit me.

222
00:22:53,595 --> 00:22:55,056
She fears fire! Fire!

223
00:22:55,056 --> 00:22:56,528
- I don't have any.
- I've got fire.

224
00:22:56,528 --> 00:22:57,360
I have it.

225
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,544
She's coming down.

226
00:22:59,056 --> 00:22:59,920
Hurry up!

227
00:23:01,395 --> 00:23:01,955
Wu!

228
00:23:02,435 --> 00:23:03,074
Hurry!

229
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:04,034
She's coming down!

230
00:23:20,915 --> 00:23:21,474
Wu,

231
00:23:21,835 --> 00:23:24,074
why is it acting like an octopus?

232
00:23:28,675 --> 00:23:29,435
Wu!

233
00:23:30,474 --> 00:23:31,635
This is twisted.

234
00:23:31,635 --> 00:23:32,714
She's even dancing.

235
00:23:32,794 --> 00:23:33,595
Take a look.

236
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:39,554
Pangzi!

237
00:23:42,155 --> 00:23:43,875
You monster.

238
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,234
Are you okay, Pangzi?

239
00:23:47,074 --> 00:23:48,794
You just wait. I'll get down there.

240
00:23:51,234 --> 00:23:52,514
It almost knocked my teeth out.

241
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,435
Easy! Easy!

242
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:56,514
My face!

243
00:23:58,675 --> 00:24:00,355
Is this hair made of nanomaterials?

244
00:24:00,635 --> 00:24:02,675
Why is it slippery like worms

245
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:03,915
and crawling into my clothes?

246
00:24:38,754 --> 00:24:39,514
Wu,

247
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:41,355
are you alright?

248
00:24:43,714 --> 00:24:44,754
I'm fine.

249
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:50,474
It hasn't eaten in centuries, has it?

250
00:24:51,915 --> 00:24:52,994
This is

251
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,514
the monster I mentioned earlier.

252
00:24:55,554 --> 00:24:57,675
It's not what I expected.

253
00:25:00,464 --> 00:25:01,514
She's that so-called

254
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:03,835
Forbidden Woman?

255
00:25:04,395 --> 00:25:05,355
It should be.

256
00:25:05,595 --> 00:25:06,675
We need to go.

257
00:25:07,195 --> 00:25:08,234
It didn't get us.

258
00:25:08,395 --> 00:25:09,554
It'll keep chasing.

259
00:25:09,955 --> 00:25:10,794
Hurry up.

260
00:25:10,994 --> 00:25:12,195
Let's go.

261
00:25:13,955 --> 00:25:14,955
Hurry!

262
00:25:33,554 --> 00:25:35,034
What's Xiaoge doing?

263
00:25:40,955 --> 00:25:42,714
Did we trigger some new paths?

264
00:25:47,595 --> 00:25:48,474
Watch out.

265
00:25:48,994 --> 00:25:50,034
There might be

266
00:25:50,435 --> 00:25:51,234
mechanisms here.

267
00:25:58,355 --> 00:25:59,395
Don't knock on the door.

268
00:25:59,554 --> 00:26:00,675
What if there are monsters?

269
00:26:02,714 --> 00:26:03,514
How is it?

270
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:05,234
Anything there?

271
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:16,915
You laugh at me?

272
00:26:17,234 --> 00:26:17,754
Your turn.

273
00:26:17,754 --> 00:26:19,314
Skinny arms can't do anything.

274
00:26:19,714 --> 00:26:20,195
You try.

275
00:26:20,195 --> 00:26:21,915
Let me handle this.

276
00:26:22,074 --> 00:26:22,835
Hold this.

277
00:26:24,955 --> 00:26:25,835
Watch and learn.

278
00:26:32,355 --> 00:26:33,314
Were you pushing hard?

279
00:26:34,554 --> 00:26:35,554
Forgot the command.

280
00:26:36,714 --> 00:26:37,835
Open sesame!

281
00:26:53,754 --> 00:26:54,514
It hurts.

282
00:26:55,474 --> 00:26:56,234
Xiaoge.

283
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:58,034
Xiaoge, what door is this?

284
00:26:58,274 --> 00:26:59,675
Is it barred from inside?

285
00:26:59,955 --> 00:27:01,234
Stop the fancy tricks.

286
00:27:01,514 --> 00:27:02,274
Let's push.

287
00:27:02,635 --> 00:27:03,314
The impact

288
00:27:03,314 --> 00:27:04,155
loosened it.

289
00:27:08,395 --> 00:27:09,195
Xiaoge.

290
00:27:11,115 --> 00:27:12,034
Xiaoge!

291
00:27:12,835 --> 00:27:14,074
It's back!

292
00:27:16,675 --> 00:27:17,355
Hurry!

293
00:27:17,355 --> 00:27:18,314
Hurry up!

294
00:27:18,314 --> 00:27:18,835
Push harder!

295
00:27:24,754 --> 00:27:25,595
Is it okay?

296
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:14,074
Xiaoge!

297
00:28:20,474 --> 00:28:21,234
Wu!

298
00:28:22,314 --> 00:28:23,155
Wu Xie!

299
00:28:23,915 --> 00:28:24,915
What is that?

300
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:25,635
Wu Xie!

301
00:28:39,714 --> 00:28:40,554
Get out!

302
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:43,314
Pangzi!

303
00:28:47,754 --> 00:28:48,794
Run this way! Hurry!

304
00:28:49,074 --> 00:28:49,915
Wu!

305
00:28:50,274 --> 00:28:51,074
Wu Xie!

306
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:52,034
Wu Xie!

307
00:28:52,034 --> 00:28:53,034
Over here! Quick!

308
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:54,875
It seems to prefer the chubby ones.

309
00:28:57,835 --> 00:28:58,635
Where did it go?

310
00:29:44,474 --> 00:29:46,595
It only picks on easy targets.

311
00:29:46,754 --> 00:29:48,274
Thank goodness for my fat.

312
00:30:00,635 --> 00:30:01,456
Xiaoge!

313
00:30:01,456 --> 00:30:02,384
It's coming again!

314
00:30:11,074 --> 00:30:12,274
Go block the hole.

315
00:30:16,395 --> 00:30:18,514
Xiaoge! Here!

316
00:30:18,514 --> 00:30:20,915
Xiaoge! I can't hold on much longer!

317
00:30:22,274 --> 00:30:24,314
She's too strong!

318
00:30:26,595 --> 00:30:28,034
Xiaoge, faster!

319
00:30:46,234 --> 00:30:47,875
Pangzi!

320
00:30:48,714 --> 00:30:49,595
