3
00:01:50,096 --> 00:01:51,362
Xiaoge.

4
00:01:51,642 --> 00:01:52,483
We're here.

5
00:01:52,843 --> 00:01:53,763
Why aren't you in?

6
00:01:54,722 --> 00:01:55,522
Bad news.

7
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:56,843
The hinge is jammed.

8
00:01:57,282 --> 00:01:58,123
What?

9
00:02:01,362 --> 00:02:02,323
What do we do now?

10
00:02:03,242 --> 00:02:04,162
There's no way out.

11
00:02:06,162 --> 00:02:07,203
Xiaoge, think of a way!

12
00:02:07,563 --> 00:02:08,923
Or we'll be crushed soon.

13
00:02:10,003 --> 00:02:11,203
No time for thinking.

14
00:02:11,682 --> 00:02:12,763
Let's just run.

15
00:02:13,203 --> 00:02:14,003
Run faster.

16
00:02:14,122 --> 00:02:15,323
We might still have a chance.

17
00:02:15,323 --> 00:02:16,203
More running?

18
00:02:18,522 --> 00:02:19,362
What?

19
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:20,483
It's too late.

20
00:02:21,043 --> 00:02:22,323
It'll take at least 10 minutes.

21
00:02:27,122 --> 00:02:28,682
Our only option is to climb up.

22
00:02:29,522 --> 00:02:30,562
Climb up?

23
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,443
How's that even possible?

24
00:02:38,723 --> 00:02:39,682
Pangzi, hurry!

25
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,328
Good thing Xiaoge's quick-witted.

26
00:02:50,443 --> 00:02:51,443
Great.

27
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:53,802
Now we can choose to jump to our deaths

28
00:02:54,203 --> 00:02:56,003
before getting squashed flat.

29
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:58,842
Slow down.

30
00:03:00,163 --> 00:03:00,763
Alright.

31
00:03:01,003 --> 00:03:02,043
This way of dying

32
00:03:02,043 --> 00:03:04,003
is still better
than becoming meat filling.

33
00:03:04,842 --> 00:03:05,842
At the speed

34
00:03:06,043 --> 00:03:07,483
these walls are moving,

35
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:08,883
we'll get to watch

36
00:03:08,883 --> 00:03:10,883
every single bone in our bodies

37
00:03:10,883 --> 00:03:12,802
get ground into dust.

38
00:03:13,682 --> 00:03:14,802
Stop imagining horrors.

39
00:03:15,003 --> 00:03:16,003
We still have time.

40
00:03:21,723 --> 00:03:23,402
I wish I were a gecko right now.

41
00:03:24,642 --> 00:03:25,562
Just keep climbing.

42
00:03:27,483 --> 00:03:28,682
I'm a gecko. I'm a gecko.

43
00:03:29,562 --> 00:03:30,402
I'm a gecko.

44
00:03:31,043 --> 00:03:31,802
I'm a spider.

45
00:03:31,923 --> 00:03:32,723
I'm a gecko.

46
00:03:38,642 --> 00:03:39,483
Hurry up!

47
00:03:42,802 --> 00:03:44,003
I want to redeem myself

48
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:45,362
and start a new life.

49
00:03:48,483 --> 00:03:49,122
I can't go on.

50
00:03:49,323 --> 00:03:50,362
I can't climb anymore.

51
00:03:51,962 --> 00:03:52,562
Wu.

52
00:03:52,763 --> 00:03:53,483
Wu.

53
00:03:53,642 --> 00:03:54,522
Wu, wait for me.

54
00:03:55,043 --> 00:03:55,962
We reached the top.

55
00:03:56,682 --> 00:03:58,763
What's up there?

56
00:03:59,242 --> 00:04:00,802
The walls stopped moving for now.

57
00:04:05,122 --> 00:04:05,802
Let's rest.

58
00:04:06,203 --> 00:04:06,923
No.

59
00:04:12,723 --> 00:04:13,842
Push hard against it!

60
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,283
I know. I'm trying.

61
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,682
If I'd known this would be my end,

62
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,843
I should've
let that white-haired monster kill me.

63
00:04:19,923 --> 00:04:20,682
Being killed

64
00:04:20,923 --> 00:04:22,122
and growing white hair

65
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,682
is better than being meat paste.

66
00:04:25,963 --> 00:04:28,242
Just imagining my guts bursting out

67
00:04:30,442 --> 00:04:31,723
makes me regret everything.

68
00:04:32,283 --> 00:04:33,083
You won't be crushed

69
00:04:33,562 --> 00:04:34,762
to death right away.

70
00:04:35,362 --> 00:04:36,723
Fat compresses well.

71
00:04:37,283 --> 00:04:38,483
It'll take a while.

72
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:41,242
Why are you so fast?

73
00:04:41,523 --> 00:04:42,322
Wait for me.

74
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:44,882
I really can't.

75
00:04:44,923 --> 00:04:45,682
My legs...

76
00:04:47,483 --> 00:04:48,242
Xiaoge,

77
00:04:48,682 --> 00:04:49,643
why did you stop?

78
00:04:56,002 --> 00:04:56,762
Well?

79
00:04:57,002 --> 00:04:58,043
Find anything?

80
00:04:58,362 --> 00:05:00,923
Wu Sanxing left me with nowhere to turn.

81
00:05:01,963 --> 00:05:02,562
Why so quiet?

82
00:05:02,562 --> 00:05:04,322
I died with grievances.

83
00:05:05,043 --> 00:05:07,002
Heaven and earth bear witness.

84
00:05:07,202 --> 00:05:08,643
Xie Lianhuan?

85
00:05:09,403 --> 00:05:10,403
Who's he?

86
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,202
Why did he say Third Uncle killed him?

87
00:05:12,762 --> 00:05:13,963
Xie Lianhuan was on the team

88
00:05:13,963 --> 00:05:15,442
from 20 years ago.

89
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,882
Holding Snake-Eyebrow Copper Fish,

90
00:05:18,043 --> 00:05:19,442
he died in the cave.

91
00:05:35,442 --> 00:05:38,442
(20 years ago,
as the team leader, Wenjin)

92
00:05:38,442 --> 00:05:40,523
(and some young people formed)

93
00:05:40,523 --> 00:05:41,882
(a geological survey team)

94
00:05:41,882 --> 00:05:44,843
(to collect deep-sea samples at Ru Sea.)

95
00:05:45,283 --> 00:05:46,723
We've arrived!

96
00:05:46,723 --> 00:05:47,882
We've arrived!

97
00:05:47,882 --> 00:05:48,843
(Xie found)

98
00:05:48,843 --> 00:05:51,643
(giant tube-dwelling worms
in the seabed.)

99
00:05:52,242 --> 00:05:53,442
(It led us to infer)

100
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,202
(the sea area not far from there)

101
00:05:55,202 --> 00:05:57,562
(was very likely to contain
massive oil reserves.)

102
00:05:59,562 --> 00:06:01,163
Since he left a message here

103
00:06:01,322 --> 00:06:02,682
and wasn't crushed to death,

104
00:06:02,882 --> 00:06:04,562
it proves there must be an exit nearby.

105
00:06:05,163 --> 00:06:06,483
Let's check further ahead.

106
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,362
Xie Lianhuan.

107
00:06:11,923 --> 00:06:13,682
Xie Lianhuan.

108
00:06:16,762 --> 00:06:17,562
Climb.

109
00:06:18,122 --> 00:06:18,923
Let's go.

110
00:06:19,403 --> 00:06:20,283
What are you doing?

111
00:06:24,963 --> 00:06:25,723
Found it.

112
00:06:26,643 --> 00:06:27,362
Move.

113
00:06:27,603 --> 00:06:29,002
Wu Xie, snap out of it.

114
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,362
Keep moving.

115
00:06:39,403 --> 00:06:40,242
Xiaoge,

116
00:06:40,362 --> 00:06:41,802
the walls seem to be moving again.

117
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,163
They're moving again.

118
00:06:51,483 --> 00:06:52,762
My turn.

119
00:07:02,163 --> 00:07:03,723
Pangzi!

120
00:07:09,403 --> 00:07:09,923
Wu Xie!

121
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:10,643
Pangzi!

122
00:07:11,043 --> 00:07:11,682
I'm stuck.

123
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:12,322
Take this.

124
00:07:13,122 --> 00:07:14,002
Wu Xie!

125
00:07:20,643 --> 00:07:21,242
Xiaoge.

126
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:25,843
Wait for me.

127
00:07:30,322 --> 00:07:30,923
Done.

128
00:07:30,923 --> 00:07:31,523
Pull!

129
00:09:47,442 --> 00:09:49,043
How much farther?

130
00:09:50,202 --> 00:09:51,243
How much farther?

131
00:09:51,923 --> 00:09:54,682
Wu, I'm sorry,
but I might have to let one rip.

132
00:09:55,322 --> 00:09:56,482
You shut...

133
00:09:56,482 --> 00:09:57,202
Don't hit me.

134
00:09:57,202 --> 00:09:58,363
Shut your mouth.

135
00:09:58,523 --> 00:09:59,202
I'm exhausted.

136
00:09:59,202 --> 00:10:00,123
Speed up.

137
00:10:00,602 --> 00:10:01,643
This is my fastest.

138
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:02,442
Don't you dare fart.

139
00:10:02,442 --> 00:10:03,722
My knees.

140
00:10:04,283 --> 00:10:05,523
My elbows.

141
00:10:06,722 --> 00:10:07,523
My back.

142
00:10:08,722 --> 00:10:09,562
I really can't go on.

143
00:10:10,883 --> 00:10:12,962
Xiaoge. Xiaoge.

144
00:10:13,283 --> 00:10:14,202
Stop crawling.

145
00:10:14,722 --> 00:10:15,682
Let's rest.

146
00:10:17,123 --> 00:10:19,043
I need rest. I can't go on.

147
00:10:21,562 --> 00:10:23,602
I need a break.

148
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:28,763
No.

149
00:10:29,322 --> 00:10:30,123
I can't do it.

150
00:10:30,602 --> 00:10:31,763
No way. I can't go on.

151
00:10:34,643 --> 00:10:35,722
I'm exhausted.

152
00:10:37,722 --> 00:10:38,842
After I get out of here,

153
00:10:39,202 --> 00:10:40,562
if I don't lose 30 pounds,

154
00:10:41,104 --> 00:10:42,682
I'll write my surname upside down.

155
00:10:45,602 --> 00:10:46,802
This tunnel

156
00:10:46,923 --> 00:10:48,763
was dug in zigzags.

157
00:10:48,923 --> 00:10:50,243
And the engineering's impeccable.

158
00:10:50,602 --> 00:10:53,523
Xie Lianhuan clearly knew his stuff.

159
00:10:54,923 --> 00:10:56,403
Architecturally speaking,

160
00:10:56,682 --> 00:10:59,363
zigzag tunnels
are structurally sound and safe.

161
00:10:59,923 --> 00:11:01,722
Even if small sections collapse,

162
00:11:01,763 --> 00:11:03,722
the whole structure remains intact.

163
00:11:04,562 --> 00:11:06,043
I'm unsure about his digging skills,

164
00:11:06,722 --> 00:11:08,643
but he sure didn't design this
for fat people.

165
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:11,202
Xiaoge,

166
00:11:11,842 --> 00:11:14,243
why was your team fine 20 years ago?

167
00:11:14,722 --> 00:11:17,082
We nearly got crushed today.

168
00:11:18,482 --> 00:11:20,482
Looks like the Life Gate symbol
was tampered with.

169
00:11:21,363 --> 00:11:22,643
The path earlier was dangerous.

170
00:11:22,923 --> 00:11:24,363
We must've entered the Death Gate.

171
00:11:27,003 --> 00:11:28,403
Could it be

172
00:11:29,243 --> 00:11:31,682
that Ning realized we survived

173
00:11:31,682 --> 00:11:33,363
and sabotaged our exit?

174
00:11:33,842 --> 00:11:34,842
Impossible.

175
00:11:35,163 --> 00:11:37,802
I'll admit she's vicious,

176
00:11:38,403 --> 00:11:39,202
but

177
00:11:40,163 --> 00:11:42,322
she couldn't have tampered

178
00:11:42,322 --> 00:11:44,043
with centuries-old mechanisms.

179
00:11:45,043 --> 00:11:46,363
That's too far-fetched.

180
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,123
Then where did she go?

181
00:12:35,003 --> 00:12:36,003
What do we do?

182
00:12:37,763 --> 00:12:38,523
It's okay.

183
00:12:39,163 --> 00:12:40,123
You did well.

184
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:43,523
Go on without me.

185
00:12:49,283 --> 00:12:50,523
I won't hold you back.

186
00:12:52,643 --> 00:12:54,163
Can you complete the mission?

187
00:12:55,283 --> 00:12:56,283
I can't do it alone.

188
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,962
But better one dead than two.

189
00:13:02,003 --> 00:13:04,403
I won't let you die here.

190
00:13:06,722 --> 00:13:07,763
I don't matter.

191
00:13:08,523 --> 00:13:10,322
I took this job
because I've got no family.

192
00:13:11,202 --> 00:13:12,043
But someone

193
00:13:12,682 --> 00:13:14,682
must be waiting for you.

194
00:13:18,883 --> 00:13:19,962
Just go.

195
00:13:23,722 --> 00:13:25,123
You'll move faster alone.

196
00:13:31,403 --> 00:13:32,243
Enough talk.

197
00:13:32,643 --> 00:13:33,403
Let's go.

198
00:14:50,202 --> 00:14:51,202
Why save me?

199
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:58,043
Do you know why we came here?

200
00:14:59,842 --> 00:15:01,643
We came to monitor you.

201
00:15:08,562 --> 00:15:09,363
You people

202
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,482
seem unaware of

203
00:15:12,842 --> 00:15:14,163
who the hunter is

204
00:15:14,722 --> 00:15:15,562
and who the prey is.

205
00:15:28,763 --> 00:15:30,682
Does that place
you mentioned really exist?

206
00:15:31,883 --> 00:15:32,722
Is it

207
00:15:34,082 --> 00:15:34,883
worth it?

208
00:15:38,202 --> 00:15:39,523
If it's just for money,

209
00:15:41,043 --> 00:15:42,123
it's not worth it.

210
00:15:49,202 --> 00:15:50,682
I have my own purpose.

211
00:15:59,643 --> 00:16:00,842
I have a regret

212
00:16:02,722 --> 00:16:03,763
about this place.

213
00:17:05,923 --> 00:17:06,883
Who is it?

214
00:17:12,883 --> 00:17:13,923
Forget it.

215
00:17:14,722 --> 00:17:15,682
Let's rest first.

216
00:17:15,883 --> 00:17:17,962
Wu Sanxing got me killed.

217
00:17:18,563 --> 00:17:19,883
Heaven and earth bear witness.

218
00:17:20,962 --> 00:17:22,042
Impossible.

219
00:17:23,002 --> 00:17:24,282
Xie Lianhuan.

220
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,363
I know who Xie Lianhuan was.

221
00:17:27,202 --> 00:17:28,482
You scared me.

222
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:29,762
I remember when I was young,

223
00:17:30,603 --> 00:17:31,682
I saw him once.

224
00:18:38,096 --> 00:18:40,603
(No wonder later, whenever
Grandpa reprimanded Third Uncle,)

225
00:18:40,603 --> 00:18:42,042
(he often mentioned the Xie family,)

226
00:18:42,608 --> 00:18:43,962
(saying our family would never)

227
00:18:43,962 --> 00:18:45,923
(hold our heads high
because of Third Uncle.)

228
00:18:46,603 --> 00:18:47,803
So Xie Lianhuan

229
00:18:48,202 --> 00:18:49,603
died like this?

230
00:18:52,242 --> 00:18:53,682
I have a bold theory.

231
00:18:54,682 --> 00:18:55,962
If you don't mind,

232
00:18:56,442 --> 00:18:57,522
hear me out.

233
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:01,002
Suppose your third uncle
and Xie Lianhuan were close,

234
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,323
but they didn't appear so.

235
00:19:08,803 --> 00:19:09,803
Get away.

236
00:19:14,032 --> 00:19:15,042
So it seems that...

237
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:15,843
Sidi.

238
00:19:16,563 --> 00:19:17,202
Coming.

239
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:19,883
Give it to me.

240
00:19:21,883 --> 00:19:23,603
Huo Ling, inform the captain.

241
00:19:23,603 --> 00:19:25,202
We'll head southwest at 40 degrees

242
00:19:25,202 --> 00:19:26,923
for about 20 more nautical miles.

243
00:19:29,563 --> 00:19:30,762
How is it, Sidi?

244
00:19:30,923 --> 00:19:31,682
Not bad.

245
00:19:50,762 --> 00:19:52,202
Why don't we all go together?

246
00:19:52,762 --> 00:19:53,323
Right.

247
00:19:53,323 --> 00:19:53,744
Let's go.

248
00:19:53,744 --> 00:19:54,256
- Go.
- Let's go.

249
00:19:54,256 --> 00:19:55,248
We may find something.

250
00:19:55,482 --> 00:19:55,843
Okay.

251
00:19:55,843 --> 00:19:56,202
Exactly.

252
00:19:56,202 --> 00:19:57,002
Then we'll go.

253
00:19:57,643 --> 00:19:58,242
Okay.

254
00:20:14,163 --> 00:20:16,123
Maybe we should head back.

255
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:18,962
Let's check it out.

256
00:20:28,002 --> 00:20:28,843
Xie,

257
00:20:29,163 --> 00:20:29,762
don't go.

258
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:30,563
Let's return.

259
00:20:31,403 --> 00:20:32,323
Let's go.

260
00:20:48,363 --> 00:20:49,363
Wenjin.

261
00:20:50,363 --> 00:20:50,962
Wenjin.

262
00:20:50,962 --> 00:20:51,603
Sidi.

263
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:52,603
How's it going?

264
00:20:53,242 --> 00:20:54,083
So many?

265
00:20:55,002 --> 00:20:56,403
Any findings?

266
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:57,843
Quite a haul.

267
00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:01,042
Plenty of gains.

268
00:22:21,603 --> 00:22:23,522
(However, after entering the shipwreck,)

269
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,042
(some unexpected incident
might have occurred,)

270
00:22:26,442 --> 00:22:28,323
(prompting your third uncle's
intent to kill)

271
00:22:28,803 --> 00:22:29,563
(Xie Lianhuan.)

272
00:22:29,563 --> 00:22:31,083
Sanxing, we're here.

273
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,363
We succeeded!

274
00:22:47,643 --> 00:22:48,242
Sanxing,

275
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:48,883
let's go.

276
00:22:57,522 --> 00:22:59,123
Why's this passage so narrow?

277
00:23:01,762 --> 00:23:02,643
Move.

278
00:23:05,042 --> 00:23:05,843
Stop!

279
00:23:11,843 --> 00:23:12,563
Sanxing?

280
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:13,643
Sanxing?

281
00:23:13,962 --> 00:23:14,643
Sanxing?

282
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:17,803
Sanxing!

283
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,843
(I don't know what happened exactly.)

284
00:23:32,002 --> 00:23:33,123
(But it's certain)

285
00:23:33,563 --> 00:23:35,363
(that when Xie Lianhuan was cornered,)

286
00:23:35,363 --> 00:23:37,563
(he left the blood-written message
on the wall.)

287
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:42,083
Wu Sanxing left me

288
00:23:43,363 --> 00:23:44,962
with nowhere to turn.

289
00:23:44,962 --> 00:23:46,682
I died with grievances.

290
00:23:47,002 --> 00:23:48,363
Heaven and earth bear witness.

291
00:23:49,002 --> 00:23:51,363
Xie Lianhuan.

292
00:24:00,403 --> 00:24:01,442
Wu Sanxing,

293
00:24:02,522 --> 00:24:04,282
you'll die horribly.

294
00:24:05,242 --> 00:24:08,042
Even as a ghost, I'll haunt you!

295
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,603
(But then he discovered
the hollow above.)

296
00:24:12,722 --> 00:24:14,323
(He quickly dug an escape tunnel)

297
00:24:14,442 --> 00:24:15,403
(and got out alive.)

298
00:24:16,282 --> 00:24:17,643
(Using his experience,)

299
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,042
(he started here)

300
00:24:19,403 --> 00:24:20,403
(and dug a few tunnels.)

301
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:21,883
(One of them)

302
00:24:22,282 --> 00:24:23,403
(leads to the bottom)

303
00:24:23,403 --> 00:24:24,923
(of the Twelve-Armed Corpse's pool.)

304
00:24:25,722 --> 00:24:27,760
(Maybe he failed
to break the pool's stone slab.)

305
00:24:28,323 --> 00:24:29,442
(He tried again and dug)

306
00:24:29,442 --> 00:24:31,803
(the tunnel where Pangzi and I
swam out of the pool.)

307
00:24:35,282 --> 00:24:36,762
(After several failed attempts,)

308
00:24:36,962 --> 00:24:38,762
(he finally escaped the shipwreck.)

309
00:24:40,883 --> 00:24:41,643
(Later,)

310
00:24:42,042 --> 00:24:44,083
(he wanted
to confront Wu Sanxing immediately.)

311
00:24:45,042 --> 00:24:46,603
(But upon meeting Wu Sanxing,)

312
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:48,123
(he got killed by him.)

313
00:24:48,923 --> 00:24:51,282
(His body was staged
to look like an accidental death.)

314
00:24:55,603 --> 00:24:56,163
Yun.

315
00:24:56,282 --> 00:24:57,563
Look. There's a cave here.

316
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:58,123
Yeah.

317
00:24:58,482 --> 00:24:59,403
Let's go check it out.

318
00:25:00,323 --> 00:25:02,522
Xie Lianhuan is dead!

319
00:25:02,923 --> 00:25:03,643
Right up ahead.

320
00:25:11,722 --> 00:25:12,482
The flashlight.

321
00:25:35,002 --> 00:25:36,083
(Later,)

322
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:37,522
(either for some hidden purpose)

323
00:25:38,123 --> 00:25:39,762
(or genuinely to escape the storm,)

324
00:25:40,403 --> 00:25:41,962
(Wu Sanxing led us into the shipwreck.)

325
00:25:41,962 --> 00:25:43,603
Let's thank Wu Sanxing.

326
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:44,442
Applause!

327
00:25:47,482 --> 00:25:48,803
(After entering the shipwreck,)

328
00:25:49,123 --> 00:25:50,843
(Wu Sanxing pretended to sleep.)

329
00:25:51,202 --> 00:25:52,242
(Then I discovered)

330
00:25:52,563 --> 00:25:53,883
(the ballast stones' secret,)

331
00:25:54,242 --> 00:25:55,568
(Heavenly Palace on the Clouds.)

332
00:25:55,962 --> 00:25:57,563
(He led everyone to the bottom)

333
00:25:57,563 --> 00:25:58,522
(of that pool.)

334
00:25:58,522 --> 00:25:59,202
Zhang!

335
00:26:00,762 --> 00:26:02,403
I say we go together

336
00:26:02,403 --> 00:26:03,722
to watch each other's backs.

337
00:26:03,803 --> 00:26:04,442
Right.

338
00:26:04,442 --> 00:26:04,883
Okay.

339
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:06,083
Let's take a look

340
00:26:06,123 --> 00:26:07,323
and get out fast.

341
00:26:07,722 --> 00:26:08,643
- Let's go.
- Go.

342
00:26:12,803 --> 00:26:14,762
(It must have been unexpected for him.)

343
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:23,242
(He had no choice)

344
00:26:23,563 --> 00:26:25,563
(but to fake being possessed
by a female ghost,)

345
00:26:25,843 --> 00:26:27,883
(lure us into the passageway,)

346
00:26:27,883 --> 00:26:28,563
(and drug us.)

347
00:26:28,563 --> 00:26:29,163
Do you

348
00:26:29,722 --> 00:26:31,083
smell fragrance?

349
00:26:32,482 --> 00:26:33,202
Yes.

350
00:26:33,403 --> 00:26:34,682
And it's growing stronger.

351
00:26:35,002 --> 00:26:35,682
Wenjin.

352
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,522
That's what happened.

353
00:26:57,403 --> 00:26:58,803
I don't know

354
00:26:59,722 --> 00:27:01,603
where he took the others
after I was knocked out

355
00:27:02,123 --> 00:27:03,722
or how I got out of there.

356
00:27:04,272 --> 00:27:06,682
I don't even know
if Wu Sanxing also lost his memory,

357
00:27:06,762 --> 00:27:07,883
so he didn't recognize me.

358
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,403
But one thing I'm certain of.

359
00:27:10,403 --> 00:27:12,403
Between Wu Sanxing and Xie Lianhuan

360
00:27:12,643 --> 00:27:13,643
are more secrets.

361
00:27:14,323 --> 00:27:16,643
Why didn't my third uncle
just kill you all back then?

362
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,282
Wouldn't that solve everything?

363
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:19,762
I don't know either.

364
00:27:21,323 --> 00:27:23,202
Maybe he thought we knew nothing,

365
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:24,522
so it wasn't necessary.

366
00:27:25,123 --> 00:27:26,042
Impossible.

367
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:28,643
My third uncle wouldn't

368
00:27:29,722 --> 00:27:31,282
and could never be that kind of person.

369
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:32,682
We'll take them all.

370
00:27:32,762 --> 00:27:34,442
We'll take them all.

371
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:36,762
The change.

372
00:27:37,042 --> 00:27:38,123
Keep the change.

373
00:27:40,482 --> 00:27:41,442
Why buy these?

374
00:27:42,643 --> 00:27:43,603
Drink it.

375
00:27:44,002 --> 00:27:45,042
I'll take all the flowers.

376
00:27:48,722 --> 00:27:50,803
Drink it. Drink now.

377
00:28:33,042 --> 00:28:33,722
I'm sorry.

378
00:28:34,042 --> 00:28:34,843
Third Uncle!

379
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:36,042
Third Uncle!

380
00:28:51,643 --> 00:28:52,722
Well,

381
00:28:53,242 --> 00:28:54,323
about this matter,

382
00:28:54,762 --> 00:28:56,682
I have a theory.

383
00:28:56,923 --> 00:28:58,042
Just hear me out.

384
00:29:00,762 --> 00:29:01,682
Basically,

385
00:29:02,202 --> 00:29:06,002
after your third uncle
arrived at this shipwreck,

386
00:29:06,722 --> 00:29:09,323
he must have encountered something.

387
00:29:11,123 --> 00:29:11,923
You know?

388
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,442
He got possessed or something.

389
00:29:14,923 --> 00:29:16,403
Didn't Xiaoge mention

390
00:29:16,843 --> 00:29:18,843
your third uncle was combing
his hair like a woman

391
00:29:18,843 --> 00:29:21,442
in front of a mirror?

392
00:29:22,323 --> 00:29:23,042
What does it mean?

393
00:29:23,042 --> 00:29:24,242
It's highly likely

394
00:29:24,323 --> 00:29:28,042
he's being controlled by
a vengeful spirit in this ship.

395
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:32,163
So if we meet him later,

396
00:29:32,363 --> 00:29:34,722
just douse him with dog blood.

397
00:29:35,202 --> 00:29:36,522
That'll snap him out of it.

398
00:29:37,803 --> 00:29:38,923
Pangzi,

399
00:29:39,123 --> 00:29:40,722
you're making it
sound like a ghost tale.

400
00:29:40,722 --> 00:29:41,522
You know?

401
00:29:41,682 --> 00:29:43,682
I've lived with Third Uncle
for over 20 years.

402
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:45,442
Never once have I seen him
act like a woman.

403
00:29:45,603 --> 00:29:46,603
You're full of nonsense.

404
00:29:47,163 --> 00:29:47,962
You don't get it.

405
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:50,002
Mental illness

406
00:29:50,002 --> 00:29:52,123
has active and dormant states.

407
00:29:53,123 --> 00:29:54,762
Maybe he acts totally fine in public,

408
00:29:54,762 --> 00:29:56,323
putting on airs and all.

409
00:29:56,442 --> 00:29:57,403
But secretly?

410
00:29:57,403 --> 00:30:00,002
He puts on rouge,

411
00:30:00,603 --> 00:30:01,923
embroiders handkerchiefs,

412
00:30:02,123 --> 00:30:05,923
and sings Peking opera as a female lead.

413
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:07,323
You think he's androgynous?

414
00:30:07,803 --> 00:30:09,282
Stop making up stories about him.

415
00:30:11,762 --> 00:30:13,403
Mark my words.

416
00:30:13,482 --> 00:30:14,323
Listen.

417
00:30:15,163 --> 00:30:16,522
It's fengshui, you know?

418
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:18,442
In fengshui, wind and water

419
00:30:18,843 --> 00:30:20,282
echo to each other,

420
00:30:20,323 --> 00:30:21,962
but wind halts at water's edge.

421
00:30:21,962 --> 00:30:22,762
You know?

422
00:30:23,123 --> 00:30:24,603
The vengeful spirit

423
00:30:24,843 --> 00:30:27,722
under the ship
has accumulated resentment

424
00:30:27,722 --> 00:30:29,242
with no specific targets.

425
00:30:29,923 --> 00:30:30,883
By coincidence,

426
00:30:30,883 --> 00:30:32,643
when your third uncle descended,

427
00:30:32,643 --> 00:30:33,603
two entities

428
00:30:34,643 --> 00:30:35,643
formed a perfect match.

429
00:30:36,563 --> 00:30:37,442
Done blabbering?

430
00:30:37,643 --> 00:30:38,442
Yeah.

431
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:39,923
I'll follow your advice later.

432
00:30:40,123 --> 00:30:41,282
The moment I see Third Uncle,

433
00:30:41,282 --> 00:30:42,962
I'll splash dog blood in his face.

434
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:44,083
Good idea.

435
00:30:44,482 --> 00:30:45,563
I'm glad you heard me.

436
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:47,123
We're short on time.

437
00:30:47,282 --> 00:30:49,883
Let's rest more before moving out.

438
00:30:50,643 --> 00:30:51,482
Well...

439
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:52,643
You can stay.

440
00:30:53,442 --> 00:30:54,643
Let's rest a bit longer.

441
00:30:56,042 --> 00:30:57,163
We can spare some downtime.

442
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:00,083
Xiaoge?

443
00:31:03,843 --> 00:31:04,603
No.

444
00:31:05,403 --> 00:31:06,682
It's even narrower here.

445
00:31:08,123 --> 00:31:09,123
Even narrower?

446
00:31:14,643 --> 00:31:15,722
Unbelievable.

447
00:31:20,123 --> 00:31:21,363
I can't go on like this.

448
00:31:22,323 --> 00:31:23,563
How much farther?

449
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:26,042
I need a break.

450
00:31:27,522 --> 00:31:28,762
Xie Lianhuan must be part mole.

451
00:31:28,962 --> 00:31:30,202
Quit whining.

452
00:31:30,803 --> 00:31:31,923
Your whining's tiring me.

453
00:31:33,643 --> 00:31:34,522
I can't crawl anymore.

454
00:31:34,563 --> 00:31:35,323
My knees.

455
00:31:37,123 --> 00:31:38,843
My first life lesson
must've been a flop.

456
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:41,202
Xiaoge?

457
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:42,883
Xiaoge? Xiaoge?

458
00:31:42,883 --> 00:31:43,722
I can't do this.

459
00:31:43,722 --> 00:31:44,482
Me neither.

460
00:31:44,482 --> 00:31:45,962
- Let's rest.
- Okay.

461
00:31:52,522 --> 00:31:53,522
I'm exhausted.

462
00:31:56,242 --> 00:31:57,083
It's killing me.

463
00:31:57,442 --> 00:31:58,323
It smells fragrant.

464
00:31:58,603 --> 00:31:59,163
Yeah.

465
00:31:59,363 --> 00:32:00,403
Do you smell that?

466
00:32:01,202 --> 00:32:02,282
I smell my own body scent.

467
00:32:03,042 --> 00:32:04,363
My own body scent.

468
00:32:06,363 --> 00:32:07,962
Why am I so drowsy?

469
00:32:32,843 --> 00:32:34,083
Did I fall asleep?

470
00:32:45,282 --> 00:32:46,242
Xiaoge?

471
00:32:47,323 --> 00:32:48,323
