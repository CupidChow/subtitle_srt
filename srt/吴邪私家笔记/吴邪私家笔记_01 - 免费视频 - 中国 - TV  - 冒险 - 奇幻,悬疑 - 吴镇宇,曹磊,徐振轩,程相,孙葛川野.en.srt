1
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,880
(In ancient times,)

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,760
(a meteorite split into nine fragments
that fell to Earth.)

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,039
(Where meteorites fell,)

4
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,359
(all lifeforms
were contaminated by radiation,)

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,800
(transforming
into entirely new lifeforms.)

6
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,079
(In isolated environments,)

7
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,159
(they formed self-contained ecosystems.)

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,320
(Humanity)

9
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,320
(couldn't survive
within these ecological chains.)

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,920
(Ancient people considered this
divine revelation.)

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,600
(They constructed temples
to worship the meteorites.)

12
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,520
(But the meteorites' power)

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,399
(was too extraordinary.)

14
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,240
(Those who obtained them)

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,880
(sought to keep their existence secret.)

16
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,079
(Thus, they devised methods)

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,560
(to conceal the temples.)

18
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,799
(Yet these ecosystems)

19
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,359
(still exist worldwide,)

20
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,760
(awaiting new waves
of greedy opportunists)

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,560
(and unsuspecting trespassers.)

22
00:01:22,228 --> 00:01:26,656
(Dart Summit, Hezhou, 1920s)

23
00:01:36,627 --> 00:01:37,467
Well.

24
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,280
Now we're

25
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,599
in deep trouble.

26
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:44,560
(Old Smoker)
The soil's bloody.

27
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:48,000
(Young Wu Laogou)
There's a blood corpse down there.

28
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,359
If we mess this up,

29
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,040
everything we've got

30
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,319
will get buried below.

31
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:57,079
Yes or no? Just one word.

32
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,120
(Er Yazi)
Stop this nonsense.

33
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,560
(Beardy)
Respect your great-grandpa!

34
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,680
When he was tomb raiding,

35
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,799
you were still a fetus.

36
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,000
I wasn't wrong.

37
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,560
Our ancestors said

38
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,239
blood corpses bring good fortune.

39
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,319
Want to lose your head?

40
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,919
Your second great-uncle

41
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,439
dug up one of these
by South River earlier.

42
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,319
He's still crazy to this day.

43
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:22,039
No idea what cursed him.

44
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,199
Down or not? Decide now.

45
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,000
No more excuses.

46
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,599
When

47
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,919
the hole's ready,

48
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,199
I'll go first.

49
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,639
Er Yazi, bring up the rear
with the drag hoe.

50
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,439
San Yazi,

51
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:44,520
stay up here.

52
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,360
If we all go down,
there's no time to retreat.

53
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,120
Hold the drag hoe's tail up here.

54
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,680
When we shout from below,

55
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,759
pull it out immediately.

56
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,000
I don't want to stay.

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,840
I'm going down too.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,159
I'll dig right now.

59
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,639
You brat! Are you testing my patience?

60
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,759
Got a death wish?

61
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,719
Enough!

62
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,280
Boys, gear up.

63
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,360
Let's work.

64
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,319
I'll find you a golden blade down there.

65
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,319
Be good.

66
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,319
It's dangerous.

67
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,400
Er Yazi,

68
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,360
are you done?

69
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,400
Quiet.

70
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,600
Stay there and hold the rope tight.

71
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,360
Move quicker.

72
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,079
Try harder.

73
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,199
Quieter!

74
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,279
There is movement.

75
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:50,000
San Yazi!

76
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:51,719
Pull!

77
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,480
Poison!

78
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,519
It's poison!

79
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,560
San Yazi,

80
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,879
run!

81
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,240
Er Yazi?

(Wu Laogou's Notes)

84
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,840
(My name is Wu Xie.)

85
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,879
(The San Yazi from the story)

86
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,159
(was my grandfather.)

87
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:40,799
(He was a tomb raider in Hezhou.)

88
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,840
(He got his education after 1949)

89
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,559
(and recognized his past mistakes.)

90
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,919
(Wu Xie)
(To start anew,)

91
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,120
(he gave away his wealth,)

92
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,279
(married into Hangzhou,)

93
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,759
(and opened an antique shop.)

94
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,320
(My grandfather never told me)

95
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,519
(how he survived back then.)

96
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,840
(But that blood corpse he mentioned)

97
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,080
(was his poisoned second brother.)

98
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,679
(And the bizarre experiences)

99
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,840
(in his notes made me)

100
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,000
(believe)

101
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:17,440
(that there must be sides of him
I've never seen.)

102
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,240
Xie,

103
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,559
remember this.

104
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,919
The clever ones always claim
with confidence,

105
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,720
"See beyond mountains

106
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,120
and see beyond waters."

107
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,480
But

108
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,480
the truly remarkable people

109
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:35,360
see mountains as mountains

110
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:37,759
and water as water.

111
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,639
Fifth Master.

112
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:49,600
Alright.

113
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,759
Be careful.

114
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,120
How many times have I told you?

115
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,120
The things you did in the past

116
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:06,200
will become responsibilities

117
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,919
you'll carry in the days to come.

118
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,560
Just go.

119
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,120
I'll handle this matter.

120
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,440
Okay.

121
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:27,440
Xie.

122
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,840
(My grandfather spent his entire life)

123
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,120
(trying to resolve
the karmic consequences.)

124
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:40,600
(The accounts in this notebook
seem thrilling,)

125
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,759
(but they were shackles
to my grandfather)

126
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,440
(that bound him until his dying day.)

(Wushanju)

(As you can see,)

131
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:36,600
(to this day,)

132

134
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,800
(I've rarely)

135
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:43,720
(ventured beyond my doorstep.)

136
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:46,639
(When will my legendary life)

137
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,960
(finally begin?)

138
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:20,800
(Jin Wantang, 'Gold Tooth')

139
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:25,639
Do you accept rubbings here?

140
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,280
We do.

141
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,559
Prices aren't high.

142
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:35,279
Let me ask you something.

143
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:38,519
Do you have rubbings
of an ancient silk manuscript?

144
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:40,759
I mean the one from decades ago

145
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:42,559
that some tomb raiders
from Hezhou retrieved

146
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:45,080
but later got swindled out of.

147
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,039
You just said it was swindled out of.

148
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,559
How would I have it?

149
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:54,080
Besides, you should hunt for rubbings
at the market.

150
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,799
No one looks for a specific scroll.

151
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,240
I heard you have connections.

152
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,879
Lao Yang sent me.

153
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,120
I know the rules.

154
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,360
This is the token.

155
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,080
Fine, let's say Lao Yang sent you.

156
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:27,719
What do you want?

157
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,559
I'm not here

158
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:30,960
to see you.

159
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,840
I came to meet your grandfather.

160
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:37,159
Didn't he once dig for treasures?

161
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:40,120
What's your game?

162
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,879
No games.

163
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:44,399
I just want to ask

164
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:46,879
if your grandfather has kept

165
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:48,440
one or two rubbings

166
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,000
of the silk manuscript

167
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,279
retrieved from Dart Summit in Hezhou.

168
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,239
Wang Meng,

169
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,399
see him out.

170
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:56,919
What's this about?

171
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:57,799
We had a good chat.

172
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,200
Why are you throwing me out?

173
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,040
Please leave now.

174
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:03,320
At least check out what I brought.

175
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,080
I've brought it.

176
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,440
Just take one glance, won't you?

177
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,280
Wang Meng.

178
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,200
Just do it for Lao Yang's sake.

179
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,920
Fine.

180
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:16,480
For Lao Yang's sake.

181
00:15:16,755 --> 00:15:18,080
(Ancient silk manuscript's rubbing)

182
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,399
Take a look.

183
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,600
It's a photocopy?

184
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:27,240
You're no amateur.

185
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,440
Who carries real treasures

186
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,759
around the streets?

187
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,240
They'd crumble to dust.

188
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:36,360
Besides, every trade has its own ways.

189
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,600
Your grandfather was too young

190
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,360
when he started tomb raiding,

191
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,840
which broke the rules.

192
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:52,480
This thing

193
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,960
is well-preserved,

194
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,000
but

195
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:56,479
it's a fake.

196
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,879
A fake?

197
00:15:58,519 --> 00:15:59,759
That can't be.

198
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,559
Anyway, I can't verify it.

199
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,200
Go find another expert.

200
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,040
Wait.

201
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,960
Does this match
what your grandfather saw

202
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,000
back then?

203
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,919
Let me be honest.

204
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:13,519
My grandfather was illiterate back then.

205
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,000
He couldn't read this.

206
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,240
I can't tell you.

207
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:17,639
What a coincidence.

208
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,360
Yes, indeed.

209
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,320
Seems like there's really no hope left.

210
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,279
Right.

211
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,399
Got it.

212
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:36,639
Collecting ancient texts
is complicated business.

213
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,559
You shouldn't get too greedy.

214
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,320
Young man,

215
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:41,559
see you around.

216
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,879
See you around.

217
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,600
I'm leaving.

218
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,440
See you.

219
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:11,920
Wang Meng,

220
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,760
the camera.

221
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:21,960
You left something.

222
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,160
Thank you.

223
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:26,680
We'll meet again.

224
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,640
(Wushanju)
(Little did I know then)

225
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:36,519
(that his appearance
would change my entire life.)

226
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,079
(This silk manuscript)

227
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,839
(resembles the one
my grandfather had then.)

228
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,799
(I'm almost certain)

229
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,240
(they're part of the same set.)

230
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:04,440
(My gut tells me)

231
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,000
(Third Uncle)
(this silk manuscript holds secrets.)

232
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,920
(I plan to ask Third Uncle.)

233
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:11,759
(In our family,)

234
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,599
(only he inherited Grandpa's skills.)

235
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:15,559
(In many ways,)

236
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:17,480
(he's even better than Grandpa was.)

237
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:20,160
(People outside call him Third Master.)

238
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,440
(Due to business reasons,)

239
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:25,640
(Third Uncle usually responds
to phone calls promptly.)

240
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:27,720
(But there's always a day or two,)

241
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:29,279
(like today,)

242
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,960
(when he becomes totally unreachable,)

243
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,559
(as if he's vanished.)

244
00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:08,113
(Wu Sanxing)

245
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:24,720
(Third Uncle)
Nine o'clock.

246
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,880
(Good stuff. Come quick.)
Chicken-eye yellow sand.

247
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,080
Dragon's Spine.

248
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,280
Come quick.

249
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,839
(Many years later,)

250
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,240
(I would recall)

251
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:41,400
(that from the moment I brought)

252
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,119
(the manuscript to Third Uncle,)

253
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,279
(my life)

254
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,480
(would undergo earth-shaking changes.)

255
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,960
Third Uncle,

256
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,440
why didn't you wait for me?

257
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,480
Your junk food's all ready.

258
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,320
Hurry up.

259
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,519
Can you eat now?

260
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:54,880
You left me dinner,

261
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,119
not Dragon's Spine?

262
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,839
Fine.

263
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,720
It's not the first time anyway.

264
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,960
You trick me every time.

265
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,319
To you,

266
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:07,359
that thing is similar to Dragon's Spine.

267
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,839
There'll be new good stuff tomorrow.

268
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:10,559
Eat first.

269
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,359
Really?

270
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:14,279
Tomorrow's stuff
will be three times better.

271
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:17,759
Just eat your junk.

272
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:18,799
Such a feast.

273
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:19,759
I wonder

274
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,440
why anyone would eat the junk.

275
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,799
Third Uncle,

276
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:29,240
why wouldn't you hold
that good stuff longer for me?

277
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,559
What stuff?

278
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,000
Dragon's Spine.

279
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,920
I took one look at its shape

280
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:38,160
and knew roughly what was inside.

281
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,759
An ancient weapon.

282
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:43,599
Right?

283
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,960
But strangely enough,

284
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:51,000
the person who bought Dragon's Spine

285
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,279
didn't look very old.

286
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,359
What's his background?

287
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,920
So wealthy.

288
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,319
Must be some rich kid.

289
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,039
Don't you know the rules?

290
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,079
Don't ask about missed treasures.

291
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,920
If you missed it, you missed it.

292
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,839
Take the loss.

293
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:04,679
Understand?

294
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:07,279
I don't even want that thing.

295
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:08,920
What I encountered today

296
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,680
was way more impressive than yours.

297
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,160
It's literally
the most bizarre thing I've seen

298
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,440
since entering this trade.

299
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,279
More bizarre than what you're eating?

300
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,039
About the same.

301
00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:19,079
Try some.

302
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:19,599
Get lost.

303
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:20,640
Stop bothering me.

304
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,160
Come on, take one.

305
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:23,440
It's delicious.

306
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,960
Get me a tissue.

307
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,519
This is dog food.

308
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:37,640
Don't waste it.

309
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,880
Shut up.

310
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,720
What exactly are you here for?

311
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,720
Out with it.

312
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,519
Actually,

313
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:46,039
this afternoon,

314
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:47,960
a strange old man came to my shop.

315
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:49,440
He had a gold tooth.

316
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,559
He wanted me
to check out this silk manuscript.

317
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:54,000
Truth is,

318
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,880
he wanted to see Grandpa's manuscript.

319
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,599
I compared them.

320
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:59,440
It resembles the one in Grandpa's notes.

321
00:23:01,843 --> 00:23:03,808
(Ancient silk manuscript's rubbing)

322
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,519
Look, Third Uncle.

323
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:09,480
Your expression changed.

324
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,880
Are you feeling
a little stirred up inside?

325
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:15,759
Third Uncle.

326
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:17,119
Third Uncle.

327
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:20,359
Release your inner passion.

328
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:21,959
Get lost.

329
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:25,240
Doesn't this look like a fox to you?

330
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:26,599
An ancient silk manuscript

331
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,440
is worthless

332
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,920
unless it's a unique copy.

333
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:30,959
Understand?

334
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:31,759
Take it.

335
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:32,599
Wait.

336
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,960
I only understand parts of it.

337
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:36,599
It mentions

338
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:39,839
a feudal lord from Lu State

339
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,759
and records some events from his life.

340
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,160
Keep going.

341
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,000
Come on.

342
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,880
It says

343
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:50,079
he possessed a Gui Seal.

344
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:53,359
(This Gui Seal)

345
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,119
(could command a special army.)

346
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,839
(That army's soldiers
only moved at night)

347
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,680
(and had unusual physiques.)

348
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:05,720
(They left)

349
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,640
(no footprints wherever they walked.)

350
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:13,240
(Third Uncle, this is made up, right?)

351
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,640
(Even fiction has real-world origins.)

352
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,160
Something still feels off.

353
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,920
This silk manuscript is strange.

354
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,759
Not the legend itself.

355
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:28,599
No footprints? Easy to explain.

356
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,400
A broom tied behind one's waist
could do that.

357
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,240
What's strange is,

358
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,160
at first glance
of this fox-face pattern,

359
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,440
it looks like a stain.

360
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,960
But if it were a stain,

361
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,680
how could it look so vivid
and three-dimensional?

362
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,720
Maybe someone intentionally painted it?

363
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,880
But why would they

364
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,480
disguise it as a stain?

365
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,359
To hide something?

366
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,640
Not bad.

367
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:54,720
You're observant.

368
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,400
But your knowledge is lacking.

369
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,160
I've repeatedly invited you here

370
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,920
to learn from me, but you refuse.

371
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,640
Now you can't decipher it.

372
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,440
This is a map.

373
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,480
A map?

374
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,320
Yes.

375
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,759
The ancients called it

376
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,559
the Eight-Array Diagram

377
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:16,200
or Pictorial Text.

378
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:17,920
It encodes a location's

379
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,400
exact geographical details

380
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,119
through special syntax,

381
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,000
disguised as a legend

382
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,440
but packed with information.

383
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:29,400
Frankly, besides me,

384
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:31,759
fewer than five people worldwide
can read this.

385
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,880
So you're saying,

386
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,640
find a specific spot,

387
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,119
turn left,

388
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,720
then right until a tree,

389
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,480
go straight, then right,

390
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,319
find a well,

391
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:45,000
and jump in?

392
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,359
Exactly.

393
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:47,839
That's what it means.

394
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:49,359
Just jump in when finding a well.

395
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,319
That well's reserved for you.

396
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,880
What now?

397
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:56,279
I don't know how.

398
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:57,400
No one's born knowing this.

399
00:25:58,759 --> 00:25:59,599
Fine.

400
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,160
I'll explain it to you now.

401
00:26:03,315 --> 00:26:04,768
(Study of Stars)

402
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:07,880
(Each of these symbols)

403
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,880
(represents a different star.)

404
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,559
(But more importantly,)

405
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:13,559
(they can form)

406
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,839
(hundreds of combinations.)

407
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,400
(Let's take this set of symbols
as an example.)

408
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,000
(By connecting these stars)

409
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:24,960
(we can create a topographic map.)

410
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,240
(By combining layers
of topographic maps,)

411
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,960
(the area indicated by the final map
progressively shrinks)

412
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:33,279
(and becomes more specific.)

413
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,440
It's actually very simple.

414
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:36,599
Got it?

415
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:38,759
Such a complex map.

416
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,559
Where exactly does it point?

417
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,799
And this manuscript is clearly a fake.

418
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,400
Though it's a fake,

419
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,119
its contents might still be genuine.

420
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:47,400
I'll look into it.

421
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:48,680
Third Uncle,

422
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,039
I understand now.

423
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:53,119
You're saying someone deliberately

424
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:54,400
created this map

425
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:55,960
and recorded the story of Lu State?

426
00:26:56,759 --> 00:26:57,640
Third Uncle,

427
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,119
you're so interested.

428
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,119
Do you want
to visit the map's marked spot?

429
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,160
Third Uncle,

430
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,000
this is exactly like

431
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,119
the opening scene
of Raiders of the Lost Ark.

432
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:07,439
Third Uncle,

433
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,400
let me go with you, okay?

434
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,599
I want to join you

435
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:13,160
in embarking on this journey.

436
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,640
You can come.

437
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:16,960
I see no problem.

438
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,680
Let's call your dad first, alright?

439
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:23,079
If he agrees, anything goes.

440
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:26,839
Never mind. Forget it.

441
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:27,640
Third Uncle,

442
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,000
no need to involve my dad.

443
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:30,359
Think carefully, Third Uncle.

444
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:31,440
I'm old enough now

445
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,920
to go out and see the world.

446
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,400
Take me with you.

447
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,079
I'll obey you...

448
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:35,919
Listen to me.

449
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,119
Call your dad first.

450
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:38,799
If he approves, I'll take you.

451
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,680
Let's see if he'll break your legs.

452
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:43,000
How will you walk without legs?

453
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,720
Come on.

454
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,759
Want me to call him?

455
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:46,839
If I say Wu Xie wants to go with me,

456
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,200
he'll come to break your legs.

457
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,040
If you won't take me,

458
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:50,279
then stop reading it.

459
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,359
Where are you?

460
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:11,119
There's a lead on that earlier matter.

461
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,400
I need your help.

462
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:18,160
(Third Uncle will definitely
call me back.)

463
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,960
(The map's still with me.)

464
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:22,240
(He can't possibly not call me back.)

465
00:28:37,428 --> 00:28:42,624
(Web Article:
How to Capture a Man's Heart.)

466
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,039
(He's really not calling me back?)

467
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:47,480
(Could he have memorized the whole map?)

468
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,040
Third Uncle.

469
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:01,759
Third Uncle.

470
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:02,519
Third Uncle,

471
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:03,880
long time no see.

472
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,080
Well,

473
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,640
Third Uncle,

474
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,960
I've always felt in this family,

475
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,640
you're the one who understands me best.

476
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:10,359
When you were young,

477
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:11,759
you defied the family's objections

478
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:13,039
to pursue what you wanted too.

479
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,079
The world belongs
to the brave and visionary

480
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:16,680
who pursue and explore.

481
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:18,159
I know

482
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,079
your care and love for me are boundless.

483
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:22,319
You taught me

484
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:24,519
about the vastness of this world.

485
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,319
Third Uncle,

486
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:28,319
please take me with you.

487
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,240
Third Uncle.

488
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,480
Where'd you get this act?

489
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,559
How long did you rehearse?

490
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,720
Jane Eyre.

491
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,880
Then go home. Won't walk you out.

492
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,960
Wait, Third Uncle,

493
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,839
I'm begging you.

494
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,960
Let's get to the point.

495
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,720
Okay?

496
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,079
Anyway, the map's in my hands.

497
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:41,880
You can't memorize

498
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,559
hundreds of symbols
even with your memory.

499
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,519
You're resourceful,

500
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:45,640
and I can't outsmart you.

501
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,240
But if you won't take me,

502
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,359
I'll tear it up.

503
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,079
We'll go our separate ways then.

504
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,480
Threatening me now?

505
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,039
Where'd you get this?

506
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,039
Think it over carefully.

507
00:29:59,039 --> 00:29:59,839
Wait.

508
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,240
Third Uncle. Third Uncle.

509
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,280
Third Uncle.

510
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:06,399
What's wrong?

511
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,920
You've already contacted Gold Tooth?

512
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:12,039
In the antique circle,

513
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,880
you can't survive
without some shrewdness.

514
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:16,359
Someone like you

515
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,519
will squander our family fortune
sooner or later.

516
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,880
About Gold Tooth,

517
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,079
his real name is Jin Wantang.

518
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:33,160
He's not the original owner
of this item.

519
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,599
The owner of this silk manuscript
is surnamed Ma.

520
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,160
He's a famous antique dealer.

521
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:40,799
(Five years ago,)

522
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,519
(he suddenly disappeared
without a trace.)

523
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,160
(Everything started
with this manuscript.)

524
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:47,160
(While acquiring artifacts,)

525
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,000
(he unexpectedly found this manuscript)

526
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,400
(in a northwest peasant household.)

527
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,559
(He must have realized)

528
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,359
(this manuscript was actually a map.)

529
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,160
(So he began studying it day and night.)

530
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,319
(Ma studied it for ten full years)

531
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:02,960
(before finally deciphering the map.)

532
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,599
(Then he spent a fortune)

533
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,960
(hiring top-tier outdoor experts.)

534
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:10,200
(But shortly after departure,)

535
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,160
(the entire team lost contact.)

536
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:18,960
(His wife only knew he went)

537
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,960
(to the location marked on the map.)

538
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,200
(Though not knowing the exact spot,)

539
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,680
(she knew
it must be extremely dangerous.)

540
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:32,200
(She kept spending money
searching for her husband)

541
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,759
(for five whole years)

542
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,279
(without finding any clues.)

543
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:37,920
(Gold Tooth)

544
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,079
(was also hired by Ma's wife.)

545
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:41,759
(He has some real skills.)

546
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,279
He discovered this manuscript originally

547
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,319
was in your grandfather's possession.

548
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:47,359
Believing your grandfather

549
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:48,720
could definitely decipher the map,

550
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,759
he approached you.

551
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:53,039
Third Uncle,

552
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,359
I was only gone for a moment,

553
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:57,400
and you've gathered
all this information?

554
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,799
Don't tell me

555
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,119
you've already taken Ma's job?

556
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,839
Do you know

557
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:10,720
how much he offered?

558
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,240
How much?

559
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,119
This much?

560
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:17,599
Third Uncle,

561
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,279
if you go,

562
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:21,480
you can't go alone, right?

563
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:24,640
Then why tell me all this?

564
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,359
Are you taking me too?

565
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:29,599
Why?

566
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,039
Give me one good reason to take you.

567
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,000
I

568
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:37,960
could probably

569
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,200
help carry some equipment.

570
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,680
Alright.

571
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,240
Our basic equipment

572
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,920
starts at

573
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,279
fifty kilograms minimum.

574
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,559
Two people means a hundred kilos.

575
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,480
But

576
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,559
I need two more team members.

577
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:53,960
Four people
means two hundred kilos total.

578
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,240
Who will you carry for?

579
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,319
Will you carry mine?

580
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:59,319
Your own gear too, right?

581
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:01,119
Can you handle a hundred kilos?

582
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,359
Enough.

583
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,839
Just say you don't want me to go.

584
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,880
Fine, I'm leaving.

585
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,480
My shop opens tomorrow.

586
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:10,679
Bye.

587
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,559
Leaving so soon?

588
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:31,839
As a Wu,

589
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,519
you gave up so easily?

590
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,799
Seems like

591
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:38,599
you didn't really want to go anyway.

592
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:41,519
What do you mean?

593
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:44,200
You'll take me?

594
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:49,200
Your dad agreed.

595
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,599
This is a search mission.

596
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:55,920
He says it's relatively safe.

597
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:57,960
I don't want our family's only heir

598
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,200
to miss out on adventuring.

599
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,480
But this is the last time.

600
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,000
Your coming with me

601
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,119
is better than your sneaking off alone.

602
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,360
Two things before departure.

603
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:11,999
First,

604
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,440
crack the code.

605
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,559
Second,

606
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,199
recruit two more members.

607
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,159
Got headshotted again.

608
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,192
He sees through walls?

609
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,240
He's cheating?

610
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,960
Who is it? Who's cheating?

611
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,239
That guy over there.

612
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,159
Bro, that brat's definitely cheating.

613
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,079
He's won ten rounds,
making us look idiotic!

614
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,800
That brat.

615
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:02,519
Buddy,

616
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:04,639
having fun?

617
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,320
You're a cheater, right?

618
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,639
Say something!

619
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,000
You think you're the boss here?

620
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,079
When someone talks to you,

621
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:22,760
you should respond properly.

622
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:25,559
Didn't your mother
teach you any manners?

623
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:28,559
Stop looking at me!

624
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:49,559
Your phone.

625
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:52,352
(Wu Sanxing: Got a job. Come quick.)

626
00:35:55,731 --> 00:35:58,239
(Xingao Internet Cafe)

627
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,079
How are you?

628
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:00,519
Are you guys okay?

629
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,760
Ma'am,

630
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,760
don't cry.

631
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,440
Hello, doctor.

632
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:07,880
Thank you for your hard work.

633
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,760
Wait.

634
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,760
I wanted a 20 yuan discount
on the nursing fee.

635
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,960
Is crying really necessary?

636
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,280
When doing business,

637
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,719
there's always some haggling.

638
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,679
No 20-yuan discount anymore.

639
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:25,400
Okay?

640
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,239
Okay?

641
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:27,079
Stop crying.

642
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:29,800
How about ten?

643
00:36:42,227 --> 00:36:47,744
(Third Master: Got a job. Come quick.)

644
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,320
Stop crying.

645
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,119
Stop it!

646
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,960
I'll raise it by 20.

647
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,880
50?

648
00:36:58,519 --> 00:36:59,760
Take good care of my mom.

649
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,039
You have my word.

650
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:19,360
(The helpers Third Uncle
found this time)

651
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,280
(are familiar to me.)

652
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,679
(This is Pan Zi,)

653
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,320
(Third Uncle's
longest-serving subordinate.)

654
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,239
(When Third Uncle audits accounts,)

655
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:29,800
(he always brings Pan Zi.)

656
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:31,159
(With him present,)

657
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,920
(no debt goes uncollected.)

658
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:36,239
(In my memory,
anything Third Uncle demanded,)

659
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:37,880
(he could always deliver.)

660
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:40,159
(Though fierce to others)

661
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:41,840
(and feared by everyone,)

662
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:43,079
(he's kind to me.)

663
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:43,960
Young Third Master.

664
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,679
(He's taken me everywhere
since childhood.)

665
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,719
(This is Da Kui.)

666
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,079
(His strength is legendary.)

667
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,000
(He can kill an ox with one punch.)

668
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,000
(He operates without principles.)

669
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,280
(Except toward Third Uncle,)

670
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,360
(for others, payment alone)

671
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,000
(can make him work against allies.)

672
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,320
(He's even double-dealing.)

673
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:11,719
(I never trusted his integrity.)

674
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:12,719
(Until he retorted,)

675
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,639
("Can integrity save my mother's life?")

676
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:16,599
(That's when I knew)

677
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:18,079
(his mother was critically ill)

678
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,159
(and he needed a lot of money.)

679
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,120
Hello.

680
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:22,519
Third Master.

681
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:23,480
Sharper than ever.

682
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,760
- Third Master.
- Bulked up.

683
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,679
I got a new liquor.

684
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,640
We'll try it later.

685
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,800
This time we're retrieving one person.

686
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:30,440
The client's paying eight million.

687
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:31,760
We'll split it.

688
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:35,440
But here's the thing.

689
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,079
About where we're going,

690
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,800
I don't know yet.

691
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,840
First, we need to decipher this map.

692
00:38:44,499 --> 00:38:48,156
(Ancient silk manuscript's rubbing)

693
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,880
(Kulou 10.)

694
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,079
(Zhu 8.)

695
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,800
(Beihe 1?)

696
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,639
Any progress?

697
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:08,479
Got it.

698
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:11,880
(These symbols form
an ancient Lu State terrain map.)

699
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,239
(Refine further.)

700
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,159
(Jiuqi 2.)

701
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:18,639
(Tianlao...)

702
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,920
(Sangong 1.)

703
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,400
(And five fuxi stars.)

704
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:31,239
Let me see.

705
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,800
It matches.

706
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:38,760
(It's Quling County
within ancient Lu territory.)

707
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:45,039
Young Third Master,

708
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:46,239
let me look again.

709
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,600
This?

710
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:49,519
Right.

711
00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:51,199
Look.

712
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:53,519
(The place called Hechuan in Quling.)

713
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:55,440
It looks like the star map.

714
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,079
Right.

715
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,039
There's hope.

716
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,519
Come on.

717
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:15,840
(Hechuan corresponds
to present-day Pengzhou.)

718
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,920
(We're almost there.)

719
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:20,119
(This shows mountain ranges.)

720
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:22,079
(This depicts rivers.)

721
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:24,559
(Stack them all together.)

722
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,760
A bit over here.

723
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:35,400
(They match.)

724
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,840
(The map's center points
to an underground cave.)

725
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,480
Let's go to Pengzhou first.

726
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,680
(We leave tomorrow.)

727
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:55,079
(We drank heavily that night.)

728
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:57,239
(I was in a daze.)

729
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:59,280
(Everything felt surreal.)

730
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,119
(I thought I'd seized this opportunity.)

731
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,159
(Am I right, Grandpa?)

732
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:21,440
