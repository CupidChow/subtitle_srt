3
00:01:45,168 --> 00:01:46,407
Don't move, both of you!

4
00:01:58,207 --> 00:01:59,088
Get up!

5
00:02:03,024 --> 00:02:04,112
Fall back to the entrance!

6
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:09,048
No way! There's too many!

7
00:02:09,048 --> 00:02:09,967
Fall back!

8
00:02:12,687 --> 00:02:13,967
Any more instant-fire straws?

9
00:02:14,288 --> 00:02:15,288
They're in my bag.

10
00:02:15,288 --> 00:02:16,087
Get them quick!

11
00:02:16,728 --> 00:02:17,527
I'll get them.

12
00:02:17,687 --> 00:02:18,568
Which bag?

13
00:02:18,687 --> 00:02:19,687
On the top!

14
00:02:20,647 --> 00:02:21,687
Found them yet?

15
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:23,647
What are all these?

16
00:02:24,807 --> 00:02:25,927
Got it!

17
00:02:25,927 --> 00:02:27,128
Here!

18
00:02:31,487 --> 00:02:32,927
Hurry! Fall back to the entrance!

19
00:02:34,807 --> 00:02:35,608
No good! No good!

20
00:02:35,608 --> 00:02:36,608
Go back! Go back!

21
00:02:36,608 --> 00:02:37,527
Too many!

22
00:02:37,582 --> 00:02:38,832
They're all coming this way!

23
00:02:39,207 --> 00:02:40,128
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:40,288 --> 00:02:41,487
Sorry, guys.

25
00:02:41,487 --> 00:02:42,848
I got you into trouble this time.

26
00:02:44,008 --> 00:02:45,087
But I truly didn't expect

27
00:02:45,087 --> 00:02:46,207
such a way to die.

28
00:02:47,008 --> 00:02:48,168
Think of something!

29
00:02:48,487 --> 00:02:49,247
Move aside!

30
00:03:04,408 --> 00:03:05,008
Go! Quickly!

31
00:03:05,008 --> 00:03:05,608
Move! Hurry!

32
00:03:05,608 --> 00:03:06,408
Fall back now!

33
00:03:17,687 --> 00:03:18,328
Hurry!

34
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:19,328
Get over here!

35
00:03:20,048 --> 00:03:21,527
Quick! Give me your hand!

36
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:26,967
My butt! My butt!

37
00:03:27,168 --> 00:03:28,247
Don't bite my butt!

38
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:29,967
Stop shaking!

39
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:31,687
Hold on!

40
00:03:42,736 --> 00:03:43,472
Come on!

41
00:03:44,752 --> 00:03:45,328
Come on!

42
00:03:58,168 --> 00:03:58,848
Bro!

43
00:03:59,247 --> 00:04:00,367
Get up quick, bro!

44
00:04:06,008 --> 00:04:06,527
Bro!

45
00:04:06,527 --> 00:04:07,848
Pan Zi! Pan Zi!

46
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:10,008
Pan Zi! I'm coming for you!

47
00:04:10,448 --> 00:04:11,487
Don't stop me!

48
00:04:11,487 --> 00:04:12,328
Let go!

49
00:04:12,608 --> 00:04:13,807
Don't come down!

50
00:04:14,848 --> 00:04:16,848
- Pan Zi!
- Leave now!

51
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,127
Pan Zi! Pan Zi!

52
00:04:22,088 --> 00:04:23,208
Pan Zi!

53
00:04:24,288 --> 00:04:25,567
Going down won't help.

54
00:04:25,567 --> 00:04:26,288
Pan Zi!

55
00:04:28,127 --> 00:04:29,927
Just finish me off.

56
00:05:09,528 --> 00:05:10,367
He's alive.

57
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:12,048
The corpse beetles fear him.

58
00:05:12,048 --> 00:05:12,968
He's alive.

59
00:05:14,408 --> 00:05:15,247
Well...

60
00:05:15,447 --> 00:05:17,168
Who is this guy anyway?

61
00:05:17,768 --> 00:05:19,487
The beetles actually fled.

62
00:05:28,687 --> 00:05:29,567
Are you okay?

63
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:30,327
Are you okay?

64
00:05:30,327 --> 00:05:31,168
- Pan Zi.
- Bro.

65
00:05:31,408 --> 00:05:32,127
I'm fine.

66
00:05:32,648 --> 00:05:33,288
Pan Zi.

67
00:05:33,447 --> 00:05:34,927
Move. It's coming.

68
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:35,968
Okay.

69
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:41,608
Let's go.

70
00:05:43,048 --> 00:05:44,528
What's chasing us?

71
00:05:44,624 --> 00:05:45,648
The thing from the kiln.

72
00:05:45,648 --> 00:05:46,447
What?

73
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:47,927
The kiln creature is coming?

74
00:05:47,927 --> 00:05:49,088
No time for questions.

75
00:05:49,327 --> 00:05:50,168
Just run.

76
00:05:50,608 --> 00:05:51,728
Hang on, bro.

77
00:05:52,007 --> 00:05:53,168
We need to get out fast.

78
00:05:53,327 --> 00:05:55,327
If that thing catches us,
we're done for.

79
00:05:58,567 --> 00:05:59,487
Put him down.

80
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,048
Careful.

81
00:06:02,608 --> 00:06:03,367
Pan Zi.

82
00:06:04,088 --> 00:06:04,927
Pan Zi.

83
00:06:09,848 --> 00:06:10,807
I'm sorry.

84
00:06:16,327 --> 00:06:17,208
It's fine.

85
00:06:25,608 --> 00:06:26,447
Step aside.

86
00:06:40,487 --> 00:06:41,567
Help me hold him down.

87
00:06:45,168 --> 00:06:46,288
Sorry about this, bro.

88
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:48,408
Try to bear it.

89
00:06:52,048 --> 00:06:52,968
What are you doing?

90
00:06:57,447 --> 00:06:59,247
One crawled into his stomach.

91
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:01,127
If we don't remove it,

92
00:07:01,408 --> 00:07:02,327
he'll die.

93
00:07:04,848 --> 00:07:06,288
His actions just now

94
00:07:06,288 --> 00:07:07,608
have proven his capability.

95
00:07:07,608 --> 00:07:08,887
Trusting him is our best bet.

96
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:22,768
Pan Zi.

97
00:07:23,127 --> 00:07:23,848
Pan Zi.

98
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:29,848
Eat this.

99
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:30,848
It'll help you.

100
00:07:34,327 --> 00:07:35,088
Listen.

101
00:07:35,927 --> 00:07:37,136
This wound's pretty deep.

102
00:07:37,136 --> 00:07:38,807
If not disinfected, it'll get infected.

103
00:07:38,807 --> 00:07:39,848
I've got a flare here.

104
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:41,168
Let's follow the movies' example

105
00:07:41,608 --> 00:07:43,247
and cauterize his wound.

106
00:07:43,247 --> 00:07:44,048
How's that?

107
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,088
You fool!

108
00:07:45,687 --> 00:07:47,487
Are you trying to kill me?

109
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,288
Flares contain phosphorus.

110
00:07:49,288 --> 00:07:50,447
Don't you know anything?

111
00:07:50,447 --> 00:07:51,447
Not bad.

112
00:07:51,648 --> 00:07:52,768
Not an amateur, huh?

113
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:54,608
I was just kidding.

114
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:55,728
Trying to make you relax.

115
00:07:56,168 --> 00:07:56,687
Come on.

116
00:07:56,687 --> 00:07:57,447
I've got bandages.

117
00:07:57,447 --> 00:07:58,447
Wrap it tight first.

118
00:07:58,447 --> 00:07:59,327
Hang in there.

119
00:07:59,848 --> 00:08:01,327
It's a bit dirty.

120
00:08:01,327 --> 00:08:02,887
But survival comes first.

121
00:08:02,887 --> 00:08:03,768
Who are you?

122
00:08:03,768 --> 00:08:06,048
Not the time for identity crises.

123
00:08:06,048 --> 00:08:07,088
We just survived together.

124
00:08:07,088 --> 00:08:08,127
Why would I hurt you now?

125
00:08:08,127 --> 00:08:09,687
He saved my life, after all.

126
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,528
This wound is too deep.

127
00:08:11,608 --> 00:08:13,408
We need to tie it tight,
or you'll bleed out.

128
00:08:13,408 --> 00:08:15,088
You tore my shirt apart.

129
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:16,367
Hang in there.

130
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:17,567
How's that feel?

131
00:08:17,807 --> 00:08:19,327
Enjoying the C-section vibes?

132
00:08:24,528 --> 00:08:25,687
Is that a dinosaur roar?

133
00:08:26,768 --> 00:08:27,807
Shut off the flashlight.

134
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:35,607
What's that?

135
00:08:44,447 --> 00:08:45,488
Help him up.

136
00:08:47,368 --> 00:08:48,288
I recognize that sound.

137
00:08:48,447 --> 00:08:49,727
That thing is coming again.

138
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:50,768
Right?

139
00:08:54,807 --> 00:08:55,528
Run!

140
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,528
Go.

141
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:57,248
Fell again.

142
00:09:58,368 --> 00:10:00,727
Too many trap floors here.

143
00:10:02,248 --> 00:10:03,168
We need to be careful.

144
00:10:03,488 --> 00:10:04,847
No more reckless running.

145
00:10:05,048 --> 00:10:05,807
Pan Zi.

146
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,327
Pan Zi, are you okay?

147
00:10:07,327 --> 00:10:08,128
Pan Zi.

148
00:10:13,408 --> 00:10:14,727
Came back down the same hole?

149
00:10:21,727 --> 00:10:22,447
No.

150
00:10:29,607 --> 00:10:30,368
Not here.

151
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,168
No doors here.

152
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,128
Nor that hole.

153
00:10:35,847 --> 00:10:37,168
Are those beetles still around?

154
00:10:37,687 --> 00:10:38,727
With Xiaoge here,

155
00:10:38,727 --> 00:10:39,967
we shouldn't worry about them.

156
00:10:40,087 --> 00:10:41,087
Right, Xiaoge?

157
00:10:43,927 --> 00:10:44,727
Where's Xiaoge?

158
00:10:46,807 --> 00:10:47,648
Did he

159
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:48,847
get separated?

160
00:10:50,648 --> 00:10:51,607
He

161
00:10:52,368 --> 00:10:54,248
wouldn't fall like we did.

162
00:10:55,528 --> 00:10:56,447
He's alone.

163
00:10:56,607 --> 00:10:57,528
He'll be okay, right?

164
00:10:59,648 --> 00:11:00,967
Listen, kid.

165
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:03,607
Stop worrying about Xiaoge.

166
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:04,807
He's unstoppable.

167
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:06,168
Our worry's wasted on him.

168
00:11:06,768 --> 00:11:08,768
We can't handle that thing anyway.

169
00:11:09,327 --> 00:11:10,288
Better stay put

170
00:11:10,288 --> 00:11:11,727
and not hold him back.

171
00:11:12,847 --> 00:11:14,648
All the tunnels here are blocked.

172
00:11:15,368 --> 00:11:17,128
Let's rest here for now.

173
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:20,567
Who exactly are you?

174
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:23,567
Are you here for Ma's crew too?

175
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:26,048
His wife hired two teams.

176
00:11:26,447 --> 00:11:27,168
What?

177
00:11:27,648 --> 00:11:28,927
Think you're the only hires?

178
00:11:30,888 --> 00:11:33,288
Mrs. Ma sure cast a wide net.

179
00:11:41,807 --> 00:11:43,008
Let me introduce myself.

180
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:44,927
My surname is Wang.

181
00:11:45,168 --> 00:11:46,207
Call me Wang Pangzi.

182
00:11:46,928 --> 00:11:48,567
I rushed out
and forgot my business card.

183
00:11:50,847 --> 00:11:53,607
I'm famous in exploration circles.

184
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:55,128
Since destiny wills it,

185
00:11:55,128 --> 00:11:56,967
let's team up on this job.

186
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,368
I don't team up with outsiders.

187
00:11:59,288 --> 00:12:01,927
Once teamed up, we're not outsiders

188
00:12:03,888 --> 00:12:05,447
I'll show good faith first.

189
00:12:06,248 --> 00:12:09,008
Do you know where this place is?

190
00:12:10,288 --> 00:12:11,368
Isn't this just...

191
00:12:11,368 --> 00:12:12,288
Where is this place?

192
00:12:13,207 --> 00:12:14,368
This was built by the ruler

193
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:16,327
specifically for King Shang of Lu.

194
00:12:17,207 --> 00:12:18,207
Keep talking.

195
00:12:19,087 --> 00:12:19,967
Take a guess.

196
00:12:20,488 --> 00:12:22,607
Why would the ruler build this

197
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:23,504
for a mere warlord?

198
00:12:23,504 --> 00:12:25,128
Because he could summon ghost soldiers.

199
00:12:25,368 --> 00:12:26,048
Right,

200
00:12:26,248 --> 00:12:27,368
but not entirely.

201
00:12:28,607 --> 00:12:29,528
I'm telling you.

202
00:12:29,847 --> 00:12:31,727
This so-called King Shang of Lu

203
00:12:32,008 --> 00:12:34,288
and borrowing ghost soldiers

204
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:36,447
are actually colossal lies.

205
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:40,648
As for the mysteries
hidden in this kiln,

206
00:12:41,048 --> 00:12:42,648
if I don't tell you,

207
00:12:44,207 --> 00:12:46,087
you'll never figure them out.

208
00:12:46,288 --> 00:12:48,528
Do you know
what King Shang of Lu really did?

209
00:12:48,528 --> 00:12:50,727
Do you know how
'borrowing ghost soldiers' worked?

210
00:12:50,888 --> 00:12:53,008
Do you know
what this Gui Seal is used for?

211
00:12:56,368 --> 00:12:57,768
King Shang of Lu

212
00:12:58,087 --> 00:13:00,567
sounded fancy as a general,

213
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:02,288
but in fact,

214
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:05,847
he was just a thief,

215
00:13:06,447 --> 00:13:07,768
who was utterly depraved

216
00:13:08,368 --> 00:13:09,567
and acted mysteriously.

217
00:13:11,488 --> 00:13:13,768
I once read a silk manuscript.

218
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:15,567
It documented like this.

219
00:13:16,648 --> 00:13:18,368
(King Shang of Lu's troops)

220
00:13:18,648 --> 00:13:21,687
(mostly rested by day
and marched at night.)

221
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:24,607
(They would often vanish suddenly,)

222
00:13:24,768 --> 00:13:26,927
(and then reappear elsewhere.)

223
00:13:27,447 --> 00:13:28,967
(In places they raided,)

224
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:31,567
(alchemists were all killed.)

225
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:35,008
(When asked, they claimed
that alchemists mislead the nation.)

226
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:36,607
Mislead the nation?

227
00:13:36,727 --> 00:13:37,888
Impossible.

228
00:13:37,888 --> 00:13:39,607
Rulers back then were alchemists.

229
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:42,207
See?

230
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,488
I made the same face
when I first heard about it.

231
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,528
How could we history scholars

232
00:13:47,528 --> 00:13:49,408
ever buy

233
00:13:49,408 --> 00:13:50,687
such superstitious nonsense?

234
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:52,567
So

235
00:13:53,087 --> 00:13:55,927
they must be
hunting alchemists everywhere,

236
00:13:56,368 --> 00:14:00,207
especially the legendary ones.

237
00:14:00,368 --> 00:14:01,128
That is to say,

238
00:14:01,128 --> 00:14:03,967
King Shang of Lu thought
alchemists misled the nation,

239
00:14:04,087 --> 00:14:05,888
while in fact,

240
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:08,087
he wanted their manuals.

241
00:14:08,368 --> 00:14:10,567
People back then were gullible,

242
00:14:11,008 --> 00:14:13,288
so tales grew wilder each retelling.

243
00:14:14,927 --> 00:14:15,687
Any evidence?

244
00:14:16,687 --> 00:14:17,607
Evidence?

245
00:14:18,368 --> 00:14:20,327
Of course, there is evidence.

246
00:14:20,687 --> 00:14:23,567
Do you remember what we saw earlier,

247
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:27,488
seven giant trees
cradling seven alchemy furnaces?

248
00:14:29,967 --> 00:14:30,648
That

249
00:14:31,327 --> 00:14:32,248
is the evidence.

250
00:14:32,687 --> 00:14:35,768
How's alchemy linked
to hunting alchemists?

251
00:14:35,768 --> 00:14:37,727
Well, it does!

252
00:14:38,727 --> 00:14:39,888
The Seven-Star

253
00:14:40,408 --> 00:14:41,847
Alchemy Sect.

254
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,048
Seven-Star Alchemy Sect?

255
00:14:44,888 --> 00:14:45,807
What does that mean?

256
00:14:49,327 --> 00:14:50,847
My throat's parched from talking.

257
00:14:52,488 --> 00:14:54,087
I need to refuel.

258
00:15:04,408 --> 00:15:05,368
Open it.

259
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:13,207
(Water)
Well, better.

260
00:15:13,607 --> 00:15:14,368
Bottoms up.

261
00:15:22,727 --> 00:15:24,008
Let's continue.

262
00:15:25,847 --> 00:15:28,687
In ancient times,
there was an alchemy sect

263
00:15:28,687 --> 00:15:30,687
called the Seven-Star Alchemy Sect.

264
00:15:30,687 --> 00:15:32,008
(They thought)

265
00:15:32,008 --> 00:15:33,447
(alchemy took too long,)

266
00:15:33,447 --> 00:15:34,447
(better to just rob.)

267
00:15:34,447 --> 00:15:36,768
(So they hunted famed alchemists,)

268
00:15:37,207 --> 00:15:38,967
(plundering all)

269
00:15:38,967 --> 00:15:40,327
(of their manuals and elixirs.)

270
00:15:40,488 --> 00:15:42,888
(They even tested elixirs
on those alchemists.)

271
00:15:43,168 --> 00:15:45,087
(Some elixirs boosted aggression,)

272
00:15:45,087 --> 00:15:47,447
(enhancing soldiers' combat skills.)

273
00:15:47,648 --> 00:15:50,488
(Besides, they always acted at night,)

274
00:15:50,847 --> 00:15:53,048
(Silk manuscript)
(making it seemed supernatural.)

275
00:15:53,528 --> 00:15:54,927
(The creepiest part)

276
00:15:55,408 --> 00:15:58,248
(is the last hierarch
of the Seven-Star Alchemy Sect.)

277
00:15:58,528 --> 00:16:00,048
Do you know who he was?

278
00:16:01,087 --> 00:16:01,888
Who?

279
00:16:04,408 --> 00:16:05,528
Nobody knows.

280
00:16:05,768 --> 00:16:08,128
Because he was too mysterious.

281
00:16:08,488 --> 00:16:09,248
So

282
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:12,768
there was a saying about him.

283
00:16:13,528 --> 00:16:14,567
Elusive

284
00:16:15,687 --> 00:16:16,727
from start

285
00:16:17,008 --> 00:16:18,567
to finish.

286
00:16:19,048 --> 00:16:19,927
In short,

287
00:16:20,207 --> 00:16:21,087
the Unseen.

288
00:16:22,687 --> 00:16:23,847
I'm talking to you.

289
00:16:24,687 --> 00:16:26,528
Do you know his connection?

290
00:16:28,008 --> 00:16:28,888
Keep spinning tales.

291
00:16:29,847 --> 00:16:31,008
Keep going.

292
00:16:31,648 --> 00:16:32,888
Are you going to claim

293
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:36,168
that the last hierarch
of Seven-Star Alchemy Sect

294
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:37,408
was King Shang of Lu?

295
00:16:37,408 --> 00:16:38,168
Right,

296
00:16:38,168 --> 00:16:39,207
but not entirely.

297
00:16:39,368 --> 00:16:40,927
I don't know whether he was a hierarch.

298
00:16:40,927 --> 00:16:42,567
But King Shang of Lu definitely

299
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:44,567
belonged to a branch
of Seven-Star Alchemy Sect.

300
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:48,248
You said King Shang of Lu
brewed elixirs here.

301
00:16:48,248 --> 00:16:49,648
But this was built by the ruler?

302
00:16:49,648 --> 00:16:50,687
That depends

303
00:16:51,327 --> 00:16:53,008
on who wrote the silk manuscript.

304
00:16:54,008 --> 00:16:55,648
It was said to be built by the ruler.

305
00:16:56,128 --> 00:16:57,528
But is it true?

306
00:16:57,528 --> 00:16:59,888
It mentioned ghost soldiers.
But did they really exist?

307
00:17:00,168 --> 00:17:01,687
There aren't that many coincidences.

308
00:17:02,807 --> 00:17:04,528
Didn't you say the same thing earlier?

309
00:17:04,528 --> 00:17:07,008
I said that to make the story
more engaging.

310
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:08,248
Anyway, I believe this place

311
00:17:08,248 --> 00:17:09,728
was surely built by King Shang of Lu

312
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,008
to refine elixirs for himself.

313
00:17:12,288 --> 00:17:13,968
I bet King Shang of Lu's corpse

314
00:17:13,968 --> 00:17:16,048
is likely inside this kiln.

315
00:17:16,288 --> 00:17:17,968
Let's bet on it? 100 yuan.

316
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:19,768
Forget about King Shang of Lu.

317
00:17:20,928 --> 00:17:22,488
Xiaoge still hasn't returned yet.

318
00:17:22,928 --> 00:17:24,008
He'll be okay, right?

319
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:26,928
It's been way too long.

320
00:17:26,928 --> 00:17:28,248
I'm afraid Xiaoge

321
00:17:28,928 --> 00:17:30,367
might have left without us.

322
00:17:30,607 --> 00:17:31,647
No way.

323
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,008
Human hearts are unpredictable.

324
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:34,208
We need to find a way

325
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,488
to reunite with Third Master.

326
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:36,647
Then we'll deal with Xiaoge.

327
00:17:36,647 --> 00:17:38,248
So what about our cooperation?

328
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:39,807
No cooperation.

329
00:17:39,807 --> 00:17:41,208
So I've wasted my breath for no...

330
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,567
This must be what attacked me earlier.

331
00:18:32,968 --> 00:18:33,768
Don't move!

332
00:18:38,448 --> 00:18:39,248
Young Third Master.

333
00:18:48,847 --> 00:18:49,647
Are you okay?

334
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:51,367
I'm fine.

335
00:19:16,847 --> 00:19:17,768
Get back here!

336
00:19:25,048 --> 00:19:26,647
Why do I always get hurt?

337
00:19:27,632 --> 00:19:29,136
There's a passage behind this wall.

338
00:19:30,608 --> 00:19:31,208
A passage?

339
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,167
And there's wind.

340
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:33,488
It might lead outside.

341
00:19:33,488 --> 00:19:34,327
It's real.

342
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:36,087
Then don't wait.

343
00:19:36,087 --> 00:19:36,968
Let's get out of here.

344
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:37,607
No!

345
00:19:38,048 --> 00:19:39,344
What if that thing

346
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,624
or corpse beetles are inside?

347
00:19:40,728 --> 00:19:43,008
That's still better than dying here.

348
00:19:44,607 --> 00:19:45,768
I have Xiaoge's blood.

349
00:19:46,704 --> 00:19:47,248
What?

350
00:19:47,248 --> 00:19:49,328
We have Xiaoge's blood
to deal with corpse beetles.

351
00:19:49,728 --> 00:19:50,407
What?

352
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,127
To deal with corpse beetles? Where?

353
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,048
Here it comes again!

354
00:19:56,768 --> 00:19:57,567
You go first!

355
00:19:57,728 --> 00:19:59,127
Go! Hurry!

356
00:20:00,327 --> 00:20:01,288
Move!

357
00:20:02,528 --> 00:20:03,327
Pan Zi.

358
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,288
Go, Pan Zi.

359
00:20:05,688 --> 00:20:06,448
Pan Zi.

360
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:07,327
Quick.

361
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:12,928
This way.

362
00:20:14,288 --> 00:20:15,008
Go.

363
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:18,167
Over here.

364
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:19,127
Hurry up, Pangzi.

365
00:20:27,968 --> 00:20:29,768
You'll definitely be a scumbag someday.

366
00:20:31,008 --> 00:20:31,688
Pan Zi.

367
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:33,087
Pan Zi.

368
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:34,728
Wait. Let me explain.

369
00:20:35,528 --> 00:20:37,248
Over here, Wu Xie. Hurry!

370
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:37,968
Pangzi.

371
00:20:37,968 --> 00:20:39,248
Slow down, Pangzi.

372
00:20:42,087 --> 00:20:43,728
Pangzi, I can't keep up.

373
00:20:43,728 --> 00:20:44,768
Why did you go down?

374
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:47,048
Pangzi.

375
00:20:47,856 --> 00:20:48,968
- Be careful.
- Don't move, Pangzi.

376
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:50,488
Give me your hand.

377
00:20:50,488 --> 00:20:51,968
I can't reach.

378
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:54,968
Who's there?

379
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:56,248
Let me come lower.

380
00:20:59,607 --> 00:21:00,528
Harder.

381
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:02,567
Wu Xie, is that you?

382
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:03,407
Third Uncle?

383
00:21:03,407 --> 00:21:04,688
Third Uncle, is that you?

384
00:21:05,127 --> 00:21:06,288
Who's this?

385
00:21:06,488 --> 00:21:07,367
Where's Pan Zi?

386
00:21:07,807 --> 00:21:08,647
Pan Zi.

387
00:21:08,728 --> 00:21:10,488
- Third Master, I'm here.
- Pan Zi is here.

388
00:21:10,847 --> 00:21:11,847
But he's injured.

389
00:21:12,008 --> 00:21:12,887
Where's Xiaoge?

390
00:21:12,887 --> 00:21:13,887
Who's this guy?

391
00:21:14,048 --> 00:21:15,288
Why is there an extra person?

392
00:21:15,488 --> 00:21:17,008
He's also here to rescue Ma.

393
00:21:17,607 --> 00:21:19,167
Help me, bro!

394
00:21:19,367 --> 00:21:21,367
I'll kowtow to you later.

395
00:21:21,528 --> 00:21:22,928
Give me a hand.

396
00:21:23,087 --> 00:21:24,432
I really can't hold on anymore.

397
00:21:24,432 --> 00:21:25,808
Third Master, should we help him?

398
00:21:26,224 --> 00:21:27,376
Pan Zi traveled with him.

399
00:21:27,376 --> 00:21:29,008
- Save him.
- I'm about to lose my grip.

400
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:31,528
Help me, sir.

401
00:21:31,528 --> 00:21:33,167
Consider yourself lucky today. Come on.

402
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:33,968
Thanks, sir.

403
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:35,327
Wonderful.

404
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:36,127
Pangzi, reach out.

405
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:37,048
Climb up.

406
00:21:37,928 --> 00:21:38,728
Reach out.

407
00:21:40,288 --> 00:21:41,448
Put some muscle into it.

408
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:43,647
What're you pretending for?

409
00:21:43,647 --> 00:21:45,367
Can't you use both hands?

410
00:21:46,928 --> 00:21:47,647
Da Kui.

411
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:49,087
Da Kui.

412
00:21:53,887 --> 00:21:55,488
Why'd you let go, bro?

413
00:21:56,807 --> 00:21:57,488
Wu Xie.

414
00:21:57,768 --> 00:21:58,448
Go.

415
00:21:58,688 --> 00:21:59,367
Wu Xie.

416
00:22:07,847 --> 00:22:08,607
Don't move.

417
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:21,968
Get lost.

418
00:22:22,847 --> 00:22:23,728
Stay back.

419
00:22:24,488 --> 00:22:25,248
Get lost.

420
00:22:35,407 --> 00:22:36,367
Pull me up, quick.

421
00:22:36,367 --> 00:22:37,008
Hurry.

422
00:22:38,887 --> 00:22:39,647
Harder.

423
00:22:43,448 --> 00:22:44,087
Pangzi!

424
00:22:50,968 --> 00:22:51,807
Pan Zi.

425
00:22:52,167 --> 00:22:52,928
Pan Zi.

426
00:22:53,264 --> 00:22:54,327
What's wrong with Pan Zi?

427
00:22:54,327 --> 00:22:55,087
Wu Xie.

428
00:22:55,087 --> 00:22:56,327
Pan Zi's been taken.

429
00:22:56,407 --> 00:22:58,127
Stay put. We're coming.

430
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,087
Pan Zi! Pan Zi!

431
00:23:06,607 --> 00:23:07,407
Pan Zi!

432
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,928
I'm not a scumbag.

433
00:23:11,127 --> 00:23:11,768
Pan Zi.

434
00:23:13,127 --> 00:23:14,048
Pan Zi.

435
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,616
Pan Zi. Pan Zi.

436
00:23:17,616 --> 00:23:18,384
Pan...

437
00:23:23,968 --> 00:23:24,768
Pan Zi.

438
00:23:25,567 --> 00:23:26,367
Pan Zi!

439
00:23:27,167 --> 00:23:28,127
Pan Zi!

440
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:36,448
Pan Zi.

441
00:23:36,607 --> 00:23:37,327
Pan Zi!

442
00:23:37,407 --> 00:23:38,208
Pan Zi!

443
00:23:40,327 --> 00:23:41,048
Third Master!

444
00:24:00,528 --> 00:24:01,847
- Da Kui!
- Third Master!

445
00:24:07,688 --> 00:24:08,327
Go!

446
00:24:08,728 --> 00:24:10,048
Go. Go!

447
00:24:12,887 --> 00:24:14,367
No path left, Third Master.

448
00:24:20,968 --> 00:24:22,127
They're not coming in.

449
00:24:22,407 --> 00:24:23,288
Why?

450
00:24:23,968 --> 00:24:25,488
They don't dare enter here.

451
00:24:25,887 --> 00:24:27,688
What's different here from outside?

452
00:24:35,647 --> 00:24:36,887
They're afraid of this.

453
00:24:37,048 --> 00:24:37,928
Throw this at it

454
00:25:19,488 --> 00:25:20,768
Monster!

455
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:23,208
Paranormal phenomenon!

456
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:23,887
Unknown...

457
00:25:32,288 --> 00:25:33,807
Don't come any closer!

458
00:25:50,768 --> 00:25:52,288
The things you've done before...

459
00:25:52,807 --> 00:25:54,127
(In the days to come,)

460
00:25:54,647 --> 00:25:56,127
(you must shoulder responsibility.)

461
00:26:08,928 --> 00:26:09,728
Third Master,

462
00:26:09,728 --> 00:26:10,807
it's Pan Zi's crossbow.

463
00:26:19,528 --> 00:26:20,327
Pan Zi!

464
00:26:20,768 --> 00:26:21,567
Pan Zi!

465
00:27:23,968 --> 00:27:24,688
Pan Zi.

466
00:27:24,688 --> 00:27:26,327
Pan Zi, are you okay?

467
00:27:27,048 --> 00:27:27,768
I'm fine.

468
00:27:44,928 --> 00:27:45,847
Third Master,

469
00:27:46,704 --> 00:27:47,884
