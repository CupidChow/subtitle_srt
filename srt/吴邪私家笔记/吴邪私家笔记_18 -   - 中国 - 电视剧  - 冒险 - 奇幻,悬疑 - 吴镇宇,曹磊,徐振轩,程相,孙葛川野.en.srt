3
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:48,186
The explosion breached the room!

4
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:49,466
There's no time.

5
00:01:49,466 --> 00:01:50,347
- Wu!
- To the passage.

6
00:01:50,347 --> 00:01:52,386
This isn't what you meant
by blowing a hole!

7
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:53,987
Where are we going?

8
00:01:54,627 --> 00:01:55,587
Move it!

9
00:02:03,947 --> 00:02:04,906
Wu!

10
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:06,546
Wu, hurry!

11
00:02:14,106 --> 00:02:14,787
Move!

12
00:02:14,787 --> 00:02:15,146
Okay.

13
00:02:15,586 --> 00:02:16,307
Pangzi, let's go.

14
00:02:16,307 --> 00:02:17,106
Go, go, go!

15
00:02:17,106 --> 00:02:17,907
Hurry!

16
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,233
Can this work?

17
00:04:04,907 --> 00:04:06,146
It's blocked!

18
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:08,546
Wu!

19
00:04:08,826 --> 00:04:10,266
Are you sure it won't collapse?

20
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:12,227
It won't. The space here is compact.

21
00:04:12,227 --> 00:04:13,146
It shouldn't.

22
00:04:24,786 --> 00:04:26,146
It's too much water!

23
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:34,867
It's flooding in!

24
00:04:56,627 --> 00:04:57,427
Wu Xie!

25
00:04:58,026 --> 00:04:59,107
Wu Xie!

26
00:05:01,947 --> 00:05:02,586
Wu Xie!

27
00:05:04,547 --> 00:05:05,346
You okay?

28
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,067
I'm fine.

29
00:05:06,947 --> 00:05:07,667
I'm fine.

30
00:05:07,747 --> 00:05:08,507
Where's Xiaoge?

31
00:05:11,867 --> 00:05:12,466
Alright.

32
00:05:12,706 --> 00:05:13,667
I'll find the exit.

33
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:15,346
No, Pangzi!

34
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:38,266
Pangzi, over here.

35
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,187
Wu.

36
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:46,146
This door won't budge.

37
00:05:47,586 --> 00:05:48,547
We need equal pressure

38
00:05:48,547 --> 00:05:50,507
inside and outside
before the door can open.

39
00:05:51,786 --> 00:05:52,786
Why didn't you say that?

40
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:54,226
You dived too fast!

41
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:55,987
What now?

42
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:56,826
We wait.

43
00:05:57,067 --> 00:05:57,947
And do nothing?

44
00:05:58,386 --> 00:05:59,187
Xiaoge,

45
00:05:59,706 --> 00:06:00,786
any other ideas?

46
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:02,386
I trust him.

47
00:06:02,867 --> 00:06:05,466
Don't act like I don't trust him.

48
00:06:06,826 --> 00:06:07,427
Fine then.

49
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:08,706
Let's wait here.

50
00:06:09,226 --> 00:06:10,826
We'll face death together at worst.

51
00:06:20,586 --> 00:06:21,507
How much longer?

52
00:06:22,146 --> 00:06:22,906
Just wait.

53
00:06:23,947 --> 00:06:24,987
The water's rising fast.

54
00:06:36,507 --> 00:06:37,616
- About time?
- Go.

55
00:07:54,906 --> 00:07:56,226
The current's too strong.

56
00:07:56,786 --> 00:07:57,826
How do we get out?

57
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:00,466
Wait a bit longer.

58
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:03,146
Until it reached the top.

59
00:08:03,146 --> 00:08:04,067
Hold your breath.

60
00:08:04,507 --> 00:08:07,026

83
00:11:57,547 --> 00:11:58,746
Come on.

84
00:12:02,787 --> 00:12:03,547
Sit properly.

85
00:12:03,547 --> 00:12:04,147
Doctor!

86
00:12:04,147 --> 00:12:05,427
Doctor!

87
00:12:05,706 --> 00:12:06,466
He's awake.

88
00:12:18,626 --> 00:12:19,506
How is he?

89
00:12:19,866 --> 00:12:20,746
Looks good.

90
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:21,866
In a couple of days,

91
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:22,746
he can be discharged.

92
00:12:22,746 --> 00:12:24,387
Good. That's good.

93
00:12:24,947 --> 00:12:25,466
Thank you.

94
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:26,307
My pleasure.

95
00:12:27,027 --> 00:12:28,626
Just send a nurse next time.

96
00:12:29,866 --> 00:12:30,667
Pangzi.

97
00:12:31,427 --> 00:12:32,226
How do you feel?

98
00:12:34,226 --> 00:12:36,947
Was it a dream?

99
00:13:07,267 --> 00:13:08,746
Who saved me?

100
00:13:09,267 --> 00:13:10,947
Who else could it be?

101
00:13:11,746 --> 00:13:12,986
Xiaoge, of course.

102
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:16,267
So young and already losing hair?

103
00:13:20,387 --> 00:13:21,147
Where's Xiaoge?

104
00:13:22,307 --> 00:13:23,387
You think everyone's

105
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:25,746
as loyal as me?

106
00:13:26,547 --> 00:13:28,346
I watched over you for three days.

107
00:13:28,746 --> 00:13:30,947
And your first words were,
"Where's Xiaoge?"

108
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:33,267
Well,

109
00:13:33,267 --> 00:13:35,586
he left you a red notebook.

110
00:13:35,746 --> 00:13:36,706
By now,

111
00:13:36,706 --> 00:13:38,226
he's probably at the pier.

112
00:13:40,706 --> 00:13:41,626
Wait, ma'am!

113
00:13:41,826 --> 00:13:42,267
Wait!

114
00:13:42,267 --> 00:13:43,027
No boarding.

115
00:13:43,027 --> 00:13:43,706
It's full.

116
00:13:43,706 --> 00:13:44,586
I'm not boarding.

117
00:13:44,586 --> 00:13:45,706
I'm meeting a friend.

118
00:13:45,706 --> 00:13:47,706
- Then make it quick.
- Xiaoge! Xiaoge!

119
00:14:15,947 --> 00:14:16,907
(In the end,)

120
00:14:16,907 --> 00:14:18,746
(I never got to thank Xiaoge properly)

121
00:14:19,506 --> 00:14:20,866
(or say goodbye.)

122
00:14:22,626 --> 00:14:24,187
(He put some pages of his speculations)

123
00:14:24,187 --> 00:14:26,226
(about the shipwreck and my third uncle)

124
00:14:27,027 --> 00:14:28,826
(Wu Laogou's Notebook)
(in my grandpa's notes.)

125
00:14:30,346 --> 00:14:32,226
(I don't know what the truth really is)

126
00:14:33,626 --> 00:14:34,427
(or whether)

127
00:14:34,427 --> 00:14:36,466
(I should continue investigating.)

128
00:14:38,187 --> 00:14:39,226
(I recalled some words)

129
00:14:39,226 --> 00:14:40,947
(Third Uncle once said to me.)

130
00:14:42,427 --> 00:14:44,866
(Did he actually leave clues long ago?)

131
00:15:03,547 --> 00:15:04,586
What did you see?

132
00:15:05,547 --> 00:15:07,267
You threw a stone down.

133
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:09,986
Do you think

134
00:15:11,267 --> 00:15:12,667
it would ever go down

135
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:14,706
if I didn't throw it?

136
00:15:18,746 --> 00:15:19,626
Probably.

137
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:22,267
Rainwater would wash it down.

138
00:15:29,866 --> 00:15:31,787
Do you think
there are fish in the water?

139
00:15:33,787 --> 00:15:34,667
Of course.

140
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,027
It's such a huge pond.

141
00:15:37,466 --> 00:15:41,106
Do you think
fish hold value while in water

142
00:15:42,427 --> 00:15:44,986
or gain value when taken out of it?

143
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:47,267
They should be

144
00:15:48,346 --> 00:15:49,392
more valuable in water.

145
00:15:51,427 --> 00:15:55,307
But fish left uncaught

146
00:15:55,307 --> 00:15:57,826
can't be traded

147
00:15:57,826 --> 00:15:59,547
or priced,

148
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:02,506
so they're practically worthless.

149
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,346
Let me ask you this.

150
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:10,466
If you had to choose,

151
00:16:10,907 --> 00:16:12,866
would you rather be a stone

152
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:15,866
or a fish?

153
00:16:22,826 --> 00:16:24,027
It makes no difference.

154
00:16:31,147 --> 00:16:31,947
Third Uncle,

155
00:16:32,307 --> 00:16:34,826
I'm still thinking
about the fish and stone analogy.

156
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,226
You're still stuck on that?

157
00:16:51,067 --> 00:16:52,187
What's to choose?

158
00:16:53,787 --> 00:16:54,907
Some questions

159
00:16:54,907 --> 00:16:56,986
sound profound at first

160
00:16:57,307 --> 00:17:00,506
but are ultimately meaningless.

161
00:17:01,626 --> 00:17:02,706
We're humans.

162
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:06,066
Why choose between a stone and a fish?

163
00:17:21,147 --> 00:17:21,986
Third Uncle?

164
00:17:23,786 --> 00:17:24,706

00:19:37,587 --> 00:19:39,706
Alright, Wu.

194
00:19:40,107 --> 00:19:41,347
I know you're upset.

195
00:19:41,746 --> 00:19:42,827
It's my fault

196
00:19:42,907 --> 00:19:45,147
for not finding your third uncle
or third auntie.

197
00:19:45,746 --> 00:19:46,187
Right?

198
00:19:46,387 --> 00:19:47,280
Or third great-aunt.

199
00:19:48,746 --> 00:19:49,786
Look at it differently.

200
00:19:51,986 --> 00:19:53,986
Who's your third uncle?

201
00:19:54,786 --> 00:19:56,266
A seasoned veteran.

202
00:19:56,266 --> 00:19:57,226
Don't even compare me.

203
00:19:57,226 --> 00:19:58,387
Look at yourself.

204
00:19:58,387 --> 00:20:00,187
If even you escaped that shipwreck,

205
00:20:00,187 --> 00:20:01,587
how could your third uncle not?

206
00:20:02,746 --> 00:20:03,266
He's probably

207
00:20:03,266 --> 00:20:04,907
feasting somewhere right now.

208
00:20:05,947 --> 00:20:07,066
He didn't want you around.

209
00:20:07,387 --> 00:20:08,147
Think about it.

210
00:20:09,746 --> 00:20:10,546
If he

211
00:20:11,947 --> 00:20:12,986
truly got out,

212
00:20:13,427 --> 00:20:14,827
why didn't he

213
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:16,746
send me messages

214
00:20:16,746 --> 00:20:17,546
or answer

215
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:19,546
when I called?

216
00:20:19,546 --> 00:20:20,466
What's wrong?

217
00:20:20,947 --> 00:20:22,147
It's perfectly normal.

218
00:20:24,226 --> 00:20:25,506
Your third uncle's practically

219
00:20:25,786 --> 00:20:27,147
half a father to you.

220
00:20:27,867 --> 00:20:30,066
Since when do sons
boss around their fathers?

221
00:20:30,627 --> 00:20:31,986
What a joke!

222
00:20:34,427 --> 00:20:36,627
Your third uncle has his own life

223
00:20:36,627 --> 00:20:37,986
and his own plans.

224
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:38,947
Right?

225
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:40,546
Just respect his choices.

226
00:20:40,546 --> 00:20:41,986
Don't try to control him.

227
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:43,786
You're not his father.

228
00:20:45,026 --> 00:20:45,867
What's the nonsense?

229
00:20:46,986 --> 00:20:48,226
Revisiting that shipwreck?

230
00:20:49,107 --> 00:20:50,427
It's been over 20 years.

231
00:20:51,026 --> 00:20:52,466
He still wants to find Ms. Wenjin.

232
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:54,026
What's wrong with that?

233
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,546
That's devotion.

234
00:20:57,427 --> 00:20:58,667
As for your third uncle now,

235
00:20:59,387 --> 00:21:01,667
whether he's searching for Ms. Wenjin

236
00:21:01,667 --> 00:21:03,466
or chasing Wang Zanghai's secrets,

237
00:21:03,466 --> 00:21:04,387
either way,

238
00:21:04,387 --> 00:21:07,466
it all connects back
to the Heavenly Palace on the Clouds.

239
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:09,427
That gives us a lead.

240
00:21:10,066 --> 00:21:10,867
Right?

241
00:21:12,587 --> 00:21:13,627
That means,

242
00:21:13,627 --> 00:21:15,107
to find clues about Third Uncle,

243
00:21:16,466 --> 00:21:19,347
I must start with studying

244
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:20,427
Wang Zanghai

245
00:21:20,427 --> 00:21:22,226
and his shipwreck.

246
00:21:22,226 --> 00:21:22,907
Exactly.

247
00:21:23,266 --> 00:21:25,546
You already have the upper hand.

248
00:21:26,026 --> 00:21:26,827
What upper hand?

249
00:21:27,266 --> 00:21:28,187
What do you have?

250
00:21:29,427 --> 00:21:29,947
The fish.

251
00:21:29,947 --> 00:21:30,427
Right.

252
00:21:31,066 --> 00:21:32,627
The Snake-Eyebrow Copper Fish.

253
00:21:34,986 --> 00:21:37,387
But I handed over the two real ones.

254
00:21:37,907 --> 00:21:40,266
Now I only own the replicas I had made.

255
00:21:40,427 --> 00:21:41,947
Replicas work fine.

256
00:21:42,306 --> 00:21:43,147
Think about it.

257
00:21:44,347 --> 00:21:45,587
What was Wang Zanghai like?

258
00:21:46,466 --> 00:21:47,226
One of the few

259
00:21:47,226 --> 00:21:48,746
even craftier than your third uncle.

260
00:21:49,147 --> 00:21:51,226
Do you think his mechanisms

261
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,306
were carelessly built?

262
00:21:54,587 --> 00:21:56,627
They were meticulously designed.

263
00:21:57,347 --> 00:21:57,986
Right?

264
00:21:58,347 --> 00:22:00,026
For all three Snake-Eyebrow Copper Fish,

265
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:03,466
you already have
the replicas of two of them.

266
00:22:03,746 --> 00:22:04,786
And for the last one,

267
00:22:04,786 --> 00:22:05,907
whether someone else has it

268
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:06,907
or it's hidden somewhere,

269
00:22:07,466 --> 00:22:08,506
if anyone wants

270
00:22:08,506 --> 00:22:10,107
to know the Heavenly Palace's secrets,

271
00:22:10,107 --> 00:22:11,947
they'll have to come to you first.

272
00:22:14,107 --> 00:22:16,587
So all you need to do now is one thing:

273
00:22:18,427 --> 00:22:19,786
wait with the fake fish.

274
00:22:19,786 --> 00:22:20,627
That's all.

275
00:22:24,387 --> 00:22:25,187
Come on.

276
00:22:26,107 --> 00:22:27,387
Didn't know you had this in you.

277
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:31,786
But there's one thing

278
00:22:32,306 --> 00:22:33,306
I still don't understand.

279
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:38,107
Why did Wang Zanghai fill the shipwreck

280
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,187
with so many

281
00:22:39,187 --> 00:22:40,506
bizarre creatures?

282
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:42,026
About that,

283
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:43,546
when Xiaoge

284
00:22:43,546 --> 00:22:45,107
returned the notebook to me earlier,

285
00:22:45,706 --> 00:22:46,947
he slipped in some papers

286
00:22:47,546 --> 00:22:48,986
with his theories.

287
00:22:49,427 --> 00:22:50,266
What did he say?

288
00:22:51,026 --> 00:22:52,387
He thinks Wang Zanghai

289
00:22:52,627 --> 00:22:55,107
was also experimenting with immortality.

290
00:22:56,226 --> 00:22:57,706
He likely visited King of Lu's kiln

291
00:22:58,266 --> 00:23:00,706
and obtained that meteorite jade.

292
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,387
In King Shang of Lu's experiment,

293
00:23:03,387 --> 00:23:05,466
he placed himself
inside the meteorite jade

294
00:23:05,627 --> 00:23:06,786
to pursue immortality.

295
00:23:08,947 --> 00:23:10,226
But Wang Zanghai

296
00:23:10,506 --> 00:23:11,746
saw what happened to him

297
00:23:12,107 --> 00:23:13,786
and realized that path was futile.

298
00:23:14,947 --> 00:23:16,266
So he used the jade to make pills

299
00:23:16,506 --> 00:23:18,226
and experimented on animals.

300
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:21,506
Unexpectedly, the animals mutated.

301
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:23,546
(Like the sea monkeys)

302
00:23:24,066 --> 00:23:25,546
(and that white-haired monster.)

303
00:23:26,587 --> 00:23:27,827
And the Forbidden Woman?

304
00:23:28,266 --> 00:23:30,187
It was a mutated nematode

305
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:33,026
that emitted
a fragrant hallucinogenic gas.

306
00:23:34,107 --> 00:23:34,907
It's fragrant.

307
00:23:37,947 --> 00:23:38,947
Forbidden Woman's Scent.

308
00:23:39,706 --> 00:23:40,706
It smells fragrant.

309
00:23:41,506 --> 00:23:42,427
Do you smell it?

310
00:23:43,187 --> 00:23:44,066
Such a scent

311
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:46,066
tricks you into thinking
it's from a woman's hair.

312
00:23:46,827 --> 00:23:48,066
How's your back doing?

313
00:23:50,026 --> 00:23:50,986
Much better.

314
00:23:50,986 --> 00:23:51,986
Almost healed.

315
00:23:52,466 --> 00:23:54,266
The doctor said it's a fungal infection.

316
00:23:54,746 --> 00:23:55,587
Didn't ask for more.

317
00:23:59,587 --> 00:24:00,266
By the way,

318
00:24:00,266 --> 00:24:01,026
I just remembered

319
00:24:02,026 --> 00:24:02,786
that lotion

320
00:24:02,786 --> 00:24:04,466
you applied on me back then.

321
00:24:04,466 --> 00:24:04,986
What was it?

322
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:05,746
You didn't tell me.

323
00:24:09,066 --> 00:24:10,266
It's export-grade stuff.

324
00:24:10,266 --> 00:24:11,347
I told you.

325
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:12,827
I'll go find it

326
00:24:12,947 --> 00:24:13,746
and give it to you.

327
00:24:14,347 --> 00:24:15,147
I heard you.

328
00:24:16,026 --> 00:24:17,026
A promise...

329
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:22,107
Is a promise.

330
00:24:27,026 --> 00:24:27,786
Wu,

331
00:24:30,506 --> 00:24:31,506
after this meal,

332
00:24:32,506 --> 00:24:33,746
I will be taking off.

333
00:24:39,026 --> 00:24:39,667
Well,

334
00:24:40,827 --> 00:24:42,066
we managed

335
00:24:43,026 --> 00:24:43,947
to scrape through

336
00:24:45,827 --> 00:24:47,066
the whole chaotic journey

337
00:24:47,706 --> 00:24:48,746
full of twists and turns.

338
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:51,746
The world isn't that big.

339
00:24:52,746 --> 00:24:53,546
If fate allows,

340
00:24:54,187 --> 00:24:55,187
we'll meet again.

341
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:56,427
Stay safe.

342
00:25:07,147 --> 00:25:08,827
Don't mind my nagging.

343
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:12,187
One last thing before I go:

344
00:25:15,627 --> 00:25:16,546
Your name's Wu Xie,

345
00:25:19,312 --> 00:25:21,008
meaning innocence, but don't be naive.

346
00:25:22,627 --> 00:25:23,427
Out there,

347
00:25:24,187 --> 00:25:24,947
not everyone

348
00:25:24,947 --> 00:25:26,786
is as decent as me.

349
00:25:29,387 --> 00:25:30,427
Come on, bottoms up.

350
00:25:33,546 --> 00:25:34,427
Till we meet again.

351
00:25:37,026 --> 00:25:37,786
Till we meet again.

352
00:25:59,706 --> 00:26:00,867
(This expedition)

353
00:26:01,667 --> 00:26:03,026
(has been more bizarre)

354
00:26:03,226 --> 00:26:05,147
(and unimaginable
than I ever predicted.)

355
00:26:05,786 --> 00:26:07,026
(Truthfully,)

356
00:26:07,347 --> 00:26:08,387
(many details)

357
00:26:08,387 --> 00:26:09,986
(have become foggy in my memory.)

358
00:26:10,466 --> 00:26:11,746
(Some events)

359
00:26:11,746 --> 00:26:13,667
(don't connect logically at all.)

360
00:26:14,786 --> 00:26:16,867
(So I'll record my journey)

361
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,107
(in the most beautiful)

362
00:26:18,306 --> 00:26:19,907
(and logical way to me.)

363
00:26:22,986 --> 00:26:23,986
(I wonder)

364
00:26:24,306 --> 00:26:24,587
(what)

365
00:26:24,587 --> 00:26:27,147
(my descendants will think)

366
00:26:27,226 --> 00:26:28,546
(when reading this journal.)

367
00:26:30,546 --> 00:26:31,746
(Yet for a moment,)

368
00:26:32,786 --> 00:26:35,026
(I think I feel what Grandpa felt)

369
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:38,026
(when writing his notes.)

370
00:27:19,627 --> 00:27:21,107
Did you get it?

371
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:22,347
It's done.

372
00:27:33,482 --> 00:27:38,704
(Missing Person Notice)

373
00:27:38,704 --> 00:27:40,976
(The fish is with me.)

374
00:28:22,746 --> 00:28:24,667
Wu Sanxing tricked us.

375
00:28:24,947 --> 00:28:27,947
He knew
we would send someone down again.

376
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:29,427
So he set a trap.

377
00:28:31,827 --> 00:28:33,147
He wasn't in the boat.

378
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:35,746
He must've gotten

379
00:28:35,746 --> 00:28:37,947
what he wanted and left.

380
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,746
But I also found something.

381
00:28:45,026 --> 00:28:46,627
His plan has a flaw.

382
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:50,587
He never thought
his nephew would save me.

383
00:28:53,347 --> 00:28:54,427
I will leave now

384
00:28:55,427 --> 00:28:57,026
with information.

385
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:16,506
Wu Sanxing.

386
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:24,587
I'm back.

387
00:29:25,107 --> 00:29:26,266
Did you miss me?

388
00:29:30,867 --> 00:29:31,947
What are you doing?

389
00:29:36,147 --> 00:29:38,107
Wash your face
and clean the wounds properly.

390
00:29:38,387 --> 00:29:40,147
You'll get scars this way.

391
00:29:40,427 --> 00:29:42,627
I knew you'd mess it up

392
00:29:42,627 --> 00:29:44,466
with your recklessness.

393
00:29:45,266 --> 00:29:47,266
I didn't expect
you'd care about my looks.

394
00:29:47,466 --> 00:29:49,506
Worried about facial scars?

395
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,306
Enough nagging.

396
00:29:51,306 --> 00:29:53,107
The problem is resolved. That's enough.

397
00:29:53,506 --> 00:29:54,506
Solved?

398
00:29:55,466 --> 00:29:56,786
You left behind such a mess,

399
00:29:56,786 --> 00:29:58,506
and I have to clean it up for you.

400
00:29:59,306 --> 00:30:00,107
You know what?

401
00:30:00,107 --> 00:30:01,947
Xie almost died because of you.

402
00:30:02,466 --> 00:30:04,147
You dragged him into this.

403
00:30:04,627 --> 00:30:05,986
Didn't I warn you

404
00:30:05,986 --> 00:30:07,627
to keep him out of the mission?

405
00:30:07,627 --> 00:30:08,387
Didn't I?

406
00:30:08,587 --> 00:30:10,746
I had my reasons.

407
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,627
You always do.

408
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,187
Well,

409
00:30:19,187 --> 00:30:21,147
we have to consider the bigger picture.

410
00:30:21,506 --> 00:30:22,947
The bigger picture?

411
00:30:24,226 --> 00:30:25,627
Ever considered

412
00:30:26,187 --> 00:30:27,427
your methods

413
00:30:27,427 --> 00:30:29,587
are precisely why

414
00:30:29,587 --> 00:30:30,947
we're trapped

415
00:30:30,947 --> 00:30:32,786
in this endless cycle?

416
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:35,226
It's been years.

417
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:38,627
Aren't you tired?

418
00:30:39,147 --> 00:30:40,427
I'm sick of it.

419
00:30:40,427 --> 00:30:41,746
You think I'm not?

420
00:30:41,746 --> 00:30:43,587
You think I enjoy wearing your face?

421
00:30:43,587 --> 00:30:44,986
Perfect.

422
00:30:44,986 --> 00:30:46,026
Let's end this.

423
00:30:46,026 --> 00:30:48,226
Isn't it better
if we each return to our own lives?

424
00:30:48,226 --> 00:30:50,786
Do you think I can still have a life?

425
00:31:01,706 --> 00:31:03,026
The time hasn't come yet.

426
00:31:04,427 --> 00:31:07,187
Even if we're unwilling,
we have to keep going.

427
00:31:07,627 --> 00:31:08,466
Right?

428
00:31:11,746 --> 00:31:12,546
Never mind.

429
00:31:12,867 --> 00:31:14,746
I know how to get
to the Heavenly Palace now.

430
00:31:15,147 --> 00:31:16,266
I will find Wenjin.

431
00:31:16,506 --> 00:31:19,827
You can clean up the mess for me.

432
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:26,226

Wang Meng.

467
00:34:19,427 --> 00:34:20,336
Young Third Master!

468
00:34:20,947 --> 00:34:22,106
Has Third Master returned?

469
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:25,146
Third Master hasn't come back at all.

470
00:34:25,947 --> 00:34:28,347
But there was a strange person
who claimed

471
00:34:28,347 --> 00:34:29,466
to be your brother.

472
00:34:29,586 --> 00:34:31,347
He insisted I tell him your whereabouts.

473
00:34:32,186 --> 00:34:33,106
A strange person?

474
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:36,586
Yeah, he looked

475
00:34:36,586 --> 00:34:37,827
slippery and cunning,

476
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:39,146
not seeming trustworthy at all.

477
00:34:39,146 --> 00:34:40,227
So I sent him away.

478
00:34:40,827 --> 00:34:42,066
But before leaving,

479
00:34:42,066 --> 00:34:43,347
he left a phone number.

480
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:44,666
How old did he look?

481
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:46,827
Well, it's hard to say.

482
00:34:46,827 --> 00:34:48,146
He seemed

483
00:34:48,146 --> 00:34:49,227
more mature than you.

484
00:34:50,227 --> 00:34:52,466
Did he stutter when speaking?

485
00:34:53,227 --> 00:34:54,066
Yes. Exactly.

486
00:34:54,267 --> 00:34:55,186
That guy

487
00:34:55,186 --> 00:34:57,586
stuttered a dozen times per sentence.

488
00:34:57,586 --> 00:34:58,867
Give me his number.

489
00:34:58,867 --> 00:34:59,867
Right away.

490
00:35:11,227 --> 00:35:13,026
W-Who is it?

491
00:35:14,586 --> 00:35:16,186
Can't even recognize my voice,

492
00:35:16,466 --> 00:35:17,307
Lao Yang?

493
00:35:18,026 --> 00:35:19,707
Bro!

494
00:35:20,186 --> 00:35:21,907
When are you free?

495
00:35:21,907 --> 00:35:23,066
Let's meet up.

496
00:35:24,506 --> 00:35:27,947
I need your help with something crucial.

497
00:35:28,347 --> 00:35:29,106
What is it?

498
00:35:29,106 --> 00:35:33,347
I found an extremely bizarre place.

499
00:35:33,347 --> 00:35:35,186
There's a tree inside

500
00:35:35,307 --> 00:35:38,666
bigger than any tree you've ever seen.

501
00:35:38,986 --> 00:35:41,506
It's beyond your imagination.
