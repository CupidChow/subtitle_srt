Dandan?

5
00:02:01,305 --> 00:02:02,264
Dandan?

6
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,305
Dandan?

7
00:02:06,744 --> 00:02:07,785
Dandan?

8
00:02:11,744 --> 00:02:12,624
Dandan?

9
00:02:20,464 --> 00:02:21,545
Dandan?

10
00:02:24,904 --> 00:02:25,784
Dandan?

11
00:02:30,464 --> 00:02:31,504
Dandan?

12
00:02:48,464 --> 00:02:49,464
Mountain God,

13
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:50,904
sorry for disturbing you.

14
00:02:51,145 --> 00:02:52,464
I'm just here to find my dog.

15
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:53,585
I'll leave once I find him.

16
00:03:10,865 --> 00:03:11,705
Dandan?

17
00:03:12,504 --> 00:03:13,425
Dandan?

18
00:03:14,105 --> 00:03:15,105
Wait for me.

19
00:03:15,585 --> 00:03:16,744
I'm coming to save you.

20
00:03:41,464 --> 00:03:42,344
Dandan?

21
00:03:43,385 --> 00:03:44,265
Dandan?

22
00:03:48,464 --> 00:03:49,265
Dandan?

23
00:03:56,224 --> 00:03:57,064
Dandan?

24
00:04:06,904 --> 00:04:07,744
Dandan?

25
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:11,385
Dandan?

26
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,145
Young Third Master,

27
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:33,264
look here.

28
00:04:37,185 --> 00:04:38,104
And here.

29
00:04:38,784 --> 00:04:39,745
What does it say?

30
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:43,945
What's the connection between this kiln
and Mount Shending?

31
00:04:45,025 --> 00:04:48,265
Does it mention that snake-like monster?

32
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,945
It says back then,

33
00:04:59,145 --> 00:05:00,585
a man from Lu

34
00:05:01,025 --> 00:05:03,544
possessed Shao Weng's arts
to command ghost soldiers.

35
00:05:03,945 --> 00:05:04,945
What does that mean?

36
00:05:09,505 --> 00:05:11,784
These carvings tell the legend
of King Shang of Lu.

37
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:14,104
The first half matches
the silk manuscript exactly.

38
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:23,385
It matches the manuscript?

39
00:05:23,705 --> 00:05:24,984
But the content here

40
00:05:24,984 --> 00:05:26,344
is more detailed and bizarre

41
00:05:27,025 --> 00:05:28,224
than the manuscript's.

42
00:05:30,784 --> 00:05:31,585
Third Master.

43
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,025
Third Master,

44
00:05:33,424 --> 00:05:34,984
the kiln and the mountain's secrets

45
00:05:34,984 --> 00:05:36,544
might be recorded on these walls.

46
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:38,025
Read it.

47
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:38,984
Read it aloud.

48
00:05:40,304 --> 00:05:41,145
Read.

49
00:05:50,544 --> 00:05:52,224
(The rock carvings)

50
00:05:52,344 --> 00:05:54,304
(told an extremely bizarre story.)

51
00:05:54,784 --> 00:05:55,864
(But I believed this story)

52
00:05:55,864 --> 00:05:57,185
(must be fabricated.)

53
00:05:58,705 --> 00:05:59,784
(How could something)

54
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:02,544
(so inconceivable exist in this world?)

55
00:06:07,705 --> 00:06:09,505
Wu Xie, what are you doing?

56
00:06:09,904 --> 00:06:11,025
Read it out loud.

57
00:06:11,025 --> 00:06:12,185
Okay, Third Uncle.

58
00:06:13,104 --> 00:06:14,265
It says

59
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:17,265
King Shang of Lu
was once a vassal of Lu State.

60
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:20,864
He possessed a Gui Seal from birth

61
00:06:21,585 --> 00:06:23,424
that enhanced his soldiers' strength.

62
00:06:24,664 --> 00:06:26,304
(Whenever he displayed the seal,)

63
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:28,625
(his soldiers fought)

64
00:06:28,864 --> 00:06:30,585
(without feeling pain or hunger.)

65
00:06:31,304 --> 00:06:32,104
(And)

66
00:06:32,104 --> 00:06:33,984
(the captured enemy soldiers)

67
00:06:34,104 --> 00:06:35,745
(who saw the Gui Seal)

68
00:06:35,904 --> 00:06:37,544
(would immediately pledge loyalty.)

69
00:06:38,904 --> 00:06:40,224
(Thus he conquered all)

70
00:06:40,424 --> 00:06:42,424
(and was titled by the Lu State's ruler)

71
00:06:42,745 --> 00:06:43,825
(as King of Lu,)

72
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,360
(or King Shang of Lu, by himself.)

73
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:47,065
(Back then,)

74
00:06:47,265 --> 00:06:48,825
(kings couldn't surpass state rulers.)

75
00:06:49,344 --> 00:06:51,424
(So his self-proclamation
as king was an overreach.)

76
00:06:52,104 --> 00:06:53,145
Then one day,

77
00:06:53,464 --> 00:06:55,585
he requested an audience
with the ruler of Lu State,

78
00:06:56,424 --> 00:06:58,424
(claiming prolonged use of the Gui Seal)

79
00:06:58,424 --> 00:06:59,945
(had left him frail)

80
00:07:00,464 --> 00:07:02,265
(and requiring feigned death
to recuperate.)

81
00:07:03,104 --> 00:07:05,625
(He sought permission
to retreat for recovery.)

82
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:08,705
(The ruler granted his request.)

83
00:07:09,864 --> 00:07:12,224
(After kowtowing,)

84
00:07:13,104 --> 00:07:15,065
(he entered suspended animation.)

85
00:07:29,185 --> 00:07:31,304
(Believing he'd return,)

86
00:07:32,424 --> 00:07:33,705
(the ruler preserved his body)

87
00:07:34,224 --> 00:07:36,344
at Mount Shending.

88
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:39,424
Body? You mean corpse.

89
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:41,265
He clearly couldn't last and died.

90
00:07:41,705 --> 00:07:42,784
You said

91
00:07:43,104 --> 00:07:44,424
King Shang of Lu's body

92
00:07:44,424 --> 00:07:46,664
was preserved at Mount Shending.

93
00:07:46,864 --> 00:07:48,065
(It's right here.)

94
00:07:49,825 --> 00:07:53,304
(So the ruler back then
constructed this site)

95
00:07:53,945 --> 00:07:56,025
and assigned someone
called Seven to guard here.

96
00:07:58,065 --> 00:08:00,385
(Could that thing in the kiln be Seven?)

97
00:08:02,705 --> 00:08:04,505
This story makes no sense.

98
00:08:04,664 --> 00:08:07,104
Why would the ruler build a kiln

99
00:08:07,304 --> 00:08:09,104
to preserve someone's corpse?

100
00:08:10,304 --> 00:08:12,344
The ruler wanted him to return

101
00:08:12,505 --> 00:08:13,544
as quickly as possible

102
00:08:13,705 --> 00:08:14,864
to continue serving him.

103
00:08:15,185 --> 00:08:17,145
So he built this place for him.

104
00:08:17,145 --> 00:08:18,984
To build large structures
in ancient times,

105
00:08:19,185 --> 00:08:20,825
they always used local materials.

106
00:08:20,825 --> 00:08:22,145
This kiln was likely used

107
00:08:22,145 --> 00:08:23,784
to fire bricks, tiles, and offerings.

108
00:08:24,784 --> 00:08:25,904
There must also be

109
00:08:25,904 --> 00:08:27,265
a ritual site somewhere here.

110
00:08:27,904 --> 00:08:29,344
You're just making this up.

111
00:08:29,664 --> 00:08:31,185
Your imagination runs wild.

112
00:08:32,105 --> 00:08:33,465
Quite the storyteller.

113
00:08:34,664 --> 00:08:36,745
Young Third Master,
you're tricking us again.

114
00:08:38,865 --> 00:08:39,824
What's the truth, then?

115
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:41,544
Third Uncle didn't find the truth.

116
00:08:41,544 --> 00:08:42,784
So he said I made it up.

117
00:08:43,025 --> 00:08:43,985
Impossible.

118
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:45,985
You don't know him well enough.

119
00:08:55,865 --> 00:08:56,664
Pan Zi.

120
00:09:00,944 --> 00:09:01,664
Look.

121
00:09:01,664 --> 00:09:02,745
What does this look like?

122
00:09:03,064 --> 00:09:03,784
One,

123
00:09:03,904 --> 00:09:04,505
two,

124
00:09:04,505 --> 00:09:05,265
three,

125
00:09:05,265 --> 00:09:08,025
four, five, six, seven.

126
00:09:08,784 --> 00:09:09,944
The Big Dipper.

127
00:09:10,145 --> 00:09:10,904
Right?

128
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,745
This position marks the Dipper.

129
00:09:15,505 --> 00:09:16,304
Its tail.

130
00:09:16,304 --> 00:09:17,105
Right?

131
00:09:24,225 --> 00:09:25,465
What's facing the entrance

132
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:26,865
is the North Star.

133
00:09:26,985 --> 00:09:27,745
Right?

134
00:09:27,745 --> 00:09:28,544
Third Uncle,

135
00:09:29,544 --> 00:09:31,784
the Big Dipper's handle
points the other way.

136
00:09:32,465 --> 00:09:33,824
It points to north now.

137
00:09:34,064 --> 00:09:35,985
Does it carry some hidden meaning?

138
00:09:38,505 --> 00:09:39,265
Third Master,

139
00:09:39,265 --> 00:09:40,784
there's something in this tree hollow.

140
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:41,944
What?

141
00:09:45,704 --> 00:09:46,544
Look.

142
00:09:50,145 --> 00:09:51,424
A mummy?

143
00:09:55,184 --> 00:09:56,745
How did it get inside?

144
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,265
Did it fall into the tree's

145
00:10:02,265 --> 00:10:03,584
hollow interior?

146
00:10:04,745 --> 00:10:06,985
Or was it dragged in by something?

147
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:09,225
Third Master,

148
00:10:10,385 --> 00:10:12,424
look at the equipment on this mummy.

149
00:10:13,064 --> 00:10:13,704
Could this be

150
00:10:13,704 --> 00:10:15,664
one of the missing people
from the tents?

151
00:10:19,345 --> 00:10:20,304
Likely.

152
00:10:20,368 --> 00:10:21,904
It's been here for four or five years.

153
00:10:21,904 --> 00:10:23,025
The time matches.

154
00:10:23,745 --> 00:10:25,664
Could he be someone from Ma's team?

155
00:10:25,664 --> 00:10:27,225
But why a foreigner?

156
00:10:28,904 --> 00:10:29,704
Let me see.

157
00:10:31,304 --> 00:10:32,944
Pan Zi. Pan Zi.

158
00:10:34,544 --> 00:10:35,385
Don't touch it.

159
00:10:37,424 --> 00:10:39,145
This person died here accidentally.

160
00:10:39,304 --> 00:10:40,345
It's not safe here.

161
00:10:40,664 --> 00:10:41,385
Break's over.

162
00:10:41,385 --> 00:10:42,345
Find an exit now.

163
00:10:44,505 --> 00:10:46,105
There's a chamber on each side.

164
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:47,625
Da Kui,

165
00:10:47,824 --> 00:10:49,345
let's scout ahead.

166
00:10:49,824 --> 00:10:50,345
Pan Zi,

167
00:10:50,345 --> 00:10:51,424
you stay here.

168
00:10:51,865 --> 00:10:53,225
Watch what Xiaoge does.

169
00:10:53,225 --> 00:10:54,544
Don't let him wander off.

170
00:10:54,944 --> 00:10:55,704
Got it.

171
00:11:00,584 --> 00:11:01,745
Give me some water.

172
00:11:01,944 --> 00:11:02,704
It's in the bag.

173
00:11:06,944 --> 00:11:07,704
Pan Zi,

174
00:11:07,865 --> 00:11:09,345
I've got a wild theory.

175
00:11:09,824 --> 00:11:11,544
Could the 'Seven' on the stone carving

176
00:11:11,944 --> 00:11:12,904
not be an entity?

177
00:11:12,904 --> 00:11:13,784
Where's the water?

178
00:11:13,784 --> 00:11:15,025
Look, seven alchemy furnaces.

179
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,625
Maybe seven monsters

180
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:17,904
are guarding King Shang of Lu.

181
00:11:18,704 --> 00:11:20,145
Third Master was right.

182
00:11:20,145 --> 00:11:22,064
Your imagination's too wild.

183
00:11:22,544 --> 00:11:23,304
What's wrong?

184
00:11:31,704 --> 00:11:32,505
What's wrong?

185
00:11:33,265 --> 00:11:34,664
It moved.

186
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:36,944
It did?

187
00:11:54,345 --> 00:11:55,105
Third Master.

188
00:11:56,105 --> 00:11:56,904
Third Master.

189
00:11:57,225 --> 00:11:58,544
There's a bag hanging up here.

190
00:11:58,544 --> 00:11:59,745
Could it belong to Ma's team?

191
00:12:04,105 --> 00:12:05,064
Da Kui?

192
00:12:07,704 --> 00:12:08,465
Da Kui?

193
00:12:09,824 --> 00:12:10,784
Third Master!

194
00:12:11,745 --> 00:12:12,584
I'm down here!

195
00:12:12,584 --> 00:12:14,544
Da Kui, you triggered a trap.

196
00:12:14,944 --> 00:12:16,944
You're not full of arrows, are you?

197
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:17,784
I'm fine.

198
00:12:26,544 --> 00:12:27,505
It didn't move.

199
00:13:07,265 --> 00:13:08,105
Young Third Master,

200
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:10,544
there's another person back here.

201
00:13:21,424 --> 00:13:22,304
Don't touch him.

202
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,544
The real deal is behind him.

203
00:13:32,784 --> 00:13:34,064
What is this thing?

204
00:13:34,345 --> 00:13:35,985
Could it be the second monster?

205
00:13:36,784 --> 00:13:38,944
It's so dried up
that it's barely recognizable.

206
00:13:39,465 --> 00:13:40,904
Third Master said not to touch them.

207
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:41,985
And we'll be fine.

208
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:44,345
Let's retreat slowly.

209
00:13:47,865 --> 00:13:49,505
There are seven monsters in here.

210
00:13:50,025 --> 00:13:51,505
This one contains one of them.

211
00:13:52,584 --> 00:13:54,105
What's inside the other six?

212
00:13:56,265 --> 00:13:56,985
Pan Zi...

213
00:13:59,664 --> 00:14:00,704
Third Uncle?

214
00:14:01,944 --> 00:14:02,745
Da Kui?

215
00:14:04,784 --> 00:14:05,465
No.

216
00:14:05,784 --> 00:14:06,824
It's not them.

217
00:14:13,465 --> 00:14:15,184
Have all these monsters come out?

218
00:14:56,465 --> 00:14:57,424
It's for fun.

219
00:14:57,424 --> 00:14:58,265
No need to shoot me.

220
00:14:58,265 --> 00:14:59,745
No. He's heading to the kiln.

221
00:14:59,904 --> 00:15:01,105
Don't let him touch the kiln.

222
00:15:01,304 --> 00:15:02,414
Wait here for Third Master.

223
00:15:03,544 --> 00:15:04,385
Pan Zi!

224
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:21,584
Third Uncle?

225
00:15:21,784 --> 00:15:22,704
Da Kui?

226
00:15:27,544 --> 00:15:28,304
Where is everyone?

227
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:29,345
Third Uncle?

228
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,184
Da Kui?

229
00:15:30,584 --> 00:15:32,184
Stop it. Where are you?

230
00:15:32,544 --> 00:15:33,424
They're gone.

231
00:15:33,704 --> 00:15:34,745
Third Uncle's gone.

232
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:38,465
Pan Zi?

233
00:17:39,945 --> 00:17:40,824
Is that you?

234
00:17:44,584 --> 00:17:45,425
Pan Zi?

235
00:19:04,624 --> 00:19:05,465
I'm sorry.

236
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,665
This kid can really run.

237
00:21:27,864 --> 00:21:29,784
Throwing stuff is crossing the line.

238
00:21:31,185 --> 00:21:32,665
That could kill someone.

239
00:21:35,706 --> 00:21:37,465
Think you're special
because you're handsome?

240
00:21:38,265 --> 00:21:39,945
Quit showing off.

241
00:21:41,225 --> 00:21:42,304
Want a fight?

242
00:21:42,584 --> 00:21:43,344
Bring it on.

243
00:21:43,505 --> 00:21:44,505
I will fight with you.

244
00:21:51,945 --> 00:21:52,624
Come at me!

245
00:21:53,384 --> 00:21:54,225
I'll make you a stew.

246
00:21:54,225 --> 00:21:55,185
You know?

247
00:21:56,225 --> 00:21:56,824
Come on.

248
00:21:56,824 --> 00:21:57,705
Don't freeze up.

249
00:21:57,864 --> 00:21:58,864
Scared, aren't you?

250
00:21:58,864 --> 00:21:59,705
Come on.

251
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,144
Frozen?

252
00:22:01,465 --> 00:22:02,384
Now you're scared?

253
00:22:05,064 --> 00:22:06,144
Got backup, huh?

254
00:22:42,665 --> 00:22:43,824
Why is it so long?

255
00:23:11,304 --> 00:23:12,384
Forget it. I'll keep going.

256
00:23:23,265 --> 00:23:24,465
Not there yet?

257
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,185
Another one?

258
00:24:28,104 --> 00:24:28,985
Da Kui?

259
00:24:29,784 --> 00:24:30,705
Third Master,

260
00:24:30,864 --> 00:24:32,144
I'm on the left.

261
00:24:34,985 --> 00:24:35,985
Left side?

262
00:24:35,985 --> 00:24:37,905
I'm on the right.

263
00:24:39,905 --> 00:24:40,985
I'm on the left.

264
00:24:41,144 --> 00:24:42,584
Come towards me, Da Kui.

265
00:24:44,425 --> 00:24:46,025
Don't go right.

266
00:24:47,064 --> 00:24:48,745
Don't go right!

267
00:24:53,544 --> 00:24:54,584
Third Master.

268
00:24:57,505 --> 00:24:58,465
Come here.

269
00:25:05,864 --> 00:25:06,824
Left side.

270
00:25:12,465 --> 00:25:13,465
Third Master?

271
00:25:16,905 --> 00:25:17,905
Not the left.

272
00:25:20,705 --> 00:25:21,584
Third Master?

273
00:25:22,745 --> 00:25:23,665
Third Master?

274
00:25:25,705 --> 00:25:26,505
Da Kui?

275
00:25:28,384 --> 00:25:29,344
Third Master?

276
00:25:36,945 --> 00:25:39,384
Da Kui, stay where you are.

277
00:25:39,384 --> 00:25:40,584
And don't speak.

278
00:25:40,584 --> 00:25:41,945
The echo here is strong.

279
00:25:41,945 --> 00:25:43,465
More talking means more confusion.

280
00:25:44,705 --> 00:25:45,665
Shout once.

281
00:25:49,225 --> 00:25:50,025
Again.

282
00:25:55,505 --> 00:25:56,304
Third Master,

283
00:25:56,505 --> 00:25:57,985
are you shining this light?

284
00:25:58,465 --> 00:25:59,185
Yes.

285
00:25:59,985 --> 00:26:00,905
Come here.

286
00:26:01,265 --> 00:26:03,185
Okay, Third Master. Slow down.

287
00:26:03,624 --> 00:26:04,584
Slow down.

288
00:26:12,544 --> 00:26:15,025
The sound directions here are all wrong.

289
00:26:15,665 --> 00:26:17,225
What kind of place is this?

290
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:18,624
Third Master,

291
00:26:18,864 --> 00:26:20,425
so you were pushed down here?

292
00:26:20,425 --> 00:26:22,064
Did you see what it was?

293
00:26:22,185 --> 00:26:22,985
No.

294
00:26:23,144 --> 00:26:24,584
This place is weird.

295
00:26:24,745 --> 00:26:25,584
I feel a lot

296
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,584
of strange things
will happen here very soon.

297
00:26:28,025 --> 00:26:29,465
Let's regroup with the others.

298
00:26:44,945 --> 00:26:48,185
Who would install a door
opening downward?

299
00:26:55,584 --> 00:26:56,584
My back.

300
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,665
(Another corpse.)

301
00:28:36,064 --> 00:28:37,864
Let me cover you up, buddy.

302
00:28:41,225 --> 00:28:44,544
022, 00059?

303
00:28:53,904 --> 00:28:58,256
(Storage ticket)

304
00:29:03,864 --> 00:29:04,945
If given the chance,

305
00:29:05,864 --> 00:29:08,185
I'll give this to your family.

306
00:29:12,864 --> 00:29:14,544
What is this place?

307
00:29:15,384 --> 00:29:16,304
A maze?

308
00:29:17,144 --> 00:29:18,584
Where does the path lead?

309
00:29:18,945 --> 00:29:20,945
We're going around in circles.

310
00:29:27,624 --> 00:29:28,544
Not working either.

311
00:29:29,784 --> 00:29:31,064
Seems like another dead end.

312
00:29:36,344 --> 00:29:37,425
Da Kui, look.

313
00:29:38,864 --> 00:29:40,265
Someone's been here.

314
00:29:43,425 --> 00:29:44,185
Look.

315
00:29:45,905 --> 00:29:47,745
They left in a hurry.

316
00:29:49,304 --> 00:29:50,064
Exactly.

317
00:29:50,665 --> 00:29:52,104
They took one bite of a biscuit

318
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:53,864
and left the bottle cap open.

319
00:29:54,665 --> 00:29:56,225
Why did they leave in such a rush?

320
00:29:57,465 --> 00:29:59,025
Something dragged them?

321
00:30:01,064 --> 00:30:01,985
Third Master.

322
00:30:05,985 --> 00:30:07,344
Isn't this Ma?

323
00:30:07,344 --> 00:30:08,225
It's him.

324
00:30:08,304 --> 00:30:09,304
We're on the right track.

325
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,304
Ma came with a whole team.

326
00:30:16,465 --> 00:30:17,945
Dozens of people were in the team.

327
00:30:19,864 --> 00:30:21,425
Why is there only one person left now?

328
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:23,344
Where did all the others go?

329
00:30:23,505 --> 00:30:24,864
And they left in such a hurry.

330
00:30:27,945 --> 00:30:30,025
Looks like something took him away.

331
00:30:31,905 --> 00:30:32,784
Third Master.

332
00:30:33,745 --> 00:30:34,544
Gunpowder?

333
00:30:34,544 --> 00:30:35,864
Why would he carry these?

334
00:30:36,384 --> 00:30:37,784
Ma's an amateur.

335
00:30:37,985 --> 00:30:39,505
Amateurs always go for such stuff.

336
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:49,584
The fog's getting thicker here.

337
00:30:52,624 --> 00:30:54,705
It might be another defensive mechanism.

338
00:31:47,265 --> 00:31:48,025
Young Third Master!

339
00:31:48,185 --> 00:31:49,025
Pan Zi!

340
00:32:00,784 --> 00:32:01,584
Don't move!

341
00:32:01,745 --> 00:32:02,945
Put your hands down.

342
00:32:09,185 --> 00:32:09,985
Come up!

343
00:32:23,104 --> 00:32:24,665
Run! Hurry!

344
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:25,905
Get back here!

345
00:32:36,528 --> 00:32:37,624
Why isn't it lighting up?

346
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:57,144
Handsome! Handsome!

347
00:32:57,864 --> 00:32:58,544
Handsome!

348
00:33:00,528 --> 00:33:01,425
The thing earlier...

349
00:33:02,185 --> 00:33:02,945
The...

350
00:33:08,304 --> 00:33:08,864
Wait.

351
00:33:09,384 --> 00:33:10,465
What the heck is that?

352
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,345
What's this, Third Master?

353
00:34:28,704 --> 00:34:29,544
Young Third Master!

354
00:34:29,825 --> 00:34:30,704
Young Third Master!

355
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:31,865
Da Kui.

356
00:34:36,385 --> 00:34:37,385
What are you doing?

357
00:34:38,345 --> 00:34:39,584
Something there is blocking us.

358
00:34:39,785 --> 00:34:40,985
It even pulled me.

359
00:34:41,465 --> 00:34:42,664
A monster is there too.

360
00:34:43,184 --> 00:34:44,785
You mentioned seven monsters.

361
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,144
What are these?

362
00:35:02,264 --> 00:35:03,305
They are big!

363
00:35:04,785 --> 00:35:05,985
Isn't he that fat guy?

364
00:35:06,785 --> 00:35:08,544
He's the one Xiaoge and I were chasing.

365
00:35:09,825 --> 00:35:10,505
Who are you?

366
00:35:10,744 --> 00:35:12,584
Who are you? I should be asking you!

367
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:16,505
Bro,

368
00:35:16,505 --> 00:35:17,224
get me up first,

369
00:35:17,224 --> 00:35:18,305
and I'll tell you who I am.

370
00:35:18,305 --> 00:35:18,985
Right.

371
00:35:20,345 --> 00:35:22,465
You're saving him
without even knowing who he is?

372
00:35:25,664 --> 00:35:27,385
Help me, please!

373
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,425
Let's help him first.

374
00:35:30,425 --> 00:35:31,865
We can outnumber him.

375
00:35:32,184 --> 00:35:33,104
Grab me.

376
00:35:33,425 --> 00:35:34,505
You're the best.

377
00:35:34,505 --> 00:35:35,785
Give me a hand. Thanks.

378
00:35:35,785 --> 00:35:36,544
Come on.

379
00:35:40,345 --> 00:35:41,104
Young Third Master!

380
00:35:49,945 --> 00:35:51,664
Young Third Master, get up here.

381
00:36:00,385 --> 00:36:01,584
My butt.
