00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,720
(Episode 29)

2
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,720
What do you want?

3
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,840
A Yan,

4
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,640
stop torturing yourself.

5
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,920
Tell me what's bothering you.

6
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,320
If something bothers you,

7
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,720
would you tell me?

8
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,920
Yes, I would.

9
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,640
No, you wouldn't.

10
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,400
I would!

11
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,480
You didn't tell me
about your trip to Sydney.

12
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,640
♪ But I would still
jump in without hesitation ♪

13
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,040
♪ I knew another step forward
may be the prison ♪

14
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,480
So...

15
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,520
you knew about it.

16
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,040
A Yan,

17
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,160
be strong.

18
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,360
I'll go with you to see your mom.

19
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,400
I...

20
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,760
She's your mother.

21
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,120
She's the one who loves you the most
in this world.

22
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,000
She's my mother?

23
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,880
I can't accept this!

24
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,800
How can I not be my parent's child?

25
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm not the son of Zhou Binli.

26
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,520
What will happen to Shenghai?

27
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,600
What will happen to us?

28
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,840
This joke is too much!

29
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,880
Why did my mom abandon me?

30
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,920
I'm his son.

31
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,800
A Yan, everything will be fine.

32
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,440
I'll go visit your mom with you.

33
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,920
We'll go see her first thing tomorrow.

35

37

Director Lin, I'm Xiaomeng.

38
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,440
Coming.

39
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,920
A Yan, you're here too.

40
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,240
Come in.

41
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,760
You've not eaten, right?

42
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,440
I'll cook some dishes.

43
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,760
Director Lin, we're fine.

44
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,480
I asked A Yan to come visit you.

45
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,800
How have you been?

46
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,400
I'm good.

47
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,760
What about you?

48
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,160
How have you been?

49
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,160
I'm good.

50
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,200
I just...

51
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,520
miss my mom.

52
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,520
I'm sorry. I don't know what to say.

53
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,920
It's fine.

54
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,040
You don't have to say anything, son.

55
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,800
I did you wrong.

56
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,400
I shouldn't have left you alone then.

57
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,720
I was in pain all these years.

58
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,040
Please don't hate me.

I'm sorry.

68
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,680
I found out what happened.

69
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,520
It's not your fault.

70
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,720
No, it's my fault.

71
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,480
It's my fault.

72
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,720
I didn't fulfill my duty as a mother.

73
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,480
You gave birth to me.

74
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,040
You're my only family in this world now.

75
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,600
This is the best present.

76
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,520
But I...

77
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,760
I'm still

78
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,480
not used to addressing you.

79
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,080
It's fine.

80
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,200
You don't have to. It's all right.

81
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,600
Give me some time.

82
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,720
Let us be each other's family again.

83
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,560
Let me and Xiaomeng
take care of you from now on.

84
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,720
Sure.

85
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,640
Sure.

86
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,760
Xiaomeng.

87
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,240
That's right.

88
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,200
Let us take care of you from now on.

89
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,040
Good...

90
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,920
Good.

91
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,960
I...

92
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,400
What is it?

93
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,640
Nothing.

94
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,040
A Yan,

95
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,640
I know you must be
having mixed feelings now.

96
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,520
But don't dwell on it.

97
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,240
I'll always be by your side.

98
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,480
Jiang Ze.

99
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,960
Zitong? Why are you here?

100
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,320
I just happen to pass by your office.

101
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,520
Are you free now? Let's go for dinner.

102
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,360
I have a dinner appointment

103
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,920
with my dad today.

104
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,680
Let's do it some other day.

105
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,040
Let's invite Xiaomeng.
I'll treat you to some good food.

106
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,080
Actually, I came today

107
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,320
because of Xiaomeng.

108
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,400
What's wrong with her?

109
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,200
She encountered such difficulties

110
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,920
but she doesn't want to trouble us.

111
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,400
As her best friend, I want to help her.

112
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,480
Why didn't Xiaomeng approach me?

113
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,320
What trouble is she facing?

114
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,640
How can I help?

115
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,320
I know of a good cafe nearby.

116
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,680
Let's talk while we eat. Come on.

117
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,520
Let's go.

118
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,520
What's wrong?

119
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,240
My stomach hurts.

120
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,960
Why so sudden?

121
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,240
I don't know.

122
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,680
It hurts...

123
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,600
It hurts.

124
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,640
Are you all right?

125
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,040
Why the sudden pain?

126
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,000
I don't know.

127
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,600
Hang on. We'll reach your house soon.

128
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,880
What's the password?

129
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,800
It's 654322.

130
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,480
It's all my fault.

131
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,520
We could've enjoyed a nice meal

132
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,480
but I spoilt it.

133
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,720
It's fine.

134
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,480
Take some medicine when you're back.

135
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,640
Thank goodness you were with me today.

136
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,960
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to
make it home.

137
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,840
Do you want to come in
for a coffee or tea?

138
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,040
No, thanks. You should go in and rest.

139
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,600
Jiang Ze,

140
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,520
don't leave.

141
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,440
Won't you worry I'll be all alone?

142
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,920
Hello?

143
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,080
Okay, fine.

144
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,000
I got it.

145
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,120
What's wrong? Something happened?

146
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,320
I can't keep you company.

147
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,600
I have more important things to attend to.

148
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,800
Are you all right?

149
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,880
Is it your bossy boss?

150
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,040
Jiang Ze, stay with me, please.

151
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,520
I'll call you about Xiaomeng's matter.

152
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,480
Jiang Ze...

153
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,760
How is it?

154
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,760
You got what I want?

155
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,880
Did you get a picture of him
holding my hands at my door?

156
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,320
Don't worry. I've got
everything in my camera.

157
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,720
Choose a few which show our intimacy.

158
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,120
Upload them onto the internet.

159
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,760
Isn't that exposure?

160
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,320
Hello, handsome guy.

161
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,760
Are you alone?

162
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm Nana. What's your name?

163
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,000
Get lost.

164
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,840
What did you say?

165
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,760
Get lost!

166
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,640
Are you crazy?

167
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,160
What's wrong?

168
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,120
She's quite pretty.

169
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,320
Why are you so fierce to her?

170
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,120
Did some women upset you

171
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,160
or were you rejected?

172
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,760
Leave me alone.

173
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,800
This place does not belong to Shenghai.

174
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,360
I can sit wherever I like.

175
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,440
You have no say in this.

176
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,720
Where are you going?

177
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,600
Get out of my way!

178
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,600
Are you mad?

179
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,480
Come on!

180
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,720
You're drunk, right?

181
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,160
You want to fight, right?

182
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,360
Fine, let's fight!

183
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,080
Come on.

184
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,080
Again.

185
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,680
A Yan.

186
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,960
A Yan.

187
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,840
A Yan, what happened to you?

188
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,000
What happened?

189
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,720
What's wrong?

190
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,800
I'm fine.

191
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,240
Leave me alone.

192
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,480
I--

193
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,160
Cold and detached is probably
the only expression I have now.

194
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,520
Only then

195
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,440
can others not see my sadness.

196
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,480
I thought pretending not to care

197
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,920
can shield me from all the hurt.

198
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,000
But all shields crumbles

199
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,480
in the face of such destiny.

200
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,760
1974 Petrus...

201
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,800
I didn’t expect it to be still here.

202
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,640
You're still saving it.

203
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,520
This is a 35 years' wine.

204
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,440
It's already 35 years old?

205
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,920
Yes.

206
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,400
So wine has ages too.

207
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,800
Why do we need
to wait so long to drink it?

208
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,880
Time.

209
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,920
We taste these wines
which have withstand the years

210
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,960
to appreciate the taste of time.

211
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,760
Time has a taste?

212
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,720
Yes, time has a taste.

213
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,400
You'll understand when you grow up.

214
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,560
Time makes people grow up

215
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,360
and forget things

216
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,600
they don't want to remember.

217
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,480
It makes people

218
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,760
understand what's
the most important in life.

219
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,280
And it makes you understand

220
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,160
what is love

221
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,520
and what is hate.

222
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,320
In the years I was abroad,

223
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,640
I doubt there was anyone at home
who would drink with you.

224
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,920
You made it sound so profound

225
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,200
but it doesn't taste that special.

226
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,960
Dad,

227
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,840
you should drink too.

228
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,440
Too bad I won't get to hear your comments.

229
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,040
I didn't expect myself to be...

230
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,200
faced with so many trials
after you're gone.

231
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,040
I found out a lot of things
these two days.

232
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,640
If you're still around,

233
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,880
you'll probably keep them from me forever.

234
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,000
How I wish I can lose my memory.

235
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,440
To forget everything...

236
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,400
and go back to the past.

237
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,280
I'm still your son.

238
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,880
And you're still the father

239
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,240
whom I worship in my heart

240
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,400
although I never admit it.

241
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,800
How dare you

242
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,920
sneak out in the middle of the night?

243
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,120
You even climbed in
through other people's window.

244
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,200
I didn't see you today.

245
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,240
Where were you fooling around?

246
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,320
Fooling around?

247
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,960
Dad, don't you remember
what day it is today?

248
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,480
I don't care what day it is.

249
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,520
The fact that you climbed through

250
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,240
other people's window
warrants a beating from me.

251
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,640
I went to the graveyard to see Mom.

252
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,360
It's her death anniversary today!

253
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,400
Go on.

254
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,040
Beat me. Beat me to death
and I'll be able to meet Mom.

255
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,400
Come on!

256
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,800
You think I wouldn't dare to?

257
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,040
-Come on.
-I'll beat you to death.

258
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,520
I'll beat you to death.

259
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,920
How dare you talk back?

260
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,640
To tell you the truth, I hate you.

261
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,880
I hate that you're my father.

262
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,640
All you care about is money.

263
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,120
I've even thought of

264
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,000
asking God to give me a new father.

265
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,280
I didn’t expect...

266
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,360
this wish to come true...

267
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,480
after so many years.

268
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,040
But now I'd rather you're still around

269
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,320
and our family's still the same.

270
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,320
Even if it's just a tinge of warmth

271
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,160
and although we're always quarreling,

272
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,440
at least we're all around.

273
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,640
The family would still be intact.

274
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,480
Dad...

275
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,120
Zhou Binli,

276
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,400
if not for the Fang Family,
you'll never make it.

277
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,040
My sister's gone for only a few years

278
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,320
and you already want to remarry?

279
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,040
Dream on!

280
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,400
Binli, we've said our piece.

281
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,760
This is our stance.

282
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,640
Meijiao treated you well
when she was alive.

283
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,360
If you make her sad in the netherworld,

284
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,360
then you're up against our family.

285
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,200
In that case, we can forget about
the capital investment.

286
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,560
A person should learn to be grateful.

287
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,360
You have to think clearly.

288
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,680
If you insist on a remarriage,
we won't stop you.

289
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,400
But we'll certainly
take back our investments.

290
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,080
I can't allow my daughter to be bullied.

291
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,960
Exactly!

292
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:10,000
(Three years later)

293
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,200
Why?

294
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,280
She's died years ago.

295
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,480
But you guys still refuse to let me go.

296
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,600
I can't marry the person I love,

297
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,120
and I can't acknowledge

298
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,040
my own daughter.

299
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,720
I'm so useless!

300
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,600
A man without money is no man at all.

301
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,760
I'll be subject to their control
my whole life.

302
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,120
I'm not worthy of being a man.

303
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,320
I've decided.

304
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,520
Watch us from heavens

305
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,960
and bless Xiaomeng.

306
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,680
From today onwards,

307
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,760
I'll live only for Xiaomeng.

308
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,600
Shenghai belongs to her.

309
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,880
After everything settles,

310
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,280
I'll return an intact
Shenghai Group to her.

311
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,840
And like you,

312
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,040
I'll keep this

313
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,840
a secret forever.

314
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,720
If these are trials
that fate presents us with,

315
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,520
then let me bare all these myself.

316
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,440
Dad, what do you think?

317
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,640
I hope Xiaomeng

318
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,800
will forever be the girl who spins

319
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,240
and jumps in the gymnastics hall,

320
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,480
just like how I remember her to be.

Xiaomeng,

326
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,520
do you hate me?

327
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,160
No.

328
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,200
I don't.

329
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,680

Because even for hate,

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,920
I have to place the person
in my heart for a long time.

337
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,920
Be it love

338
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,200
or hate,

339
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,840
they're all too heavy.

340
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,360
I don't want that anymore.

341
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,400
You're right.

342
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,480
Be it love or hate,

343
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,720
it's all because
the person's still around.

344
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,000
Once that person's gone,

345
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,840
everything's in the past.

I have a headache.

351
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,640

Yes.

367
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,200
We were like this in the past too.

368
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,840
When I was tired from boxing,

369
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,840
you helped me massage.

370
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,200
Yes.

371
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,000
And you would fall asleep

372
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,760
in the process.

373
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,720
What's wrong?

374
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,680
A Yan.

375
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,760
You're finally

376
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,960
willing to recollect our past now.

377
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,600
Is it because

378
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,040
the Xiaomeng in your heart

379
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,080

Hello?

386
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,560
Okay, I got it.

387
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,880
-I've amended this document...
-Come in.

388
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,840
per your instructions.

389
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,920
Please check if it's fine.

390
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,640
President Zhou, I just received news

391
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,640
that a serious accident
occurred at Dikai Commercial City.

392
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,120
Have you informed Jiang Qingcheng?

393
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,480
Vice President Jiang is
still on a business trip.

394
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,240
There's a minor accident
at Dikai Commercial City, I--

395
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,520
A minor accident?

396
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,240
How can you talk about it so casually?

397
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,320
Should we wait for my dad to come back?

398
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,920
You still want to drag this on?

399
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,280
Now that things have happened,
we have to think of a solution.

400
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,160
Got it?

401
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,480
Okay, I'll listen to you.

402
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,120
Let's go to the hospital first.

403
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,760
We'll think of a solution then.

404
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,680
ACCIDENT IN SHENGHAI'S DK COMMERCIAL CITY
10 PLUS INJURED AT CONSTRUCTION SITE

405
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,240
Zhou Yanzhao is here!

406
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,400
Dear.

407
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,840
Yes...

408
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,600
Who's the person-in-charge?

409
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,760
I am.

410
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,480
You can talk to me.

411
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,880
Everyone, this is President Zhou
from Shenghai Group.

412
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,200
President Zhou,

413
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,760
you have to take responsibility for this.

414
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,760
More than ten people were hurt.

415
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,800
How can something so serious
happen at the construction site?

416
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,080
Madam, please rest assured

417
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,720
that the company will bear

418
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,360
all the medical expenses.

419
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,160
Your site has quality issues.

420
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,240
Who is responsible for this?

421
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,800
Sir, we're still investigating the matter.

422
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,920
Don't worry.

423
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,560
The results will be out soon.

424
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,440
I know what you guys are up to.

425
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,720
You said you'll investigate

426
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,440
but in the end, you'll blame it on us.

427
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,400
Right. This is so common.

428
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,240
My husband suffered the worst injury.

429
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,320
He's still in the emergency room.

430
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,640
If something bad happens to him,

431
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,280
how will my family live?

432
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,160
Compensate us.

433
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,240
Right, compensate us.

434
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,600
-Right, compensate us.
-Compensate us.

435
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,080
Your company must have pocketed the money

436
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,960
and deliberately cut corners.

437
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,200
You're murderers!

438
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,800
Yes, my dad was seriously hurt
because of you guys.

439
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,240
He's still in coma now.

440
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,600
You must take full responsibility.

441
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,480
Don't worry, we'll...

442
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,120
President Zhou will definitely investigate

443
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,680
and give you an answer.

444
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,880
Your dad's not hurt.

445
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,080
Of course you're not worry.

446
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,120
You must give us an answer today. Right?

447
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,040
-Right.
-Yes, he must.

448
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,440
You must give us an answer.

449
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,640
-Quiet!
-Give us an answer.

450
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,680
We're in a hospital. Calm down.

451
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,680
The workers are undergoing
emergency treatment now.

452
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,920
Don't hinder the doctors.

453
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,160
How is the situation?

454
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,320
There are 12 injured.

455
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,320
Three are seriously injured
while the rest suffered minor injuries.

456
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,040
Everyone, I understand your feelings.

457
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,280
An accident no one wants
happened at our site.

458
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,760
Rest assured,

459
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,240
I'll work with the authorities to conduct
a thorough investigation

460
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,360
and give you an explanation.

461
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,360
But right now,

462
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,520
rescuing them is the most important.

463
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,280
If you want your loved ones

464
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,600
to recover as soon as possible,

465
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,800
don't kick up a row here.

466
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,200
Let's go outside to wait for news.

467
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,080
Okay?

468
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,680
We came from other cities.

469
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,560
Where can we stay?
And how about our meals?

470
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,880
The company will take care of everything.

471
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,240
Follow me to my office.

472
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,640
Qingyan,

473
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,680
take care of this with Lingxi.

474
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,840
Sure.

475
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Everyone, follow me.

476
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,440
Let's go.

477
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,720
-Okay.
-Let's go.

478
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,800
Please have a seat.

479
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,480
You have to be mentally prepared.

480
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,680
Of the three
who suffered serious injuries,

481
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,360
one's in critical condition.

482
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,480
We'll try our best to save him.

483
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,720
Where's Uncle Jiang?

484
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,440
I've informed him.

485
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,840
He's on his way back.

486
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,600
No matter what,

487
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,760
I have to thank you
for coming forward today.

488
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,120
No matter what,

489
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,280
Dikai is Shenghai's project.

490
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,520
I won't stand by and do nothing.

491
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,720
This accident may affect
Shenghai's reputation.

492
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,400
Now that this has happened,

493
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,920
we just need to discuss the solution

494
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,040
and not the outcome.

495
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,360
The injured
must be properly taken care of.

496
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,960
Try to meet their requests.

497
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,600
More than just appeasing them,
this is what we should do.

498
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,840
Think about it.

499
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,000
The workers don't earn much.

500
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,240
The whole family
may be dependent on his salary.

501
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,800
Such an accident is a devastating blow

502
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,960
to all the families.

503
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,880
We can't sit back and do nothing.

504
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,880
I understand.

505
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,720
I'll do my best to meet their demands

506
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,040
for the treatment costs and compensation.

507
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,800
What I'm worried about is the media.

508
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,400
I've involved the PR department.

509
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,080
As long as we handle this transparently,

510
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,360
let them be.

511
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,720
We can finally take a break.

512
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,120
Those people are
so demanding and difficult.

513
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,960
It's been tough on you.

514
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,480
I'm not good at words

515
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,120
and I don't know how to comfort others.

516
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,080
Luckily you're around.

517
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,720
Or else I wouldn't be able

518
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,480
to handle this on my own.

519
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:07,960
Come to think of it,

520
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,480
they're really unfortunate.

521
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,080
A huge misfortune
suddenly befalls on them.

522
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,720
It's understandable

523
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,200
why they're so agitated.

524
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,400
Of course I understand.

525
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,440
I wanted to help

526
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,280
but I had to face
so many people by myself.

527
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,240
What's worse is
they treated me like a murderer.

528
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,400
You saw it yourself.

529
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,080
This is a tough nut to crack.

530
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,880
Yes.

531
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,280
I think this matter

532
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,360
will take another day or two to settle.

533
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,520
Why don't you go home to rest?

534
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,520
I'll take care of matters here.

535
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,920
Can you do it?

536
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,360
I've learned a lot from you.

537
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,160
I should be able to handle it.

538
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,120
I'll leave it to you then.

539
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,480
For you...

540
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,960
It's what I should do

541
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,640
for the company.

542
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,400
I'm off then.

543
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,200
-Bye.
-Bye.

544
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,680
Sister, where's your husband?

545
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,840
Why isn't he picking up calls?

546
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,840
He went out early this morning.

547
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,440
I couldn't contact him either.

548
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,640
What's wrong?

549
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,760
Hello?

550
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,360
When he's back, ask him to return my call.

551
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
How are things?

552
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,120
How are things?

553
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,040
I've helped the injured workers
and their family settle down.

554
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,600
There are 12 workers hurt.

555
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,840
Three are seriously injured.

556
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,920
One of them...

557
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,200
I'm asking you
about the construction site.

558
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,000
All work there has halted.

559
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,600
The police wants us
to cooperate with their investigation.

560
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,840
Uncle Jiang, we have to
get to the bottom of this.

561
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,160
Find out the cause and who's responsible

562
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,320
so that we can answer to the injured.

563
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,320
Yes.

564
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,280
Our group has never had
such major accident.

565
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,360
If we don't handle this well,

566
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,480
Shenghai's reputation may be affected.

567
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,640
I'll take care of this.

568
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,720
A Ze, give some money to the workers.

569
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,200
Ask them to mind their words.

570
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,000
Uncle Jiang,

571
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,640
there are 12 casualties in this accident.

572
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,280
Behind them are 12 families

573
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,120
who are in a state of anxiety.

574
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,320
This matter can't be resolved with money.

575
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,160
Then what do you want?

576
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,040
I think both you and the group

577
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,600
should show our sincerity
in resolving this.

578
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,160
Right now, I've no sincerity
towards those workers.

579
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,840
For all you know,

580
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,240
they may have caused the accident.

581
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,200
Uncle Jiang!

582
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,200
President Zhou, what do you mean by this?

583
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,960
Are you trying to tell me

584
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,680
you're the one behind this?

585
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,720
Uncle Jiang,

586
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,640
what do you mean?

587
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,560
What do I mean?

588
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,960
You just want to ruin
Dikai Commercial City

589
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,400
so that you can
pit against me as an equal.

590
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,800
Let's wait for the investigation results

591
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,240
to know the truth.

592
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,880
Excuse me. I have to go
arrange for the investigation.

593
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,080
Directors,
please keep your mobile phones on.

594
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,480
I'll contact you
if there are any problems.

595
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,840
Zhou Yanzhao is still very young.

596
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,680
This has a great impact on the company.

597
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,800
He's inexperienced.

598
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,560
Come in.

599
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,240
Xiaomeng, why are you here?

600
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,760
I saw the news,

601
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,400
so I came over to take a look.

602
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,840
A Yan, are the workers

603
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,840
seriously injured?

604
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,360
Three of them are seriously injured

605
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,240
and one is still in critical condition.

606
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,000
Others suffered minor injuries.
They're all hospitalized now.

607
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,040
How did this accident happen?

608
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,680
What went wrong?

609
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,640
We're still investigating.

610
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,880
Nobody expected this to happen.

611
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,960
Uncle Zhou said before

612
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,120
all projects of Shenghai

613
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,120
are guaranteed to be of good quality.

614
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,120
And this is what he's most proud of.

615
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,600
Yes.

616
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,480
That's precisely why

617
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,040
I don't want Shenghai's reputation
to be tarnished.

618
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,280
No matter what price I have to pay,

619
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,120
I'll find out the truth.
