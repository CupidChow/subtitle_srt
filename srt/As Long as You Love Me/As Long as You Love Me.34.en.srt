1
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,760
(Episode 34)

2
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,520
Xiaomeng.

3
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,280
Xiaomeng.

4
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,440
What's wrong?

5
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,560
I'm fine.

6
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,080
Let's get ready then.

7
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,360
-Okay.
-Let's go.

8
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,440
It's starting.

9
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,320
Wendy, look!

10
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,480
It's so beautiful.

11
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,040
Wendy.

12
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,040
Is this our dreamland?

13
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,560
Really? You and me.

14
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,480
Yes, it's a dreamland.

15
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,360
How do you

16
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,680
really feel?

17
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,800
What do you feel?

18
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,360
Is it happiness, sadness, anger, jealousy,

19
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,560
or love?

20
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,560
Love?

21
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,200
Yes, love.

22
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,480
No, never.

23
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,360
You must've heard about it.

24
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,120
You must've felt it

25
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,440
for somebody.

26
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,040
No.

27
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,440
That's terrible!

28
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,840
Wendy,

29
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,840
why must you ruin the mood?

30
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,680
I teach you how to fly.

31
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,440
You teach me how to tell stories.

32
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,560
Isn't it wonderful?

33
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,920
There are many more things

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,160
we don't know about.

35
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,640
When we grow up,

36
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,200
we'll feel them too.

37
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,800
Never.

38
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,720
I'll never grow up.

39
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,520
Tell us

40
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,640
about Peter.

41
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,520
All I know is his name is Peter Pan.

42
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,040
He doesn't want to grow up.

43
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,960
That's why we've flown to Neverland.

44
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,560
I'm sure he's very happy then.

45
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,240
Yes, but he's very lonely too.

46
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,280
Lonely?

47
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,240
That's why he needs Wendy.

48
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,440
But why?

49
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,040
He likes my stories.

50
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,600
Stories? What stories?

51
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,200
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,

52
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,120
and Cinderella.

53
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,240
Love stories?

54
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,320
In these stories,

55
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,680
good always triumphs over evil.

56
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,720
All right. Now tell me.

57
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,880
Why can he fly?

58
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,000
You old rascal! Let go of her!

59
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,360
Look.

60
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,400
Peter Pan?

61
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,520
Great, you're finally here.

62
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,320
Let's battle to our death.

63
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,920
My pleasure.

64
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,360
Poor child.

65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,960
Think about it.

66
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,120
Your Wendy is about to leave you.

67
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,960
You will die a lonely death

68
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,200
without love!

69
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,720
Now let's hear

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,760
Wendy bidding farewell to Peter.

71
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,040
Wendy.

72
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,880
It's great.

73
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,440
We're finally going home.

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,080
Yes, yes.

75
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,560
-It's great.
-It's great.

76
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,080
Wendy.

77
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,400
Peter Pan.

78
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,640
We've decided to go home.

79
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,000
We want to grow up.

80
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,640
Wendy. Why...

81
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,080
do you all want to grow up?

82
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,480
We could be children forever.

83
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,800
We'll be so happy.

84
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,880
What's wrong with that?

85
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,360
Peter Pan, listen to me.

86
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,880
One day when you get it,

87
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,560
you can leave Neverland

88
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,720
and come to us.

89
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,000
The world outside

90
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,040
is not as scary as you think.

91
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,880
Let's get to know it.

92
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,240
Let's get to feel it.

93
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,240
Okay.

94
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,360
Let's go to the outside world together.

95
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,520
It's good.

96
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,760
Miss Xiaomeng! Miss Xiaomeng!

97
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,840
Tiankong!

98
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,240
Miss Xiaomeng!

99
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
-Tiankong, look.
-She's over there.

100
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,920
-Go.
-Go on.

101
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,680
-Miss Xiaomeng!
-Tiankong.

102
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,920
Tiankong, do you like the play?

103
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,480
Miss Xiaomeng, this is for you.

104
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,800
I've made it myself.

105
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,520
It's so cute. Thank you, Tiankong.

106
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
I really like it.

107
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,280
Aunt Lin.

108
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,240
You were great today.

109
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,240
Congratulations.

110
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,640
Thank you.

111
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,920
Miss Zhou, congratulations
to your excellent performance.

112
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,600
Would you answer a few questions?

113
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,280
I'm sorry.

114
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,320
I'm not doing interviews today.

115
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,320
Zitong.

116
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,320
-It's Zitong.
-Hurry.

117
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,840
-Who is she?
-Zitong, Zitong.

118
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,520
Have you come to show
your support for Xiaomeng?

119
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,160
Of course. We were classmates,

120
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,240
as well as best friends.

121
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,480
Her performance today is a great success.

122
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,480
I'm really happy for her.

123
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,040
-Xiaomeng.
-Director Lin.

124
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,320
I'll let you guys talk.

125
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,800
Xiaomeng.

126
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,080
You were wonderful today.

127
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,960
Let's go somewhere to celebrate. My treat.

128
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,440
Thank you.

129
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,440
Zhen, where's my mother?

130
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,120
I told Xiao Sizhi
to take her and Sister Hua home.

131
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,600
I wanted to bring her to see you,

132
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,840
but the backstage was so crowded.

133
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,800
So I sent them home first.

134
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,880
Zitong. Are you here today
with your boyfriend?

135
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,760
About the rumored love triangle
among the three of you,

136
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,840
do you have anything to say?

137
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,080
I'm sorry.

138
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,720
Today is about Peter Pan.

139
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,440
I don't want to answer
any other questions.

140
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,400
Xiaomeng.

141
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,720
Let me take you away from all this gossip.

142
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,840
Let me tell Aunt Lin.

143
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,720
Okay.

144
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,080
Do you like it, Aunt Lin?

145
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,080
I'm sorry but I have to leave.

146
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,800
All right, go ahead.

147
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,840
Tiankong.

148
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,920
I'll visit you again when I'm free, okay?

149
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,560
-Okay.
-I'm going then.

150
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,440
Let's go together.

151
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,440
-Bye bye.
-Rest well. Bye bye.

152
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,280
Bye bye.

153
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,520
-Let's go.
-We should go too.

154
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,080
-Let's go.
-Okay, let's go.

155
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,400
Excuse me.

156
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,360
Hello.

157
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,720
Are you here for the play too?

158
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,680
What do you think?

159
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,760
It is amazing.

160
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,720
I really like Miss Xiaomeng.

161
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,120
Her children's plays

162
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,280
and her stories

163
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,400
are my favorites.

164
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,280
I think Xiaomeng
did the art show for this kid.

165
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,120
Yes, it's him.

166
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,840
-Good job.
-Hello. Are you from the Welfare Center?

167
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,920
Yes, we're from the Welfare Center.

168
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,000
His name is Tiankong.

169
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,320
Xiaomeng used to visit
the Welfare Center to tell stories.

170
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,160
She befriended Tiankong there.

171
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,040
She did an art show for him previously.

172
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,880
Moreover, he had an eye condition.

173
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,240
He just had an operation.

174
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,760
None of this could've been done

175
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,520
without Xiaomeng's help.

176
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,000
Well,

177
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,080
this is my business card.

178
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,240
Could you give me your contact?

179
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,200
I would like to do an in-depth interview

180
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,640
about Xiaomeng and Tiankong.

181
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,800
Sure. Okay.

182
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,840
That'll be great.

183
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,080
Here it is.

184
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,880
Okay, thank you.

185
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,840
We won't bother you any further.

186
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,160
Okay, thank you guys.

187
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,560
-Okay.
-Thank you. Goodbye.

188
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,080
Let's have a toast
to Xiaomeng's great opening night!

189
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,040
May the good reviews pour in!

190
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,720
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

191
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,080
Thank you guys.

192
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,680
I wouldn't be here without your support.

193
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,600
Xiaomeng.

194
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,080
It was all your hard work.

195
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,800
We're all so happy for you.

196
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,000
Yes, Xiaomeng.

197
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,360
You did so well today.

198
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,800
Will you consider
becoming a professional actor?

199
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,160
I have no such plan for now.

200
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,720
However,

201
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
I really enjoy doing children's plays.

202
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,320
The director was telling me

203
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,240
his investors want to adapt
other fairy tales.

204
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,240
He's interested in working with us again.

205
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,560
-Really?
-Yes.

206
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,600
That's great!

207
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,720
Listen, Xiaomeng.

208
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,640
I'm so happy.

209
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,400
You've finally found a job
that makes you happy.

210
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,160
Let's drink to that.

211
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,480
A Qi, thank you.

212
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,400
Xiaomeng, no matter when,

213
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,680
no matter what you're doing,

214
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,720
I will support you as always .

215
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,920
Jiang Ze,

216
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,160
you have been
my strongest pillar of support.

217
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,280
Here's my toast to you.

218
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,880
Xiaomeng,
I want to propose a toast to you too.

219
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,600
If you didn't recommend me to the station,

220
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,440
I wouldn't be here today.

221
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,120
No worries, Zitong.

222
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,720
You are always very talented.

223
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,280
It is just a matter of time.

224
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,600
Cheers.

225
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,720
Zitong,

226
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,920
you're the most hyped celebrity
at this table now.

227
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,640
Stop teasing me.

228
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,840
Come, let's eat.

229
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,680
-Here, Zhen.
-It smells so good.

230
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,320
This smells so good.

231
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,200
Really?

232
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,920
By the way, Zhen.

233
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,040
Why isn't Dr. Xiao here yet?

234
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,240
He's probably on his way.

235
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,320
Let's not wait for him.

236
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,120
Let's just eat. Go on.

237
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,680
This is pretty good.

238
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,520
Thank you guys.

239
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,840
Cheers once again.

240
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,440
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

241
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,080
Where are we going?

242
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,000
-We're going home.
-Going home?

243
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,840
-Be good.
-I'm not drunk.

244
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,280
I want to drink more.

245
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,560
Zhen.

246
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,200
I want to drink more.

247
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,040
-Why didn't you come in?
-Be careful.

248
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,920
-Standing here like a fool.
-A Qi!

249
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,960
He's drunk.

250
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,360
I'm not drunk at all.

251
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,920
-Be careful.
-I know, you're not drunk.

252
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,640
Jiang Ze, take her home.

253
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,640
-I'm fine.
-I'll go with Dr. Xiao.

254
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,720
Look how drunk she is.

255
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,760
Drunk.

256
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,000
if it's anybody else taking her home,

257
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,480
we'd be worried.

258
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,560
So you won't worry

259
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,960
if I take her home?

260
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,280
Jiang Ze, you're the best.

261
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,680
Please take her home.

262
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,320
I know

263
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,320
you won't say no to me, right?

264
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,080
All right, since you put it that way.

265
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,160
I won't say no.

266
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,560
Get home safely.

267
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,480
Okay.

268
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,560
Bye.

269
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,560
A Qi, are you okay?

270
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,360
I'm okay. I'm just happy for you.

271
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,680
-It's true, Xiaomeng.
-Are you okay?

272
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,200
Xiaomeng.

273
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,840
You're so nice to Zitong.

274
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,920
Look at her.

275
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,160
She's throwing herself at Jiang Ze.

276
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,760
If Zitong really gets together with him,

277
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,280
I'll be happy for them.

278
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,440
I'll be happy for them too.

279
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,480
I wish them the best.

280
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,240
(Nanyue Taxi)

281
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,280
Drive.

282
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,120
Xiaomeng, I have to work tomorrow.

283
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,280
But A Qi...

284
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,840
It's okay, I'll take care of him.

285
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,920
Go home.

286
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,920
I'm going then.

287
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,160
Take care, okay?

288
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,200
-Don't worry.
-Bye bye.

289
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,320
-Bye bye. Bye bye.
-Take care.

290
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,880
You're leaving?

291
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,360
-A Qi.
-Drive the car round

292
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,400
and take us home.

293
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,960
-Okay.
-Go.

294
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,960
Zhen,

295
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,000
Dr. Xiao is just like a little sun.

296
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,720
He's so warm to everyone.

297
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,960
What's the use?

298
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,760
Don't you think he sometimes lacks

299
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,560
the masculinity of a tough guy?

300
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,640
Zhen,

301
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,200
who cares about tough guy in this age?

302
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,160
He's good to you.

303
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,600
He loves you, adores you,
and cherishes you.

304
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,480
He gives you everything.

305
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,720
Isn't that enough?

306
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,040
I don't know.

307
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,640
I love him very much.

308
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,960
I want him to meet my parents.

309
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,680
But he's been evading.

310
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,440
He says he's not ready.

311
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,160
I think

312
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,400
maybe he's just very proud.

313
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,920
He thinks he can't give you what you want.

314
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,040
And you're so talented too.

315
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,800
That's why he feels the pressure.

316
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,640
I just want a person

317
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,320
who knows me and loves me.

318
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,640
I don't care about anything else.

319
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,160
Why can't he get that?

320
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,480
Why can't he get that?

321
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,880
Love is a path

322
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,560
we have to go through ourselves.

323
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,560
Treasure whom you're with.

324
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,760
Stop talking about me.

325
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,200
I want to give you a word of advice.

326
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,080
You should be

327
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,360
cautious of Zitong.

328
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,880
Are you joking?

329
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,320
She was my classmate in college,

330
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,560
and a very close friend.

331
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,800
I've been working with her at the station.

332
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,480
I kind of know what she's like.

333
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,400
She's indeed hardworking and smart.

334
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,720
But she's also very manipulative.

335
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
Think about it.

336
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,160
She's only just started

337
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,840
but she's already got the management
to give her a new program.

338
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,360
Don't you think

339
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,880
that's really incredible?

340
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,320
You're probably thinking too much.

341
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,480
Maybe Zitong is just very talented.

342
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,480
Just be careful.

343
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,920
It's better safe than sorry.

344
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,680
I know you're just looking out for me.

345
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,000
You're just too kind.

346
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,360
Sometimes it's not good to be kind.

347
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,800
Saying you're kind is putting it nicely.

348
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,880
To be honest,

349
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,600
you're just a fool.

350
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,440
You're just a fool!

351
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,440
Whatever the case,

352
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,800
I always believe

353
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,440
a fool has a fool's luck.

354
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,520
Look at you.

355
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,360
If one day you get sold for a dime,

356
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,760
you'd probably worry

357
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,560
whoever has sold you
isn't making enough money.

358
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,600
Dr. Xiao is here. Let's go.

359
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:10,880
Let's go.

360
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,840
I don't want to.

361
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,920
-A Qi, let's go!
-I'm not going!

362
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,240
Come on, be good.

363
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,200
Watch your step.

364
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,840
Jiang Ze, stay with me.

365
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,880
Don't leave.

366
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,240
Jiang Ze, stay with me.

367
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,520
Don't go.

368
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,760
Hello?

369
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,720
Xiaomeng.

370
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,760
Zitong is asleep.

371
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,680
Don't worry.

372
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,240
I'll take care of her.

373
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,920
Go to bed. I'm going home.

374
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,040
Jiang Ze.

375
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,760
Jiang Ze! Jiang Ze!

376
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,640
You've been drinking.

377
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,160
A little bit.

378
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,000
The play went well today.

379
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,400
I was really happy.

380
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,760
Yan, you know,

381
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,080
I haven't been so happy in a long time.

382
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,840
The next time you drink,

383
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,520
let Guang knows beforehand

384
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,480
so that he can pick you up, okay?

385
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,000
Okay, I will.

386
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,200
Are you feeling sick?

387
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,120
Come.

388
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,360
If you can't drink,

389
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,880
you shouldn't drink so much.

390
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,640
Yan.

391
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,040
Is the Luofeng Sports Center

392
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,960
going well?

393
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,800
Yes.

394
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,160
I just don't get it.

395
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,000
Why would you build a sports center?

396
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,920
It's not like you as a businessman.

397
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,800
What am I like then?

398
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,880
You're demanding and cold.

399
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,840
You seek a high profit and return,
and nothing else.

400
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,400
A sports center is about public welfare.

401
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,520
Why would you dedicate to it?

402
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,840
I remember...

403
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,560
when we were in the Sports Institute,
you said

404
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,680
that if one day,

405
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,200
you become a businessman,

406
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,720
you'd do a better job than Uncle Zhou.

407
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,640
You'd never allow

408
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,640
the company to make a loss.

409
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,360
The sports center might look
like a public welfare project.

410
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,120
But actually it has
more development potential

411
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,440
than other real estate projects.

412
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,600
It'll really contribute
to the new image of Shenghai.

413
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,600
Under my direction,

414
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,240
Shenghai will gain
both profit and reputation.

415
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,560
Is that the only reason?

416
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,840
What are you expecting?

417
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,520
I...

418
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,000
Go to bed.

419
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,880
I need to go back to work.

420
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,840
Yan.

421
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,040
I'm really excited for your sports center.

422
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,480
The first stage of Luofeng Sports Center

423
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,400
has been completed.

424
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,760
All accompanying buildings are also
at the interior decoration stage.

425
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,880
This is the bird's-eye view
of Luofeng Sports Center.

426
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,600
It is starting to take shape.

427
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,400
What do you guys think of what we've done?

428
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,840
Not bad.

429
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,360
A lot has been accomplished
in such a short development period.

430
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,840
It is much better than expected.

431
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,160
I'm really happy too.

432
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,320
It's exceeded my expectations.

433
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,080
For the second stage of financing,

434
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,080
we'll need to focus on
marketing and promotion.

435
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,920
We'll need publicity and influence

436
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,320
to attract investors.

437
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,640
The marketing department
has drafted a proposal.

438
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,120
We'll need to shoot
a range of advertisements.

439
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,160
But we haven't found
the right spokesperson.

440
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,560
We'll need you to decide on that.

441
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,920
You are responsible for the marketing
of Dikai Commercial City, right?

442
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,360
Yes. Dikai Commercial City targets

443
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,600
the mid-to-high range consumers.

444
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,960
This will be different.

445
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,800
We will need a spokesperson

446
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,560
with a sunny and positive disposition.

447
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,600
Ideally the spokesperson
would be a breath of fresh air,

448
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,280
preferably with a sports background.

449
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,480
That makes sense.

450
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,040
Sun Lingxi.

451
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,560
Tell the marketing department

452
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,240
to find a person
that fits Jiang Ze's description.

453
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,400
Okay, Chairman Zhou.

454
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,560
I'd like to suggest someone.

455
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,600
Zhou Xiaomeng.

456
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,200
As everyone knows,

457
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,760
Xiaomeng's play, Peter Pan,

458
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,480
has entered the third round of showing.

459
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,080
It has sold out every night,

460
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,440
so it's become very well-known.

461
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,240
Her image and disposition

462
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,480
are really suitable for the sports center.

463
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,440
She used to be an athlete herself.

464
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,080
She is the best choice.

465
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,360
No, I disagree.

466
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,520
Why?

467
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,200
This is not the right time

468
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,400
for Zhou Xiaomeng to be in the public eye.

469
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,040
But she's been
in the center of media attention.

470
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,960
Last week, a lot of media

471
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,800
carried the in-depth interview
with Tiankong and her

472
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,680
published in Nanyue Evening Times.

473
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,960
That interview is about
how she's encouraged Tiankong.

474
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,680
She has a very positive image.

475
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,880
It's the perfect publicity
for our sports center.

476
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,400
Jiang Ze.

477
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,160
Let's talk about this later.

478
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,800
Sun Lingxi.

479
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,320
Get the marketing department
working on this.

480
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,400
Okay, Chairman Zhou. I'll do that now.

481
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,640
All right.

482
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,040
If that's all, the meeting is over.

483
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,440
Get back to work.

484
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,360
(Taxi)

485
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,240
Sir, how much?

486
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,200
Twenty.

487
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,040
Jiang Ze.

488
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,160
Why do you want to see me urgently?

489
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,320
Nothing.

490
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,360
I have some free time today

491
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,520
so I want to have dinner with you.

492
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,880
All right, let's order.

493
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,640
I'm on a diet.
I'll just have a green salad.

494
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:05,880
Waiter.

495
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,680
Hello, what would you like?

496
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,120
Italian baked shrimp,

497
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,120
a green salad.

498
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,560
and two glasses of orange juice.

499
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,520
Okay, coming right up.

500
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,400
Thanks.

501
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,680
The other night,

502
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,920
I was really drunk.

503
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,720
Thank goodness you took me home,

504
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,120
or I might have a scandal.

505
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,480
I didn't say

506
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,000
anything out of place,

507
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,200
did I?

508
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,440
No.

509
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,560
Every time I drink,

510
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,720
I get drunk so easily.

511
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,560
But I won't remember

512
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,600
anything I've said or done the next day.

513
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,920
Did I embarrass myself?

514
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Don't think too much.

515
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,400
When I took you home

516
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,640
you were already sleeping like a pig.

517
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,840
Jiang Ze, you're awful.

518
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,240
Do you think
something happened between us?

519
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,760
No. Maybe...

520
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,360
it was just a dream I had.

521
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,920
What dream?

522
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,800
A girl's dreams

523
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,280
should be kept secret.

524
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,880
It doesn't sound like a good dream.

525
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,800
Jiang Ze, you're really awful.

526
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,720
Thank you.

527
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,400
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

528
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,800
Jiang Ze, can I ask you something?

529
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
I heard

530
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,960
Shenghai Group
is looking for a spokesperson

531
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,680
for its sports center.

532
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,200
News travels pretty fast.

533
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,640
Everyone has their eyes

534
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,040
on Shenghai Group.

535
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,640
It's true.

536
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,520
But we haven't decided on anyone.

537
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,720
Jiang Ze.

538
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,800
I'm really interested

539
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,640
to be the spokesperson
for the sports center.

540
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,040
Could you recommend me?

541
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,280
You?

542
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,280
You see,

543
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,200
besides hosting that children's program,

544
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,600
I've also been assigned
to host a travel program.

545
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,880
Being the spokesperson
for the sports center,

546
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,080
will be very good

547
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,320
for my career.

548
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,600
But this is not up to me to decide.

549
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,440
If you get a chance,

550
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,080
would you recommend me?

551
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,160
Please?

552
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,160
Okay. I'll try my best.

553
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,040
Jiang Ze.

554
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,920
I really want to thank you.

555
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,480
Let's go singing someday.

556
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,120
We'll see.

557
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,800
Excuse me, your food is here.

558
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,640
Thank you.

559
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,520
Enjoy.

560
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,320
Dig in.

561
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,160
About the spokesperson
for Luofeng Sports Center,

562
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,880
are you not considering Xiaomeng at all?

563
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,240
Jiang Ze.

564
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,680
Why are you always
so concerned about Xiaomeng?

565
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,160
Yan, think about it.

566
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,320
She's been through so much.

567
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,680
Her career is only just taking off.

568
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,240
Why don't you help her?

569
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,720
I want to.

570
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,160
But I don't want her
to have anything to do with Shenghai.

571
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,040
She has a new image now.

572
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,960
It'll be a win-win situation
for her and us

573
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,680
if she's the spokesperson.

574
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,280
That's too simplistic.

575
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,480
There are many things
you don't understand.

576
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,800
Why don't you enlighten me?

577
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,720
I want to see how complicated things are.

578
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,080
Some things you need to experience

579
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,840
to understand.

580
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,040
If not Xiaomeng, what about Zitong?

581
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,360
Zitong should be fine.

582
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,480
Pass on Zitong's information

583
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,600
to the marketing department

584
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,760
and let them decide.

585
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,920
Director Ning.

586
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,840
Miss Zitong, have a seat.

587
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,880
Miss Zitong, what would you like?

588
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,400
-Just coffee.
-Okay.

589
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,120
Director, it's nice to finally meet you.

590
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,600
I heard you've done
all of Shenghai's commercials.

591
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,120
That's true.

592
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,280
When the late Mr. Zhou was still alive,

593
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,200
I always shot all of their commercials.

594
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,960
That makes you a veteran director.

595
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,920
You flatter me.

596
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,600
Miss Zitong.

597
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,520
Have you ever acted?

598
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,320
No.

599
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,520
But if I get the chance,

600
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,880
I would like to try.

601
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,440
Well, if I find a good role for you,

602
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,960
I'll consider you first.

603
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,840
Thank you, Director Ning.

604
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,760
Director Ning.

605
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,200
I want to ask you something.

606
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,000
Has the spokesperson
for Shenghai's sports center

607
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,800
been chosen?

608
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,960
So you're interested

609
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,680
in this spokesperson affair.

610
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,080
Shenghai is
the biggest corporation in this city.

611
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,520
Being a spokesperson for them

612
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,840
is everybody's dream.

613
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,160
You have good judgment.

614
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,880
But as far as I know,

615
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,520
Shenghai has their own ideas.

616
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,240
Miss Zitong, I've heard

617
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,200
you've been dating the son
of Shenghai's President Jiang.

618
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,320
Why don't you go to him instead?

619
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,680
If you go to him,

620
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,760
he'll surely help you.

621
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,600
Director,

622
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,880
I hate it when people talk about this.

623
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,240
Actually I haven't gone public

624
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,840
about my relationship with Jiang Ze.

625
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,040
All those gossips are just rumors

626
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,600
written by tabloid journalists.

627
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,000
Don't take them seriously.

628
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,920
Moreover,

629
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,600
if I'm seeking help with this matter,

630
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,160
Jiang Ze has far less influence

631
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,960
than you, Director.

632
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,680
After all, you're the director.

633
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,160
You're in charge.

634
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,480
You're such a TV host.

635
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,400
You are so good with words.

636
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,600
What you've just said
makes me feel so good.

637
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,520
Miss Zitong.

638
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,400
If you're sure about this,

639
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,240
I'll definitely strongly recommend you.

640
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,280
Thank you, Director.

641
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,600
Miss Zitong, do you have

642
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,640
any requirements about your salary?

643
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,840
Director, I'm new after all.

644
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,080
That can be negotiated.

645
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,840
I just want to have
a long-term relationship with Shenghai.

646
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,480
Director,

647
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,120
if you could help me with this,

648
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,480
I don't mind

649
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,200
sharing half of my salary

650
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,360
as a gesture of thanking you.

651
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,320
Miss Zitong.

652
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,120
Your look is as magnificent

653
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,440
as your working attitude.

654
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,320
You're so sincere.

655
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,640
I can see

656
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,880
how determined you are.

657
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,800
Director.

658
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,760
We have to fight for our own opportunities

659
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Don't you think?

660
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,280
Exactly.

661
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,920
You're smart.

662
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,160
Here's to our collaboration.

663
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,520
Please take care

664
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,720
of a newbie like me.

665
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,000
You can bank on that.

666
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,840
You're so smart.

667
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,760
Of course I'll take care of you.

668
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,200
You can use red for your rainbow.

669
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,680
Miss Xiaomeng.

670
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,280
Does my tiger look real?

671
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,240
It's very real.

672
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,200
-Tongtong, you're so good.
-Lele, your clouds are too round.

673
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,920
You should have some lines too.

674
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,960
Let me teach you.

675
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,360
Xiaomeng.

676
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,600
If you get really busy,

677
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,760
you don't have to keep coming.

678
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,440
Aunt Lin.

679
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,400
I can pace myself.

680
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,840
Being so busy

681
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,920
has made me realize

682
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,040
how meaningless many things are.

683
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,760
The children are the most important thing

684
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
to me right now.

685
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,600
They look forward to your visits.

686
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,440
-You can't go in there.
-Miss Zhou.

687
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,640
What are you doing? Don't go in.

688
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,920
-Don't go in!
-Miss Zhou.

689
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,120
-Miss Zhou. Miss Zhou.
-Miss Zhou.

690
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,560
-Don't go in!
-We're TV reporters.

691
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,960
We want to interview you.

692
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,880
Do you have some time?

693
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,960
This is the Welfare Center.

694
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,360
Children are having classes here.

695
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,880
You can't just barge in.

696
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,720
Miss Zhou.

697
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,560
We just want a simple interview, please.

698
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,480
Yes, Miss Zhou.

699
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,480
I've said

700
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,440
I don't give interviews anymore.

701
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,440
Leave now.

702
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,880
Don't disrupt the class.

703
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,960
Let us interview you for 10 minutes.

704
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,880
-Yes, just 10 minutes.
-Just 10 minutes.

705
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,400
Everyone, please listen to me.

706
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,040
I'm the Director of the Welfare Center.

707
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,640
You can talk to me about anything.

708
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,080
But not here.

709
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,400
You need an appointment.

710
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,360
Miss Zhou, just give us 10 minutes please.

711
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,400
Yes, just 10 minutes.

712
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,440
-Yes, just 10 minutes.
-Just 10 minutes.

713
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,440
What's going on, Xiaomeng?

714
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,280
Talk to them for me.

715
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,760
This is the Children Welfare Center.

716
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,160
They're disrupting the class.

717
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,280
If they want to shoot here,

718
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,680
they'll have to wait for the visiting day.

719
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,480
Miss Zhou, just say a few words.

720
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,760
Say a few words.

721
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,840
-Wait, everyone.
-Yes.

722
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,800
Come on.

723
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,840
Sorry.

724
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,920
No interviews today.

725
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,120
If you want an interview,

726
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,000
come on Saturday.

727
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,160
Make an appointment

728
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,080
with a teacher here.

729
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,960
If need be,

730
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,920
I can arrange it.

731
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,320
There's no way we can get it today.

732
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,680
I guess we can't interview her today.

733
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,960
-What should we do?
-Let's go then.

734
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,240
-Let's make an appointment.
-Okay.

735
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,240
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

736
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,600
Jiang Ze.

737
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,680
Thanks for helping out earlier.

738
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,120
By the way,

739
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,320
what are you doing at the Welfare Center?

740
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,720
I want to talk to you about something.

741
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,320
What is it?

742
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,520
Shenghai will be shooting

743
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,160
a commercial
for its Luofeng Sports Center soon.

744
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,920
We've been looking for a spokesperson.

745
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,280
I think you fit the bill.

746
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,000
Me?

747
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,360
Yes. Your image and disposition

748
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,080
and the fact you used to be an athlete

749
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,480
make you very suitable
for the sports center.

750
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,640
You might have had
some negative publicity before.

751
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,280
But you recent activities

752
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,000
and the success of your children's play

753
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,480
can negate all that bad press.

754
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:03,040
But I don't think I'm good for it.

755
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,840
You should find someone better.

756
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,200
To me,

757
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,720
you're the best spokesperson
for Shenghai Group.

758
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,800
Jiang Ze.

759
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,080
There are many factors

760
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,840
in choosing a spokesperson.

761
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,560
It depends more than
just your personal conviction.

762
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,080
I've considered all the factors.

763
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,800
That's why I've recommended you.

764
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,120
The impact of this commercial

765
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,200
will be very important
for our fundraising.

766
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,960
For both Shenghai and Zhou Yanzhao,

767
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,200
it's very important.

768
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,960
Xiaomeng, please consider it.

769
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,360
But...

770
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,840
Think about it and let me know.

771
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,480
I think you're the best person for it.

772
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,200
Three of a kind.

773
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,000
I pass.

774
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,960
Whose turn is it?

775
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,520
My turn. A single four.

776
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,440
A single eight.

777
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,160
I trump you guys. An ace.

778
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,560
I can't match that.

779
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,560
Xiaomeng, you're home.

780
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,200
Can my mother play?

781
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,800
She couldn't at first.

782
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,120
But now she's so good at it.

783
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,480
She's won so many rounds.

784
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,800
Really?

785
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,440
Ace trumps. Your lead.

786
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,080
A pair of jacks.

787
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:27,960
A pair of twos.

788
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,560
I won't take this lying low.

789
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,840
Four sixes! I trump you!

790
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,760
Xiaomeng, don't worry.

791
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,080
Dr. Ye is having so much fun.

792
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,560
If you don't let her play,
she'll complain.

793
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,320
Mom, don't stay up too late.

794
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,800
-Go to bed early.
-Okay.

795
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,160
Nobody can match this, right?

796
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,200
-Can anybody match this?
-Wait, I can.

797
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,240
Four sevens! I trump you!

798
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,720
Dr. Ye, nice move.

799
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,720
It's my last card! I won!

800
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,200
Oh no, I've underestimated you.

801
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,160
Look! Look at my cards!

802
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,520
Mine are bad too.

803
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,720
No, no. Let's play again.

804
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,600
-One more round.
-Yes.

805
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,320
-One more round.
-I'm sure I can beat you.

806
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,240
Sister Hua.

807
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,960
Is Yan back?

808
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,640
Not yet.

809
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,880
I'm going to my room then.

810
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,800
After this round,

811
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,360
you should let my mother go to bed.

812
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,720
Okay, don't worry.

813
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,000
Shuffle the cards.

814
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,160
Why is it taking you so long?

815
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,880
Well, I'm getting old
and slow with my hands.

816
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,760
Come.

817
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,080
I'm sure I can beat you.

818
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,720
Yay, I won again.

819
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,840
(Luofeng City
Commercial Integrated Sports Center)

820
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,680
Yan! What was that for?

821
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,160
You're always pranking me.

822
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,560
You're always pranking me.

823
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,280
I don't want to talk to you.

824
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,880
What are you drawing?
What's your masterpiece?

825
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,920
Is it sunflowers, or Venus?

826
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,240
It's a sports center.

827
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,880
But I'm not done yet.

828
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,840
Sports center?

829
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,600
Yes.

830
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,880
Every time I train,

831
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,960
I always think

832
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,560
how nice it would be

833
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,560
if I could compete

834
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,000
in the best sports center

835
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,600
in the world.

836
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,480
All the equipment in there
would be brand new.

837
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,240
The audience would be

838
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,720
the most enthusiastic audience
in the world.

839
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,000
You know,

840
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,680
every time I think about that

841
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,680
while training,

842
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,120
I would get so much energy.

843
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,480
All right, continue with it.

844
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,520
Once you're done, let me know.

845
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,400
When I get rich,

846
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,680
I'll build the best sports center for you.

847
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,880
Stop bragging.

848
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,440
Uncle Zhou once told me

849
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,240
if you ever go into business,

850
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,720
it'll be a miracle

851
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,320
if you don't lose money for just one day.

852
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,000
I will do it.

853
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,400
I promise you.

854
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,080
Go on. I'll watch you draw.

855
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,240
What are you doing?

856
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,920
When I was young, I once drew...

857
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,120
a sports center.

858
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,800
Do you remember?

859
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,320
What are you trying to say?

860
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,680
This sports center

861
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
is built exactly the way I drew it.

862
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,320
Am I right?

863
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,360
The fairy tale theme...

864
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,760
is also inspired by the stories I wrote

865
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,080
and Tiankong's paintings.

866
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,960
So...

867
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,800
you have built...

868
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,560
this sports center for me.

869
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,120
Yan.

870
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,120
Thank you
for everything you've done for me.

871
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,400
Jiang Ze came to see me today.

872
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,600
He wanted me to be
the spokesperson for the Sports Center.

873
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,560
I don't want you to appear in public.

874
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,200
No,

875
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,800
I want to.

876
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,720
As long as you let me,

877
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,160
I'd like to be the spokesperson for this.

878
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,760
I want to reappear in the public eye

879
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,760
and get back to the real world for myself.

880
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,920
Is this what you truly want?

881
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,160
You don't have to do this.

882
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,360
I could get someone else.

883
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,600
I know I'll awake from my dream someday.

884
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,720
However,

885
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,640
please give me this chance
to dream once again.

886
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,880
Please give me this chance.

887
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,000
