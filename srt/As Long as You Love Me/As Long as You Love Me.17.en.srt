00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,880
(Episode 17)

2
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,720
Xiaomeng is a gentle and pretty girl.

3
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,240
She is a fine girl.

4
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,520
Am I not?

5
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,400
Chairman Zhou,

6
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,720
I don't expect too much.

7
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,720
I only want you to give me a chance.

8
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,560
Compile and analyze the data on Luofeng,

9
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,000
and identify the consumer groups.

10
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,440
Be meticulous and precise.

11
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,480
Yes.

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,320
Good morning, Chairman Zhou.

13
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,800
Did you sleep well?

14
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,440
The room was very comfortable,

15
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,120
but when I lay down,
I could only think of the project.

16
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,200
So I simply got up and made some changes.

17
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,320
Opportunities are for
those who come prepared.

18
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,800
I believe today will end well.

19
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,960
Tie up your hair.
It'll make you look refreshed.

20
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,280
Really?

21
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,200
Let's eat.

22
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,600
The development of stadiums
is the latest craze.

23
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,200
We want to build not just a stadium,

24
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,800
but an industrial chain.

25
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,720
It will be a habitat system that
integrates sports, business, and leisure.

26
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,920
This is what Shenghai does best.

27
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,160
Visitors will get full satisfaction
and enjoyment here.

28
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,840
This is our concept of
a commercially integrated stadium.

29
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,480
Wonderful.

30
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,040
-Wonderful.
-Wonderful.

31
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,840
-Impressive!
-Great!

32
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,400
This is really impressive.

33
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,440
-Yes!
-Great!

34
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,640
President Jiang.

35
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,520
I did not expect this kid
to be so well prepared today.

36
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,080
However, it's not going to be so simple.

37
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,200
Let him be complacent for a few days.

38
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,400
Keep an eye on his tender offer,

39
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,000
especially his bottom price.

40
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,400
Report to me promptly.

41
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,680
Why?

42
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,080
Shouldn't this be strictly confidential
from our rivals?

43
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,240
I have my own plan.

44
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,120
Are you trying to take over Shenghai

45
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,480
or destroy it?

46
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,840
Do not second-guess me.

47
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,440
Guang,

48
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,120
I want to see Xiaomeng.

49
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,320
Drive me to the harbor straight away.

50
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,600
Have you made up your mind?

51
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,680

(Resignation Letter)

79
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,520
(Nanyue Broadcasting Company)

80
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,080
Xiaomeng!

81
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,800
Xiaomeng!

82
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,600
Come back with me.

83
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,040
I don't want to.

84
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,360
You can't hide here forever.

85
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,800
Come back to Nanyue with me.

86
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,600
Let go! I don't want to go back!
I want to stay here.

87
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,560
-I don't want anyone to find me.
-For the last time,

88
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,800
pack up right now,
and catch the last ferry with me.

89
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,760
I don't want to.

90
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,640
Let's go see Miss Xiaomeng. Okay?

91
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,520
Haixing,

92
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,600
why are you here?

93
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,560
Miss Xiaomeng, please don't go.

94
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,160
Okay, I won't.

95
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,600
I'll stay and play with you. Okay?

96
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,320
Who is this?

97
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,840
Ms. Li, this is Yan.

98
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,800
I know about Yan.

99
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,560
He is the son of Uncle Fang's
former employer.

100
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,160
I heard you said you were leaving today.

101
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,200
I'm afraid today is not likely.

102
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,720
Fang just called and said that

103
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,440
all the vessels are at berth.

104
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,880
A typhoon is heading here.
You won't be able to leave today.

105
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,120
He can't even make it back either.

106
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,480
Does it mean the ferry here
will stop operating?

107
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,640
Yes.

108
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,080
Affected by the outer circulation
of Typhoon No. 30,

109
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,800
a sudden rainstorm has hit
the Daling Island waters,

110
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,560
with gust wind force
reaching Beaufort scale 11.

111
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,440
Many fishing vessels are affected.

112
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,600
We are not sure how many vessels
are affected.

113
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,600
Over the next few days, heavy rain
will continue in the Daling Island waters.

114
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,400
See? What did I say?

115
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,120
You definitely cannot leave today.
Why not tomorrow?

116
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,440
In view of the wind and heavy downpours
that Typhoon Doksuri might bring,

117
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,600
all the cities and counties
in the province are on high alert,

118
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,600
and doing the best to protect themselves.

119
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,040
This is Uncle Fang's room.

120
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,320
You have to stay here for the night.

121
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,920
Uncle Fang sees you as his family.

122
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,640
When he comes back tomorrow,
see him before you leave.

123
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,240
How about you? Will you go back with me?

124
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,200
We should get some rest now.

125
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,160
Do you feel that you have
suffered injustice?

126
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,320
It's not like that.

127
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,040
Then why did you leave without telling me?

128
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,280
Do you still think that
I posted the photos online?

129
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,720
Why don't you believe me?

130
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,840
I do not know,

131
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,320
and I do not want to know.

132
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,040
I only know that everyone in Nanyue
has seen those photos.

133
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,520
When I walk on the street,

134
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,480
everyone is staring and judging me.

135
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,040
Some parents even
won't let me near their children.

136
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,680
They are afraid I am a bad influence.

137
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,240
Has it ever occurred to them

138
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,520
that I am also a victim?

139
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,200
So you hide yourself

140
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,640
to evade all these things,

141
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,000
like an ostrich

142
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,400
that hides its head in the sand
when there is danger?

143
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,840
Can that solve any problem?

144
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,360
Yan,

145
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,040
I just want to calm down by myself
for a few days.

146
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,720
It doesn't mean I don't want to go back.

147
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,440
You hide whenever you have a problem.

148
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,280
You hide away for a few days this time.
What about next time?

149
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,960
What would you do next time?

150
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,480
Will you leave without
telling anyone again?

151
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,320
Will you leave the Zhou family and me?

152
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,760
I...

153
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,760
I just don't know...

154
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,240
how to face you.

155
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,840
What about your mother?

156
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,280
Don't you care whether she lives or dies?

157
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,640
My mother...

158
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,160
How is my mother now?

159
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,200
As long as you stay with me,

160
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,240
your mother will be safe.

161
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Xiaomeng...

162
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,280
you can't solve your problem by hiding.

163
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,240
It will only make matters worse.

164
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,240
All things aside,

165
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,840
as you and I are both responsible
for Shenghai's reputation.

166
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,360
surely we have a heavier burden
than average person.

167
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,960
You are not a little girl anymore.

168
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,320
You know what you should do
and what you should not.

169
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,200
Go back and think about it.

170
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,560
I've got your point.

171
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,920
You may leave now.

172
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,760
Zhou Yanzhao actually went to
look for Xiaomeng.

173
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,480
At a time when the Luofeng project
needed him most,

174
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,960
he left.

175
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,840
Now I finally realize

176
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,480
how important Zhou Xiaomeng is to him.

177
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,040
Well, so you're drowning your sorrow
with alcohol?

178
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,600
Mind your own business.

179
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,800
Miss Sun,

180
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,720
I want to encourage you

181
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,200
to court Zhou Yanzhao.

182
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,960
What do you mean?

183
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,560
Nothing.

184
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,360
I just think you still have a shot.

185
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,000
If I have a shot,

186
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,960
you will have the chance
to secure your target too. Yes?

187
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,760
She is different.

188
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,280
How so?

189
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,200
I used to think women are all the same.

190
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,240
They live for their men.

191
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,080
You only have to move a finger,

192
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,080
and they know what you mean.

193
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,000
They are as tame as kittens,
domesticated by you.

194
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,560
I am happy when I am with them

195
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,760
because I can control everything.

196
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,080
But some woman

197
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,120
just has to glance at you,

198
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,360
and you will fall deeply for her.

199
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,880
You can't extricate yourself.

200
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,720
You can even feel lost.

201
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,640
However, there is a
dangerous person by her side.

202
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,680
He is her guardian.

203
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,160
You can't even get near her.

204
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,000
Be careful. He might counterattack.

205
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,520
Don't you know that

206
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,440
I love challenges?

207
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,960
Tell me,

208
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,640
what you like about Zhou Yanzhao.

209
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,760
What do I like about him?

210
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,560
He is calm and collected.

211
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,720
He is smart and decisive in his work.

212
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,120
Maybe it is his unfathomable eyes,

213
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,360
and his self-assured composure.

214
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,040
I can't figure it out.

215
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,200
I only know that
I'm one step away from him,

216
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,560
but we are worlds apart.

217
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,320
I do not know what he is thinking.

218
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,320
After the incident in his family,

219
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,840
he has become a different man.

220
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,080
He never shows his emotions.

221
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,840
He isolates himself with indifference,
and works like crazy.

222
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,000
He seems to be venting
all his emotions on his work.

223
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,280
Are you saying Zhou Yanzhao
was different before?

224
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,560
Many things are not
as simple as they look.

225
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,480
After you gradually get to know him,

226
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,080
you will understand.

227
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,840
Ms. Li, are the noodles
for table five ready?

228
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,000
Oh, no,

229
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,600
I'm sorry, Xiaomeng.

230
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,760
It's okay.

231
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,920
-Your seafood noodles.
-Thank you.

232
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,040
Here you go. Your seafood noodles.

233
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,440
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

234
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
Xiaomeng!

235
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,600
Xiaomeng!

236
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,000
I have to answer a call.

237
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,360
Hello.

238
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,080
Where are you? Why aren't you here?

239
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,440
I did not go anywhere.

240
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,720
I thought that the typhoon is coming,

241
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,280
and the tourists are stranded.

242
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,240
Ms. Li's noodle house will be very busy,

243
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,720
so I came to help her.

244
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,400
Stay in the house
if there's nothing to go out for.

245
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,480
Don't go out all the time.

246
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,600
I understand. I'll be back soon.

247
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,840
Xiaomeng, is that Yan?

248
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,560
He is already tracking you with his phone
this early in the morning.

249
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,040
He is afraid that you'll leave him.

250
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,360
Ms. Li, what are you talking about?

251
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,080
Is Yan your boyfriend?

252
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,280
It's complicated between me and Yan.

253
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,840
We are only--

254
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,520
I can tell.

255
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,280
Even if you two are not an item,

256
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,120
I'm sure you both like each other.

257
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,880
I do not know whether he likes me or not.

258
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,240
If he really likes me,

259
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,840
why is he always hurting me?

260
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,040
Xiaomeng, although I do not know

261
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,400
what happened between you two,

262
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,120
one who's involved too deeply
might not be able to see clear.

263
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,760
As an onlooker, I'd like to remind you.

264
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,520
If he does not truly like you,

265
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,000
he will not come looking for you,

266
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,640
much less repeatedly ask you
to go back with him.

267
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,560
Yan. I'm back.

268
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,480
Yan.

269
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,680
Yan.

270
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,840
Yan.

271
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,920
That is weird. Where can he be?

272
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,120
(All Photos have been taken down.
It will blow over soon.)

273
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,360
(Did you find out where they were leaked?
He wouldn't tell.)

274
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,760
(How about IP address?
Only the IP address of the proxy server.)

275
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,000
Yan,

276
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,680
where were you?

277
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,000
I went to the harbor.

278
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,600
How was it? Were the ferry operating?

279
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,200
The typhoon is coming.
All ferries have been cancelled.

280
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,040
It looks like we will have heavy rain.

281
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,120
I suppose you haven't eaten.

282
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,840
Come. Try my seafood noodles.

283
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,600
Her noodles are super delicious.

284
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,920
Come have a try.

285
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,280
Come, sit down quickly.

286
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,560
Here, Yan.

287
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,320
Here, eat quickly.

288
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,600
Ms. Li, you're such an excellent cook.

289
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,560
It'll be great if I can make noodles
that smell as good as yours.

290
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,680
That's not a problem. I can teach you.

291
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,920
Is the ferry
the only boat that I can take?

292
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,760
Not necessarily. Sometimes
when fishing boats come back,

293
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,000
you can also take the boats.

294
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,720
Must you leave today?

295
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,080
I have many things to attend to
in the company.

296
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,760
The coastal weather is unpredictable.

297
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,160
The clouds are so thick.

298
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,000
A storm is coming soon.

299
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,680
How about we ask around to see

300
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,480
if any fishing boat
is going out right now?

301
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,800
In this weather,
no fishing boat will set sail.

302
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,920
It's too risky.

303
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,200
(Chang Qingyan)

304
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,520
Chairman Zhou, when are you coming back?

305
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,680
The project in Yunnan has hit a snag.

306
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,680
I can't go back now.

307
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,880
A typhoon is coming.

308
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,480
All the boats are at berth.

309
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,760
At least I have to wait
until the typhoon has passed.

310
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,120
This is an urgent matter.

311
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,600
Jiang Ze and Sun Lingxi
have rushed there to handle it.

312
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,120
We are also awaiting your instructions
on what to do next.

313
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,480
I have already emailed you.

314
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,720
Okay, I've got it.

315
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
I will handle that as soon as possible.

316
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,880
Ms. Li, when will the typhoon pass
at its earliest?

317
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,120
At least one day.

318
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,160
It may take as long as it takes.

319
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,440
This depends on the impact
of the outer circulation.

320
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,280
If the impact is greater,

321
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,640
the boats can't sail out.

322
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,800
I have to get busy.

323
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,040
Had I known, I would have
brought more changes of clothes.

324
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,640
I have enough.
I'll help you buy some clothes.

325
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,800
Take your time to eat.

326
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,240
Don't go. The typhoon is coming.

327
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,600
I'll be back soon.

328
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,160
Okay.

329
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,600
Come, let's get the photos.

330
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,640
Okay.

331
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,400
Do you look forward to this?

332
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,040
Uncle is printing the photos
we just took on this. Isn't it amazing?

333
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,800
Look, it'll be ready soon.

334
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,840
It's done.

335
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,840
-Is it pretty?
-Yes.

336
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,600
-This one is for you too.
-Thank you.

337
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,320
-How much is it?
-Ninety-nine.

338
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,120
Hello.

339
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,440
Boss, can you tell me

340
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,840
if I can use the photos in my cell phone

341
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,640
to print on the T-shirt?

342
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,720
-Let me see.
-Okay.

343
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,880
It's more or less like this.

344
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,560
No problem. Send the photo to me.

345
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,840
Okay.

346
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,400
From my experience,

347
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,280
I can tell that the two of you
have just gotten together.

348
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,000
The happiness and sweetness of love
are all over your face.

349
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,520
You two are a very good match.
Wish you the best.

350
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,720
Thank you.

351
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,160
How much are the shirts?

352
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,400
Two hundred.

353
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,760
Xiaomeng, you knew the typhoon was coming,

354
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,240
but you still didn't bring an umbrella.

355
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,560
You really make people worry.

356
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,840
Change your clothes quickly.

357
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,160
Yan, are you looking for something?

358
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,960
You're feeling cold.
I'll make you something hot.

359
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,840
You mean

360
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,160
you'll cook something for me?

361
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,440
If you get sick,

362
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,000
you will have an excuse to stay.

363
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,560
By the way, Yan.

364
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,160
I bought you a shirt.

365
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,720
Go upstairs and get changed. Hurry up.

366
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,760
Okay, I know. I'll go right away.

367
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,320
Remember to try this on
and see if it fits.

368
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,400
You were out so long,

369
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,560
and you only bought this childish shirt?

370
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,400
I think it is quite interesting.

371
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,400
Don't you like it?

372
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,400
Sit down.

373
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,720
It smells good.

374
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,880
Yan,

375
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,680
this congee you've made is tasty.

376
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,680
Eat some more, and then get an early rest.

377
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,880
Do not get sick.

378
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,360
That was me.

379
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,360
Yan, is there a power outage?

380
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,000
The typhoon must have
knocked the power lines out.

381
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,000
Get an early rest. It'll be okay.

382
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,800
Yan, is everything all right in your room?

383
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,560
Do not come near.
The rains are splashing in.

384
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,400
Xiaomeng, can you help me find

385
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,960
a plank to board up the window?

386
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,680
Okay.

387
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,320
Here's a plank.

388
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,240
Give it to me.

389
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,360
Be careful.

390
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,440
Be careful.

391
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,360
This should hold things up for the night.

392
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,240
Yan, forget it.

393
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,160
You can sleep in my room.

394
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,240
This is too dangerous.

395
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,360
If the water splashes in again,

396
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,240
neither of us
will be able to leave tomorrow.

397
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,960
Dry your hair before you sleep,

398
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,520
or you will catch a cold.

399
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,960
Yan.

400
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,480
Sorry.

401
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,360
And thank you.

402
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,160
For what?

403
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,720
The leaked photos.

404
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,040
I know you didn't do it.

405
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,080
Are you still denying
what actually happened?

406
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,920
Are you satisfied now?

407
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,200
Why do you hate me so much?

408
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,920
How could you be so vicious?

409
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,000
How could you be so vicious?

410
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,760
How could you?

411
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,120
I did not expect you to suspect me,

412
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,640
and I do not want to explain either.

413
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,040
So I've wrongfully accused you,
and I'm sorry.

414
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,640
Also,

415
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:07,800
thank you for removing those photos
from the internet on my behalf.

416
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,760
You knew about that.

417
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,280
I saw your chat with Chang Qingyan
on your computer.

418
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,160
I'm really sorry.

419
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,200
That day I was in a fit of anger,

420
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,560
and I even slapped you.

421
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,080
Does it still hurt?

422
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,920
Ouch, it hurts!

423
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,600
Now you know it hurts?

424
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,520
You are deliberately seeking revenge.

425
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,600
I'm not.

426
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,520
Ouch, I am sorry! Sorry!

427
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,840
Please forgive me.

428
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,880
After all, you're a gentleman.

429
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,840
You can forgive me, right?

430
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,880
Okay.

431
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,840
Here. Let me help you.

432
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,240
It's all right. It's all right.

433

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,680
Yan,

440
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,440
I wish we could stay like this forever.

441
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,560
Sometimes you are very nice to me,

442
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,320
but sometimes you are nasty.

443
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,080
Every day I live
in constant fear and anxiety.

444
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,440
I really miss our time together
in the past.

445
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,040
I miss the Yan from the past.

446

at this exact moment...

448
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,280
do you still hate me?

449
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,960
It's you who should be hating me.

450
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,880
It's okay. You can hate me.

451
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,400
No.

452
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,680
I have never hated you.

453
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,440
In fact, I've often forgot

454
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,440
the hurt and hatred between us.

455
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,240
Yan,

456
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,720
I really want to return to the past.

457
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,400
Don't move.

458
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,240
Are you still scared?

459
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,640
Not anymore.

460
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,960
Just go to sleep like this.

461
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,720
But we--

462
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,880
Don't speak.

463
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,240
Just sleep.

464
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,520
The typhoon will pass soon.

465
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,440
Sleep.

Okay.

474
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,480
Thanks, Ms. Li.

475
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,400
Yan,

476
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,120
what did Ms. Li say?

477
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,320
She said she had helped us secure a boat.

478
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,640
Today, we can go back to Nanyue.

479
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,040
If you do not want to go back,

480
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,520
you can spend a few days more here.

481
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,760
Are you saying that

482
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,680
I can stay a bit longer?

483
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,920
If you like it here,

484
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,560
just stay a few days more.

485
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,240
Okay.

486
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,360
Yan,

487
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,120
what's the matter?

488
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,640
That was the hospital.

489
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,000
It was about your mother.

490
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,000
What happened to my mother?

491
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,680
The doctor said
she had basic response to external sound.

492
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,080
Really?

493
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,520
That's great news!

494
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,320
If she regains consciousness,

495
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,880
the love and hatred between us

496
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,760
will come to a conclusion.

497
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,240
Yan, it's not like that.

498
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,960
Whatever the outcome,

499
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,960
you'd better come back
and face it together with me.

500
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,320
Ms. Li.

501
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,040
Xiaomeng, are you really leaving?

502
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,280
Uncle Fang is not back yet.

503
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,360
Yes.

504
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,640
I must rush home
to attend to an urgent matter.

505
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,000
When Uncle Fang comes back,
please tell him

506
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,360
I'll visit him again.

507
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,120
Okay. I hope the next time

508
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:58,680
you visit Mayi Island,
you'll be here to have fun.

509
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,360
I will.

510
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:05,000
Haixing, I am glad and thankful
for your companionship

511
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,440
over the last few days.

512
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,280
When I grow up,
I'm going to visit you in the big city.

513
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,680
Okay.

514
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,000
The sky has cleared up.

515
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,600
Thank you very much

516
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,200
for taking care of me and Yan
over the last few days.

517
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,960
A typhoon will always pass.

518
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,120
So long as we are a bit more patient,

519
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,400
the sky will be blue
after the storm has passed.

520
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,360
Xiaomeng, after you return home,

521
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,440
be patient in what you do.

522
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,840
Take your time,
and have a little more patience.

523
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,280
Ms. Li,

524
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,160
I know what you mean.

525
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,600
Don't worry. I will be okay.

526
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,240
Till we meet again.

527
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,120
Okay. Go quickly,

528
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,200
or your bossy chairman
will call and ask you to hurry up.

529
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,120
Okay. Goodbye, Ms. Li.

530
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,200
-Go.
-Goodbye, Haixing.

531
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,480
Goodbye, Miss Xiaomeng.

532
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,080
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

533
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,880
(6 Missed Calls)

534
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,760
(Jiang Ze)

535
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,920
-Hello.
-Finally, you are home.

536
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,200
How is Xiaomeng?

537
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,560
How are things in Yunnan?

538
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,480
I asked you about Xiaomeng.

539
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,720
She's great. She's beside me.
How are things there?

540
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,560
Good to hear that Xiaomeng is okay.

541
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,040
What is the situation there?

542
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,040
The road that we are repairing
passes through a mountain village.

543
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,360
When we blasted the mountain,
a child in the village was frightened,

544
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,000
and has been having a high fever since.

545
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,480
The villagers are using this as an excuse
to stop us from carrying on.

546
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,160
I'm trying to negotiate with them.

547
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,360
It is very difficult.

548
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,320
Now that I heard of Xiaomeng being fine,

549
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,800
my fighting spirit is rekindled.

550
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,960
That's enough.

551
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,720
I'm going back to the company right now.
Wait for my news.

552
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,160
Go to Shenghai Group first.

553
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,160
Then drive Xiaomeng to the hospital.

554
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,720
I admire you, Yan.

555
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,240
Why?

556
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,800
Your life is so exhausting.

557
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,960
Just drive and stop talking.

558
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,360
Exactly what happened?

559
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,960
Initially they agreed to the road repair.

560
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,160
On the very first day,
they made trouble at the site.

561
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,560
They claimed that a girl
was scared out of her wits.

562
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,520
It's obvious that they are being
deliberately unreasonable.

563
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,000
Any progress?

564
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,440
No matter what we said,
they wouldn't let us start work.

565
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,480
Have you found out
what the exact reason is?

566
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,200
The little girl is really sick,

567
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,000
but this has nothing to do
with our road repair.

568
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,720
It is utter nonsense.

569
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,760
I heard the villagers said

570
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,520
that they would rather

571
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,480
have another company
to develop Eco-tourism here.

572
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,920
I'm not really sure about this.

573
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,160
Hold on.

574
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,320
Wait.

575
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,280
Qingyan, go to the Marketing Department,

576
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,840
and find out which company
has a project in Yunnan.

577
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,320
By the way, do Shenghai have
a charity foundation?

578
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,640
Yes.

579
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,760
There are only two possibilities.

580
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,120
First, the village benefits more
from another company,

581
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,200
so they've reneged.

582
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,920
Second, another incident
happened in the village,

583
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,320
and the villagers had to renege.

584
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,120
First, find out which is true,

585
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,440
and immediately send for the person
in charge of the charity foundation.

586
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,600
We'll take care of the incident
about the scared girl,

587
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,920
Okay. I've got it.

588
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,880
Jiang Ze,

589
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,880
run a thorough investigation,

590
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,440
and find out exactly
why they won't let us repair the road.

591
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,600
By the way,

592
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,080
pay attention to your own safety.

593
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,160
If I could survive overseas,

594
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,400
the safe environment of my home country
is a piece of cake.

595
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,640
Don't worry about me dying.

596
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,640
Okay.

597
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,120
I'm hanging up.

598
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,320
(Xiaomeng)

599
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,760
Hello.

600
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,800
The number you dialed is not available.

601
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,360
I got it.

602
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,160
This company indeed has a Yunnan project

603
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,560
that involves this village.

604
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,080
However, the company is rather small,
and doesn't have much business.

605
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,080
Furthermore,

606
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,400
Their project is very vague too.

607
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,680
This is undoubtedly just a shell company.

608
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,640
It doesn't even have
a complete project document.

609
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,880
How could it possibly
participate in the Yunnan project?

610
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,880
You're right.

611
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,520
Eco-tourism is certainly not
the reason it gets involved now.

612
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,680
It's not that simple.

613
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,640
-Go and investigate immediately.
-Yes. Right away.

614
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,760
-Hello.
-Chairman Zhou, I've found out why.

615
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,560
A few of the villagers
have caught a very serious illness.

616
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,000
and they need money for treatment.

617
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,160
A small company

618
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,320
is acquiring land under the pretext
of developing Eco-tourism,

619
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,800
but is actually building
a commercial resort.

620
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,320
The villagers need money,
and want to cooperate with them.

621
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,480
The little girl just happened to get sick,

622
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,200
and they blamed it on the construction.

623
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,840
So this is what it is all about.

624
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,480
Lingxi, you and Ze negotiate with them.

625
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,600
We are willing to provide
the best medical team

626
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,000
to treat the villagers.

627
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,720
They should not renege
on what they've agreed.

628
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,400
Prepare a contract immediately
for the worst scenario.

629
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,400
Okay. I will do it as soon as possible.

630
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,840
Say hello to Xiaomeng for me.

631
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,720
Okay.

632
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,840
Return here once you get something.

633
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,560
We have to go to Sydney soon.

634
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,800
Okay.

635
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,160
Chairman Zhou, do you want to see me?

636
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,080
-Please have a seat.
-Okay.

637
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,200
What are the medical projects

638
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,000
that our charity foundation have?

639
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,040
We have special Fund for Children's Health
for the city's welfare center.

640
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,120
A certain portion of the fund is reserved

641
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,120
for the old and young who are left behind
in poor mountain regions.

642
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,000
We have an urgent issue now.

643
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,160
Our company has a project in Yunnan
that cooperates with a village.

644
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,840
Many of the villagers have caught
a very serious illness.

645
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,040
Find out what is the cause,

646
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,880
and intervene fully in the name
of the charity foundation.

647
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,800
Yes.

648
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,960
Remember.

649
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,560
Regardless of whether we can
settle the company's issue,

650
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,280
we must treat the illness.

651
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,760
Okay. I'll do it now.

652
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,160
The nurse said
when she was changing her clothes,

653
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,320
your mother's hands twitched slightly.

654
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,760
She also responded a bit to loud noise.

655
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,640
Does it mean
my mother could wake up anytime soon?

656
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,320
Will she wake up today?

657
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,360
Relax, Xiaomeng.

658
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,040
Here's what's happening now.

659
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,560
Last month, Chairman Zhou suggested

660
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,560
we purchase equipment for
treatment plans from overseas.

661
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,600
I've talked to Dr. Xiao,

662
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,800
and the hospital has specially bought

663
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,560
one of the most advanced physiotherapy
equipment in the world at the moment.

664
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,360
It's been treating Ye Sirong,
based on her daily condition.

665
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,800
The equipment has been purchased
according to Yan's proposal?

666
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,160
Yes.

667
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,520
Why haven't you told me?

668
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,080
I've just been informed
upon returning to the hospital

669
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,160
that I'd be on the medical team
for treating Aunt Ye.

670
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,480
I've also learned that it has imported
the latest equipment and technology.
