1
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,640
(Episode 22)

2
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,720
I don't want to be stuck in this hospital.

3
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,720
It's like a cage in here.

4
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,760
Sister Xiaomeng.

5
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,640
Can you take me home?

6
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,400
Tiankong, what's wrong with this place?

7
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,400
Look.

8
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,160
All these big sisters are here
to play with you.

9
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,440
And a big brother too.

10
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,680
No. It's not nice at all.

11
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,760
I don't want injections,
I don't want pills,

12
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,400
and I don't want surgery!

13
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,800
Sister Xiaomeng.

14
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,240
I'll behave.

15
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,960
Please don't send me here again.

16
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,640
I hate this place!

17
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,120
Alright, Tiankong. Don't cry.

18
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,720
Why don't I take you out to play?

19
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,160
Tiankong,
I know a place that's really fun.

20
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,400
Do you want to go there?

21
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,600
You're not lying, right?

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,760
Where is this place?

23
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,360
Come, let's find out.

24
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,320
Let me help you get changed.

25
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,360
Here, put these on.

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,760
These will protect your eyes
when you go out.

27
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,080
Sister Xiaomeng, are we in a park?

28
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,880
How did you know?

29
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,160
I can smell it, and hear it.

30
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,000
I can smell the grass, and the flowers.

31
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,440
There are many trees and birds here.

32
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,360
You're so smart, Tiankong.

33
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,040
You're completely right.

34
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,520
Sister Xiaomeng, why did you take me here?

35
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,280
Because you're the most well-behaved
and the bravest boy ever.

36
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,720
Over the next few days,

37
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,800
Sister Qiao Zhen, Brother Xiao, and I

38
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,440
will all play with you.

39
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,320
-Alright?
-Yes!

40
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,480
Tiankong!

41
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,720
Tiankong!

42
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,040
Are you okay?

43
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,040
Sister Xiaomeng.

44
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,480
Are you doing this

45
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,680
because I'm about to do my surgery?

46
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,520
Sister Xiaomeng,

47
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,920
I know you're doing this just for me.

48
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,400
But I'm really scared.

49
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,960
I don't want to undergo surgery.

50
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,080
I heard some people couldn't see

51
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,200
after they did their surgery.

52
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,440
Sister Xiaomeng,
talk to the doctor for me.

53
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,280
Tell him not to do the surgery, please?

54
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,800
Tiankong.
Let's not think about anything today.

55
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,720
Let's just play and have fun, okay?

56
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,680
Yes, let's play together.

57
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,640
You're flying!

58
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,120
Is this fun?

59
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,320
Yes!

60
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,480
Tiankong, don't you feel
like a bird flying?

61
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,800
Very much!

62
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,240
Let's fly!

63
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,720
Let's fly!

64
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,600
Little bird fly!

65
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,040
I'm flying!

66
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,360
Tiankong.

67
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,120
What are you thinking
in that little head of yours?

68
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,320
I was thinking if only I was a bird.

69
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,400
I could fly to wherever I want to go.

70
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,360
Tiankong, you know?

71
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,960
I want to be a bird too.

72
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,520
I want to fly freely

73
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,560
in the sky.

74
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,560
Sister Xiaomeng, let's fly together.

75
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,800
We'll fly across the sea

76
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,440
all the way to the clouds, okay?

77
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,040
Yes. I will go with you.

78
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,880
Let's fly! Fly!

79
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,040
Brother, can I really be a bird?

80
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,920
Of course you can be a bird.

81
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,560
You can fly in the sky,

82
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,160
and touch the clouds.

83
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,520
When you look down from the sky,

84
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,200
you'll see the green grass,

85
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,400
the red flowers,

86
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,960
and the sparkling rivers.

87
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,640
But I'm about to lose my eyesight.

88
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,800
Tiankong,

89
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,440
do you want to see this beautiful world?

90
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,240
Yes. But I don't want to do surgery.

91
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,600
Do you know what I do?

92
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,800
I know. You're a doctor.

93
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,480
I am a doctor.

94
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,000
That's why I can promise you,

95
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,560
after your surgery,

96
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,200
you'll recover very quickly.

97
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,720
Will I be able to see everything
after my surgery?

98
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,480
I promise you.

99
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,760
Look at this flower.

100
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,560
After your surgery,

101
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,160
you will see

102
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,040
its red petals and green leaves.

103
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,360
Tiankong,

104
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,760
what do you want to be when you grow up?

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,040
I want to be a painter!

106
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,240
But if I can't see anything,

107
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,520
I won't be able to paint anymore.

108
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,760
Tiankong, I have faith in you.

109
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,720
When your eyes get better,

110
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,640
you'll definitely be able to paint again.

111
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,800
You'll paint such a colorful world.

112
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,360
But I'm afraid of the pain.

113
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,840
People say surgeries are painful.

114
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,320
Remember what Sister Xiaomeng said?

115
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,360
You're the bravest boy

116
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,800
in the world.

117
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,440
If only it wouldn't hurt at all.

118
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,480
I'm a doctor.

119
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,560
I know this surgery well.

120
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,400
It'll be like going to sleep.

121
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,600
When you wake up and open your eyes,

122
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,520
you'll be able to see Sister Xiaomeng

123
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
and Director Lin clearly.

124
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,040
Really? Will it not hurt at all?

125
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,040
Of course!

126
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,040
He's a doctor. He's always right.

127
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,640
We'll be with you the whole time.

128
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,360
We'll be rooting for you.

129
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,160
Sister Xiaomeng. Will you be with me

130
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,880
during the surgery too?

131
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,520
Of course, Tiankong.

132
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,120
I promise you.

133
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,240
All of us will be with you.

134
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,040
After your surgery,

135
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,880
you'll be able to see all of us

136
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,760
and continue painting.

137
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,200
You'll be a painter again.

138
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,320
Sister Xiaomeng. I'll do as you say.

139
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,760
I'll do the surgery.

140
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,920
After the surgery,

141
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,200
I'll be able to see you,

142
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,720
Sister Qiao Zhen, and Big Brother.

143
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,200
Oh right, and Mommy Lin too.

144
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,320
Also, I want to continue painting.

145
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,480
Tiankong, you're the best.

146
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,680
Good job, we're so proud of you.

147
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,480
Thank you, Sister Xiaomeng.

148
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,920
Thank you, Sister Qiao Zhen.

149
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,240
Thank you, Big Brother.

150
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,160
Tiankong,

151
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,080
the person you should thank the most

152
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,760
is Big Brother.

153
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,360
When my eyes get better,

154
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,480
I'll make a drawing of you.

155
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,720
Make sure you make him look handsome.

156
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,320
He's so ugly.

157
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,680
Big Brother, are you ugly?

158
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,840
I'll make you better looking.

159
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,040
Don't get mad. Here.

160
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,880
Have some fruit. You'll look better.

161
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,480
I'm not angry.

162
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,200
You're right.

163
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,440
Tiankong.

164
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,720
Let's eat fruit too.

165
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,320
Are you ticklish? Are you?

166
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,360
Are you ticklish?

167
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,800
Dr. Xiao, Senior.

168
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,880
Thank you guys for staying with

169
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,640
Tiankong and I these last few days.

170
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,240
Thank you so much.

171
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,840
No worries.

172
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,360
We had a lot of fun too.

173
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,240
I haven't had so much fun in a while.

174
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,800
You were with Tiankong all day today.

175
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,800
You haven't eaten anything at all.

176
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,560
How about I'll treat you dinner later?

177
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,440
Xiaomeng, I'm a doctor.

178
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,520
It's my job.

179
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,400
Take Qiao Zhen out,

180
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,560
I'll stay

181
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,160
That's so impolite.

182
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,600
Xiaomeng wants to treat us.

183
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,920
How could you turn her down?

184
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,080
Exactly. Both of you have to come.

185
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,480
Alright then.

186
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,800
But I don't think
it's right for you to pay.

187
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,040
I'll pay instead.

188
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,400
Sure.

189
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,320
Xiaomeng will take us out.
Dr. Xiao will pay for it.

190
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,480
Perfect.

191
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,080
That'll make me happy.

192
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,920
Sister Xiaomeng, where are you guys going?

193
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,400
I want to come too.

194
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,640
Tiankong, not tonight.

195
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,240
It's getting late.

196
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,440
You should go to bed soon.

197
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,200
Alright, I'll take Tiankong to his ward.

198
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,720
You guys wait for me in the restaurant.

199
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,680
But I want to be with Sister Xiaomeng
a little longer.

200
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,880
Sister Xiaomeng, take me back to the ward.

201
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,320
-Okay, okay.
-Be good.

202
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,920
Tiankong.

203
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,160
You must listen to me.

204
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,160
How about this?

205
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,480
I'll take Tiankong back,

206
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,480
you guys can go ahead.

207
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,600
I'll join you later.

208
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,360
That sounds good.

209
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,800
Dr. Xiao, let's go.

210
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,880
But...

211
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,600
No buts.

212
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,280
He'll be safer with Xiaomeng
than any doctor.

213
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,760
Come on, let's go.

214
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,080
Don't worry. Let's go.

215
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,200
Xiaomeng, hurry up!

216
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,440
Alright, I will.

217
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,240
Let's go.

218
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,960
Tiankong, let's go back.

219
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,720
Dr. Xiao, you don't mind
paying for our dinner?

220
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,160
Of course not.

221
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,240
You wouldn't mind paying
for Xiaomeng of course.

222
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,480
But now there's just the two of us.

223
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,480
I don't know if you'll mind.

224
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,400
What are you talking about?

225
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,160
Alright then. It's a deal.

226
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,400
I'm going to order
the most expensive stuff.

227
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,880
I'll order the entire menu.

228
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,840
Qiao Zhen. Actually a doctor

229
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,800
doesn't make nearly as much
as people say we do.

230
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,880
Go easy on me.

231
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,640
You're so cute.

232
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,520
Come on, let's go.

233
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,600
Sister Xiaomeng,

234
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,400
why don't you tell me your favorite story?

235
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,840
Alright, I'll tell you a story

236
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,640
about a playground, okay?

237
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,920
Yes!

238
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,520
I want to go to a playground.

239
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,320
There was a girl named Wendy.

240
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,360
She really, really liked playgrounds.

241
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,440
Her brother Jack adored her.

242
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,680
And so,

243
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,520
Jack built a mini playground for Wendy

244
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,440
in their own house.

245
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,520
There were many

246
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,400
cute little things in that playground.

247
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,720
Such as a little train filled with eggs.

248
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,240
At night, all these toys

249
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,480
all came alive.

250
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,880
(A Yan)

251
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,440
I'm busy. What is it?

252
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,960
Well,

253
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,720
Tiankong's surgery is tomorrow.

254
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,480
I want to stay

255
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,760
at the hospital with him tonight.
Is that okay?

256
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,640
A Yan?

257
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,800
Alright, sure.

258
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,080
Go ahead.

259
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,640
But...

260
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,080
I'm a little worried about my mom.

261
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,320
She's alone at home.

262
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,000
I'll get Guang and Sister Hua
to take care of her.

263
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,480
-You...
-Yes?

264
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,760
Be safe.

265
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,760
Okay, I will.

266
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,120
Take a break and have a coffee.

267
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,440
I'm almost done. Thank you.

268
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,320
You're welcome.

269
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,800
Um...

270
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,160
there's a new Japanese restaurant

271
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,840
on Xingfu Street that's very authentic.

272
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,800
I was thinking...

273
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,640
Qingyan.

274
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,200
President Zhou.

275
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,960
Thanks for your hard work.

276
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,080
Once you're done with the documents,
go home and get some rest.

277
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,200
Tomorrow will be another tough battle.

278
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,360
With you around,
we're not afraid of any battles.

279
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,160
Bye, President Zhou.

280
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,920
Alright.

281
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,080
Qingyan, you were saying something
about Xingfu Street?

282
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,800
There's a very authentic

283
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,640
Japanese restaurant on Xingfu Street.

284
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,480
-I was thinking...
-Sure.

285
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,600
Tomorrow will be a long day.

286
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,880
Let's relax tonight. It'll be my treat.

287
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,080
Really?

288
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,600
Sure, I'll go get ready.

289
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,240
Unlocked. Please open.

290
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,680
It's so late.

291
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,360
Is Xiaomeng coming?

292
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,360
Hello, Xiaomeng?

293
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,440
What? You're not coming?

294
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,160
Alright. Take care of Tiankong

295
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,600
at the hospital then.

296
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,600
Okay, bye.

297
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,360
Xiaomeng said she isn't coming.

298
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,720
Come, let's keep drinking.

299
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,320
Cheers.

300
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,920
It's getting late.
We shouldn't drink anymore.

301
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,400
I'm in a good mood today.

302
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,880
Don't take my beer away.

303
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,240
Don't take my beer away!

304
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,280
Please stop drinking.

305
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,640
Dr. Xiao...

306
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,600
do you have a girlfriend?

307
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,840
No.

308
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,360
I like you.

309
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,040
I don't care if you like anyone else.

310
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,560

460
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,120

for getting the bid.

It's all thanks to you

482
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,280
for raising the price for Mr. Jiang.

483
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,840
I feel bad for your President Zhou.

484
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,760
He's going to pay hundreds of
millions more now.

485
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,080
He'll definitely be mad later.

486
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,320
Make sure you appease him.

487
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,880
You don't have to worry about that.

488

490
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
How is he?

491
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,560
Don't worry, everyone.

492
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,520
The surgery went very well.

493
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,760
He'll wake up
once the anesthesia wears off.

494
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,640
If he recovers well,

495
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,800
he'll be able to see
normally again very soon.

496
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,080

Could you check for me?

503
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,360
President Zhou, I was the only one

504
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,680
who knew about that document.

505
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,800

506

00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Okay, thank you.

509
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,120
Okay. Thanks a lot.

510
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,600
President Zhou.

511
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,040
Flights are all very full
so we can't switch.

512
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,320
We can only go back to Nanyue as planned.

513
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,880
Okay.

514
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,360
-Here you go.
-Hello.

515
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,440
Thank you.

516
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,560
Just put it down.

517
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,480
Enjoy.

518
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,720
The food's all here.

519
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,520
Dr. Xiao.

520
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,960
I want to propose this toast to you.

521
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,760
If you hadn't put in a request

522
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,640
to Director Lin about Tiankong's surgery,

523
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,840
things wouldn't have happened so fast.

524
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,760
You can't drink.

525
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,920
Drink this instead.

526
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,400
Xiaomeng, actually I--

527
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,720
Alright, you're just being modest.

528
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,000
But it's not all praise for you today.

529
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,760
I'm not pleased about one thing.

530
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,600
Did I do something wrong?

531
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,640
Why didn't you tell us anything

532
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,440
about you and Senior?

533
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,240
Senior, you too.

534
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,520
How can you call yourself my best friend?

535
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,560
You didn't say a word.

536
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,360
I've been so busy with Tiankong.

537
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,400
I didn't have time to tell you.

538
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,440
Dr. Xiao,

539
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,360
you've found the right person.

540
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,160
My senior is the kindest

541
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,920
and warmest girl in the world.

542
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,120
You must be good to her.

543
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,200
I want to make a toast to you today.

544
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,040
Here's wishing you happiness.

545
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,200
Okay.

546
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,680
You drank everything.

547
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,920
Drink slowly. You have a small mouth.

548
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,800
After what Xiaomeng said

549
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,920
-why aren't you drinking?
-Dig in.

550
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,480
Director Lin, have some of this.

551
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,600
Have some of this.

552
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
It's tea.

553
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,800
I changed it to tea for you.

554
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,040
Aren't you driving me home later?

555
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,160
This is very good.

556
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,920
You shouldn't drink if you're driving.

557
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,680
I'm too happy, I forgot.

558
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:03,960
I want to--

559
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,120
Dr. Xiao.

560
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,600
It's my turn now.

561
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,480
Dr. Xiao,

562
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,240
I want to toast you

563
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,520
for saving Tiankong.

564
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,480
You saved his life

565
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,680
and you saved our home.

566
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,840
Director Lin.

567
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,360
Please don't say that.

568
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,520
I grew up on welfare myself.

569
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,840
It made me what I am.

570
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,520
You're so modest.

571
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,720
This toast is on behalf of Tiankong,

572
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,800
but I also want to congratulate
you and Qiao Zhen.

573
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,480
I just heard about it.
You're such a good match.

574
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,000
I wish you all the best.

575
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,280
Thanks Director Lin.

576
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,360
Dr. Xiao and I

577
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,480
will come by the home a lot more often.

578
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,720
You must.

579
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,160
Let's make a toast to Director Lin.

580
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,120
Okay.

581
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,560
Why are you toasting me?

582
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,000
I'm the oldest here.

583
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,720
Xiaomeng,

584
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,520
Qiao Zhen and Dr. Xiao,

585
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,840
you three are so kind.

586
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,040
I'm so lucky to have met

587
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,920
the three of you.

588
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,240
If only there are more people like you,

589
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,200
this world would be so much better.

590
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,560
Director Lin,

591
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,080
stop flattering us three.

592
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,400
It's making me dizzy.

593
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,280
Come, let's eat.

594
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,960
-Let's eat.
-Why are you looking at me?

595
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,720
Let's stop talking and eat.

596
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,360
Senior, let's drink another glass.

597
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,960
Okay.

598
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,680
Cheers to all of us.

599
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,640
-Sure.
-Here's to happiness.

600
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,000
-Here's to happiness.
-Okay.

601
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,760
-Here's to happiness.
-Here's to happiness.

602
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,080
This restaurant is so good.

603
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,600
Yes, it is.

604
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,920
How are we leaving?

605
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,360
Senior,

606
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,520
you've been so busy the last two days.

607
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,520
You must be tired.

608
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,080
You don't have to come
to the hospital tomorrow.

609
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,040
I can take care of Tiankong myself.

610
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,800
It's been really busy at the station.

611
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,720
I really should get back to work.

612
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,360
Xiaomeng, where are you parked at?

613
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,600
In the parking lot behind.

614
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,000
I'm parked there too.

615
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,040
Director Lin, Qiao Zhen,

616
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,600
-I'll get the car.
-Wait here.

617
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,560
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

618
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,040
-Go.
-Bye.

619
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,400
Dr. Xiao, I never thought

620
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,440
you and Senior

621
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,400
would get together so quickly.

622
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,400
I already knew Senior likes you.

623
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,320
But you were always so slow.

624
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,200
I tried to give you hints so many times.

625
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,960
I'm such a dummy.

626
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,920
But I knew how she felt.

627
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,800
I was just too cowardly
when it came to love.

628
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,520
I must thank Qiao Zhen.

629
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,920
She gave me the courage

630
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,720
to make the leap.

631
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,320
Look how far we've come.

632
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,680
We did the art show,

633
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,360
and you and Senior got together.

634
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,360
Tiankong will be able to see too.

635
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,880
So many happy things have happened.

636
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,000
How wonderful!

637
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,480
What's wrong?

638
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,680
Xiaomeng.

639
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,760
Something has been weighing on me.

640
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,120
What is it?

641
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,720
The person who actually
helped Tiankong wasn't me.

642
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,600
You've told me before.

643
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,080
It was Jiang Ze who helped.

644
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,400
He got in touch with
the specialist from overseas.

645
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,160
I'll buy you all dinner soon.

646
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,880
It wasn't him.

647
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,800
It wasn't Jiang Ze?

648
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,320
Then why did he say yes when I told him

649
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,880
I wanted to thank him?

650
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,880
I don't know.

651
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,080
He probably doesn't want to miss

652
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,720
a chance to have dinner with you.

653
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,640
If it wasn't Jiang Ze,

654
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,720
then who was it

655
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,120
who helped so much?

656
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,400
It was the boss of Shenghai Group.

657
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,080
You mean A Yan?

658
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,080
Xiaomeng,

659
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,920
I'm just an average doctor.

660
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,800
I don't have the power to get
Tiankong a cornea donor.

661
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,240
Many people wanted to help Tiankong.

662
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,160
But the person who helped the most
was Mr. Zhou.

663
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,240
He was the one
who got in touch with cornea centers

664
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,680
and cornea donor organizations.

665
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,840
He found a donor organization in Sri Lanka

666
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,400
who agreed to give Tiankong a cornea.

667
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,200
I was shocked too when I found out.

668
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,920
But that's the truth.

669
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,240
The person we should thank the most
is Zhou Yanzhao.

670
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,680
Then why didn't you tell me earlier?

671
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,760
He didn't want me to.

672
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,320
I think he has his own plans.

673
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,400
Xiaomeng,

674
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,520
you should sit down with him

675
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,200
and clear your misunderstandings.

676
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,040
I don't know

677
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,960
if I'll ever get the chance to do that.

678
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,080
(Qiao Zhen)

679
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,000
Qiao Zhen's calling. Let's go.

680
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,200
-See you then.
-Okay.

681
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,360
Your car's here.

682
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,520
Director Lin, let me take you.

683
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,440
Thank you.

684
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,280
Be safe. See you.

685
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,720
Director Lin,

686
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,640
Tiankong will be able to see again
in a few days.

687
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,320
I'll come to the hospital
to see him often.

688
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,680
So don't worry.

689
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,280
I really don't know
how to thank you, Xiaomeng.

690
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,200
You didn't have to do so much.

691
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,040
You've done so much

692
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,320
so that Tiankong can see.

693
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,320
If it hadn't been for you,

694
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,000
I don't know what would've happened.

695
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,200
It was fate for me to meet Tiankong.

696
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,360
When I was feeling down,

697
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,600
he also helped me a lot.

698
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,280
That's why, Tiankong is lucky

699
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,680
to have a sister like you.

700
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,480
You're his mother now.

701
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,600
He's really lucky to have you.

702
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,160
Yes.

703
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,920
But this surgery was very high risk.

704
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,320
I kept reassuring Tiankong,

705
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,600
but deep inside

706
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,200
I was still worried.

707
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:57,960
I'm sure

708
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,600
it was the ring you gave Tiankong

709
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,560
before the surgery

710
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,920
that brought him good luck.

711
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,920
Tiankong.

712
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,840
This is my protective charm.

713
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,520
My mother left this for me.

714
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,880
Now I'm giving it to you.

715
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,760
Director Lin.

716
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,800
This is Zhou Yanzhao from Shenghai Group.

717
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,760
Mr. Zhou, nice to meet you.

718
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,400
I had a child

719
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,080
when I was younger.

720
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,120
But I lost him after all.

721
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,080
(Facial recognition system processing...)

722
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,280
(Complete)

723
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,120
(Test Results)

724
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,720
How...

725
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,960
How could this be?

726
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,680
(97% maternity match suggested)

727
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,080
That means...

728
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,320
Uncle Zhou...

729
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,120
really wasn't A Yan's father?
