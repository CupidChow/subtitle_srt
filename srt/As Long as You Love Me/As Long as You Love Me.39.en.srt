00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,720
(Episode 39)

2
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,200
Sister Hua,

3
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,520
get in the car with my mom first.

4
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,560
I have a few words with Yan.

5
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,440
Sure.

6
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,440
Yan, we are leaving now.

7
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,200
-Let's go.
-We'll get going then

8
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,240
Come on, Sister Hua. Be careful.

9
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,600
It's okay. I can walk myself.

10
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,840
It's tiring for you to do it yourself.

11
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,840
I'm fine.

12
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,240
Yan, we are leaving now.

13
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,920
Follow Dr. Xiao's instructions

14
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,800
at the nursing home.

15
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,160
Don't make decisions by yourself.

16
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,800
Are you really okay

17
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,200
on your own?

18
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,000
Don't worry.

19
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,360
It's more convenient for me to be alone.

20
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,520
Don't forget,

21
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,680
Guang is here with me.

22
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,320
Call me at once

23
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,800
if anything comes up.

24
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,400
I will come back to help you immediately.

25
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,840
Relax. Don't worry about me.

26
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,520
What matters most

27
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,080
is to take good care of your mom

28
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,160
at the nursing home.

29
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,400
As a matter of fact,

30
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,040
take care of Jiang Ze as well.

31
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,200
Yan.

32
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,680
How is it going?

33
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,360
I have contacted Dr. Xiao and Jiang Ze.

34
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,880
We will join them at the hospital later,

35
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,160
then we will go to the nursing home
together.

36
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,000
Go on then.

37
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,320
Okay.

38
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,800
Alright, we should go now.

39
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,040
Let's go.

40
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,040
Alright.

41
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,720
The procedures are done.

42
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,760
Dr. Xiao,

43
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,280
thank you so much.

44
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,880
I wouldn't know

45
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,040
what to do

46
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,320
without your help today.

47
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,000
You haven't done the procedures before.

48
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,240
Of course you wouldn't know the process.

49
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,280
I have worked in the hospital
for many years,

50
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,600
so this is a piece of cake for me.

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,080
Xiaomeng, I really want to help you

52
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,600
but...

53
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,800
I can't.

54
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,240
You should take a rest.

55
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,840
Alright.

56
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,880
We should get to the room now.

57
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,360
Don't just stand here.

58
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,040
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

59
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,920
I have cured many of

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,680
these kinds of patients.

61
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,640
After two rounds of treatment,

62
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,040
she will get better.

63
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,000
and she might recover her memory.

64
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,200
That's great. Thank you, Professor David.

65
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,720
This way.

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,880
What did they say?

67
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,200
I didn't understand anything.

68
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,880
Sister Hua, they said that

69
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,720
mom would get well soon.

70
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,720
That's great.

71
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,600
Right.

72
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,840
The foreign doctor is really good!

73
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,400
-Mom.
-It's good that you'll recover.

74
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,640
-Don't worry.
-I'll get you some food.

75
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,120
How is that?

76
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,200
It still hurts a little

77
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,760
but it's better than before.

78
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,560
You are recovering well,

79
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,560
yet your leg is still weak.

80
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,560
I'll arrange physiotherapy for you.

81
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,320
Is your family going to be
with you for the therapy?

82
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,000
Doctor, I will be with him.

83
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,240
Good. In your case, you just need to

84
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,400
do physiotherapy regularly,

85
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,440
and your leg will recover
completely before long.

86
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,480
That's great, Jiang Ze.

87
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,800
I know that

88
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,600
you'll get well soon.

89
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,200
I told you I'm not that fragile.

90
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,000
Alright. That's it for now.

91
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,440
Call me

92
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,400
if anything happens.

93
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,360
-Sure.
-Thank you, doctor.

94
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,000
Do you want some fruit?

95
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,400
Sure, thank you.

96
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,440
It has been a long time

97
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,600
since our workers stopped working

98
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,080
due to shortage of funding.

99
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,800
It has a great impact

100
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,120
on the reputation of Shenghai group.

101
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,600
Our public relations department

102
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,600
has gotten in touch

103
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,520
with the workers' representative

104
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,840
and tried to negotiate with them.

105
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,840
But it's not very effective.

106
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,360
Chairman Zhou,

107
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,280
our lack of funding has caused

108
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,320
a breach of acquisition contracts.

109
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,640
Our vendors are pushing us every day.

110
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,200
If this goes on,

111
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,920
I think they may

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,600
take legal actions against us.

113
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,280
This is the toughest time

114
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,600
for Shenghai Group.

115
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,760
But I think we may see
the light at the end of the tunnel soon.

116
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,280
I am seeking

117
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,600
partnership with other companies.

118
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,880
Once the funding is in place,

119
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,560
the issues we're facing

120
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,840
will be resolved immediately.

121
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,720
We have to calm the workers down.

122
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,440
Try to raise some funds first

123
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,600
and pay the workers some money first.

124
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,080
Regarding the vendors.

125
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,280
Talk to them.

126
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,800
After all, we've partnered with them for
such a long time.

127
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,040
I think it should not be a big problem

128
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,280
for them to hang with us for another
while.

129
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,360
Thank you very much.

130
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,280
Chairman Zhou,

131
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,840
Vice president Jiang has just sent
a message in the group

132
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,880
to notify us of
an urgent board meeting tomorrow.

133
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,240
(Notification of an Urgent Board Meeting)

134
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,560
(Shenghai Group Holdings Ltd.)

135
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,280
(Jiang Qiancheng, September 6th, 2017)

136
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,160
Chairman Zhou, what should we do?

137
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,040
Even if you tortured yourself

138
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,200
the problems won't be solved.

139
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,360
The best case scenario would be

140
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,280
a failure in the PR strategy

141
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,840
which will intensify the impact of
the strike,

142
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,120
causing Shenghai's share price to plunge.

143
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,640
Jiang Qingcheng would then conspire

144
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,000
with the board members to dismiss me
as CEO.

145
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,320
If this is the best scenario,

146
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,720
what about the worst case scenario?

147
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,000
Jiang Qingcheng

148
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,120
would acquire a massive external capital

149
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,680
to boost his shares in Shenghai.

150
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,000
My equity and Xiaomeng's

151
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,960
would be diluted.

152
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,560
When Jiang Qingcheng's owns

153
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,640
more shares in Shenghai than me,

154
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,680
he will take over Shenghai Group.

155
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,400
You won't let him succeed.

156
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,800
Jiang Qingcheng will try every way

157
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,200
to dismiss me as CEO.

158
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,280
I am in a very difficult position now.

159
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,440
But no matter what,

160
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,760
I will guard Shenghai Group

161
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,880
and protect Xiaomeng's equity.

162
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,120
Why are you sighing?

163
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,640
Don't you not trust me?

164
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,800
Brother Yan,

165
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,400
if I don't trust you,

166
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,560
you wouldn't be able to see me

167
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,800
in such a critical moment.

168
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,760
Thank you very much, Professor David.

169
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,800
I really appreciate your help

170
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,840
for communicating with the patient.

171
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,280
Later, I will have
a case discussion meeting

172
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,520
in the room over there.

173
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,800
I hope you can join.

174
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,040
Then we can have a talk about
Chinese traditional medicine

175
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,200
and western medicine.

176
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,000
It's my pleasure.

177
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,600
See you later at the meeting room.

178
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,200
Okay. So, don't miss it.

179
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,720
Be sure to come.

180
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,320
Yeah, here's the report.

181
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,400
See you. Bye.

182
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,440
-See you.
-Bye.

183
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,120
Xiaomeng.

184
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,840
Sister Hua, keep an eye on my mom.

185
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,800
I'll be back soon.

186
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,600
Dr. Xiao.

187
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,160
What did the foreign expert

188
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,160
say to you?

189
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,960
There's some difference between
Chinese and western treatment.

190
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,320
There are also different approaches
for particular cases.

191
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,920
I will list all the things to watch
out for later.

192
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,360
Then I will post it in the patient's room.

193
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,640
You should also tell Sister Hua

194
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,800
to pay attention

195
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,720
when she looks after Aunt Ye.

196
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,960
I'm glad you are here,

197
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,040
so that my mom's treatment

198
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,040
has gone very well.

199
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,560
Don't say that.

200
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,120
Aunt Ye has helped me since my childhood.

201
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,800
I'm just returning the favor.

202
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,160
Professor David said that

203
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,680
Aunt Ye will recover very soon.

204
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,280
All we need now is

205
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,760
time and patience.

206
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,240
You have to believe that

207
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,360
Aunt Ye will recover very soon.

208
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,280
I do believe that

209
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,640
mom will get well soon.

210
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,840
We will treat Aunt Ye

211
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,200
in the following three approaches.

212
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,520
Firstly, medicine

213
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,160
with a dietary therapy.

214
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,800
Secondly, counseling.

215
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,160
Alright.

216
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,160
I'm late. Let's begin.

217
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,280
Since Chairman Zhou is here,

218
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,720
let's start the board meeting.

219
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,520
Everyone,

220
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,640
the investment in the sports arena project

221
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,240
has caused great tension

222
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,640
to our funding.

223
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,160
Also, the workers' strike

224
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,480
has been violently suppressed

225
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,600
by Chairman Zhou

226
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,600
and it has a great impact.

227
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,120
The share price of our company

228
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,560
has dropped to
the lowest point in the last three years.

229
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,960
The total value of our assets

230
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,120
has shrunk by 20%.

231
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,760
If the situation goes on,

232
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,560
our company won't survive.

233
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,400
Yes, it has never been
as tough as this year.

234
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,000
Yes. Our efforts in the last year is
in vain.

235
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,800
Stop talking.

236
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,960
Listen to Vice president Jiang.

237
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,360
We can no longer withstand the pressure

238
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,200
from the board members and the public,

239
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,760
so I've called for this

240
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,920
urgent board meeting

241
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,080
to discuss the issue of

242
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,360
the lack of funding.

243
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,560
With my efforts,

244
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,400
currently Fanhai Capital,

245
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,680
Shenjian Investment, and Luye Industrial

246
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,400
are willing to join our group

247
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,240
with the capital of six billion dollars.

248
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,560
In the board meeting today

249
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,400
we shall vote for the acquisition

250
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,600
of shares by these companies.

251
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,160
I agree.

252
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,080
This is great news.

253
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,520
Fanhai Capital, Shenjian Investment

254
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,840
and Luye Industrial

255
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,240
are the biggest investment companies

256
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,520
in our city.

257
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,560
Under such unfavorable circumstances,

258
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,400
a massive investment of

259
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,800
six billion

260
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,000
is definitely a great relief to us.

261
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,440
Vice president Jiang,

262
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,520
you are the savior of Shenghai.

263
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,920
Us small board members

264
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,200
can't be happier.

265
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,920
We can't be happier.

266
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,360
Yes, such good news.

267
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,840
That's right.

268
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,560
Dear board members, hear me out.

269
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,640
Perhaps Chairman Zhou

270
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,760
may not want to hear this.

271
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,840
In order to get Shenghai

272
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,320
out of the current plight,

273
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,920
I must say,

274
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,760
funding is the most common challenge

275
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,920
for real estate companies.

276
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,360
Yet there is no other company

277
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,400
who would make such a mess

278
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,240
with the PR incident.

279
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,800
I have to say that

280
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,920
now I seriously doubt

281
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,520
the capability of Chairman Zhou.

282
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,360
I propose

283
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,800
for the development of Shenghai Group,

284
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,440
we should discuss

285
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,560
whether Chairman Zhou is able to

286
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,240
continue his leadership in Shenghai

287
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,960
and whether he can

288
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,920
ensure the interest of every board member.

289
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,400
Director Xu, take it easy.

290
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,920
According to the agenda

291
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,400
of this board meeting,

292
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,240
we should only vote for

293
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,440
the issue that's discussed in this
meeting.

294
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,040
Today, we are only discussing

295
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,160
the injection of capital funding

296
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,000
and the change in equity.

297
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,920
Whether Chairman Zhou's method of
management

298
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,400
is appropriate,

299
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,200
it's not in

300
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,400
the scope of our discussion today.

301
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,000
Moreover, the suitability of

302
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,080
Chairman Zhou's management

303
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,000
should not be judged by speculation.

304
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,560
We need to judge with evidence, right?

305
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,360
Vice president Jiang and board members,

306
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,360
Director Xu is right.

307
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,760
My stubbornness

308
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,160
and arrogance

309
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,720
have led the operation of Shenghai

310
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,160
into a huge turbulence.

311
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,560
I've failed to do my job.

312
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,560
With the injection of solid capital

313
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,720
into Shenghai Group,

314
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,960
it will certainly
bring new energy to the group.

315
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,080
The strength of the three investment
companies

316
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,080
is widely recognized.

317
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,360
Not only can it relieve
our pressure in funding,

318
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,760
it will also extend the scope
for the restructuring

319
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,280
of our group's business.

320
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,160
I approve of the participation of
these companies.

321
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,920
Please make a decision, board members.

322
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,560
That's right.

323
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,600
Great. Let's vote.

324
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,440
Come in.

325
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,080
Xiaomeng, why are you here?

326
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,440
Don't move, Jiang Ze.

327
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,440
Lie down.

328
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,840
I just want to check on you.

329
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,440
Just when I wanted to have fruit,

330
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,560
you've brought fruits.

331
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,360
-Eat more, then.
-Sure.

332
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,200
The apple is so sweet.

333
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,680
How are you?

334
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,600
Is it boring

335
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,320
to stay in a nursing home?

336
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,840
I'm not bored.

337
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,120
Aren't you staying here too?

338
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,280
I'm having fun.

339
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,000
Doesn't your leg hurt?

340
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,520
I feel much better. How is your mom?

341
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,640
What's the matter?

342
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,920
My mom is on her way to recovery.

343
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,360
She has many of her memories back.

344
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,640
But I still think that

345
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,560
there's something

346
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,920
hidden in her mind.

347
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,440
She wouldn't tell me even when I asked.

348
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,200
Xiaomeng, everyone has kept

349
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,960
some secret in their hearts.

350
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,960
Even you have secrets, right?

351
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,240
Come on. Have a slice of apple. Relax.

352
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,760
Sure.

353
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,520
Alright. Don't stick around here.

354
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,800
Go back to your mom.

355
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,400
Visit me again when you have time.

356
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,520
Don't worry.

357
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,920
I will take very good care of you.

358
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,200
So I am very important

359
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,360
in your heart.

360
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,680
Take care of me forever then.

361
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,880
Do you want to lie here
for the rest of your life?

362
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,280
Xiaomeng, I'll stop messing with you.

363
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,520
Go back to your mom.

364
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,960
Alright. I'm leaving then.

365
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,520
Call me

366
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,520
if you need anything.

367
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,760
-Bye.
-Bye.

368
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,640
Boss,

369
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,680
I have investigated thoroughly.

370
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,000
Lin Yueling got pregnant out of wedlock

371
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,360
and gave birth to a child

372
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,400
at Sydney Maternity Hospital.

373
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,000
The child was secretly adopted by

374
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,360
Fang Meijiao, Zhou Binli's wife.

375
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,880
In other words,

376
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,840
there is no way that

377
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,000
the boy from the hospital

378
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,000
could be Zhou Binli's son.

379
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,160
Fang Meijiao's child

380
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,200
died in labor,

381
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,800
so she bribed the doctor

382
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,480
and adopted Lin Yueling's son.

383
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,920
In addition to
the certification that we have obtained,

384
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,360
it is certain then.

385
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,000
Who could have guessed?

386
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,280
Zhou Yanzhao,

387
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,960
your doomsday is here.

388
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,400
Also, Zhou Xiaomeng and Ye Sirong

389
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,920
are in a nursery home. Shall we...

390
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,680
Zhou Yanzhao sent them away

391
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,120
so that he could be a good man

392
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,240
and shoulder everything.

393
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,080
Be patient.

394
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,160
We will take it slow.

395
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,440
You are right, boss.

396
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,800
Go! Pass it on to the media.

397
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,320
Let them dig into it.

398
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,600
Yes, boss.

399
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,560
No, no...

400
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,040
No...

401
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,000
Xiaomeng.

402
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,360
It's my fault

403
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,840
that you have suffered.

404
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,280
Mom.

405
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,760
Mom.

406
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,480
Mom.

407
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,320
Mom?

408
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,040
Mom!

409
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,840
Mom!

410
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,320
Mom!

411
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,480
Mom!

412
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,520
Mom!

413
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,160
Nurse, did you see my mom?

414
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,320
No, I didn't.

415
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,680
Thanks.

416
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,280
Mom!

417
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,520
Xiaomeng, what's wrong?

418
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,760
Dr. Xiao, my mom is missing again.

419
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,720
Did you see her?

420
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,960
Don't worry. Let's search separately.

421
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,840
Okay.

422
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,200
It's my fault.

423
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,760
I'm sorry, Yan.

424
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,440
Xiaomeng,

425
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,000
I owe you the most.

426
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,920
You have suffered a lot of pain

427
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,760
which you don't deserve.

428
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,480
Mom remembers now.

429
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,040
But I don't know how to explain to you.

430
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,280
I can't explain everything to you.

431
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,560
I just want

432
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,440
peace.

433
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,400
Xiaomeng,

434
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,000
mom is leaving.

435
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,440
Take care of yourself.

436
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:12,080
Aunt Ye!

437
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,720
Aunt Ye!

438
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,320
Mom!

439
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,240
Mom!

440
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,120
Aunt Ye!

441
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,840
Aunt Ye!

442
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,160
Aunt Ye!

443
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,040
Aunt Ye!

444
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,360
Mom, come out!

445
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,320
-Aunt Ye!
-Mom!

446
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,000
Aunt Ye!

447
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,240
Xiaomeng, how's it going?

448
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,960
I've searched everywhere

449
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,440
but I can't find her.

450
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,680
Could she be at the beach?

451
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,040
The beach?

452
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,760
-Go. Let's have a look.
-Sure.

453
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,800
Let me go. Let me go.

454
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,840
Aunt Ye!

455
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,120
-What are you doing?
-Let go of me.

456
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,840
-Mom!
-Aunt Ye!

457
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,120
Let me die!

458
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,920
Don't think like that!

459
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,680
Let go of me.

460
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,640
Aunt Ye!

461
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,400
-Mom!
-I won't let go, Aunt Ye!

462
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,880
Mom!

463
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,400
-Aunt Ye!
-Let me go.

464
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,480
Mom!

465
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,440
Xiaomeng!

466
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,840
-Let me die!
-Hurry! Aunt Ye!

467
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,360
-Mom!
-Hurry!

468
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,680
-Mom!
-Let go of me!

469
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,000
Mom, why are you doing this?

470
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,200
Why are you doing this?

471
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,040
I am so worried.

472
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,960
You can't do this again.

473
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,760
I've let you down.

474
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,480
Mom.

475
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,120
Why did you do this?

476
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,720
Do you want to leave me?

477
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,360
Aunt Ye,

478
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,320
you can tell Xiaomeng and me anything.

479
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,000
We will help you.

480
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,080
You don't need to ask any further.

481
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,960
I won't say anything.

482
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,240
Mom, you must be hungry.

483
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,760
Let me get you some fruit.

484
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,800
Xiaomeng,

485
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,200
I am going to arrange

486
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,920
a psychiatrist for Aunt Ye.

487
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,280
Also,

488
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,920
don't tell anyone that

489
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,280
Aunt Ye tried to kill herself.

490
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,960
Tell Jiang Ze to do the same.

491
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,880
Got it.

492
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,720
Take care of Aunt Ye.

493
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,040
I'm leaving now.

494
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,520
Mom,

495
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,360
it's just you and me now.

496
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,080
Have you recalled everything?

497
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,000
Tell me.

498
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,560
Xiaomeng,

499
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,760
I remember everything.

500
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,440
I want to

501
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,840
tell you everything, but I can't

502
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,000
explain clearly.

503
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,240
Do you understand?

504
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,440
Mom, it's fine.

505
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,360
If you don't want to tell me,

506
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,040
then don't.

507
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,920
Just one thing.

508
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,240
Don't leave me again.

509
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:54,960
Okay?

510
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,080
My girl.

511
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,120
Ye Sirong walked into the ocean
trying to kill herself

512
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,400
and was saved by Jiang Ze.

513
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,160
Hold on. Let me think about this.

514
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,400
The media can't find out about this.

515
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,040
Someone tried to hurt her before.

516
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,280
If they find out about that,

517
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,360
I'm afraid they might do it again.

518
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,560
I've reminded Xiaomeng

519
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,960
and told her to ask Jiang Ze

520
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,920
not to tell anyone.

521
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,360
Why did Ye Sirong try to commit suicide?

522
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,400
Was her condition getting worse again?

523
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,800
It's not certain yet,

524
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,000
but I don't think she is getting worse.

525
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,080
Aunt Ye will be seen by

526
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,120
a psychiatrist soon.

527
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,840
Perhaps we will find out

528
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,040
what happened very soon.

529
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,040
When I have time,

530
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,680
I will visit you at the nursery home.

531
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,200
It's alright, Chairman Zhou.

532
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,360
I've got this.

533
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,680
Take care of Ye Sirong.

534
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,120
Take care of Xiaomeng.

535
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,200
Sure, don't worry.

536
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,560
Xiaomeng.

537
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,080
Jiang Ze.

538
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,160
Thank you for saving my mom.

539
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,720
It's so formal for you to say that.

540
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,880
We are good friends.

541
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,200
Moreover, even if it were somebody else,

542
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,680
I would've helped that person, too.

543
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,200
I don't even know

544
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,200
how to thank you.

545
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,640
When I've figured it out,

546
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,680
I'll let you know.

547
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,640
Jiang Ze,

548
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,680
I need to

549
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,480
ask you for another favor.

550
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,120
Sure, tell me.

551
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,880
Can you not tell anyone

552
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,840
about what happened to my mom?

553
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,520
Don't worry.

554
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,480
I promise I won't tell anyone.

555
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,840
Thank you.

556
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,440
Right.

557
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,080
Your mom still needs
someone to look after her.

558
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,680
Go back and take care of her now.

559
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,520
You should also take care of yourself.

560
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,040
I'm fine. Don't worry.

561
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,560
Jiang Ze,

562
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,240
you are a good person.

563
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,720
You are a good person.

564
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,360
A good person.

565
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,680
Ms. Ye.

566
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:18,880
You may see me

567
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,000
as a friend.

568
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,880
We can just chat casually.

569
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,160
Okay.

570
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,840
I heard that

571
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,280
you wanted to end your life

572
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,720
by walking into the ocean.

573
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,920
Xiaomeng is your daughter.

574
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,160
Have you thought about

575
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,840
how devastated she would be

576
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,960
if you are gone?

577
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,400
Were you trying to leave the world

578
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,600
to avoid someone?

579
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,480
If only

580
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,880
things could be

581
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,840
that simple.

582
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,000
Relax, Ms. Ye.

583
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,720
We are just chatting.

584
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,440
Dr. Xiao,

585
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,400
do you think the psychiatrist

586
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,360
can completely
resolve the issue in my mom's mind?

587
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,000
Xiaomeng, don't worry.

588
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,880
Aunt Ye should get well very soon.

589
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,320
But what if she does that again

590
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,920
when I am not watching her?

591
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,840
How could that happen?

592
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,000
You, Sister Hua and me are still here.

593
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,880
We will all keep a close eye on Aunt Ye.

594
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,520
We won't let her be in any danger again.

595
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,920
Mom.

596
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,280
Aunt Ye.

597
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,280
Thank you, doctor.

598
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,880
Xiaomeng.

599
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,080
Take Aunt Ye to rest.

600
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,320
I'll have a few words with the doctor.

601
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,320
Sure.

602
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,080
-Mom, let's go back.
-Sure.

603
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,640
What did she say?

604
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,240
She has suppressed her feelings.

605
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,480
I can tell.

606
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,880
She is hiding a lot of secrets

607
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,800
and is under a lot of stress.

608
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,400
She won't be able to open up

609
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,040
in such a short time.

610
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,480
We can only take it slowly
in this circumstance.

611
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,400
We can't push it.

612
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,360
Alright. Thank you.

613
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,240
You're welcome.

614
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,360
(Children switched at birth!)

615
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,640
(Shenghai's successor isn't the real son
of former CEO)

616
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,800
(The DNA test might've been leaked)

617
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,120
-Hello.
-Madam Lin,

618
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,240
there are some reporters here

619
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,360
to interview you.

620
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,680
No, don't let them in.

621
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,000
And don't call me again.

622
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,000
If anyone asks if I'm here,

623
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,040
tell them I'm not here.

624
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,960
(Turn Off)

625
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,800
Brother Yan, why don't we

626
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,240
take a day off and stay home?

627
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,040
We'll handle things as they happen.

628
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,000
Even if I keep hiding,

629
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,040
I will need to face it sooner or later.

630
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,840
Chairman Zhou, Vice president Jiang
is waiting for you at the meeting.

631
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,920
You...

632
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,600
I'll be right there.

633
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,520
Brother Yan, I think...

634
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,760
Guang, stop talking.

635
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,280
Drive faster if you can.

636
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,880
(Children switched at birth!)

637
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,880
(Shenghai's successor isn't the real son
of former CEO)

638
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,400
I believe you've all read the news

639
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,560
in the morning.

640
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,880
To be honest, I am shocked.

641
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,760
I worked with Zhou Binli

642
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,160
for so many years.

643
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,640
I would've never expected

644
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,480
such a news today.

645
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,160
The press couldn't make up

646
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,000
such things.

647
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,880
It is possible that

648
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,320
the Zhou family has been hiding the secret

649
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,120
-and it was dug out somehow.
-Right.

650
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,760
From what I know about the father
and son of the Zhou family,

651
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,440
they couldn't have done

652
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,760
such a thing.

653
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,680
Besides,

654
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,720
since Yan has succeeded his dad,

655
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,080
he has done a lot of work

656
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,360
for the company, right?

657
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,360
He is a young lad

658
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,800
who is ignorant of reality.

659
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,920
You see

660
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,040
what a mess he has made.

661
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,720
We thought

662
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,400
he should take after his father.

663
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,160
But now,

664
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,160
it seems that

665
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,600
the guy is only a toothless tiger.

666
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,120
You are right.

667
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,400
Everyone.

668
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,960
It's just a rumor so far.

669
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,080
Whether it is true or not...

670
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,160
Vice president Jiang,

671
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,320
you don't need to speak for him.

672
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,840
Look, the truth is right here.

673
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,120
-Yes.
-How can it be false?

674
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,480
Yan, you are back.

675
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,480
Quickly explain to everyone.

676
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,040
What is going on?

677
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,120
You are our CEO.

678
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,880
Your identity has a stake

679
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,440
in our company's reputation.

680
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,440
This is

681
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,440
my personal affair.

682
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,400
Whether it is true or not

683
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,880
and who did it,

684
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,280
I will investigate and verify myself.

685
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,440
You are all

686
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,240
board members of Shenghai Group.

687
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,480
I hope that

688
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,160
you will focus your attention

689
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,800
on the future of Shenghai Group,

690
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,960
instead of gossiping about me.

691
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,560
Chairman Zhou,

692
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,560
it's not like that.

693
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,600
We care about the news

694
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,120
because we care about

695
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,960
the future of Shenghai Group.

696
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,400
If you really aren't

697
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,560
the son of Chairman Zhou,

698
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,160
then you are not qualified

699
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,400
to inherit anything that belonged to
Zhou Binli,

700
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,920
including his shares.

701
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,120
You don't even

702
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,040
have the right to

703
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,840
talk about Shenghai's future here.

704
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,560
That's right.

705
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,000
If the old Chairman Zhou

706
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,400
knew that he had passed Shenghai Group

707
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,800
to the hands of a stranger,

708
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,920
he wouldn't rest in peace.

709
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,320
Zhou Binli was my father.

710
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,280
I was Zhou Binli's son.

711
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,840
It is written clearly
on the census report

712
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,160
of the Zhou family.

713
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,040
You are all
board members of Shenghai Group.

714
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,000
Do you need me to teach you

715
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,000
basic legal knowledge?

716
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,440
What do you think, Director Wang?

717
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,880
Yes.

718
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,040
Director Wang, Director Xu,

719
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,600
we can't say that.

720
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,160
Even if Yan

721
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,320
isn't Zhou Binli's biological child,

722
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,560
yet the relationship of father and son

723
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,760
is still real between them.

724
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,040
I wouldn't agree with

725
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,440
what you've said.

726
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,160
Yan, I have watched you grow up.

727
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,760
I know very well about

728
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,000
you and your father.

729
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,240
There must be some misunderstanding.

730
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,480
Vice president Jiang,

731
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,680
this news article

732
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,520
sounds very solid.

733
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
It has even published

734
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,960
my DNA certification.

735
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,560
Even I can't find any flaws in this
report myself.

736
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,440
Now, all the board members here

737
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,920
are certain that

738
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,920
I am not Zhou Binli's biological son.

739
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,960
You are the only one
who's still on my side.

740
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,480
I am so grateful for you.

741
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,040
Thank you for all your good deeds.

742
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,920
Yan, I did everything

743
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,240
for the sake of Shenghai Group,

744
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,280
which is built by your dad and I

745
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,920
for all our lives.

746
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,920
Shenghai Group is not

747
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,520
in an optimistic condition right now.

748
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,960
This news of Chairman Zhou

749
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,880
could be the last straw of

750
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,400
the reputation of Shenghai Group

751
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,440
in the society.

752
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,120
I propose,

753
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,600
for the future of Shenghai Group,

754
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,000
we shouldn't let Zhou Yanzhao

755
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,000
continue his duties as Shenghai's CEO.

756
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,840
-I agree.
-I also agree.

757
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,000
I agree.

758
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,640
-I agree.
-I also agree.

759
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,440
-I agree.
-I agree.

760
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,720
-I also agree.
-I agree.

761
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,040
Calm down, everyone.

762
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,160
Sit down.

763
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:30,920
Sit down.

764
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,440
You all are

765
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,320
board members of Shenghai Group.

766
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,000
We have to make every decision cautiously

767
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,000
for the sake of the company.

768
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,640
We can't be affected by rumors.

769
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,480
We often make wrong decisions

770
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,200
when we are hotheaded.

771
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,080
Vice president,

772
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,600
-you are absolutely correct.
-Sit.

773
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,560
Yan.

774
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,280
Before everything

775
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,680
has been thoroughly investigated,

776
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,200
the board will not terminate

777
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,640
your position as CEO.

778
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,560
But the news

779
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,040
has damaged our company's image.

780
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,400
I hope you can

781
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,560
stop all your work in hand immediately.

782
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,800
We will handle it by the rules

783
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,760
when the truth is out.

784
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,320
Today, we've had an urgent board meeting.

785
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,920
We will continue the discussion

786
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,280
in the regular meeting next month.

787
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,480
Starting from today, I,

788
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,000
as the Vice President of Shenghai,

789
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,240
will handle the CEO's duties

790
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,120
and execute the CEO's authority
in the interim.

791
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,000
Do you think

792
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,360
my decision is appropriate?

793
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,760
If no one objects, it is agreed then.

794
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,640
Yan,

795
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,080
you can go home

796
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,200
and handle your personal affairs.

797
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,120
Let us know if you need help.

798
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,120
Meeting dismissed.

799
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,400
Let's go.

800
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,280
Chairman Zhou, I will see you out.

801
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,360
Qingyan,

802
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,160
thank you.

803
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,560
The elevator is here.
