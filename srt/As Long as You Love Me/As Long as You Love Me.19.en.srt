00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,920
(Episode 19)

2
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,480
Yan,

3
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,680
since my mom woke up,

4
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,920
she has been like this.

5
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,360
not answering to anybody's questions.

6
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,840
She just kept calling my name.

7
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,800
But I got the feeling.

8
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,440
She couldn't even recognize me.

9
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,320
Xiaomeng...

10
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,760
Chairman Zhou, don't worry.

11
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,560
Condition like this is quite normal.

12
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,960
Maybe after some time

13
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,760
the patient's memories will return.

14
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,560
Chairman Zhou, I understand your feelings.

15
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,360
The patient has just regained conscious.
Her situation is still unstable.

16
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,400
-Correct.
-Regarding her condition now,

17
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,560
I can't explain to you
in just a few words.

18
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,200
Let's have a longer discussion.

19
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,320
This way please.

20
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,120
Yan, what do we do now?

21
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,640
You stay and keep an eye of the situation
until I come back.

22
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,960
Okay, don't worry.

23
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,680
Mom.

24
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,640
Xiaomeng...

25
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,040
Chairman Zhou, look here.

26
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,600
This x-ray was taken
at the initial stage of her coma,

27
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,160
as part of a full examination.

28
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,400
We specifically focused
on her injured head with an MRI.

29
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,800
This is the first x-ray.
You have seen it before.

30
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,640
Her intracranial injuries
and hemorrhage were severe.

31
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,480
Her condition was not optimistic.

32
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,520
Her condition was unstable too.

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Go on.

34
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,400
Look at this one.

35
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,320
While the patient showed
signs of activities for the first time,

36
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,160
we performed another check-up
and took this one.

37
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,680
Through our treatment,

38
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,760
her brain damages have recovered.

39
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,760
This is the best we can do.

40
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,160
Let's put it this way,

41
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,880
it's a miracle that the patient
has woken up from the coma.

42
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,760
I would like to know the precise
current condition of Ye Sirong.

43
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,560
What did Dr. Xiao mean
earlier in the patient's room?

44
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,480
Chairman Zhou, please don't get agitated.

45
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,800
Have a cup of tea.

46
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,720
You should elaborate more clearly.

47
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,960
Explain all the details.

48
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,360
Okay, Let me put it in layman's terms.

49
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,520
Chairman Zhou,

50
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,320
looking at her current condition,

51
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,680
although she has regained consciousness,

52
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,200
the trauma to her head was very severe,

53
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,080
causing irreversible injuries.

54
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,760
They result in her loss of
cognitive ability and intelligence.

55
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,680
Based on my observation these two days,

56
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,720
the current IQ of Ms. Ye

57
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,360
is probably lower than
that of a three or four year old.

58
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,720
Is it possible that she is pretending?

59
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,680
Regarding this,

60
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,120
based on the second MRI result,

61
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,600
there are still blood clots in her cranium

62
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,440
and they're showing
no sign of diminishing.

63
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,280
That will cause brain dysfunction.

64
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,440
Regarding if she is pretending,

65
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,040
I can't determine it
from a medical perspective.

66
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,320
When can she be discharged?

67
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,280
Today we will run some tests again.

68
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,840
If there is no problem,
she can be discharged.

69
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,160
She will have to come back
to the hospital later for some check-ups.

70
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,200
Yes.

71
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,320
Okay.

72
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,160
(Sun Lingxi)

73
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,120
Haven't I asked you not to call me?

74
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,480
President Jiang,
Ye Sirong has regained conscious.

75
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,200
What?

76
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,080
She has regained consciousness?

77
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,680
Did she tell Zhou Yanzhao anything?

78
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,160
She didn't say anything.

79
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,640
Or I should put it this way,

80
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,080
she can't say anything.

81
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,040
What do you mean?

82
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,360
Although Ye Sirong has regained conscious,

83
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,200
she doesn't seem to remember anything.

84
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,680
She couldn't even recognize Zhou Xiaomeng.

85
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,640
Her current IQ is close to
that of a three year old.

86
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,680
You continue sticking around
with Zhou Yanzhao.

87
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,800
As for who dies and who lives
is none of your business.

88
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,280
Don't expose your identity
because of that.

89
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,360
Understood.

90
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,360
Yan.

91
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,040
Chairman Zhou.

92
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,520
You drive Lingxi home first.

93
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,240
-Okay, I will pick you up later.
-Okay.

94
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,600
Chairman Zhou,

95
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,880
You can stay and take care of Aunt Ye.
I'm fine.

96
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,200
I can go back by myself later.

97
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,840
Stay safe.

98
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,800
Thank you for your concern.

99
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,920
Guang,

100
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,720
You go take care of the discharge papers.

101
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,640
Okay, Yan.

102
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,120
Yan, what did the doctor say?

103
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,000
Will my mom recover?

104
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,080
It's hard to say.

105
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,040
I hope she can get better soon
more than you do

106
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,800
so that I can listen to
the truth with my own ears.

107
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,040
But with my mom's current condition,

108
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,520
she doesn't know anything.

109
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,440
I will find out the whole truth
from her mouth.

110
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,200
Ye Sirong,

111
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,440
if you are pretending here,

112
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,040
I advise you not to do it.

113
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,480
Don't waste my time!

114
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,600
Xiaomeng!

115
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,240
I am scared.

116
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,200
Let's go.

117
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,000
Mom, it's okay.

118
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,320
I am here.

119
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,440
Everything will be fine.

120
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,120
Yan,

121
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,920
please don't scare my mom.

122
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,920
My mom really doesn't know anything now.

123
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,680
Look at her condition,

124
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,240
how could she pretend this?

125
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,320
I know that you don't trust us,

126
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,840
but can you at least trust the doctors?

127
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,600
Chairman Zhou,

128
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,600
the patient has lost all her memories.

129
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,960
She is not pretending.

130
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,320
Ye Sirong supported you
through university.

131
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,040
She is your benefactor.

132
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,480
I can't trust them

133
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,440
and I can't trust you either.

134
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,760
You can choose not to trust me,

135
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,400
but you can't doubt medicine.

136
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,920
I want her discharged immediately.

137
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,160
Her condition is not stable now.

138
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,640
If you insist on having her discharged,

139
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,320
please bring her back for check-ups.

140
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,400
Xiaomeng,

141
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,680
the condition of Aunt Ye is not good.

142
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,240
If you want her to be discharged,

143
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,640
you have to take good care of her.

144
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,000
Help her to familiarize with
everything in her life again.

145
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,320
She can't be left alone in this condition.
Do you understand?

146
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,680
Thank you, Dr. Xiao.

147
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,760
As a friend or a doctor,

148
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,520
I should be doing this.

149
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,200
Mom,

150
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,840
let's go home.

151
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,400
Listen to me.

152
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,080
You shall stay at my home.

153
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,280
On the one hand, it helps her recovery.

154
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,320
On the other, I get to keep an eye on her.

155
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,600
I have asked someone
to pack things for both of you.

156
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,360
You don't have to do anything.

157
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,960
Let's go home.

158
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,280
Let's go home.

159
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,480
We won't come back here anymore, okay?

160
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,040
Go home

161
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,560
Mom, come.

162
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,760
Mom,

163
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,440
-why did you stop?
-This...

164
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,520
Are you tired?

165
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,760
This is not home.

166
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,440
Mom, we will be staying here for now.

167
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,200
This doesn't look like my home.

168
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,320
Mom, don't be scared, I am here.

169
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,960
Yan, you left this in the car.

170
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,440
Mom, don't be scared.

171
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,040
I will protect you.

172
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,880
Let's go.

173
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,160
Let's go.

174
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,280
Mom, let's go.

175
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,680
Everything is fine.

176
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,440
Boss.

177
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,400
Ye Sirong has regained consciousness.

178
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,640
She has regained consciousness?

179
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,400
You should be prepared at all times
to do what you must do.

180
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,960
Yes, I understand.

181
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,960
A Ze,

182
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,920
come home now.

183
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,480
Play a round of chess with me.

184
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,120
Mom, slow down. Mind the stairs

185
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,960
Finally, you are back.

186
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,160
Dr. Ye.

187
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,320
Xiaomeng,

188
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,920
what happened to Dr. Ye?
How come she looks a bit weird?

189
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,120
My mom...

190
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,920
has lost her memories.

191
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,040
She can't recognize people anymore?

192
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,000
Oh my gosh, how could this have happened?

193
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,640
Dr. Ye couldn't recognize people anymore?

194
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,440
How will she be able to live her life?

195
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,600
What did the doctor say?

196
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,000
I can't believe it.

197
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,280
Dr. Ye, I am Sister Hua.

198
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,560
Don't you remember me?

199
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,600
Dr. Ye.

200
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,440
Sister Hua.

201
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,480
Xiaomeng, who is she? I don't know her.

202
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,000
Sister Hua,

203
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,720
my mom can't remember anyone now.

204
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,680
Then why is she
discharged from the hospital?

205
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,400
Why not stay at the hospital
for treatment?

206
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,800
The doctor said my mom
has lost all her memories.

207
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,160
She doesn't really know anything now.

208
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,400
But, it is already a miracle
that she can regain consciousness.

209
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,560
The doctor also said

210
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,440
my mom should familiarize
with everything again

211
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,880
to help her recover her memories.

212
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,760
This is the house where my mom
has stayed longest before.

213
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,880
That's why the doctor suggested us
to bring her here.

214
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,400
I see.

215
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,600
I will cook her favorite food for her now.

216
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,480
You take her to rest first.

217
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,840
Mom.

218
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,960
Mom.

219
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,520
Sister Hua is cooking
some delicious food for us now.

220
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,200
You must be tired now.

221
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,840
How about I take you to the room
for some rest?

222
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,280
Come.

223
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,240
Go back to the room?

224
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,400
Do you still remember?

225
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,480
It's this way.

226
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,240
Come, slowly.

227
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,240
It's upstairs.

228
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,160
Ye Sirong.

229
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,480
My father has been waiting for you
for a while.

230
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Come in and say hi to him.

231
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,000
Do you still remember
the person in the photo?

232
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,480
He has a lot to ask you.

233
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,160
You'd better not lie to him.

234
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,040
Who is he?

235
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,440
I don't know him.

236
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,880
Why is he looking at me?

237
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,000
Dr. Ye, are you asking who he is?

238
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,480
You're the last person he spoke to
before he died, aren't you?

239
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,240
He is Zhou Binli. He is your patient.

240
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,120
He hoped that
you would bring health to him.

241
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,640
Do you remember?

242
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,600
I had a knife.

243
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,440
It was red.

244
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,760
All of you stay away from me.

245
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,560
What knife?

246
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,840
What did you do?

247
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,200
I held the knife.

248
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,280
I held the knife

249
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,840
to cut watermelon.

250
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,440
Do you want to eat watermelon?

251
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,440
Ye Sirong,

252
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,320
-enough with this nonsense!
-Yan!

253
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,280
Xiaomeng!

254
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,600
I beg you,

255
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,080
please stop treating
my mom this way, all right?

256
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,640
She really doesn't know anything.

257
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,400
Don't force her anymore.

258
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,160
I am helping her recovers her memories.

259
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,080
This is the doctor's suggestion, right?

260
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,040
But the doctor said it has to be slow.

261
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,120
You stimulate her like this,

262
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,800
besides making her scared,

263
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,360
what is the benefit?

264
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,040
Yan, I am begging you.

265
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,680
Please understand and give us time, okay?

266
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,120
I know that

267
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,400
not even time can heal the wound
in your heart now.

268
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,400
But with my mom's current condition

269
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,120
really needs some time.

270
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,440
Zhou Xiaomeng,

271
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,240
maybe you don't know that

272
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,360
whether her memories can be recovered

273
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,160
is not important at all to me.

274
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,000
I only want her to remember

275
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,440
everything that happened
in this room on that day.

276
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
That's all I need.

277
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,040
Xiaomeng, let's leave here quickly.

278
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,400
It's too dangerous here.

279
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,440
This place is very scary.

280
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,960
He is too scary.

281
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,400
We have to go. We have to go quickly.

282
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,520
Let's go quickly.

283
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,960
You are wrong.

284
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,000
Everything is wrong.

285
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,960
Then what do you want me to do?

286
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,520
Don't you also want her memories
to recover as soon as possible?

287
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,480
Xiaomeng, be good.

288
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,560
Be good, don't be scared.

289
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,560
Mom is here.

290
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,280
Don't be scared.

291
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,720
Mom is here.

292
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,040
Don't worry, don't be scared, be good.

293
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,200
Mom will protect you.

294
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,080
Don't be scared.

295
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,720
Mom is here.

296
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,920
Mom,

297
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,800
when I was little,

298
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,360
did you bathe me like this too?

299
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,120
Xiaomeng, you are really good.

300
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,680
Mom,

301
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,080
actually I am already very happy
that you can regain consciousness.

302
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,480
If you really can't remember anything,

303
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,640
let's not think about it anymore.
Just forget it.

304
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,480
From today onwards,

305
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,520
we will start over, okay?

306
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,040
Xiaomeng, you are really good.

307
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,600
Let us start over.

308
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,520
-Start over.
-Right.

309
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,800
As long as Xiaomeng likes it.

310
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,560
Mom loves you.

311
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,040
Mom, I love you too.

312
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,440
In the future,

313
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,960
it doesn't matter if you can recover,

314
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,120
I will still take care of you.

315
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,320
I will pay all your debts.

316
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,360
As long as I am here,

317
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,320
you don't have to be afraid of anything.

318
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,640
Mom loves you.

319
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,880
Mom loves you.

320
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,760
Are you comfortable?

321
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,240
Yes, very comfortable.

322
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,240
Mom, it's okay.

323
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,720
In the future,

324
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,000
nobody will bully you again.

325
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,640
We will put on the bib now

326
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,080
and start to eat.

327
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,760
Xiaomeng.

328
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,680
I want to go home.

329
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,400
I want to go home.

330
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,320
Mom,

331
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,920
we don't have a home anymore.

332
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,920
We can't go back to our home anymore.

333
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,800
No. I want to go home.

334
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,160
I don't want to stay here.

335
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,480
-I want to go home.
-Mom.

336
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,440
-I don't want to.
-Mom.

337
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,440
Mom, don't be scared. I am here.

338
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,080
As long as both of us are together,
we can call the place home.

339
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,720
Yes.

340
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,440
I am not scared anymore now .

341
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,880
Xiaomeng, be good.

342
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,880
Okay, the congee is ready.

343
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,280
Come, mom, have a seat.

344
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,000
Dr. Ye, despite everything,
you are a patient now.

345
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,200
Yan has told me

346
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,720
to take good care of you.

347
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,400
So that you can recover faster.

348
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,880
I remember that your favorite food

349
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,520
is my seafood congee.

350
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,600
Here.

351
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,000
Come.

352
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,440
Try it.

353
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,560
See if you can remember anything.

354
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,840
It smells good, right?

355
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,760
Xiaomeng.

356
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,520
Sister Hua, let me do it.

357
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,000
Be careful, it's hot.

358
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,760
Mom, let me feed you.

359
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,680
Come, be good, open your mouth.

360
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,880
Yes, like this.

361
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,280
Eat more.

362
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,120
Come.

363
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,880
It's delicious, right?

364
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,200
Let's eat some more.

365
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,400
I don't want to eat anymore.

366
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,680
Okay, then don't eat anymore.

367
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,160
Mom,

368
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,240
let's have a walk at the backyard.

369
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,960
A lot of flowers are blossoming there.

370
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,200
They're very beautiful.

371
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,840
-Flowers.
-Yes.

372
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,880
Good, I want to see flowers.

373
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,920
Okay.

374
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,360
Let's go. I'll take you there.

375
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,880
Come.

376
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,440
Let's go.

377
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,480
People will not grow up
without going through some challenges.

378
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,840
This spoilt little girl...

379
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,600
knows how to take care of someone now.

380
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,040
Mom, do you remember?

381
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,480
The neighborhood that we used to live in

382
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,440
had swings like these too.

383
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,880
Back then,

384
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,040
you used to sit on the swing

385
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,600
and waited for me to come home.

386
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,280
When I was little, I went home
from school every day

387
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:05,080
and would tell you everything
that had happened in the school.

388
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,240
I remember back then,

389
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,040
you liked to wear a light-yellow skirt.

390
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,400
You had your hair done up,

391
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,840
and always had a book on your lap.

392
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,040
When it turned dusk,

393
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,720
I could see you from far

394
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,120
waiting for me on the swing.

395
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,840
You were so young and beautiful.

396
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,960
I can still remember that moment even now.

397
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,240
Mom, do you still remember too?

398
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,800
It's okay that you don't remember it.

399
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,920
I will help you remember everything.

400
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,120
Let us remember one by one, okay?

401
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,240
Xiaomeng.

402
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,440
Miss Sun?

403
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,040
What are you doing here?

404
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,600
Aunt Ye, hello.

405
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,960
I come to visit you and Aunt Ye.

406
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,440
I asked my friends to buy some tonic food

407
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,760
It is beneficial for the recovery
of cranial nerves

408
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,440
Miss Sun, thank you.

409
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,800
You are welcome.

410
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,680
How is the condition of Aunt Ye?

411
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,920
The doctor said

412
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,800
he didn't know when my mom will
be able to remember things again.

413
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,160
Since we came back from the hospital,

414
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,960
her condition has been the same.

415
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,280
Aunt Ye, hello.

416
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,760
I am Sun Lingxi.

417
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,880
Sun Lingxi from Shenghai Group.

418
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,560
Shenghai Group?

419
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,920
Aunt Ye.

420
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,280
You still remember Shenghai, right?

421
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,400
Zhou...

422
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,040
Zhou...

423
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,480
What are you trying to say?

424
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,640
Mom, are you trying to say
the name of Uncle Zhou?

425
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,600
Zhou Binli.

426
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,120
Mom, do you remember everything now?

427
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,400
Your father.

428
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,000
We shall go quickly.
Let's leave this place.

429
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,600
Quickly. Let's go.

430
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,040
-We should leave here quickly.
-Mom, it's okay.

431
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,720
Mom, what's wrong?

432
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,960
Okay, let's not think about it anymore.

433
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,040
-Let's go.
-Miss Sun, I am sorry.

434
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,920
My mom's emotion is not very stable now.

435
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,400
I have to bring her home.

436
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,640
Go home. Let's go home quickly.

437
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,120
We will go home now.

438
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,200
Stop thinking about it.

439
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,400
-Let's go home. Stop thinking about it.
-Go home.

440
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,960
Here, Miss Sun. Have a cup of tea.

441
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,800
It's Dark Roast Dahongpao, very good tea.

442
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,880
Based on my observation,

443
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,040
Ye Sirong is
in a very confusing state right now.

444
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,000
She doesn't know
what she is talking about herself.

445
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,640
Are you sure?

446
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,560
One's facial expression
always betrays the mind.

447
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,440
I've observed her expression
in her looks carefully.

448
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,080
Her eyes are dull.

449
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,080
I should say there isn't any response.

450
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,960
I don't' think Ye Sirong's
acting skill is that good.

451
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,440
You're probably right.

452
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,440
She has suffered serious injuries.

453
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,480
It's not easy to recover.

454
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,120
Have some tea.

455
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,560
However,

456
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,960
when we mentioned about Zhou Binli,

457
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,200
she had some different reactions.

458
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,840
What kind of reaction?

459
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,520
She seemed to be scared
and wanted to leave.

460
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,120
I couldn't quite put my finger on it.

461
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,840
But President Jiang,

462
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,080
why are you so interested in Ye Sirong?

463
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,720
Have some tea.

464
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,240
What do you think, Miss Sun?

465
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,240
What do you think about this tea?

466
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,960
Quite good.

467
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,840
Apparently Miss Sun doesn't
know much about tea.

468
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,160
Dark Roast Dahongpao

469
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,640
has to be brewed with rain water
boiled just enough to bubble.

470
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,440
What sort of water at what temperature

471
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,560
is very important.

472
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,920
If it's over boiled,

473
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,400
the aroma of the tea will be ruined.

474
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,360
It's the same in human relationship.

475
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,040
It's dangerous
if you have crossed the line.

476
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,640
I am just curious.

477
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,840
Haven't you heard about the proverb?

478
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,520
Curiosity killed the cat.

479
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,720
I am sorry, President Jiang.

480
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,240
I didn't mean to pry.

481
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,360
Okay, I will tell you.

482
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,760
I will tell you this time only.

483
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,960
I am interested in anything
related to the Zhou Family.

484
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:06,080
I hope that you can be an obedient cat
from now on.

485
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,040
This is the best for you.

486
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,960
Be careful. It's hot.

487
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,840
Xiaomeng, come and eat breakfast.
You are the only one who hasn't eaten.

488
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,680
You must be exhausted
taking care of your mom.

489
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,360
Sister Hua, did you see
where my mom went? Where is she?

490
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,640
Dr. Ye?

491
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,400
Yan took her out early in the morning.

492
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,640
Don't you know about it?

493
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,840
Yan probably didn't want you
to be too tired.

494
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,160
He was trying to help you out.

495
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,720
Where did he take my mom?

496
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,520
He said he wanted to take
your mom to a place.

497
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,000
It could probably help
recover your mom's memories.

498
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,680
But my mom is a patient now.

499
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,880
Where could he possibly take my mom?

500
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,120
How do I know?

501
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,040
What can I do?

502
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,360
Yan is not picking up my call.

503
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,440
Xiaomeng, don't worry.

504
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,280
You should trust me.

505
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,120
I have been working for
the Zhou Family for a very long time.

506
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,480
I know Yan very well.

507
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,040
Yan is only mean with his words,

508
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,760
but deep down he's very kind.

509
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,200
He knows what he is doing.

510
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,480
You know what,
you should just wait for him here.

511
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,880
They will surely be back soon.

512
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,840
Get off the car.

513
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,640
Move quickly.

514
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,720
Where are we going?

515
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,600
What are you doing? Where is this place?

516
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,240
This...

517
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,640
Dad,

518
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,080
I have brought your murderer here.

519
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,600
Zhou Binli?

520
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,680
Zhou Binli is dead?

521
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,680
How come I didn't know about this?

522
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,120
How come I didn't know about this?

523
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,560
You didn't know about this?

524
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,520
You were his personal doctor.

525
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,040
Tell me now.

526
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,120
What exactly had happened?

527
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,040
I don't know.

528
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,880
Are you not going to say something
in front of my father?

529
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:44,480
Ye Sirong, how much longer are you
carrying on with this nonsense?

530
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,760
Take me home.

531
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,360
I want to see Xiaomeng.

532
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,800
Go home?

533
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,680
Which home do you want to go?

534
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,600
Look carefully at
the person in this photo.

535
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,120
He trusted his health with you.

536
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,840
Tell me now. Were you the one
who caused his death?

537
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,080
I want to see Xiaomeng.

538
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,880
Can you please take me home?

539
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,200
Look at me.

540
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,560
I am Zhou Yanzhao. I am his son.

541
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,120
I am Zhou Binli's son.

542
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,640
Yan?

543
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,680
Yan?

544
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,480
Yes.

545
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,960
I am Yan.

546
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,480
Do you still remember me?

547
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,840
When Xiaomeng and I
were in the Sport Institute,

548
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,160
I called you Aunt Ye every time I saw you.

549
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,000
Aunt Ye, do you still remember me?

550
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,840
Tell me, how did my father pass away
in such a suspicious way?

551
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,440
What had happened on that day?

552
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,520
I am sorry, Yan.

553
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,280
I am really sorry.

554
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,760
-Sorry.
-Sorry?

555
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,000
Aunt Ye, why do you apologize?

556
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,320
Do you remember something?

557
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,800
Tell me what had actually
happened, Aunt Ye.

558
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,400
I am sorry.

559
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,800
I am really sorry.

560
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,280
I am sorry.

561
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,120
I am sorry.

562
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,200
I am sorry.

563
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,200
(Here Lies Zhou Binli, Rest in Peace)

564
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:57,960
Mom.

565
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,800
-Mom.
-Xiaomeng.

566
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,920
It's Yan.

567
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,480
Yan

568
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,000
Mom, are you all right?

569
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,040
Yan.

570
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,200
Yan, I am sorry.

571
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,360
Mom, can you recognize him now?

572
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,560
I am sorry, Yan.

573
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,160
I am sorry, Yan.

574
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,960
What did you do to my mom?

575
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,120
Where did you take her?

576
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,760
The cemetery where my dad lies.

577
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,000
My mom is a patient now.

578
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,080
You provoked her this way,
what do you want actually?

579
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,880
She keeps saying to me she's sorry
all the way.

580
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,040
She has not spoken anything else.

581
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,840
But what good can it do
by provoking her like this?

582
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,600
As soon as she heard my name,
she just kept saying she's sorry.

583
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,360
Doesn't this prove her inner guilt,
does it?

584
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,400
I am sorry.

585
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,680
-I am sorry.
-Moreover,

586
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,280
I took her to my father's tomb.

587
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,720
Although she can't be held accountable
by the law right now,

588
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,560
shouldn't she at least show remorse
at my dad's tomb?

589
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,040
I am sorry.

590
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,000
-Mom.
-I am sorry.

591
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,160
-Mom.
-I am really sorry.

592
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,400
-It's enough.
-I am sorry.

593
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,080
I know it. Yan knows it too.

594
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,000
I am sorry.

595
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,680
-Let's go in.
-I am sorry.

596
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,600
Yan, Xiaomeng. Lunch is ready.

597
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,000
We're coming.

598
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,280
Mom, have a seat.

599
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,120
Mom, I will put this on for you.

600
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,200
Mom, you shall eat more for lunch today.

601
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,320
Yan.

602
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,440
Yan.

603
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,800
Here. Let's eat lunch.

604
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,000
Come, eat more.

605
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,200
Yan, you are Xiaomeng's classmate.

606
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,520
You should take care of each other, right?

607
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,080
Right,

608
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,040
studying in the Sports Institute
is not easy,

609
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,960
and they don't serve good food there.

610
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,920
You shall come to Aunt Ye's home sometime.

611
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,120
I will cook something nice for you.

612
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,800
Mom,

613
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,720
Yan and I
went to the Sports Institute together.

614
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,480
Do you remember it now?

615
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,840
Zhou Xiaomeng.

616
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,960
What tricks are the two of you
playing here now?

617
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,440
The person that needs to recover
all the memories is her.

618
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,320
It's Ye Sirong, not me.

619
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,040
Both of you stop trying to touch me
with your acting anymore.

620
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,400
Yan, I am not.

621
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,000
Zhou Xiaomeng,

622
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,440
are you recalling the sweet memories
we had before?

623
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,800
It's all over.

624
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,640
Since the day my father passed away,

625
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,200
the Xiaomeng in my heart has--

626
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,200
What about it? Say it!

627
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,800
Died.

628
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,560
Yan,

629
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,320
do you really have to break my heart
with words like these?

630
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,360
Yan, I am sorry.

631
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,920
Yan is very pitiful. I am sorry.

632
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,640
Okay, mom.

633
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,160
-Yan is very pitiful.
-I know.

634
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,240
Yan, I am sorry.

635
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,320
Mom.

636
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,800
Why we should feel sorry for him?

637
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,360
He is the one that has
misunderstanding about us.

638
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,920
Yan, I am sorry.

639
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,360
Why?

640
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,280
Why?

641
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,120
-Mom.
-Why?

642
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,560
Don't think anymore.

643
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,400
If you can't remember it,
don't think about it anymore, okay?

644
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,040
Mom, it's okay.

645
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,040
Don't think about it anymore, mom.

646
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,600
If you can't remember it,
don't think about it anymore.

647
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,440
Mom, don't think anymore.

648
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,640
Don't think anything anymore.

649
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,000
-Hello.
-Xiaomeng.

650
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,440
Director Lin, may I help you?

651
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,800
Xiaomeng, I don't know
if it's convenient for you to come over

652
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,360
to the Children Welfare Center right now?

653
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,360
Right now...

654
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,240
is probably not very convenient
for me to go out.

655
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,800
Has anything happened?

656
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,680
It's about Tiankong.

657
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,120
Something has happened to him.

658
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,520
I feel embarrassed to ask,
but I can really use your help.

659
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,240
Can you please come here
as soon as possible?

660
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,120
Okay, I will go over there now.
