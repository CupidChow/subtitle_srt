00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,760
(Episode 24)

2
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,320
Whenever I see him,

3
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,800
I want to tell him...

4
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,240
that I'm his mother.

5
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm his mother.

6
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,280
Calm down.

7
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,920
Now isn't the time yet.

8
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,240
Didn't you tell me yesterday
not to tell him the truth?

9
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,720
When I saw him,

10
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,600
I thought what I'd done previously

11
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,000
and my thoughts were all wrong.

12
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,560
You ought to have told him I'm his mother.

13
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,440
I want to reunite with him!

14
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,320
-You can't be like that.
-I want to reunite...

15
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,480
Come, have a seat.

16
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,200
Let me suggest this.

17
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,720
We have to take it step by step.

18
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,280
At least now, he's with us, isn't he?

19
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,360
He's here where you can see him.

20
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,120
You can go see him whenever you want.

21
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,800
For now, this is the best situation,
isn't it?

22
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,280
You know it better than I do.

23
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,920
Once you tell A Yan about his background,

24
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,400
that will put him through troubles.

25
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,480
If you can't help telling him the truth,

26
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,880
you will just drive him away.

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,120
I'm sorry...

28
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,920
I didn't control myself.

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,960
I was too emotional.

30
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,320
Director Lin, don't worry.

31
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,160
I will definitely find a way
to arrange for you to see him.

32
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,520
No.

33
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,560
Didn't you say it just now?

34
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,840
You don't have to arrange for us to meet.

35
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,240
If I always show up in A Yan's world,

36
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,920
he will soon realize this issue.

37
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,520
As long as you don't
expose your intention,

38
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,040
he won't find out.

39
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,360
You silly girl.

40
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,040
You haven't become a mother yet.

41
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,280
A Yan and I are blood-related
mother and son.

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,520
In this relationship,
there is nothing between us.

43
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,600
A Yan is a smart boy.

44
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,440
He's sensitive as well.

45
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,120
Sooner or later, he'll find out.

46
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,560
Therefore,

47
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,960
keeping a distance from him

48
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,200
is actually the greatest help
and protection for him.

49
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,040
But can you really bear it?

50
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,000
I can...

51
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,320
As long as A Yan is well,

52
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,600
I can do anything.

53
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,400
However, Xiaomeng, please promise me

54
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,320
you will take good care of him

55
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,920
for as long as you stay with him.

56
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,120
Please.

57
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,880
Don't you worry.

58
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,600
I will.

59
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,200
Thank you...

60
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,480
You're home.

61
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,600
It's rare to see you home so early.

62
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,920
Don't you have
any business dinner tonight?

63
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,840
I'm taking a day off.

64
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,920
I heard from Guang that

65
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,360
Shenghai is facing a huge funding gap.

66
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,480
You must be under a lot of pressure.

67
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,400
I will handle it.

68
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,800
If Uncle Zhou saw how dedicated you are
to Shenghai Group,

69
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,520
he would be delighted.

70
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,720
Sometimes,

71
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,800
you've just got to do what you have to do.

72
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,040
A Yan, have you forgotten?

73
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,800
Uncle Zhou hired my mother
to be his personal doctor

74
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,320
because of his health issues.

75
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,120
My mother told me once

76
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,720
that Uncle Zhou was a workaholic,

77
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,040
had too many business meals to go,

78
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,560
and ended up overworking his body.

79
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,160
I hope you take care of yourself.

80
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,600
I used to look down on Shenghai.

81
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,760
Only after taking the rein

82
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
do I realize how heavy
my responsibility is.

83
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,920
It's a pity that
I didn't realize this sooner.

84
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,880
I should have come back sooner
and helped my dad out.

85
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,480
I let him down.

86
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,160
Perhaps...

87
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,920
Uncle Zhou didn't lose confidence in you.

88
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,440
He probably couldn't be more delighted
seeing you happy.

89
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,320
What about you?

90
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,920
Xiaomeng, have I let you down?

91
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,160
I...

92
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,320
You haven't let me down.

Xiaomeng,

00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,600
I have let you down.

115
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,240
No!

116
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,280
Go away! Go away!

117
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,760
Zhou Binli, go away!

118
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,240
I'm going to kill you, Zhou Binli!

119
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,440
I'm going to kill you!

120
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,600
I'm going to kill you!

121
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,240
Zhou Binli!

122
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,520
-I'm going to kill you!
-Mom!

123
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,920
-I'm going to kill you!
-Mom, wake up!

124
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,800
-Zhou Binli!
-Mom!

125
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,720
-Zhou Binli!
-It's just a bad dream!

126
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,320
Mom! Wake up!

127
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,280
Wake up!

128
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,320
-Mom.
-Zhou Binli.

129
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,280
Look clearly.

130
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,480
Zhou Binli.

131
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,240
I will not let you off the hook.

132
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,600
Mom! Look clearly.

133
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,320
I'm Xiaomeng, not Uncle Zhou.

134
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,960
And you're not a murderer.

135
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,000
You're not!

136
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,160
A Yan, you saw it for yourself.

137
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,360
My mom was just dreaming.

138
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,720
This was not real.

139
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,440
Mom, tell him!

140
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,600
Tell him now!

141
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,080
-Zhou Binli, get away from me!
-This isn't real.

142
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,680
-Mom.
-Go away!

143
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,720
Let's go.

144
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,040
No!

145
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,600
I need to stay here to look after my mom.

146
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,240
I can't leave my mom here on her own.

147
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,320
I'm not going.

148
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,920
Don't worry.
I'll get someone to look after her.

149
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,560
I won't do anything to her.

150
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,720
Even if she is a murderer,

151
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,560
I'll leave her in the hands of the court.
Go now.

152
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,040
A Yan.

153
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,760
I have to say what my mum said isn't real.

154
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,280
She isn't in a clear state of mind.

155
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,640
A Yan, I beg you,

156
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,640
please believe me.

157
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,520
Dr. Xiao has already explained

158
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,640
that what she can recall
is all fragmented memories.

159
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,000
It means what she just said
is part of her memory!

160
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,800
It was just a nightmare, not a memory.

161
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,080
Enough! Stop talking!

162
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,040
Brother Yan.

163
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,200
How is she?

164
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,960
She's sleeping after taking sedatives.

165
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,360
Sister Hua is staying by her side.

166
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,840
Guang, you should have an early night.

167
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,320
Take Xiaomeng to the hospital tomorrow.

168
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,200
Yes.

169
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,680
Come in.

170
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,840
Chairman Zhou,

171
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,120
this delivery came this morning.

172
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,200
It's for you.

173
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,120
Besides, Manager Liu,
who's in charge of Properties,

174
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,240
will be in the conference room
in half an hour.

175
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,640
All right, I get it.

176
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,520
You go over there

177
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,080
and sort out these documents.

178
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,120
All right.

179
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,320
-Come in.
-Lingxi.

180
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,760
What is this?

181
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,400
A picture book sent by a friend.

182
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,200
What's the matter?

183
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,400
The first phase construction plan

184
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,320
of the Commercial Integrated Sports Center

185
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,240
is out.

186
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,440
The 3D version is still in the making.

187
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,560
This is a related document
that requires your signature.

188
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,040
Is Aunt Ye getting better?

189
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,720
There's not much improvement.

190
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,000
I've read a lot of medical case reports

191
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,640
about different ways to awaken
her memories deep in the brain.

192
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,800
The success rate is very high.

193
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,960
Let's just wish her a speedy recovery.

194
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,280
I plan to visit her in a couple of days.

195
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,200
Would that be all right with you?

196
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,600
Whatever suits you.

197
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,440
I have another document
that requires Secretary Chang's signature.

198
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,600
Go ahead.

199
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,400
Secretary Chang,

200
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,400
please sign here and write the date there.

201
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,720
Signature?

202
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,560
You signed at the wrong place!
I just told you to sign here.

203
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,080
I'm sorry...

204
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,960
I'm sorry...

205
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,640
Qingyan!

206
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,640
Pay attention.

207
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,160
Chairman Zhou, I'm sorry.

208
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,760
I'm sorry.

209
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,880
Never mind.

210
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,360
I can just print a new one.

211
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,960
Qingyan.

212
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,200
Chang Qingyan!

213
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,560
I...

214
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,800
You have to stay focused at work.

215
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,720
Don't make any mistake.

216
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,280
I'm sorry, Chairman Zhou.

217
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,720
Now go outside
and sort out those documents.

218
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,320
Understood.

219
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,200
(A Yan, I hope
you find the picture book useful. Lin)

220
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,920
Lingxi!

221
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,120
I'm very sorry about that.

222
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,680
Now you have to print it again
because of my fault.

223
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,400
It's nothing.

224
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,360
I'll let you sign it
after printing it out.

225
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,240
Thanks.

226
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,800
You don't look well. Are you ill?

227
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,600
Do I? Well, I...

228
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,960
You have to take good care of yourself.

229
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,360
Work has been hectic.

230
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,080
You are Chairman Zhou's right-hand man.
You can't fall ill.

231
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,080
Yes, thank you.

232
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,120
Do let me know if you need anything.

233
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,240
I'll do my best to help.

234
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,560
Why do I feel like you're acting
a bit strange today?

235
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,400
Am I?

236
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,720
I'm fine.

237
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,760
That's good to hear. I'd better get going.

238
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,640
Hold on.

239
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,720
How about I walk you there?

240
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,480
I'm just going back to my office,
not somewhere far away.

241
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,080
-Oh right...
-Alrl ight, I'm going now.

242
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,280
When I get this printed,
I'll take it to you.

243
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,680
Thank you.

244
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,680
Take care.

245
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,240
Who are you?

246
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,560
Why are you looking at me like that?

247
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,400
Don't do that.

248
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,960
I...

249
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,160
Why are you staring at me?

250
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,960
You... are still smiling.

251
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,040
Why... are you smiling at me?

252
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,600
You...

253
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,320
Why are you smiling at me?

254
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,880
Why are you smiling at me?

255
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,440
Why are you smiling at me?

256
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,040
Why are you smiling at me?

257
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,680
Why?

258
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,040
Dr. Ye, you can't tear this apart!

259
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,080
You can't tear this apart!

260
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,520
I want to go home!

261
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,440
Go to my home!

262
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,120
Dr. Ye, you can't tear this apart!

263
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,880
You stay here. We can take care of you.

264
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,920
I don't want to see him.

265
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,040
-I don't want to stay here.
-All right...

266
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,160
-I want to go home!
-You won't see this again.

267
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,000
Don't leave!

268
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,480
I beg you. I want to go home!

269
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,920
-Don't go!
-I don't want to stay here!

270
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,440
All right, you won't see this again.

271
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,720
-I want to go home!
-All right...

272
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,760
-All right, you'll go home!
-I want to go home!

273
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,360
-Go home.
-Go home...

274
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,640
All right...

275
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,800
This is your prescription.

276
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,360
Remember to take your medication.

277
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,120
Besides, make sure that

278
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,560
you don't sprain your wrist again.

279
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,880
Thank you.

280
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,240
No problem. It's nothing.

281
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,280
However, Xiaomeng,

282
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,760
judging from your description,

283
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,880
Aunt Ye's condition seems very strange.

284
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,560
She only has fragmented memories

285
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,560
but not any sign of cognitive issues.

286
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,160
Then why all of a sudden
she couldn't recognize you

287
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,320
and even attacked you?

288
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,520
As soon as she saw
the photo of Uncle Zhou,

289
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,480
she got all tensed up for some reason.

290
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,200
I'm really worried about her.

291
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,480
Is it possible that my mom really

292
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,640
-murdered Uncle Zhou--
-Xiaomeng.

293
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,400
Calm down.

294
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,600
Judging by Aunt Ye's current condition,

295
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,960
it proves that she hasn't recovered yet

296
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,200
and that part of memory
has seriously damaged her.

297
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,320
Think about it.

298
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,880
Did they have any serious argument,
fight or conflict?

299
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,640
No.

300
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,640
My mom was Uncle Zhou's personal doctor.

301
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,040
Uncle Zhou trusted my mom very much.

302
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,080
My mom and Uncle Zhou
got along really well.

303
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,760
For some reason,

304
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,880
it seems that my mom became
a completely different person last night.

305
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,320
She was not someone I know.

306
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,400
Xiaomeng, don't worry too much.

307
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,480
Although Aunt Ye hasn't recovered yet,

308
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,560
judging by her current condition,

309
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,960
it won't be long before she gets well.

310
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,560
When she's recovered,

311
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,440
I believe the truth will be out.

312
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,200
What have you done to my mom this time?

313
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,360
Go ask your mom what she had done.

314
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,520
I tell you.

315
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,560
If you hurt my mom again,
I won't let you off.

316
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,400
And I won't let the murderer of my father
off the hook!

317
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,720
Zhou Yanzhao, who makes you think
you can treat us like this?

318
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,200
To this day,
you still ask me that question?

319
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,560
You don't know anything, Zhou Yanzhao.

320
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,440
You have no right to judge us!

321
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,520
That's because you are not even...

322
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,360
What did you say?

323
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,360
Say it!

324
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,120
What did you say? I'm not what?

325
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,160
You'll understand one day.

326
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,720
You're wrong.

327
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,040
All this time,
you've been hopelessly wrong.

328
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,120
Let me out!

329
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,520
Mom!

330
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,680
-I beg you, please.
-Mom!

331
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,200
-Let me out!
-Mom!

332
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,800
Open the door!

333
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,040
-Mom!
-I'm scared!

334
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,320
Sister Hua, get the key! Sister Hua!

335
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,800
Mom!

336
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,200
-Mom!
-Xiaomeng, help me!

337
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,200
-Mom! Don't be afraid.
-Come help me!

338
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,080
In a minute...

339
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,680
I'll let you out
once I get the door opened.

340
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,080
Sister Hua! Sister Hua!

341
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,400
-Open the door!
-Coming.

342
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,320
Open the door now!

343
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,320
Help!

344
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,760
Mom!

345
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,360
Mom!

346
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,480
Mom!

347
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,040
Mom! Mom!

348
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,440
I'm Xiaomeng, Mom!

349
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,280
You're really Xiaomeng?

350
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,040
Xiaomeng!

351
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,880
Why didn't you come sooner?

352
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,080
Mom, don't be afraid.

353
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,520
It's fine now. Everything is over.

354
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,840
Mom, let's go.

355
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,080
I'll get you out of here.

356
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,920
Sister Hua,

357
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,880
what happened?

358
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,880
It's my fault.

359
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,440
I didn't keep an eye on Dr. Ye.

360
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,040
She cried and yelled
that she wanted to go home.

361
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,280
She ripped up the picture of Mr. Zhou too.

362
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,760
I hadn't got the time to clean it up
before A Yan got home.

363
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,160
I was anxious
so I just locked her in the room.

364
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,200
Sister Hua, thank you.

365
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,760
It's all sorted here.

366
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,160
You may go now. Leave her with me.

367
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,600
All right.

368
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,240
Mom, let's go.

369
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,480
Here, take a seat, Mom.

370
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,720
Mom, don't worry.

371
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,280
Don't worry. I'm here.

372
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,760
Xiaomeng.

373
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,520
It's Mommy's fault. It's all my fault.

374
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,760
I'm very sorry to you.

375
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,720
Mom.

376
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,240
You did nothing wrong.

377
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,120
You did nothing wrong.

378
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,400
It's not your fault.

379
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,000
Xiaomeng, why are you hurt?

380
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,480
Who bullied you?

381
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,800
Tell me.

382
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,640
Mom.

383
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,760
I'm fine.

384
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,520
Don't worry.

385
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,720
Does it hurt?

386
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,800
No.

387
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,400
Not at all.

388
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,040
Xiaomeng is a good girl. Mommy loves you.

389
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,560
Mommy loves you.

390
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,840
Xiaomeng, let's get out of here.

391
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,080
We'll go somewhere far away.

392
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,080
Mom!

393
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,280
What's wrong with you?

394
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,840
Where are we going?

395
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,560
Where are we going?

396
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,360
Where are we going?

397
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,040
Where are we going?

398
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,960
Mom, do you have anything
to do with Uncle Zhou's death?

399
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,440
Zhou Binli!

400
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,600
Xiaomeng!

401
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,120
Let's get out of this country.

402
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,920
We need to leave here now! Now!

403
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,200
Mom, do you really want to leave with me?

404
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,040
Yes, we'll go somewhere
where no one knows us.

405
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,440
No, Mom.

406
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,280
We can't leave just yet.

407
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,200
Just give me some time, all right?

408
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,000
Xiaomeng, I beg you, please leave with me!

409
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,080
We really have to leave! Now!

410
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,840
Xiaomeng, I beg you.

411
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,840
We have to leave now.

412
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,240
-I'm sorry, Mom.
-We have to leave now.

413
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,960
I'm sorry, Mom.

414
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,560
I'm sorry.

415
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,960
What more do you have to say?

416
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,360
I'm sorry.

417
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,240
As long as my mom
hasn't returned to normal,

418
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,640
this case will not come to an end.

419
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,000
You think she is the murderer,
but I disagree.

420
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,920
A Yan,

421
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,400
I just want to ask you this.

422
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,520
If one day, you realize that you are wrong

423
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,640
and everything is not
what you have imagined,

424
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,080
what would you do?

425
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,960
What do you think you would do

426
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,080
to make amends for what you did today?

427
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,320
A Yan, if one day,

428
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,200
we ended up in that situation,

429
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I just hope that

430
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,400
you could forgive yourself.

431
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,080
Watch it, it's a bit hot.

432
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,360
A Yan, they are going to

433
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,680
remove Tiankong's dressing today.

434
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,880
I want to go see him at the hospital.

435
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,120
Is that okay?

436
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,360
Ask Guang to take you there.

437
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,680
Mom, I need to go out
to do something today.

438
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,240
You stay home.

439
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,200
When I come back,
I'll take you for a walk.

440
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,080
All right?

441
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:30,920
Sister Hua!

442
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,640
Keep an eye on her.

443
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,560
Don't let her mess with anything.

444
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,680
I get it.

445
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,360
Sister Hua.

446
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,120
Sister Hua, I'll leave my mom with you.

447
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,840
Don't you worry. From now on,

448
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,720
I won't let her get out of my sight.

449
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,160
Mom, let's eat some more.

450
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,880
There you go.

451
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,640
Sister Xiaomeng.

452
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,160
You're Sister Xiaomeng.

453
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,040
Tiankong, you can see me.

454
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,200
Tiankong, what about me?

455
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,840
Mom Lin.

456
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,720
You can see me now.

457
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,560
Didn't I tell you to just call me "Mommy"?

458
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,160
I'm used to calling you Mom Lin.

459
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,520
You little devil.

460
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,400
Tiankong.

461
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,920
Do you know who I am?

462
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,440
Dr. Xiao,

463
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,680
Sister Qiao Zhen's incredible boyfriend.

464
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,760
Tiankong, what about me?

465
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,000
You are Ms. Qin.

466
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:49,200
Doctor, does that mean Tiankong
has recovered his eyesight?

467
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,400
Not so soon.

468
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,440
He needs to wear a pair
of special eyeglasses,

469
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,560
and come back regularly to do check-ups.

470
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,640
Then, it'll take some time
for him to recover.

471
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,960
But the surgery is a success.

472
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,040
He will get better.

473
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,480
Thank you so much.

474
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,360
Thank you, Doctor.

475
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,720
-Take care.
-That's great.

476
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,360
Tiankong, from now on,
you have to do as the doctor says.

477
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,080
When you've recovered your vision,

478
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,920
Sister Xiaomeng will take you
to the zoo, the park

479
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,200
or anywhere you like.

480
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,800
How does that sound?

481
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,880
Tiankong will never let
Sister Xiaomeng down.

482
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,920
Director Lin.

483
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,280
For some time,

484
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,000
I might not be able to come
as regularly as I wish.

485
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,600
You must be exhausted during this time.

486
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,520
It's all right.

487
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,040
I've asked Ms. Qin to come help me.

488
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,200
Don't you worry.

489
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,200
All right.

490
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,000
Is there something troubling you?

491
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,040
I'm going to look for a job.

492
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,480
So I will be busy.

493
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:47,960
This is important.

494
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,160
-Go do it.
-Yes.

495
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,960
We'll be here. Don't worry.

496
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,880
Don't you worry about it.

497
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,840
Tiankong.

498
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,960
-Tiankong.
-How are you feeling?

499
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,120
You're a good boy.

500
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,160
-Hello.
-When you've recovered,

501
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,480
Ms. Qin will take you to the zoo,

502
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,360
all right?

503
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,680
What?

504
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,080
My mom has gone missing?

505
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,760
Sister Hua!

506
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,040
Xiaomeng.

507
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,880
I'm really sorry.

508
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,160
Just now, Dr. Ye fell asleep on the sofa.

509
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,600
I went to the toilet.

510
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,480
She was gone when I got out.

511
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,360
Sister Hua.

512
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,680
Didn't I ask you to keep an eye on her?

513
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,920
Why does she suddenly disappear?

514
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,800
Did you go out and look for her?

515
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,000
I searched every room of the house

516
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,120
but couldn't find her.

517
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,400
I didn't dare go out to look for her
just in case she comes back.

518
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,520
What about A Yan?

519
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,760
Is A Yan at home?

520
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,920
No.

521
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,560
Do you think it could be A Yan
who took my mom out?

522
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,600
That's not possible.

523
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,000
He hasn't come back.

524
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,200
How about this, Sister Hua,
you stay home and wait.

525
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,600
Xiaomeng, we'll go find her.

526
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,480
All right.

527
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,000
-Let's go.
-Go now!

528
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,760
-Mom!
-Aunt Ye!

529
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,960
-Mom!
-Aunt Ye!

530
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,880
Mom!

531
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,040
Dr. Xiao, let's go over there.

532
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,040
Sure.

533
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,920
-Mom!
-Aunt Ye!

534
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,840
-Mom!
-Aunt Ye!

535
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,400
Aunt Pan,

536
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,800
have you seen my mom today?

537
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,080
Usually you bring her here.

538
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,480
I haven't seen her today.

539
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,200
Have you seen Dr. Ye?

540
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,720
No.

541
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,240
Xiaomeng, how about

542
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,040
you call the police first?
I'll check over there.

543
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,720
Hello.

544
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,040
Hello.

545
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,080
Thank you.

546
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,040
No news from the police.

547
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,560
What have you got over there?

548
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,960
They haven't seen her.

549
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,640
Let's continue to look for her.

550
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,640
That's the only way. Let's go.

551
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,200
Excuse me. I'm wondering
if you have seen this person.

552
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,280
She's around 40 years old.

553
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,720
About this height.

554
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,480
-No.
-No, I have not seen her.

555
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,360
No.

556
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,600
Have you ever seen this person?

557
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,640
Around 40 years old.

558
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,520
Around this height.

559
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,400
No, I haven't.

560
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,320
No.

561
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,320
Have you got any clue?

562
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,320
Last night,

563
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,280
I had a big argument with Zhou Yanzhao.

564
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,080
Is it possible that he got angry
and locked my mom somewhere?

565
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,160
Xiaomeng, just calm down.

566
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,400
Don't let your thoughts go wild.

567
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,880
Try to recall,

568
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,560
where else would Aunt Ye go?

569
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,800
No, I have to see Zhou Yanzhao.

570
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,320
You're wasting time searching blindly.

571
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,640
How about we go back to your house

572
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,800
and search for other clues?

573
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,240
All right, that's the only way.

574
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,520
Sister Hua! Has my mom got back?

575
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,080
No, you haven't found her?

576
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,960
You haven't found your mom?

577
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,760
Have you hidden my mom away?

578
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,840
I won't do such a thing.

579
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,760
She has gone missing.

580
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,200
I've been looking for her
the whole afternoon,

581
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,720
but to no avail.

582
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,560
Are you sure you haven't taken her away?

583
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,520
Xiaomeng.

584
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,760
It has nothing to do with A Yan.

585
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,480
Then, where has my mom gone?

586
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,480
Where else would she go?

587
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,720
It's all your fault! It's all your fault!

588
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,360
You have hidden my mom away, haven't you?

589
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,240
-Calm down!
-Give me back my mom!

590
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,640
How long has she gone missing?

591
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,560
She went missing this afternoon.

592
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,200
We searched the surrounding area
but we've got nothing.

593
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,840
Let's try one more time.

594
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,800
If you want to find your mom,

595
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,520
don't just stand there like a fool.

596
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,800
How is it?

597
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,120
Have you found my mom?

598
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,880
We are like trying
to find a needle in a haystack.

599
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,320
Xiaomeng, where does Ye Sirong usually go?

600
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,640
Is there anywhere else we haven't covered?

601
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,080
We've searched the area
where my mom goes for walks

602
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,280
and places she might go.

603
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,680
No one has seen her.

604
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,880
Ye Sirong has lost her memory,
not intelligence.

605
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,840
She wouldn't be wandering without purpose.

606
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,360
She has fragmented memories.

607
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,560
Probably, she thought of somewhere
and decided to go there.

608
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,800
Then what should we do?

609
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,600
We've searched everywhere we can think of.

610
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,840
Is it possible that my mom got kidnapped?

611
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,560
We... She...

612
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,880
Where else would she go?

613
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,040
Calm down! Listen to me.

614
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,520
Besides the places
she has been to recently,

615
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,840
where else is she familiar with?

616
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,840
Think carefully.

617
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,200
Where did she live in the past?

618
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,960
My mom used to live with my grandmother.

619
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,960
But the building had been demolished.

620
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,560
She doesn't know about that.

621
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,560
Is it possible that she thinks
her home is there?

622
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,120
Sister Hua said my mom kept telling her

623
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,800
she wants to go home.

624
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,720
The most unforgettable thing to a person
is where she'd lived before.

625
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,000
Although Aunt Ye
doesn't remember anything,

626
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,760
her home still appears
in her subconscious mind.

627
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,800
Let's go there now
and see if we can find her.

628
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,320
Hurry.

629
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,560
These are all new residential buildings.

630
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,160
I can't find where my old house is.

631
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,840
Anyway, let's have a look inside.

632
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,280
Guang, you wait here.

633
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,480
Call us if you have any news on Ye Sirong.

634
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,600
Sure, Brother Yan.

635
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,960
Mom! Mom!

636
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,080
Aunt Ye!

637
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,320
Aunt Ye!

638
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,240
Xiaomeng! Aunt Ye is here.

639
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,400
Mom!

640
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,840
What are you doing here?

641
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,680
I've been looking for you.

642
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,440
Go away! Don't touch me!
Don't come near me!

643
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,560
Are you all right?

644
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,760
I'm fine. Go see her.

645
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,080
Mom, have you forgotten me?

646
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,320
I'm Xiaomeng.

647
00:41:59,120 --> 00:41:59,920
What should I do?

648
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,560
She doesn't recognize me again.
