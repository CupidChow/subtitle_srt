00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,760
(Episode 25)

2
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,520
Mom, do you remember me?

3
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,640
I'm Xiaomeng.

4
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,280
What should I do?

5
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,000
She doesn't recognize me again.

6
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,040
Aunt Ye,

7
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,800
do you still remember me?

8
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,840
I'm A Yan.

9
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,480
A Yan?

10
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,520
A Yan, why are you here?

11
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,200
We'll talk about it when we get home.

12
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,000
Mom!

13
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,680
Aunt Ye.

14
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,520
She's Xiaomeng.

15
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,600
-No, she's not her.
-You don't recognize her?

16
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,600
No, Xiaomeng is just 10 years old.

17
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,560
She's not Xiaomeng. She's not.

18
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,400
Mom, take a good look at me.

19
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,920
I really am Xiaomeng!

20
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,720
You are my Xiaomeng?

21
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,760
Mom, let's go.

22
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,720
Let's go home first, all right?

23
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,640
Home?

24
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,440
Isn't this my home?

25
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,600
Mom, you've forgotten it again.

26
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,920
You've moved out a long time ago.

27
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,680
Then where do I live?

28
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,040
I'll tell you this later.

29
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,480
Let's go home first, all right?

30
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,760
A Yan.

31
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,720
Come home with us.

32
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,520
Let's go.

33
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,120
Let's go home.

34
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,160
A Yan.

35
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,360
You don't have to thank me.

36
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,960
I'm sorry. If it were not for you today,

37
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,120
I wouldn't have found my mom this quickly.

38
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,280
I can't even imagine
what could've happened to her.

39
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,280
I just can't let her get out of my sight.

40
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,200
For some reason,

41
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,840
my mom couldn't even recognize me today,

42
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,600
but she remembers you.

43
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,880
Probably she's got a guilty conscience.

44
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,600
So it made a deep impression on her.

45
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,080
No matter what,

46
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,640
I believe that

47
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,840
my mom is not a murderer.

48
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,480
Whether or not she is a murderer,

49
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,960
Xiaomeng,

50
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,360
we can't go back to what we used to be.

51
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,400
I know...

52
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,080
that all your patience and belief

53
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,040
comes from the hope
you have in your heart.

54
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,040
And if she's not the murderer,

55
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,440
I won't be able to forgive myself
for what I did to you.

56
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,720
Therefore, you should never
open the door of your heart...

57
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,680
to me again.

58
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,160
A Yan...

59
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,160
It's fine now.

60
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,040
Mom.

61
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,160
Go away, don't touch me.

62
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,560
Take a rest.

63
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,880
Mom, go to bed.

64
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,160
Keep a close eye on her.

65
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,440
You might not be this lucky next time.

66
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,120
Xiaomeng,

67
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,440
we can't go back to what we used to be.

68
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,320
If she's the murderer,

69
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,920
I won't be able to forgive you
my whole life.

70
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,080
If she's not the murderer,

71
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,080
I won't be able to forgive myself
for what I did to you.

72
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,320
Therefore, you should never
open the door of your heart...

73
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,040
to me again.

74
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,600
Here, have some porridge.

75
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,920
Xiaomeng,

76
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,240
you dressed up so beautifully today.

77
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,280
Mom, if you like my outfit,

78
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,040
I'll wear it every day for you.

79
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,920
How does that sound?

80
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,600
Mom, you have to stay home today.

81
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,960
Don't wander off like you did yesterday.

82
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,800
Otherwise, I'll be worried sick.

83
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,640
I got it.

84
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,240
I won't go out again.

85
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,200
I'll stay home
and wait for you to come back.

86
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,840
Xiaomeng,

87
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,000
you look so pretty today.

88
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,280
You haven't dressed yourself like this
for a long while.

89
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,400
I have a job interview today.

90
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,480
You're looking for a job?

91
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,840
I can't just stay home
and do nothing forever.

92
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,920
I have to get a job at some point.

93
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,480
Don't you worry.

94
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,040
From now on,
I'll stay by Dr. Ye's side every moment.

95
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,440
Accidents like yesterday
won't happen again.

96
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,600
Don't worry. Go for it.

97
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,080
Mom, you stay here.

98
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm going now.

99
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,240
I'll come back to you later today.

100
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,240
Sister Hua, I'll leave her with you then.

101
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,160
Sure.

102
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,480
I'm going now.

103
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,160
A Yan?

104
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,960
A Yan, come and have breakfast.

105
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,240
A Yan, come and have breakfast.

106
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,640
Breakfast is very important.

107
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,440
It's good for your body.

108
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,320
Come, come on.

109
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,000
Come here, come on.

110
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,640
You must not skip breakfast.

111
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,000
Come here.

112
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,240
Sit down. Here.

113
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,400
Here, I'll get you some porridge.

114
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,720
Here.

115
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,680
I'll do it.

116
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,840
There you have it.

117
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,760
See, these are all your favorite dishes.

118
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,800
Fried dough fritters, Chinese pickles.

119
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,000
Plenty of choices.

120
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,000
What's wrong?

121
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,960
Why are you not eating?

122
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,000
Have a taste of the porridge.

123
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,560
It's nice.

124
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,320
Guang, how does Ye Sirong behave

125
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,520
when I'm not at home?

126
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,480
Her condition fluctuates.

127
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,720
Sometimes, she's confused
and speaks incoherently.

128
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,520
Sometimes, she looks completely normal

129
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,880
and speaks articulately.

130
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,520
The way she talked to me this morning

131
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,520
made me almost believe
that she's completely normal.

132
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,200
She's particularly caring to me.

133
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,680
I don't want to accept
that she killed my father.

134
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,520
Brother Yan.

135
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,160
We still don't know what the truth is.

136
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,800
It's simply a speculation.

137
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,440
She is so kind to me,

138
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,480
probably because she feels guilty.

139
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,000
Or she genuinely cares about you.

140
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,640
Maybe.

141
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,880
We've finalized the architectural design.

142
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,720
We will build a brand new
modern and wide-ranging sports complex

143
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,880
using sports and health as the theme.

144
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,680
At the moment,
this project is in the construction phase.

145
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,080
No planning for that area yet?

146
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,640
That area

147
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,200
is the modern sports area.

148
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,600
which spreads over 156,000 square meters.

149
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,520
There will be five to ten
different sport centers.

150
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,360
Have you come up with the design?

151
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,440
Yes.

152
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,120
I personally chose the theme.

153
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,280
Every sport center
has a different architectural style.

154
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,200
I've also added elements of fairy tales

155
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,040
so that the sport centers
won't look all the same.

156
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,400
Don't worry.

157
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,080
I guarantee
the originality of the designs.

158
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,480
Besides,

159
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,480
we're discussing the design layout
with the design company.

160
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,160
It'll be handed to all of you
in a couple of days.

161
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,640
Hello, sorry to keep you waiting.

162
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,640
I'm Lisa, Project Manager.

163
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,760
Hi, I'm Zhou Xiaomeng.

164
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,960
This is my resume.

165
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,240
Do I have to do a short self-introduction?

166
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,240
There's no need.

167
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,600
You are a notable celebrity in the city.

168
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,560
Your background is written on here.

169
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,560
There's no need to introduce yourself.

170
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,440
Basically,

171
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,000
I started hosting children's TV shows

172
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,400
since I was a freshman.

173
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,120
Everyone knows that I'm a host.

174
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,400
But actually, I also participated

175
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,960
in program planning and production.

176
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,680
I was told
they will recommend a fresh graduate,

177
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,440
but they didn't tell me that it'd be you.

178
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,480
To be honest, I'm surprised to see you.

179
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,520
Are you familiar with our company?

180
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,520
I've read about the background.

181
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,000
Our company specializes
in various outsourced TV shows.

182
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,240
We're looking for a host
that meets our requirements.

183
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,640
I'm sorry.

184
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,080
But I don't think
I'm suited to be a host anymore.

185
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,200
Compared to hosting a show,

186
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,560
I prefer to work behind the scenes.

187
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,120
But to be honest,
apart from hosting shows,

188
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,320
I don't know what I can do.

189
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,480
Xiaomeng, I understand how you feel.

190
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,480
But with your current state,

191
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,320
whether it be on screen or off stage,

192
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,240
you're not suited to work in TV.

193
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,640
We work a lot with
TV broadcasting companies.

194
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,600
Besides, our company image...

195
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,880
Do you understand what I mean?

196
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,120
Yes.

197
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,160
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

198
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,160
Thank you for meeting with me.

199
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,320
Hope you will keep it up from now on.

200
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,760
I will. Thank you for your encouragement.

201
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,800
See you.

202
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,840
See you.

203
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,960
-I'd better get going.
-All right.

204
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,560
-See you.
-See you.

205
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,640
A Yan, I can tell

206
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,560
you are very confident about this project.

207
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,000
But blind confidence among young people

208
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,720
is not a good thing.

209
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,640
You may go now.

210
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,120
Uncle Jiang,

211
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,600
I've always been

212
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,760
confident about everything I do.

213
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,320
You're very much like your father.

214
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,240
Always going all out
and leaving no stone unturned.

215
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,760
This was how your father
kept the business running.

216
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,840
But things are different now.

217
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,880
Everything is about rules and regulations.

218
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,240
I won't let my father feel ashamed.

219
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,720
And of course,

220
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,080
I still need the support and help
from my uncles.

221
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,920
Oh right, I heard that

222
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,080
Dr. Ye is recovering well.

223
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,080
Looks like you care about this very much.

224
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,360
This is fate.

225
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,680
She's getting better during this time.

226
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,120
Isn't that convenient?

227
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,920
Yes, it is.

228
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
"The merciful can't lead an army,
the kind can't hold wealth."

229
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,600
Shenghai Group has many employees
and high assets.

230
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,600
Uncle Jiang, you're kind and merciful.

231
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,000
The fact that you lead
Shenghai Group this far

232
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,440
is really something.

233
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,320
I'm too flattered

234
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,680
by your "kind and merciful" compliment.

235
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,200
I'm only a bit too sympathetic.

236
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,880
I did all this for Xiaomeng.

237
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,440
She is the stockholder of Shenghai.

238
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,400
I hope her mom will get well soon,

239
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,320
so Xiaomeng can lay her burden down

240
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,920
and be happy for the rest of her life.

241
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,080
Oh, right,

242
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,320
a friend of mine from America

243
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,000
is an expert in cranial nerve disorders.

244
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,440
I can introduce you to him.

245
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,760
There's no need.

246
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,840
You know,

247
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,760
the health care quality
of Shenghai Hospital

248
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,480
is no worse than other hospitals.

249
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,640
Aunt Ye is recovering steadily.

250
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,160
I believe it won't long before

251
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,320
she can recall what she should remember

252
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,840
and what she shouldn't.

253
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,560
That puts my mind at ease.

254
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,200
I'd better get going. Please excuse me.

255
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,680
Hello, Miss. Are you here to consult
about early education?

256
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,400
Oh right, how old is your kid?

257
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,720
A boy or a girl?

258
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,720
No...

259
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,240
I just saw the hiring notice
outside your center.

260
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,600
I'm here to apply for the job.

261
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,200
Apply for the job?

262
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,560
I knew it. I thought you were too young

263
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,880
to have a kid.

264
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,120
Applying for the job... Come, take a seat.

265
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,240
All right.

266
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,800
If you're here to apply for the job...

267
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,680
Oh, right,

268
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,240
do you have any experience
in this industry?

269
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,440
Do you have any education qualifications?

270
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,760
Early education training experience?

271
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,960
Sales performance certificates?

272
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,720
No.

273
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,360
I don't have any of those.

274
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,800
But I studied broadcasting before

275
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,280
and I always worked with children.

276
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,000
Do you think this experience
matches with the requirements?

277
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,400
That is indeed some useful experience.

278
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,520
But--

279
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,960
I'm a quick learner.

280
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,000
I think I can get the hang of it
very quickly.

281
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,400
All right.

282
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,320
Our manager is out for training.

283
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,480
He'll be back this afternoon.

284
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,280
Why don't you hand out these flyers
on the street

285
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,720
and promote our courses as well.

286
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,280
See if you can bring
potential clients here for consultation.

287
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,200
It'll be even better if you can
get them to apply for our courses.

288
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,200
When our manager comes back,

289
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,520
I'll put in a good word for you.

290
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,400
That's about it.

291
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,360
Hand out flyers... Where should I go?

292
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,880
Just go to that mall.

293
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,000
A lot of people bring their kids
to that mall this time of day.

294
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,960
Have a try over there. I guess it'll work.

295
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,200
All right, I'll have a try.

296
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,400
Good luck!

297
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,640
Hello, do you need one?

298
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,720
No...

299
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,560
Hi, do you need one?

300
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,480
No...

301
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,200
-No.
-Hi. Do you need one?

302
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,960
-Hello, do you need one?
-No...

303
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,960
Have a look at this.

304
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,400
-No.
-Hello,

305
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,000
do you need early education services?

306
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,680
Hi, early education services--

307
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,600
No.

308
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,800
-Do you need this?
-Sure.

309
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,840
-Hi, early education services.
-No.

310
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,720
Have a look at this. There you go.

311
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,080
Hi, early education services.

312
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,200
-No...
-Hello,

313
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,560
have a look at this. Do you need this?

314
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,720
No.

315
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,840
Do you...

316
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,320
Miss, I want one.

317
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,560
Give me one.

318
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,040
Miss, give me one flyer please.

319
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,080
Thanks.

320
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,200
Miss, give me one flyer please.

321
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,480
-Sure.
-Thank you, Miss.

322
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,360
Thanks.

323
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,960
Do you want one?

324
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,120
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

325
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,800
Thank you.

326
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,200
Here you are.

327
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,560
Hold tight.

328
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,880
There you go.

329
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,480
Here.

330
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,600
Thanks.

331
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,680
Here.

332
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,480
-There you go. Hold tight.
-Thank you.

333
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,440
Hello,

334
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,400
may I ask, is he your son?

335
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,600
Yes, he is.

336
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,840
I'm wondering if you'd be interested

337
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,880
in finding early education services?

338
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,960
I've heard good things

339
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,800
about this center.

340
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,760
I'm actually looking for
a reliable center for him

341
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,920
to have early education courses.

342
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,840
Really?

343
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,480
Would you have time today

344
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,800
to drop by our center
for more information?

345
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,480
Sure.

346
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,720
Miss,

347
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,840
you look familiar.

348
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,280
I think I've seen you somewhere before.

349
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,480
Baby, look.

350
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,600
Do you know this lady?

351
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,240
Sister Xiaomeng.

352
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,320
You're sister Xiaomeng
who tells a lot of stories in the TV.

353
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,000
You are Zhou Xiaomeng?

354
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,840
No wonder you look so familiar.

355
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,720
Baby, let's go.

356
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,240
No, hold on.

357
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,160
Didn't you say
you wanted to consult at our center?

358
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,840
I don't think that's necessary.

359
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,640
They have hired someone like you.

360
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,040
I'll be worried if I send my son
to this kind of education center.

361
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,360
Madam!

362
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,920
Why don't you come have a look
at our center first? I--

363
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,920
Xiaomeng?

364
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,280
Xiaomeng, it's been a while.

365
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,560
I missed you so much.

366
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,400
Why didn't you keep in touch with us?

367
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,160
A Qi, come over here.

368
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,320
Xiaomeng, why are you here?

369
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,160
Xiaomeng, you've slimmed down so much.

370
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,960
Why are you guys here?

371
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,880
We came here to pick out
sponsored clothing.

372
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,600
I was recommended
to other shows as a guest.

373
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,160
Really? That's great.

374
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,080
Zitong, good job!

375
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,880
Xiaomeng,

376
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,760
what are you doing here?

377
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,120
I...

378
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,160
Xiaomeng,

379
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,400
don't tell me you're giving out flyers

380
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,000
as a job?

381
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,720
Yes, this is my job.

382
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,160
What are you talking about?

383
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,320
Xiaomeng, you're handing out flyers?

384
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,040
Xiaomeng, you are a star TV host.

385
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,040
And now you're even
a shareholder of Shenghai Group.

386
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,560
Xiaomeng, if people see you doing this,

387
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,480
they will think you're staging a scene.

388
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,720
If you have any difficulty,
just let me know.

389
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,360
I will definitely help you.

390
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm not staging a scene, A Qi.

391
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,240
You know the situation with my family,

392
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,760
I lost my job

393
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,240
so I have to earn money to make ends meet.

394
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,280
Xiaomeng, just let us know
if you have difficulties.

395
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,760
We will help you, right, A Qi?

396
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,800
How about this?
I have a lot of projects going on,

397
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,320
do you want me to introduce you to them?

398
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,960
Don't you worry,

399
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,360
they won't refuse you
out of respect for me.

400
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,080
Zitong, thank you.

401
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,240
But there's no need.

402
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,240
I'm content with what I'm doing right now.

403
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,200
I still have to hand out these flyers.

404
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,880
I'll let you get on with your work.
See you.

405
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,240
Xiaomeng!

406
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,920
Xiaomeng is like that.

407
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,320
She's stubborn. Let's go.

408
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,720
We still have lots to do.

409
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,160
Let's go.

410
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,240
You...

411
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,040
handed out all of them?

412
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,760
You didn't throw them away, did you?

413
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,840
No.

414
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,640
I did hand out all of them.

415
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,640
But I couldn't get any clients in.

416
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,800
I'm sorry.

417
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,160
You've never done
anything like this before, right?

418
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,200
I'm fresh out of college

419
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,760
so I don't have much work experience.

420
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,880
Generally speaking,
if all flyers are handed out,

421
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,480
there should be clients
dropping by for consultation.

422
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,440
I'm sorry.

423
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,920
You don't have to apologize.

424
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,280
I don't mean to blame you.

425
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,600
It's just that...

426
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,920
You really didn't manage
to persuade any parent?

427
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,160
I guess I'm not suitable for this job.

428
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,280
Considering you're a fresh graduate

429
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,480
and doesn't have much work experience,

430
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,760
it's understandable.

431
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,280
And probably you're not familiar
with what we do.

432
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,480
How about you go home

433
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,040
and get to know
more about our center first?

434
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,080
I'll schedule an appointment for you
with our manager tomorrow.

435
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,240
Then, you both can sit down
and talk about it.

436
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,160
There's no need. I'm sorry.

437
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,240
I think I'm really not suitable
for this job.

438
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,120
Thank you so much.

Jiang Ze?

470
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,640
Why are you here?

471
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,600
I just happened to pass by.
What about you?

472
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,680
So was I.

473
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,400
What a coincidence. Let's walk together.

474
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,960
Do you remember
when we were in Sports School,

475
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,640
I always waited for you
outside the school gate?

476
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,920
Though I always managed to upset you

477
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,360
and we ended up parting on bad terms.

478
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,920
Of course I remember.

479
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,800
But...

480
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,080
that's a long time ago.

481
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,440
You're looking for a job?

482
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,200
Even you, as a shareholder of Shenghai,

483
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,400
need to get a job
by walking in off the street?

484
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,840
What do you mean?

485
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,160
Are you being sarcastic?

486
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,160
Of course not.

487
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,120
You know I admire
your determination and perseverance.

488
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,840
But you majored
in broadcasting and hosting.

489
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,480
It seems not appropriate

490
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,120
to just walk in off the street.

491
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,640
It's not about if it's appropriate or not.

492
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,040
You know the situation I'm in right now.

493
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,440
How about this,

494
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,160
let's find a place to sit
and talk about it?

495
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,080
I know--

496
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,160
If you're going to refuse me,
then there's no need to say anything.

497
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,320
I'm not in a good mood today.

498
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,760
Judging by your state of mind,

499
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,160
I guess you also need to relax.

500
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,600
We can console each other.

501
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,920
I was trying to say

502
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,240
there's a really nice dessert place
over there.

503
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,240
Let's go there.

504
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,520
Sure. Let's go.

505
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,040
Why did you order so much?

506
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,840
It would go to waste
if we couldn't finish them.

507
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,080
I don't know which flavor you like,

508
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,720
so I ordered one each.

509
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,920
Let's dig in.

510
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,680
You should have asked me first.

511
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,280
I like to find out myself.

512
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,800
If we couldn't finish them,
I could wrap up the leftovers

513
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,960
and save them for dinner.

514
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,000
Would that be okay?

515
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,320
I got you your favorite lemon pie.

516
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,520
A Yan, how do you know I like this?

517
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,000
I'm your A Yan.

518
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,800
Of course I know you like this.

519
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,360
Let's eat.

520
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,360
It's good.

521
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,920
You have some too.

522
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,400
Xiaomeng.

523
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,880
Xiaomeng.

524
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,080
I didn't know you like lemon pie.

525
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,480
Next time I know what to order.

526
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,840
Your favorite is lemon pie.

527
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,640
Do you know...

528
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,040
why I like it?

529
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,280
Why?

530
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,720
Because it tastes sweet

531
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,840
with a hint of tartness,

532
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,840
not overly sweet, not too light.

533
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,440
It's just about right.

534
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,240
That's how I want my life to be.

535
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,800
I don't mind a bit of
sweetness and tartness

536
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
from time to time.

537
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,320
As long as they exist together,

538
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,440
it'll be perfect.

539
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,920
That's impressive.

540
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,800
You came up with a life philosophy
when eating a slice of pie.

541
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,360
Isn't that too artistic?

542
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,560
People like to find a reason
for liking certain things.

543
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,840
I can't say that I like this

544
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,920
because I don't want
to put on weight, right?

545
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,080
Oh, right.

546
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,960
You've been looking for a job?

547
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,880
I need to get one anyway.

548
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,480
After quitting being a host,

549
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,920
I can't just sit and do nothing, right?

550
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,080
Then how is your job hunting going?

551
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,800
I realize

552
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,600
I don't know anything

553
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,680
apart from being a host.

554
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,600
I'm just useless.

555
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,040
Xiaomeng, don't say that.

556
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,400
You just haven't found the right job.

557
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,760
When Uncle Zhou passed away,

558
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,480
didn't he leave you and your mother

559
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,480
some of the shares of Shenghai?

560
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,120
You can use that money
to start a business.

561
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,760
I don't want to use Uncle Zhou's money.

562
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,760
And the shares are still frozen.

563
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,360
I see.

564
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,200
If you need a job,
I can recommend you to someone.

565
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:02,960
There's no need.

566
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,600
I can figure this out.

567
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,480
I don't want help from any of you.

568
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,480
Look, you're as stubborn

569
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,120
as Zhou Yanzhao.

570
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,840
Then I can only wish you all the best.

571
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,040
What's wrong with A Yan?

572
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,000
Is he in trouble?

573
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,680
The proposal for Dikai Commercial City.

574
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,920
Your father's in charge of this project.

575
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,000
Is there anything wrong?

576
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,200
I'm moving to his team to help him.

577
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,640
So you're giving up on the projects
you're working on?

578
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,080
We have the same goal,

579
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,440
that is to work for Shenghai.

580
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,760
This project has high business value

581
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,360
and it's almost finished.

582
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,320
All that's left is asking for investments
and promotion.

583
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,840
I believe

584
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,720
if you and your father join hands,

585
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,080
that will go down well.

586
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,440
Of course.

587
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,720
So A Yan, you agree
that I move to Dikai project's team?

588
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,720
I have no reason to refuse.

589
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,320
The Yunnan Resort project
is going smooth as well.

590
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,920
Given your ability,

591
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,440
I believe you can do well on both sides.

592
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,040
No problem. Don't worry.

593
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,240
Besides, if you do well
in your father's team,

594
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,240
I can learn from you as well.

595
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,360
Jiang Ze,

596
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,000
I wish you all the success.

597
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,400
Thank you, A Yan.

598
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,560
But I have one more thing to say.

599
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,480
Please.

600
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,800
From now on, if I ask Xiaomeng out,

601
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,160
please don't meddle with it.

602
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,080
Nothing.

603
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,080
It's just company business.

604
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,160
Just as I see you,

605
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,600
it instantly puts me in a better mood.

606
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,920
Xiaomeng, thank you.

607
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,880
You're like a sunbeam

608
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,240
that shines through the shadow
covering my eyes.

609
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,120
See? You called me artistic.

610
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,600
You sound like a crappy poet.

611
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,360
Crappy? Why crappy?

612
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,280
If not crappy, how about trashy?

613
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,040
Why are you doing this hand gesture?

614
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,720
It's silly.

615
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,640
(Meeting)

616
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,920
What has Xiaomeng been doing
these two days?

617
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,680
She's looking for a job.

618
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,080
She never mentioned it to me.

619
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,600
Yan, are we going home?

620
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,080
Let's go to the hospital.

621
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,480
Sure.

622
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,840
Xiaomeng, get in.

623
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,400
I'll put the takeaway bag in the trunk.

624
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,000
Xiaomeng, why are you not getting in?

625
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,680
I'm sorry, Xiaomeng.

626
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,520
I didn't want you to know about this.

627
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,440
Jiang Ze...

628
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,960
thank you.

629
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,080

Mommy Lin,

640
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,920
will you be my mom forever?

641
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,880
Of course.

642
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,520
Not only you, all the kids in the center

643
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,920
are my children.

644
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,920
Do you have your own children?

645
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,480
Yes.

646
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,800
Mother Lin lost him...

647
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,320
accidentally.

648
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,880
Mother Lin, if you don't find him

649
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,240
and he can't find his mother,

650
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,080
he must be very anxious.

651
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,920
Mother Lin, how did you lose him?

652
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:38,920
I...

653
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,000
Aunt Lin.

654
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,440
A Yan, you're here.

655
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,560
I bought a present for Tiankong.

656
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,400
Tiankong...

657
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,880
This is Uncle Zhou. Say hi to Uncle Zhou.

658
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,960
Hi, Uncle Zhou.

659
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,720
Thank you, Uncle Zhou.

660
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,080
Tiankong,

661
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,280
"uncle" might be a bit confusing.

662
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,640
Like sister Xiaomeng,

663
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,720
you may call me brother A Yan.

664
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,360
Brother A Yan.

665
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,600
There you go.

666
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,480
He can't wait to take it.

667
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,320
Look what it is.

668
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,120
Thank you, brother A Yan.
I really like it.

669
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,160
How do you know that I like this?

670
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,040
Because I liked it when I was little.

671
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,440
So I thought all boys would like it.

672
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,960
Mother Lin, can I go to that open space

673
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,120
and play a little bit?

674
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,520
Of course you can. Have fun.

675
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,520
Mother Lin, but you haven't

676
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,680
told me how you lost your kid.

677
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,640
I...

678
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,040
I was just joking.

679
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,240
Go play over there.

680
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,600
This kid likes drawing

681
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,560
so he's very imaginative.

682
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,760
His head is just full of strange thoughts.

683
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,960
Let's take a seat.

684
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,200
Here.

685
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,480
Aunt Lin,

686
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,040
have you seen Xiaomeng lately?

687
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,920
Not a lot.

688
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,840
I think she said she's looking a job.

689
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,880
What's wrong?
Is everything okay with you guys?

690
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,360
Nothing, I'm just worried about her.

691
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,080
She doesn't tell me a lot of things.

692
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,160
You actually really care about Xiaomeng.

693
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,280
It's just that when you two meet,

694
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,440
you can't deal with the feelings

695
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,680
you have for each other, right?

696
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,840
Yes, that's right.

697
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,600
A Yan, in your heart,

698
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,880
do you hate Xiaomeng a little bit?
