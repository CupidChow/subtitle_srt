1
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,760
(Episode 28)

2
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,080
It's the first time you're late.

3
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,800
What's wrong? Feeling unwell?

4
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,280
No. I didn't sleep well last night.

5
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,600
Is it a breakup?

6
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,960
I've never dated anyone.

7
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,040
How could there be a breakup?

8
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,520
Qingyan, go talk to

9
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,320
the supervisor at Luofeng Sports Complex
for an update.

10
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,000
Hurry and get me a timetable.

11
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,480
Okay, I'll do that.

12
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,800
Come to my office.

13
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,280
Thanks.

14
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,600
What's wrong? You didn't sleep well?

15
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,600
I couldn't sleep.

16
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You've been thinking too much.

17
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,680
That's why you're losing sleep.

18
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,120
You should clear your mind.

19
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,280
Lie down and think of nothing.

20
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,640
That's how you fall asleep.

21
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,960
What about you?

22
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,760
You've never lost sleep?

23
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,920
I have.

24
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,320
But I know how to regulate myself.

25
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,120
Did you ask me here

26
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,800
just to show your concern
for your employee?

27
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,840
I hope what I said yesterday
won't affect your feelings.

28
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,040
I...

29
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,480
don't think so.

30
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,920
Will it affect your work
or our relationship, then?

31
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,000
No.

32
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,200
I keep my personal feelings
separate from my work.

33
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,040
Good.

34
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,360
I hope

35
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,600
this won't affect
our working relationship.

36
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,360
You're someone I can trust.

37
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,080
Mr. Zhou. You know how I work.

38
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,880
I don't bring my personal feelings
into my work.

39
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,280
So don't worry.

40
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,640
Thank you.

41
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,560
You're welcome.

42
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,640
Chocolate?

43
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,440
I thought it was coffee.

44
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,800
Chocolate has phenethylamine.

45
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,960
It calms you down
and makes you feel better.

46
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,880
How do you know I'm upset?

47
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,200
Well...

48
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,440
I thought
you women like things like chocolate?

49
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,240
Like...

50
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,600
sweets, cakes, or candy?

51
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,320
You usually don't talk much at work.

52
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,680
But you're quite thoughtful.

53
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,240
Thanks for the chocolate.

54
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,000
That was good.

55
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,240
A Yan, you're back.

56
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,680
A Yan, you're back.

57
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,520
You're home early today.

58
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,080
A Yan.

59
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,920
How is she today?

60
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,880
The same as always.

61
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,640
Sometimes she would call
your name or Xiaomeng's name

62
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,960
and talk to herself,

63
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,200
just like when she hit Xiaomeng.

64
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,720
She wouldn't remember anything after.

65
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,280
She's always absentminded.

66
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,560
Okay.

67
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,480
A Yan, you've lost weight.

68
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,520
Have you been staying up

69
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,960
studying for your exams?

70
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,840
Sister Hua.

71
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,240
Let me look at you.

72
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,840
I have exams soon.

73
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,640
You're so hardworking.

74
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,480
You lost weight
because you're studying so hard.

75
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,680
Wait, come with me.

76
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,560
I have something for you.

77
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,640
What is it?

78
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,760
Come. Just come with me.

79
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,200
Come with me to the room. Come.

80
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,920
Let's go.

81
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,720
I'm not lying.

82
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,320
It's true. Come.

83
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,400
You won't guess what it is.

84
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,040
Come, come in.

85
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,440
Wait a minute.

86
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,560
Let me see.

87
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,080
What?

88
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,440
Why can't I find it?

89
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,800
What are you looking for?

90
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,680
I'm looking for it.

91
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,720
A Yan, help me.

92
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,200
Help me look for it.

93
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,400
Why... Why can't I find it?

94
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,480
It's not here.

95
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,640
But I put it right here.

96
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,400
Why isn't it here? Where is it?

97
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,520
I put it right here.

98
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,640
What?

99
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,160
Why isn't it here?

100
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,320
When did you meet my father?

101
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,120
That's me.

102
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,000
How old were you?

103
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,880
How old?

104
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,400
I don't remember.

105
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,440
It looks like I was in my 20s.

106
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,280
I think that's it.

107
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,680
You knew each other
when you were that young?

108
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,880
Look.

109
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,640
Wasn't I pretty then?

110
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,920
You know,

111
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,480
at that time, people always looked at me
on the street.

112
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,920
Everyone was looking at me.

113
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,080
My photograph
was on display in the photo studio.

114
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,360
But this isn't what I was looking for.

115
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,040
This is not it.

116
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,440
What have you hidden away?

117
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,760
Tell me.

118
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,520
I'll tell you.

119
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,280
I hid away a key.

120
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,280
It's a very important key.

121
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,440
It's very important. It's a secret.

122
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,880
Don't worry.

123
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,960
Just sit down and think carefully.

124
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,240
What kind of key is it?

125
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,880
Where did you put it?

126
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,040
Did you leave it at home or outside?

127
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,840
Where did I put it?

128
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,600
At home?

129
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,480
I don't remember. I...

130
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,520
I mustn't tell. I mustn't tell them.

131
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,360
Tell who?

132
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,680
Don't tell Xiaomeng.

133
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,160
Remember.

134
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,600
Don't ever tell Xiaomeng.

135
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,040
Did you hide it at home?

136
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,720
In the study? The bedroom? The safe?

137
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,920
The study?

138
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,840
Wait, wait. Let me think...

139
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,080
It's...

140
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,520
I know.

141
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,960
Where is it?

142
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,040
It's in the dirt.

143
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Dirt?

144
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,600
You buried it in the garden?

145
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,000
The garden?

146
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,080
A flowerpot.

147
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,280
It's under some flowers.

148
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,840
I hid it away in the dirt of a flowerpot.

149
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,680
A flowerpot?

150
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,240
The dirt of a flowerpot?

151
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,600
Dirt.

152
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,480
No, it's not there!

153
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,800
It's not there. It's not there.

154
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,640
I was wrong. It's not there.

155
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,080
Where is it?

156
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,680
A Yan.

157
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,880
Are you looking for something?

158
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,880
Your mother lost something.

159
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,040
I was helping her look for it.

160
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,720
I should go now.

161
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,000
You look awful.

162
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,640
Are you okay?

163
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,960
There's a lot going on at work.

164
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,600
It's no big deal.

165
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,560
By the way,
I've given Tiankong his present.

166
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,640
He was really happy.

167
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,640
Great.

168
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,280
Did your mother...

169
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,080
Did Aunt Ye hit you again?

170
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,520
No. I'm better today.

171
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,440
Take care.

172
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,080
Get Guang and Sister Hua
to stay with you always.

173
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,760
Where could it be?

174
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,560
Xiaomeng.

175
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,920
Look at this mess.

176
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,480
I'll tidy it up.

177
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,600
Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty.

178
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,840
Wendy said, "He likes my stories.

179
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,000
Because in those stories,
good always triumphs over evil."

180
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,280
Hook said angrily,

181
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,120
"Fine. Then tell me. Why does he fly?"

182
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,680
Peter Pan said, "I won't grow up...

183
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,920
because I don't feel love."

184
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,080
A Yan.

185
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,080
Wait.

186
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,760
I remember now.

187
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,480
Xiaomeng's not home.

188
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,520
Let me tell you, then.

189
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,040
What did you remember this time?

190
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,160
Well...

191
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,160
The key...

192
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,000
It's a very important key.

193
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,280
I put it in...

194
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,080
the bonsai.

195
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,920
Which bonsai?

196
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,720
Which bonsai?

197
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,400
-Which bonsai?
-Is it the bonsai in my father's study?

198
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,080
Yes, yes.

199
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,000
That's the one.

200
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,200
Were you referring to this key?

201
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,720
I found it under the pot.

202
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,280
That's it.

203
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,360
No one knows about it.

204
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,160
Your father told me about it.

205
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,040
It's very important.

206
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,320
My father?

207
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,320
You remember him?

208
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,280
What does this key
have to do with my father?

209
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,960
Does it have something
to do with his death?

210
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,280
No. You're hurting me.

211
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,720
Let go. You're hurting me.

212
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,080
Aunt Ye.

213
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,720
What key is this?

214
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,000
It's a secret.

215
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,320
The secret of the Zhou family.

216
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,920
Keep it well.

217
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,640
Don't tell Xiaomeng.

218
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,520
What secret?

219
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,000
What secret?

220
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,080
What secret?

221
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,920
Come in.

222
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,120
A Yan, you wanted me?

223
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,920
Guang.

224
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,120
Look into this key.

225
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,400
Find out where it's from.

226
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,720
Remember.

227
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,960
No one must know about this.

228
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,200
Don't worry, A Yan.

229
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,280
Go on.

230
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,760
What is the secret of the Zhou family?

231
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,760
Tell us the story of Peter.

232
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,480
Wait, wait.

233
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,240
You're a pirate.

234
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,320
To kids,
you're supposed to be evil incarnate.

235
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,200
You're too gentle.

236
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,040
-Okay.
-Go big. Bigger gestures.

237
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,960
Okay, okay.

238
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,360
You guys too.

239
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,720
You guys are not excited enough.

240
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,760
Get into your characters.

241
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,680
Be more excited.

242
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,800
More excited.

243
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,320
-Okay.
-Okay, got it.

244
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,960
Guang.

245
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,920
A Yan, I found it.

246
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,800
It's the key to a safe in a bank.

247
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,120
Okay.

248
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,000
Mr. Zhou.

249
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,600
I need to leave for a while.

250
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,960
Let's talk when I get back.

251
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,800
The results...

252
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,200
are unable to rule out
a father-son relationship

253
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,280
from the samples received
for the paternity test.

254
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,360
Genes from the father sample
can be found in the child sample.

255
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,120
The analysis
of 15 different genetic loci shows that

256
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,960
the probability of biological kinship

257
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,720
between the two samples
is 99.9999 percent.

258
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,960
(Xiaomeng at 100 days old)

259
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,440
Mr. Jiang, Zhou Yanzhao
left town a few days ago.

260
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,600
Where did he go?

261
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,600
Sydney.

262
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,840
Go find out now

263
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,320
where he went and who he's meeting.

264
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,720
Zhou Yanzhao
has been acting strange lately.

265
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,440
Yes, got it.

266
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,440
Go now.

267
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,120
Mr. Zhou.

268
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,880
Here's the surveillance footage
you asked for.

269
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,560
But this is like

270
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,120
finding a needle in a haystack.

271
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,880
We'll find him
using whatever clues he's left behind.

272
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,600
I'll leave you to it.

273
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,800
I need to do my rounds.

274
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,600
Call me if you need me.

275
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,520
Okay.

276
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,720
Where are you going?

277
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,840
What is this place?

278
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,560
I'm so scared!

279
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,320
Dr. Xiao!

280
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,520
-Dr. Xiao!
-Aunt Ye.

281
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,160
I'm so scared!

282
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,520
-Aunt Ye.
-I'm so scared!

283
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,160
Dr. Xiao.

284
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,280
Mr. Zhou, this is the footage
from the day before.

285
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,480
I found something.

286
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,160
Great.

287
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,800
That's him.

288
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,800
After her accident,
Aunt Ye was very confused.

289
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,760
If she had fallen to her death,

290
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,480
most people would think it was suicide

291
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,400
or suicide from guilt.

292
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,520
Mr. Zhou, shall we call the police?

293
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,080
They won't be able to find him
with this alone.

294
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,680
But there are some people I'm suspecting.

295
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,200
Let's wait a bit longer.

296
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,640
But I'm worried
Aunt Ye and Xiaomeng might be in danger.

297
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,800
I'll take precautions.

298
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,560
Don't tell anyone about this.

299
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,120
I will find him.

300
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,760
Sister Hua.

301
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,400
You're making chicken soup?

302
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,360
Of course.

303
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,680
It smells so good.

304
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,680
A Yan has been working so hard.

305
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,040
He lost so much weight.

306
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,880
That's why I wanted to make him soup.

307
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,040
Sister Hua, you're always thinking of him.

308
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,000
Xiaomeng, are you jealous?

309
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,960
I treat you both equally.

310
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,600
But I've known A Yan since he was a kid.

311
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,560
I see him as my own son.

312
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,040
He's had a tough life.

313
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,160
His mother died when he was young.

314
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,680
Now his father is gone too.

315
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,400
He has no family left in this world.

316
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,880
Shouldn't we be nicer to him?

317
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,040
Sister Hua,

318
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,880
you're the kindest,
most generous person in the world.

319
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,440
All right, all right.

320
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,800
Sister Hua.

321
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,840
What was A Yan like as a kid?

322
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,320
I mean, after his mother died.

323
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,760
He's always kept to himself.

324
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,840
He never talked much.

325
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,280
When Mrs. Zhou died,
her husband wasn't around.

326
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,800
A Yan has always held
a grudge against him for that.

327
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,480
Before Mrs. Zhou died,
she was very worried about A Yan.

328
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,880
She called me over and told me

329
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,200
to take care of A Yan.

330
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,480
You mean A Yan's mother?

331
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,520
Yes.

332
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,200
You know, during that time,

333
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,440
she was a little confused.

334
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,200
She kept going on about

335
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,240
how he shouldn't have
to deal with all this.

336
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,360
He didn't deserve a fate like this.

337
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,840
I didn't get it.

338
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,080
Also, when she was really sick,

339
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,960
maybe she got really confused.

340
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,320
But she kept saying...

341
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,680
A Yan shouldn't have been her child.

342
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,160
He shouldn't be in the Zhou family.

343
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,800
Are you okay?

344
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,040
I'm okay.

345
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,160
Where would A Yan be
if not in the Zhou family, right?

346
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,080
Sister Hua.

347
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,280
I know you love A Yan and me a lot.

348
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,880
Make sure you stay with us forever, okay?

349
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,120
When you get old,

350
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,920
I'll take care of you like my mother.

351
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,480
You're so good.

352
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,880
All right, all right.

353
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,880
You're both like my children.

354
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,400
-Are you coughing?
-Yes.

355
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,640
There's chili in there.

356
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,160
All right, take it over there.

357
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,120
Dinnertime!

358
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,320
What are you doing here?

359
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,760
I had some time today,

360
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,560
so I thought I'd come
and visit Xiaomeng and Aunt Ye.

361
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,840
Mr. Zhou.

362
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,840
Are you mad at me for coming uninvited?

363
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,240
No. Let's go in.

364
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,200
Lingxi is here.

365
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,680
Xiaomeng.

366
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,160
This is for Aunt Ye.

367
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,240
It's just a little something.

368
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,920
Thank you.

369
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,640
You didn't have to.

370
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,760
I did.

371
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,960
Is Aunt Ye feeling better?

372
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,520
She's better.

373
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,000
Thanks for asking.

374
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,840
Auntie, I'm here to see you.

375
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,000
Do you remember me?

376
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,280
I'm Lingxi.

377
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,560
She hasn't recovered her memory.

378
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,160
Sometimes she gets confused,

379
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,640
so she doesn't remember everyone.

380
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,880
Let's eat.

381
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,000
Mom, let's go sit down.

382
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,320
Sister Hua.

383
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,080
Your cooking is so good.

384
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,120
I've gotten so used to your food

385
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,520
that I can't eat takeout anymore.

386
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,880
Ms. Sun, you flatter me.

387
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,880
A Yan.

388
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,600
I made you chicken soup.

389
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,720
It's good for you.

390
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,720
Sure.

391
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,840
It's been so long since I've had
such a good home-cooked meal.

392
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,920
This is what home feels like.

393
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,120
Here you go.

394
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,600
Auntie, you look much better than before.

395
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,040
I'm sure you'll recover soon.

396
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,360
Xiaomeng, who is she?

397
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,800
Mom, this is Lingxi.

398
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,080
She's A Yan's...

399
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,000
friend.

400
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,680
Auntie, you don't remember me?

401
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,880
I'll take you out more often
when I have time.

402
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,320
We can go to the mall or to the park,
okay?

403
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,720
Okay.

404
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,480
Is Ms. Sun A Yan's girlfriend?

405
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,840
Mom, don't say such things.

406
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,360
Come on, have some soup.

407
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,240
Here you go.

408
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,880
I get it!

409
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,480
They don't want

410
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,920
anyone to know.

411
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,920
Young people are always so shy

412
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,480
when they first start dating.

413
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,320
It's okay. I won't tell.

414
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,800
I won't tell.

415
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,320
Ms. Sun.

416
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,760
You're so pretty.

417
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,600
Eat more. You're too skinny.

418
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,400
Okay, thank you, Auntie.

419
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,280
I've really been getting so confused.

420
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,760
I don't remember a lot of things.

421
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,160
But A Yan has always been such a nice boy.

422
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,760
You'll be really happy with him.

423
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,560
Okay, Auntie.

424
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,360
Mom, let's eat before the food gets cold.

425
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,360
I was right.

426
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,680
(Director Lin)

427
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,960
I need to take this.

428
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,520
Hello? Director Lin?

429
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,000
Hello, Xiaomeng.

430
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,640
Well, do you have some time?

431
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,800
Could you come to the hospital
when you're free?

432
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,520
Tiankong misses you.

433
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,040
What's wrong with Tiankong?

434
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,720
He's fine.

435
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,840
The doctor says he's recovering well.

436
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,440
The eye he had surgery on

437
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,440
is seeing better than before.

438
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,480
He just misses you
because you haven't come by

439
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,680
in a few days.

440
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,520
Okay, I'll go visit him.

441
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,440
Sorry.

442
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,920
I just got a call.

443
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,920
I'm going to see Tiankong.

444
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,200
You guys continue eating.

445
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,160
Sister Hua.

446
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,320
Could you take care of Mom for me?

447
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,080
Sure, don't worry.

448
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,080
A Yan.

449
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,560
Do you want to go with me to see Tiankong?

450
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,160
Say hi to him for me.

451
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,720
And to Director Lin too.

452
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,680
Okay, I will.

453
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,640
Ms. Sun, eat more.

454
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,480
Thanks, Auntie.

455
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,080
This story is called

456
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,800
"The Fox Pretending to Be a Tiger."

457
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,320
This cunning fox--

458
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,560
Xiaomeng!

459
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,880
Xiaomeng is here.

460
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,480
Tiankong.

461
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,400
Are your eyes feeling better?

462
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,320
I'm a lot better.

463
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,600
The doctor said
his eye is recovering very quickly.

464
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,040
The one they did surgery on

465
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,520
is a lot better than before.

466
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,120
He has a healthy system.

467
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,360
Great.

468
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,040
A Yan didn't come with you?

469
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,560
He is busy today.

470
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,400
It's fine.

471
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,680
Have you had dinner?

472
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,760
-Not yet.
-All right.

473
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,920
Watch him for me.

474
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,800
I'll buy you something.

475
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,800
-Okay.
-I haven't eaten either.

476
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,120
Thank you.

477
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,480
Tiankong, be good.

478
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,720
Tiankong, tell me.

479
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,520
Now that you can see again,

480
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,360
what do you want to do most?

481
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,000
I'll help you so you can do
anything you want.

482
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,920
Now that I can see you and Mommy Lin,

483
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,320
I want to go back to the welfare center
and see all my friends.

484
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,520
I want to go to the sea
and see what it's like.

485
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,880
Tiankong, but it's already dark outside.

486
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,200
Now that it's dark,
you won't be able to see anything.

487
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,760
It's time for you to sleep.

488
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:01,920
How about this?

489
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,320
When the doctor says
it's okay for you to leave,

490
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,720
I'll take you to the sea, okay?

491
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,600
Okay.

492
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,760
Come on, lie down and sleep.

493
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,160
Tiankong, how will you sleep

494
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,520
with your eyes open?

495
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,720
I'm afraid if I close my eyes,

496
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,800
I won't see you all
when I open them again.

497
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,760
Silly boy.

498
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,960
Why would you think that?

499
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,480
Don't think too much.

500
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,280
I promise you.

501
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,960
When the sun rises tomorrow,

502
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,840
you'll still be able to see us.

503
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,120
Okay?

504
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,440
Go to sleep.

505
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,560
I'm knitting a scarf for Xiaomeng.

506
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,280
It's getting cold.

507
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,960
Winter is coming.

508
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,320
A Yan, you just came back from overseas.

509
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,240
Auntie.

510
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,400
What's wrong?

511
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,600
Tell me.

512
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,400
What happened between you and my father?

513
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,880
I... I forgot.

514
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,000
I can't remember.

515
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,840
What happened to me?

516
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,080
What happened?

517
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,760
Sirong.

518
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,880
I'm sorry.

519
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,760
I'm late. I'm sorry.

520
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,040
You have a lot to be sorry about.

521
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,960
Never mind. Leave it.

522
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,440
Sit down.

523
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,480
You're such a tease.

524
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,840
What is it?

525
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,080
What's so urgent that you wanted to meet?

526
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,320
Binli.

527
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
You're going to be a father.

528
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,440
I'm pregnant with your baby.

529
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,960
You're going to be a father.

530
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,560
Aren't you happy?

531
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,040
You're unhappy, aren't you?

532
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,360
No.

533
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,160
It's just so sudden.

534
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,560
Binli. When will you marry me?

535
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,040
I don't want the child to have no father.

536
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,640
I was going to wait for you to propose.

537
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,160
But today,
when I found out I was pregnant,

538
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,520
I was so excited I couldn't wait anymore.

539
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,000
Binli, when will you marry me?

540
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,000
♪ I want to say I love you ♪

541
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,360
♪ But during that year
Everything stopped ♪

542
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,960
♪ The most faraway love ♪

543
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,240
♪ Back towards the sea ♪

544
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,800
♪ Take those memories ♪

545
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,880
You've never...

546
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,960
wanted to marry me.

547
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,160
Sirong, listen.

548
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,920
You know about my situation with her.

549
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,000
She might be gone,

550
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,080
but her family won't let go of this.

551
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,080
They don't want me to remarry.

552
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,720
They're really demanding.

553
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,480
There's nothing I can do.

554
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,680
I can't do anything.

555
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,040
How about this?

556
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,520
Wait a few more years, okay?

557
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,960
I can't wait any longer!

558
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,080
I'm already pregnant!

559
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,160
I can't wait!

560
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,520
I can't keep waiting forever!

561
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,960
Give me an estimate.

562
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,040
How much time do you need?

563
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,400
Sirong.

564
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,400
Trust me.

565
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,240
I really love you.

566
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,160
Just give me some time.

567
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,160
I'll get rid of them.

568
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,320
Okay. Three months.

569
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,480
Before I start to show.

570
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,000
Three months?

571
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,440
I don't think I can do that.

572
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,400
Zhou Binli.

573
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,240
You're a hypocrite! Coward!

574
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,320
This was your very last chance.

575
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,720
You wanted to give this up.

576
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,280
Let's never...

577
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,400
see each other again.

578
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,360
Sirong, don't be rash!

579
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,520
Sirong!

580
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,720
Father.

581
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,800
What should I do?

582
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,480
I want to tell Xiaomeng everything.

583
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,200
She's your daughter.

584
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,840
She has a right to know the truth.

585
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,920
But my rationality tells me...

586
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,280
that if Xiaomeng learns the truth...

587
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,920
she will be in grave danger.

588
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,160
Dad.

589
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,440
I'm sure you don't want that.

590
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:36,880
Dad.

591
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,160
I will protect Xiaomeng.

592
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,680
I will give...

593
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,800
everything to her after some time.

594
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,400
I will tell her everything.

595
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,480
Keeping the truth from her...

596
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,200
is the best way to protect her now.

597
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,000
And I...

598
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,360
am just a joke.

599
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,520
I know my mother is right there.

600
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,960
But because of my worries...

601
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,480
I can only look at her from afar.

602
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,680
A Yan, where are you going?

603
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,560
For a walk.

604
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,480
Let me drive you.

605
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,920
I'm going alone. Don't follow me.

606
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,160
A Yan...

607
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,760
I won't repeat myself.

608
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,080
Don't torture yourself like this.

609
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,640
What are you doing here?

610
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,640
Guang couldn't find you.

611
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,040
He didn't know where you were.

612
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,800
A Yan, stop drinking.

613
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,440
If you want to stay here,

614
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,800
then don't stop me.

615
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,200
What are you doing?
