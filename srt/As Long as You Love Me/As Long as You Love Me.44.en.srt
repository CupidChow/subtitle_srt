1
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,720
(Episode 44)

2
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,960
Hello?

3
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,560
Where are you?

4
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,680
Wait for me.

5
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,760
Father, where are you going?

6
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,440
Something came up. I need to go out.

7
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,440
Xiaomeng, there's one more thing
I need to apologize to you for.

8
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,880
It's about the spread of
your indecent photo on the internet,

9
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,480
I was the one who shared it.

10
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,520
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

11
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,600
Men are no doubt

12
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,440
good at flirting.

13
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,400
But look at what you are like now.

14
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,600
Check your email.

15
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,920
Okay.

16
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,800
Get it done. It's a must.

17
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,840
Don't worry.

18
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,560
But why...

19
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,400
Why did you do that?

20
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,160
I wanted President Zhou so badly.

21
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,360
I adore and look up to him.

22
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,600
But I don't know how to get him.

23
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,240
I was too silly.

24
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,720
Xiaomeng, after this incident,

25
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,480
you two must get along well.

26
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,800
Only you can make him happy.

27
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,560
I wish you the best.

28
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,360
Boss, boss.

29
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,120
Is this really the last resort?

30
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,360
Listen, the police are suspicious
about me, you know?

31
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,640
You don't need me
to tell you what to do, do you?

32
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,040
It's time to return my favor
when I saved your life outside the casino

33
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,600
five years ago.

34
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,440
Boss, my life is not worthy.

35
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,600
It can be gone anytime.

36
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,480
But I have family to take care of.

37
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,160
If I'm gone, they--

38
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,680
Don't worry.

39
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,160
I've thought it through for you.

40
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,880
I've transferred a big sum of money
to your wife's bank account.

41
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,600
It's enough for her
to spend for decades, you know?

42
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,120
Actually this isn't
what I expected as well.

43
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,280
If anyone is at fault,
Zhou Yanzhao is to be blamed,

44
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,440
right?

45
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,960
Yes.

46
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,520
Right.

47
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,160
You sure it's him?

48
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,200
Okay, thank you.

49
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,640
A Yan, what's wrong?

50
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,880
Nothing.

51
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,280
We had a deal.

52
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,920
No matter what happens,

53
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,080
we shouldn't hide things from each other.

54
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,960
Jiang Qingcheng's assistant...

55
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,200
has just died.

56
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,400
What? He's dead?

57
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,240
The call was from the police,

58
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,000
saying that he jumped off the building.

59
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,280
I think there's something fishy
going on here.

60
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,360
Jiang Qingcheng must've
suspected something.

61
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,960
In that case,

62
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,960
he can blame all the fault
onto his assistant.

63
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,160
Dead men tell no tales.

64
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,960
Guang,

65
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,160
follow Xiaomeng closely for now,

66
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
don't leave her alone.

67
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,680
Brother Yan, are you worried that
they might move in on Xiaomeng?

68
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,280
Jiang Qingcheng is ruthless.

69
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,800
I'm afraid he might do something else.

70
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,920
So for the time being,

71
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,680
you have to follow Xiaomeng closely.

72
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,000
Don't ever leave her alone.

73
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,480
Don't worry.

74
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,360
A Yan, Jiang Qingcheng now sees you
as his worst enemy.

75
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,280
So you should be more careful.

76
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,960
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

77
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,600
Have you seen the news?

78
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,080
Someone jumped off the building just now.

79
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,040
That's normal.

80
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,400
There're many cases like this.

81
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,520
No. I've seen this person before.

82
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,840
He was always here to look for
Vice President Jiang.

83
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,040
Jumping from such a height,

84
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,520
what an awful death.

85
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,280
I'm going back to work.

86
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,320
Okay.

87
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,640
Secretary Zhao, where's my father?

88
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,040
He didn't come to work today.

89
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,520
I don't know where he is either.

90
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,240
I'll get back to work.

91
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,560
Rubbish!

92
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,560
How could this happen?

93
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,800
Didn't you say so confidently

94
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,320
that there's no problem with
the company's operation?

95
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,080
What excuse is this?

96
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,000
Three days. I'll only give you three days.

97
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,040
Solve the problem immediately.

98
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,240
I don't care how you do it.
I only want the outcome.

99
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,600
A Ze, why are you back?

100
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,480
The statement of
Dikai Commercial City's project shows

101
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,440
an unusual transaction.

102
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,440
After checking,
it was you who approved it.

103
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,360
What did you do
with such large amount of money?

104
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,400
This day has finally come.

105
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,280
You can discuss business matters
with me already.

106
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,080
Father,

107
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,400
I don't wish to see you make mistakes.

108
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,920
A foreign subsidiary had problem
with its capital turnover.

109
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,800
It was used to deal with the emergency.

110
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,600
Is that really all?

111
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,120
Son, with so many things happening,

112
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,320
I feel really old

113
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,240
and tired.

114
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,080
Maybe it's time for me to retire.

115
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,880
After I retire,

116
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,040
I'll pass the company to you.

117
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,560
I'll go fishing, play sports,

118
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,720
live the life of an elderly person.

119
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,000
Father, why don't...

120
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,760
you reconcile with Zhou Yanzhao?

121
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,680
The matter is getting critical by day.

122
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,960
It'll be out of control if this continues.

123
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,000
Son, we must not reconcile.

124
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,840
This is our last chance.

125
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,880
Discharge one
when he has served his purpose.

126
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,720
Now it's not about choosing
to advance or retreat.

127
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,480
Instead we must fight till the end.

128
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,160
It's not only for the Jiang family now,
but also for your future, you know?

129
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,000
Father, if we continue fighting,

130
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,880
we may lose everything.

131
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,680
If we retreat now,
we can still start over.

132
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,040
I'm old already.

133
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,600
I have no more chance to start over.

134
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,280
But you still have me.

135
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,440
I've made up my mind.

136
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,160
Stop persuading me.

137
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,720
(Your period has been delayed for 45 days.
You might be pregnant.)

138
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,600
(Got it)

139
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,880
(Period has been delayed for 45 days)

140
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,120
This is the recording
my sister passed to me.

141
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
Also the bank statement that shows

142
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,120
the money Jiang Qingcheng
transferred to me.

143
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,600
If you want to litigate,

144
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,280
I'm willing to be the witness.

145
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,200
If you had told me this earlier,

146
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,200
things would have not ended up this way.

147
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,560
It's too late to talk about the past
that cannot be changed.

148
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,920
I made a mistake, so I should be punished.

149
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,360
President Zhou,

150
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,160
thank you.

151
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,440
I'm really lucky to have met you.

152
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,280
Don't worry.

153
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,760
I'll plead to the judge.

154
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,360
When you come back,

155
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,120
the seat outside is still yours.

156
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,120
There's another reason...

157
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,040
I came here today.

158
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,360
♪I am not sure if your hands♪

159
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,160
♪Will hold on to the past♪

160
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,320
Have you thought it through?

161
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,240
I have no reason to stay.

162
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,960
Okay.

163
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,640
I respect your decision.

164
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,560
You really decided to leave?

165
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,280
I've heard something from President Zhou.

166
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,520
But...

167
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,240
why did you leave so suddenly?

168
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,680
Even if President Zhou wants you to leave,

169
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,080
I can ask for his forgiveness.

170
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,240
I decided to leave.

171
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,680
I've worked here for such a long time.

172
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,240
It's time to move on.

173
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,440
-Lingxi, I--
-I'm leaving.

174
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,640
I'm glad to have you as my colleague.

175
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,960
Don't be a workaholic.

176
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,880
It's time to think about your life.

Lingxi.

I've been keeping this
to myself for a long time.

But I must tell you today.

Because I like you.

00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,240
I've liked you all this while.

210
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,360
Can you give me a chance

to take care and protect you?

Thank you?

219
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,040
Is this how you're going to reject me?

220
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,600
Qingyan,

221
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,400
you're kind and friendly.

222
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,440
You treat everyone well.
You're a great man.

223
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,880
It's just that I'm so messed up now.

224
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,520
I really can't jump into
a new relationship yet.

225
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,840
But I'll always remember your kindness.

226
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,960
We can be good friends forever.

227

You know what, Qingyan?

Love needs to be unlocked
with a fingerprint.

229

But not everyone...

230
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,160
can unlock it.

231
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,640
I understand.

232
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,200
Everyone needs to find the right person

By the way,

253
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,120
Sun Lingxi came today.

254
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,880
She passed me the recording.

255
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,760
Did she say anything?

256
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,160
She resigned.

257
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,280
It's to be expected.

258
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,080
She has a strong personality.

259
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,880
She has got a mind of her own.

260
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,680
By the way, regarding Jiang Qingcheng,

261
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,960
what do you have in mind?

262
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,040
Anything you say.

263
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,680
At this point,

264
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,720
there's no point in fighting
over anything.

265
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,040
I only hope

266
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,200
he could realize his mistake

267
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,200
and never harm others.

268
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,560
Should I talk to Jiang Ze then?

269
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,000
That'll be fine.

270
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,800
After all, he is Jiang Qingcheng's son.

271
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,000
Okay.

272
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,840
I know what to do now.

273
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,880
Let's eat.

274
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,800
I'll go home first.

275
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,000
Come home early.

276
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,320
Got it.

277
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,040
President Zhou, I just got dumped
and you're so lovey-dovey.

278
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,840
Qingyan,

279
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,800
I think you still have a chance.

280
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,000
It's just that Lingxi
can't think about it yet

281
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,520
given her current condition.

282
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,000
When it comes to courting a girl,

283
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,880
if you fail once, try it again.

284
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,920
Don't give up if you really like her.

285
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,120
Don't worry.
I'm just not in good condition lately.

286
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,000
But I won't give up on Sun Lingxi.

287
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,320
What's up?

288
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,240
This is the operational report of
Dikai Commercial City.

289
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,240
As we collaborated with their competitor,
putting pressure on them,

290
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,960
Dikai Commercial City decided
to engage in a price war.

291
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,960
Now they can't make ends meet
and are in debt.

292
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,360
Our initial objective is starting to work.

293
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,520
In less than a week, Dikai Commercial City

294
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,920
will be investigated by
regulatory departments

295
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,320
due to capital chain issue.

296
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,400
Let's stop it.

297
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,320
Wait.

298
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,720
What did you say?

299
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,520
Stop it.

300
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,600
Don't push them to the edge.

301
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,920
But I don't understand.

302
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,440
If we pull out now,

303
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,600
won't all our hard work go to waste?

304
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,920
I understand what you're trying to say.

305
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,720
But now, I don't want to do this anymore.

306
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,280
Give them a chance.

307
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,200
President Zhou,

308
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,840
ever since you're married,
you've totally changed.

309
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,120
It's often said marriage can change a man.

310
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,920
I didn't believe it.

311
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,640
Is that so? After being married,
one will become more careful,

312
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,080
and be afraid of losing.

313
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,920
I don't like the idea of
letting Jiang Qingcheng go.

314
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,760
After all, he'd caused us so much damage.

315
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,840
What can you do if you don't let him go?

316
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,640
Intriguing against each other is tiring.

317
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,080
I only want Jiang Qingcheng
to realize his mistake,

318
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,680
and put an end to this matter.

319
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,360
I want to stop taking revenge.

320
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,160
We need to put our focus
on the Commercial Integrated Sports Center

321
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,320
and the Guest House project.

322
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,360
This is Xiaomeng's wish, as well as mine.

323
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,680
Shenghai needs to move forward.

324
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,080
Got it, President Zhou.

325
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,160
I'll do as you said.

326
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,000
Go.

327
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,200
Hello.

328
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,840
Are you free?

329
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,680
Let's meet tonight.

330
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,720
-Get me a drink.
-Okay.

331
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,600

Quite long, I suppose.

00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,880
You're my friend.

337
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,720
Even though your father deserves it,

338
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,280
I don't want to push him to the wall.

339
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,560
I've talked to him earlier, but he--

340
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,960
The situation is different now.

341
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,200
I believe you know it well.

342
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,000
At the moment, Xiaomeng and I
chose not to report to the police.

343
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,760
We hope he could give himself up
to the police.

344
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,560
So that he could
gain back his self-respect.

345
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,520
A Ze.

346
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,560
Don't let him stray further.

347
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Thank you, A Yan.

348
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,520
Father.

349
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,800
I'm your son.

350
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,720
Have you ever thought for me?

351
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,200
Why did you suddenly say so?

352
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,760
Are you going to abandon me
for your own sake?

353
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,120
Nonsense.

354
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,120
You're my son.

355
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,520
I can do anything for you.

356
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,520
Don't you understand?

357
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,040
Since young, I've been watching
how you treat others and me.

358
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,120
Do you know why I'm unwilling
to join your business circle?

359
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,880
Because I don't want
to be under your thumb forever.

360
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,400
I want to start my own business.
Did you ever support me?

361
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,360
With you, I have no freedom at all.

362
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,720
Freedom?

363
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,920
You're too selfish.

364
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,760
What did you say?

365
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,360
Zhou Yanzhao and Xiaomeng
have got all your evidence of crime.

366
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,040
You misappropriated company funds.

367
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,960
They've known it.

368
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,680
They haven't reported to the police yet,
hoping that you could surrender.

369
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,880
Father, please surrender yourself.

370
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,320
So that we can gain back
self-respect for Jiang's family.

371
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,080
Surrender, surrender.

372
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,200
By now, there's no more self-respect.

373
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,200
Father, you taught me yourself.

374
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,640
Men aren't afraid of making mistakes.

375
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,400
Once you've done it,

376
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,400
be it a mistake or a crime,

377
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,720
you can't run away.

378
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,280
Doomed.

379
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,840
Jiang's family is doomed.

380
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,280
No, Father.

381
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,640
You've owned so much.

382
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,160
Why aren't you letting go?

383
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,280
You've harmed so many people.

384
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,360
You put Shenghai in a critical situation.

385
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,640
You ruined Ronghui.

386
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,560
You unscrupulously took over Lingtian.

387
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,400
Look at your greed. What have you done?

388
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,960
What have I done?

389
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,000
Did I do all these for my own sake?

390
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,640
It was for you.

391
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,520
To get more leverage for your future.

392
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,960
I don't need these.

393
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,480
These aren't what I want.

394
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,120
Have you truly thought of what I want?

395
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,840
It's not that I'm not interested
in business.

396
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,400
I like internet entrepreneurship.

397
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,360
But the deceptions and battles
in your business circle

398
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,000
aren't what I want to get involved in.

399
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,360
What I want to do is

400
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,760
to catch hold of the current trend and
use my own ability to make money.

401
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,000
Father, please surrender yourself.

402
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,880
Surrender?

403
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,520
Do you know what surrender means?

404
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,240
Son, you're pushing me

405
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,080
to the prison.

406
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,600
You're already in prison.

407
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,160
Your desire and greed
have already trapped you.

408
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,040
Only if you surrender,
you get a second chance.

409
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,960
That's the father whom I respect.

410
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,560
I just wanted to go higher.

411
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,040
I didn't expect I'd come to this point.

412
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,280
Father, you're too extreme.

413
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,360
Success isn't earned
at the expense of others.

414
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,880
It's not too late to turn around.

415
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,120
Father, I beg you.

416
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,520
Please surrender.

417
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,800
All right, son.

418
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,440
I promise you.

419
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,560
I'll surrender to the police.

420
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,480
Okay.

421
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,240
I'll get you the best lawyer and team.

422
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,360
Don't worry, father.

423
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,560
I'll leave it to you.

424
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,680
You decide.

425
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,160
Leave me alone.

426
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,520
Father, don't worry.

427
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,920
I'll take care of everything.

428
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,680
Book me a ticket to Singapore.

429
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,240
Today's flight.

430
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,200
No return ticket.

431
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,520
As soon as possible.

432
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,440
-A Yan, eat more.
-Thanks, Mother.

433
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,080
(Jiang Ze)

434
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,920
-Hello?
-Hello.

435
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,640
Xiaomeng, it's me.

436
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,600
My father booked
a direct flight to Singapore.

437
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,680
Got it.

438
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,080
Xiaomeng, what's wrong?

439
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,480
It's Jiang Ze, right?

440
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,640
He told me his father booked
a direct flight to Singapore tonight.

441
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,920
Is he...

442
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,240
Jiang Qingcheng wants to run away.

443
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,720
A Yan, I go with you.

444
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,640
Xiaomeng, you stay with mother.

445
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,880
It's easier to act alone.

446
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,320
A Yan, you've to be careful.

447
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,240
Don't worry.

448
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,800
Mother.

449
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,960
Don't worry, he'll be fine.

450
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,080
Let's eat.

451
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,600
Come on.

452
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,480
That way.

453
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,560
Okay, then you go the other way.

454
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,080
-We meet here.
-Okay.

455
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,680
A Ze.

456
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,160
-Found him?
-No.

457
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,600
The airport is too big.
I couldn't find him.

458
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,800
What do we do now?

459
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,000
Is that your father?

460
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,640
Yes, it's him.

461
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,800
Father.

462
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,920
Call him, quick.

463
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,440
Uncle Jiang

464
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,760
(Father)

465
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,200
Turn on speaker, quick.

466
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,000
(Father)

467
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,240
Hello.

468
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,120
A Ze.

469
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,360
Father.

470
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,840
Great.

471
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:38,200
Son, I've been plotting all my life,

472
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,840
never thought I'd fall into
my son's hands.

473
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,280
Father, I never wanted this to happen.

474
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,160
This is not the outcome I want.

475
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,240
I've talked to you earlier.

476
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,280
If I let you go today,
that's not what I should do as a son.

477
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,240
You want me to bow before him?

478
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,600
No. Never

479
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,200
Uncle Jiang.

480
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,000
At this point,
it's not about something personal.

481
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,520
Both Jiang Ze and I don't wish
to see you stray further.

482
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,800
You've to take responsibility
for your own actions.

483
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,760
Please surrender.

484
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,920
Perhaps the offense might be mitigated.

485
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,440
Father.

486
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,320
You care only for your own interests.

487
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,560
But above all,
there're still right and wrong.

488
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,120
Listen to me.

489
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,000
Trust me this time.

490
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,040
I'm right.

491
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,440
Zhou Yanzhao,

492
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,080
you thought you'd win
with A Ze being on your side?

493
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,040
No, you'll never win!

494
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,680
Uncle Jiang, Jiang Ze was right.

495
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,120
Right or wrong is always
more important than interests.

496
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,960
What I'm doing now
is to protect you, father.

497
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,720
The earlier you quit,

498
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,360
the less consequence you've to bear.

499
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,280
I beg you.

500
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,360
Surrender to the police.

501
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,360
Okay, A Ze.

502
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,680
I'll listen to you this time.

503
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,120
I won't leave.

504
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,800
I'll listen to you this time.

505
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,880
Get up.

506
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,640
I go get my father's luggage.

507
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,280
Jiang Ze.

508
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,680
Bring him to the police
as soon as possible.

509
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,040
In case he harms himself again.

510
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,400
Okay, got it.

511
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,720
When we were at the sports field,

512
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,480
we used to compete to win.

513
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,080
But now,

514
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,640
there aren't such standards.

515
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,000
I know how you feel.

516
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,920
We're the same.

517
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,120
There's no winning or losing.

518
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,080
How was it? Have you found him?

519
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,240
Jiang Ze was at the airport.

520
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,200
He managed to stop Uncle Jiang
and talked him into surrendering.

521
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:41,360
But will Uncle Jiang really
listen to Jiang Ze and surrender?

522
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,760
Maybe it was Jiang Ze's tears
that touched him.

523
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,440
I guess Jiang Ze did this mainly

524
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,200
for Uncle Jiang's own good.

525
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,120
What's wrong?

526
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,840
I don't know why

527
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,240
I somehow think that Uncle Jiang
won't give up so easily.

528
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,280
Will he really surrender?

529
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,800
I understand your concern.

530
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,880
But what we can do now

531
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,200
is to let Jiang Ze decide himself.

532
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,640
I believe he knows what to do.

533
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,920
But your concern is valid.

534
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,280
We have to be careful.

535
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,040
Will you let Jiang Ze stay at Shenghai?

536
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,120
Why not?

537
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,480
The construction of sports center
needs manpower.

538
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,920
We talked about this before.

539
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,960
He's always wanted to do
internet entrepreneurship.

540
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,000
I think the Guest House sector of
Yunnan resort

541
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,520
seems to have a prospect
towards online business.

542
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,200
You mean you incorporated Guest House

543
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,520
in Yunnan resort project?

544
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,400
Yes, I can even help you
develop your art space.

545
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,120
Being able to help my loved one
to realize her dream

546
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,400
worth more than anything else.

547
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,160
Xiaomeng.

548
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,520
Nothing can hold us back now.

549
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,200
Maybe not long after,
Shenghai can come back stronger.

550
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,840
A Yan, I believe you can do it.

551
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,600
Xiaomeng, it's all over now.

552
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,440
Everything will be fine.

553
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,040
Nobody will ever hurt you again.

554
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,160
I'll make it up to you
with all my love, okay?

555
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:48,400
By the way, I have something to tell you.

556
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,200
Yes?

557
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,720
I'm not sure...

558
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,760
if you like boy...

559
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,160
or girl?

560
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,360
This...

561
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,320
I only found out after using
a period tracker app.

562
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,760
(Period has been delayed for 45 days)

563
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,640
But it's only been 35 days.

564
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,480
Come, lean on it.

565
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,120
Whether it's a boy or a girl,
I'll be equally happy.

566
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,880
As long as both of you are safe.

567
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,800
We need to find time
to officially announce this news

568
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,800
to our friends and family.

569
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,520
You don't know this.

570
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,840
The elders say we can't spread the news
during early pregnancy.

571
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,200
It's ominous.

572
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,400
There's such a saying?

573
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,000
Sit down.

574
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,120
Hello, A Yan.

575
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,280
My father's gone.

576
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,360
Take it easy. What's wrong?

577
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,360
This morning,

578
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,520
I planned to take him
to the police station.

579
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,960
But he'd gone right after breakfast.

580
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,520
Are his luggage and passport still there?

581
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,040
All his belongings are still here.

582
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,120
It's like he went out for a walk.

583
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,280
I've searched everywhere
but didn't see him.

584
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,560
Call the police.

585
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,320
If you don't want to report
your father for murder,

586
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,440
report him as missing.

587
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:46,840
Jiang Ze.

588
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,560
We have to find your father

589
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,360
for his own good.

590
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,400
Okay.

591
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,880
A Yan, what's wrong?

592
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,240
Your concern is valid.

593
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,160
Uncle Jiang didn't surrender.

594
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,080
Now nobody knows where he is.

595
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,280
Then what should we do now?

596
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,960
I suppose Jiang Ze will report
to the police.

597
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,920
A Yan, how will things end up later?

598
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,560
Uncle Jiang refuses
to realize his mistakes.

599
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,200
I wonder how this will end up
in the future.

600
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,320
Leave all of this to me.

601
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,000
Your current main task
is to take care of yourself

602
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,400
and the baby.

603
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,680
Got it.

604
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,840
By the way, don't you need to work today?

605
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,880
How can I be at ease to go to work
with you like this?

606
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,400
I've decided to move my office
to the study room for the time being.

607
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,560
I'll work from home.

608
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,320
How can you do that?

609
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,560
You don't need to be so anxious.

610
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,360
Sister Hua.

611
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,200
The doctor said Xiaomeng lacks nutrition.

612
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,320
It's very risky.

613
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,200
From now on, our meals
should include ginseng, velvet antler

614
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,160
and bird nest.

615
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,640
Prepare tonic twice a day.

616
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,120
Sister Hua.

617
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,760
Your current main task is
to help Xiaomeng gain 10kg.

618
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,320
No. 15kg.

619
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,720
A Yan, since when did you learned
how to care for people?

620
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,560
Don't worry, I'm experienced.

621
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,920
I know how to take care of
pregnant ladies.

622
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,600
-Just wait and see.
-Xiaomeng.

623
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,480
-Don't worry.
-Okay.

624
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,960
-A Yan is back.
-Mother.

625
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,320
-Mother.
-How was the checkup?

626
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,920
Don't worry, mother. Everything is fine.

627
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,360
That's good.
