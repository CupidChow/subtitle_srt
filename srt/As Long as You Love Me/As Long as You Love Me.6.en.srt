00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,680
(Episode 6)

2
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,760
Yan, the flowers you requested are ready.

3
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,720
Let's go.

4
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,760
Stay there.

5
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,480
Come over.

6
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,240
Be quick if you're giving your lecture.

7
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,400
I'm meeting friends.

8
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,960
You've told me that

9
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,800
being late is a great insult to others.

10
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,360
Look at you. Sleep in daytime

11
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,800
and go out at night.

12
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,760
What are you up to every day?

13
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,040
Take it easy.

14
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,640
I don't traffic humans.

15
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,120
I don't kill or commit arson.

16
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,800
I'm not involved in sex or drug deals.

17
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,520
I'm just going out with friends to enjoy

18
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,200
the nightlife in my hometown.

19
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,200
How long do you plan to live like this?

20
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,640
Listen,...

21
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,320
Shenghai Group is hiring soon.

22
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,080
Get well prepared for this.

23
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
Dad,

24
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,400
just because you couldn't defeat
Zhou Yanzhao to become the chairman,

25
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,760
now you're forcing me to do this.

26
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,400
I refuse to be his training partner.

27
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,000
Please spare me.

28
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,960
Listen,

29
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,600
I'm not discussing with you.

30
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,920
I'm informing you.

31
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,960
You must get into Shenghai Group.

32
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,400
Why must I work in Shenghai?

33
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,920
Because you're Jiang Qingcheng's son,

34
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,000
you can't lose to Zhou Binli's son.

35
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,640
I'd rather not be your son

36
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,720
than to work at Shenghai.

37
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,760
I'll cut all your credit cards...

38
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,000
You!

39
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,120
unless you get a job in Shenghai.

40
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,160
Are you really my dad?

41
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,560
Ze,...

42
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,080
I've got to have a perfect plan

43
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,400
for your life

44
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,440
because I'm your dad.

45
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,240
Remember,...

46
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,600
you've been called
the second generation of the rich.

47
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,440
The term weighs more than you've imagined.

48
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,440
Since you were born,

49
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,920
you've been bearing

50
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,720
a greater burden than
your previous generation.

51
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,320
You don't just inherit wealth.

52
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,520
You have more pressure and challenges.

53
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,120
The competition is crueler.

54
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,760
I'm not interested
in anything you've just said.

55
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
I can't help you
even if I work in Shenghai.

56
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,000
This is only the first step.

57
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,520
I know the details of Zhou Binli's will.

58
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,000
The next step is

59
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,040
to have you marry Zhou Xiaomeng.

60
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,640
I want to live my life in my own way.

61
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,000
When you're older,

62
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,040
you'll know how childish your words are.

63
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,800
Yan,...

64
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,720
I'll go back to my room first.

65
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,680
Yan,...

66
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,560
Please don't, and listen to me.

67
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,200
Yan, don't act like this.
Where are you taking me?

68
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,040
-Yan, where are you going?
-Back off.

69
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,640
Yan!

70
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,960
Get off.

71
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,160
You've brought me to Mr. Zhou's cemetery.

72
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,280
Let's go.

73
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,160
Yan!

74
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,560
Zhou Xiaomeng, look carefully.

75
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,640
My dad has just passed away,...

76
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,880
but you're dressed in red on TV
for the whole world to see.

77
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,720
Listen to me, Yan.

78
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,080
It was just for work,

79
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,360
-so--
-Don't explain to me.

80
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,560
Explain to my dad.

81
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,760
My dad was good to you and your mom.

82
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,400
He even left you Shenghai's shares.

83
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,320
Even if you don't appreciate,

84
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,360
can't you just pretend
to show him some respect?

85
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,840
Uncle Zhou,...

86
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,120
I'm sorry.

87
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
I'm sorry.

88
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,960
Do you like me?

89
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,680
Yes.

90
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,360
If you like me,...

91
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,360
you should respect me.

92
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,000
You shouldn't have been dressed
in bright red and smile on TV.

93
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm sorry, Yan.

94
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,680
I'm sorry.

95
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,800
You're sorry?

96
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,560
Sorry doesn't mean anything.

97
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,520
Dad, rest assured.

98
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,600
Shenghai Group is your lifetime's work.

99
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,120
I won't let it fall apart.

100
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,280
For those who've betrayed you,...

101
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,800
I'll have them pay gravely.

102
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,880
Trained before?

103
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,800
No formal training. I box for fun.

104
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,120
Practice with me.

105
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,800
You're too tired, Yan.

106
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,800
Take a break.

107
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,800
The cemetery.

108
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,960
She's in the cemetery.

109
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,360
Do you still remember this, Yan?

110
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,200
You gave this to me.

111
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,680
We were in the sports center.

112
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,920
You said I looked like goofy Garfield.

113
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,200
-Are you hurt?
-I'm fine.

114
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,680
How did you get hurt? Allow me.

115
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,720
I'm okay.

116
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,400
It may hurt a little bit.

117
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,800
Bear it.

118
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,080
I feel nothing.

119
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,640
You're pretending.

120
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,200
Does it hurt now?

121
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,720
She's killing me. Help!

122
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,480
She's trying to kill her own husband!

123
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,160
Stop your nonsense.

124
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,960
I've got a wound.

125
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,240
Why are you using a facial mask?

126
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,760
I don't have any bandages,

127
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,560
so I'm using this instead.

128
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,720
You do look like this goofy Garfield.

129
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,840
I've got bandages.

130
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,920
Let me.

131
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,080
We were so happy at that time.

132
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,880
Garfield, I envy you to be so carefree.

133
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,120
If only in life,...

134
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,640
when times are tough,...

135
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,320
I could just goof around.

136
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,160
Hang in there,...

137
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,920
Zhou Xiaomeng. You're the toughest!

138
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,280
Big Eyes.

139
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,040
Yan asks you to stay home today

140
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,080
as you have no classes.

141
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,000
Guang,...

142
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,000
I just wanted to go to the sports store

143
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,640
to buy Yan a pair of boxing gloves.

144
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,840
Alright.

145
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,840
Don't put me in a difficult position.

146
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,440
Big Eyes, let's go.

147
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,320
Miss, our boxing gloves are all here.

148
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,800
This pair is imported from the U.S.

149
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,120
It's a bit more expensive

150
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,480
but the quality is really good.

151
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,120
Give me a pair of these red gloves.

152
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,120
Sure.

153
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,440
The black ones too.

154
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,640
Yes, Miss.

155
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,800
Is your boyfriend a boxer?

156
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,640
He...

157
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,400
Yes.

158
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,400
A boxer for a boyfriend
surely makes you feel safe.

159
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,640
Please check out at the counter.

160
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,640
Why have they parked so close?

161
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,080
Hello, A Qi.

162
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,760
Where are you, Xiaomeng?

163
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,800
Listen. The director
and the crew are all here.

164
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,520
Don't be late.

165
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,640
I'm nearby.

166
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,760
I'll be there in a minute.

167
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,080
But...

168
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,560
I bumped into someone's car.

169
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,640
What should I do?

170
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,240
Is it serious?

171
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,880
It's probably okay.

172
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,320
You should just apologize
and pay for the damages.

173
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,760
Listen, the director is quick-tempered.

174
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,200
Make sure you come on time.

175
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,160
He just scolded his assistant severely.

176
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,800
Alright. I've got it.

177
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,840
I'll come soon.

178
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,920
Calm him down first.

179
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,920
That's it for now. Bye!

180
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,160
See you tonight

181
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,600
-in our usual place.
-Sure.

182
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,800
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye...

183
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,720
How can I be so unlucky?

184
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,720
Zhou Xiaomeng.

185
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,120
Do you like it?

186
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,120
Yes.

187
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,600
Shall I give it to you?

188
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,440
Yes.

189
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,680
Let's call it "Weekend," shall we?

190
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,560
Okay.

191
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,040
Why are Xiaomeng's eyes so red?

192
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,560
What's up?

193
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,880
Director,

194
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,520
she worked long hours yesterday.

195
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,040
She probably hasn't got enough rest.

196
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,240
We've bought some eye drop for her.

197
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,160
She's used it.

198
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,200
Her eyes will be fine soon.

199
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,960
How about we take the wide shot first.

200
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,880
Cameraman,...

201
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,600
we'll take the wide shot first.

202
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,480
Wide shot first. Get ready.

203
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,360
It's okay now.

204
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,400
Get ready. Follow the camera.

205
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,240
Surrounding us,...

206
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,800
there's this group of kids.

207
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,400
They can see...

208
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,760
but they don't look
at anything around them.

209
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,040
They can hear...

210
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,240
but they don't listen to anything.

211
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,080
They can make sounds...

212
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,760
but they don't know

213
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,080
how to communicate with this world.

214
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,360
They're the kids of the stars.

215
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,440
Cut! Cut! Cut!

216
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,440
Xiaomeng, what's the matter with you?

217
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,440
I'm really sorry, director.

218
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,800
I just had a stumble.

219
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,160
Can we have another take?

220
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,560
Let's take

221
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,080
the kid's close-up first.

222
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,600
Xiaomeng, go take a break.

223
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,400
Get ready.

224
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,400
Three, two, one. Action!

225
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,960
Anything wrong?

226
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,880
No.

227
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,720
The director must have
a bad impression of me.

228
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,440
I can feel it.

229
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,480
I think it doesn't matter.

230
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,080
You have good work ethic.

231
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,600
Everyone knows that.

232
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,880
You didn't do it on purpose anyway.

233
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,520
Don't worry.

234
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,000
Whose call are you waiting for?

235
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,480
Didn't I tell you I bumped into a car?

236
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,400
I left my phone number for the car owner.

237
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,080
My phone is on mute.

238
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,280
I'm afraid
I might miss that person's call.

239
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,720
This one.

240
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,800
I think it's from the car owner.

241
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,840
He's not looking this way right now.

242
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,280
Go out and answer it.

243
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,920
If he asks,
I'll say you're in the washroom.

244
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,520
-Thanks!
-Hurry up. Go.

245
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,760
Hello? Is this Zhou Xiaomeng?

246
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,440
Yes.

247
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,920
Are you the owner of the car
that I bumped into today?

248
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,680
Yes, I am.

249
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,040
I'm really sorry.

250
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,400
I wasn't paying attention.

251
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,640
But please be assured

252
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,720
I'll take responsibility.

253
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,480
I'll pay the compensation in full.

254
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,200
I don't care about the money.

255
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,480
But you crushed my car's bumper
and ran away.

256
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,840
This is a hit-and-run accident.

257
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,680
I...I didn't run away.

258
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,680
I left you a note.

259
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,880
A note?

260
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,560
The wind must have blown it away.

261
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,040
I haven't seen any note.

262
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,280
Impossible.

263
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,720
How can you tell such a blatant lie?

264
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,920
How could you get
my number without my note?

265
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,440
I'll explain it when I see you.

266
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,760
I'm hungry now.

267
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,000
Today at noon.

268
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,480
Let's meet up at New Betsy's Restaurant.

269
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,240
Noon?

270
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,560
I'm afraid I can't make it.

271
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,520
If you don't come,

272
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,120
I'll see this as hit-and-run.

273
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,240
I--

274
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,240
He's such a weirdo.

275
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,480
Chairman Zhou.

276
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,280
Ladies and gentlemen,

277
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,560
this is Mr. Zhou Yanzhao,
chairman of Shenghai Group.

278
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,400
Chairman Zhou will personally host
this part of the interview.

279
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,840
Please sit down.

280
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,200
Qingyan,...

281
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,040
shouldn't there be six candidates?

282
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,360
Why are there only five?

283
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,600
Jiang Qingcheng's son,

284
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,880
Jiang Ze hasn't come in yet.

285
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,000
He's coming?

286
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,120
I'm sorry I'm late.

287
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,400
As you're late, you're disqualified.

288
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,760
Come on. My car was crashed into.

289
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,440
We only look at the outcome
regardless of the cause.

290
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,600
Please leave this room.

291
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,920
Are you trying to pick on me?

292
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,560
The interview notice states
clearly that...

293
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,280
you'll be disqualified if you're late
for more than five minutes.

294
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,360
This is a rule set up
by HR Department of the company.

295
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,960
It isn't personal.

296
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,480
Is it okay now?

297
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,520
How can you...

298
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,600
He's smart.

299
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,280
He can stay calm during a crisis.

300
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,880
Manager Chen,...

301
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,760
let him stay for the interview.

302
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,920
Sure, Chairman Zhou.
You have the final say.

303
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,160
Please have a seat.

304
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,040
Qingyan.

305
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,520
Each of you

306
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,360
is given some basic information
about a project.

307
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,760
I need you to make
a professional evaluation and analysis.

308
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,360
In 15 minutes, each of you
will give a representation.

309
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,880
You can now
go to the room next door to prepare.

310
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,640
We'll call you back later.

311
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,000
Jiang Ze,...

312
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,640
wait a minute.

313
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,720
I'm happy that
you've come to this interview.

314
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,160
Save the pleasantries.

315
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,880
I want to get the job on my merits.

316
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,960
I don't need help from you.

317
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,680
Jiang Ze, back to business then.

318
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,000
You're late today.

319
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,080
Other departmental managers
may have opinions.

320
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,840
We're old friends...

321
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,520
but business is business.

322
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,320
Should you get a job in Shenghai,...

323
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,440
you have to work hard.

324
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,800
Relax.

325
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,200
I love nothing more.

326
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,800
I really had an accident today.

327
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,840
Otherwise, I'd have been
the first one to arrive.

328
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,000
Come on.

329
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,720
When we were in the sports institute,

330
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,320
there was a Fall Sports Day.

331
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,240
You were late and disqualified
for the fencing competition.

332
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,440
Had you won that competition,...

333
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,760
our school would've become the champion.

334
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,800
Stop dwelling in the past.

335
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,120
Look forward to the future.

336
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,240
Okay. I've got to go prepare.

337
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,040
We'll talk later after the interview.

338
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,960
Please have a seat.

339
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,760
Tourism real estate project.

340
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,480
Total investment is 180 million.

341
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,720
Estimated project life cycle
is around three years.

342
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,840
Major marketing risk
is the lack of regional facilities.

343
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,240
The long distance from the airport

344
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,560
will be a deal-breaker for customers.

345
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,520
But it's near the seashore.

346
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,960
We can build a marina

347
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,480
to attract high-end customers
who own a yacht.

348
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,760
Good thinking,...

349
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,600
but this isn't the answer I expect.

350
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,920
What did you say?

351
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,280
I'm hoping you can show some creativity
and thinking outside the box.

352
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,680
Shenghai Group
needs such talents urgently.

353
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,360
Jiang Ze, hold on.

354
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,320
You can ask me a question.

355
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,200
Is the interview question...

356
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,880
a real project of Shenghai?

357
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,480
Yes. With slight modifications.

358
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,840
I've asked my question.

359
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,840
The HR Department
will soon notify you of the result.

360
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,960
Next.

361
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,240
This is the next one.

362
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,760
(Job Application Form for Shenghai Group)

363
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,360
Best of luck.

364
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,800
You too.

365
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,560
Miss Sun Lingxi, you're next.

366
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,080
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

367
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,640
Hello, Chairman Zhou.

368
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,080
Sun Lingxi,...

369
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,360
summa cum laude
at Columbia Business School.

370
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,640
Over five years of upper management
in a multinational corporation.

371
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,080
To be honest,...

372
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,560
your resume is as pretty as your face.

373
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,520
I'm surprised that you'd choose Shenghai.

374
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,160
Pleasantly surprised, actually.

375
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,240
My mom lives in Nanyue.

376
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,360
She wants me to come back.

377
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,720
Shenghai is the best company in Nanyue,

378
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,040
so I've chosen it.

379
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,040
Okay. You may start now.

380
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,440
I wouldn't recommend
commencing this project.

381
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,920
Why not?

382
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,560
Low rate of return

383
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,600
and long profit cycle.

384
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,440
Please elaborate.

385
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,160
The cost for developing hotel
transport and basic facilities

386
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,240
is too high.

387
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,240
The profit cycle is at least five years.

388
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,760
The information doesn't
reveal its location,

389
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,360
but I can tell from some data

390
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,120
it's located
in a high-altitude region in the country.

391
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,520
Let me presume
it's either Tibet or Yunnan.

392
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,040
If it's in remote areas,

393
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,200
poor road transport system
will increase the cost

394
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,880
and the risk of the investment.

395
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,120
As a result,

396
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,240
further analysis is required
for this project.

397
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,640
I see.

398
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,320
Now you can ask me a question.

399
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,040
Can I ask you anything?

400
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,920
Anything except for personal questions.

401
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,840
Don't stress out.

402
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,440
If I were to be stringent,...

403
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,680
I'd have counted what you said
as two questions.

404
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,400
Chairman Zhou,...

405
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,400
imagine that you're alone in a forest.

406
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,280
A hungry and fierce grizzly bear
suddenly appears in front of you.

407
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,280
I want to know

408
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,360
how you'd deal with it
in order to stay alive.

409
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,720
I would probably...

410
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,280
run away.

411
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,840
Usain Bolt's world record for 100 meters

412
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,480
is 37.5 kilometers per hour.

413
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,720
A grizzly bear's top speed
is about 50 kilometers per hour.

414
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,400
Even if you're as fast as Bolt,...

415
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,440
you won't stand a chance.

416
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,400
If I am in a forest,...

417
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,640
I might climb up a tree next to me.

418
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,880
The weight of an adult grizzly bear
is about 500 kilograms.

419
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,520
Its front paws
can easily destroy a fully grown tree.

420
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,240
Can you tell me
the answer to your question?

421
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,440
Chairman Zhou,
it's my turn to ask you a question,

422
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,360
not the other way around.

423
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,800
Next time we meet,

424
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,440
I may tell you the answer.

425
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,280
Okay. I look forward to your answer.

426
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,360
Goodbye, Chairman Zhou.

427
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,560
I believe...

428
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,160
we'll see each other again soon.

429
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,680
Hello?

430
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,480
Where are you?

431
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,920
Excuse me. Hold on a second.

432
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,560
(I'm here. Table number six)

433
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,000
Table number six.

434
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,520
Excuse me. Which one is table number six?

435
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,560
It's over there.

436
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,960
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

437
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,400
Jiang Ze? Why is he here?

438
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,160
Have a seat.

439
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,760
Please.

440
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,960
Long time no see, Xiaomeng.

441
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,400
So you're the car owner!

442
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,240
How's your car? Have you fixed it?

443
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,480
How much is it? I'll pay you back.

444
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,440
You've just arrived.

445
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,680
Don't talk about money.

446
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,080
The steak here is good. Let's have a try.

447
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,280
Waiter.

448
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,320
Sir.

449
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,440
I'm not hungry.

450
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,280
You can buy me lunch...

451
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,240
as an apology.

452
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,760
I'm not asking too much, right?

453
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,360
I'll have a green salad then.

454
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,400
-Yes.
-Thanks.

455
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,840
A medium well steak with foie gras.

456
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,080
Yes.

457
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,520
Xiaomeng,...

458
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,240
you look distracted.

459
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,760
What's the problem?

460
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,800
You can tell me.

461
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,280
In Nanyue,...

462
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,920
there's nothing I can't settle.

463
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,680
Come in.

464
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,320
Chairman Zhou, it's lunchtime.

465
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,400
You haven't eaten anything,...

466
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,120
so I've bought you some food.

467
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,120
-Have you had your lunch?
-I have.

468
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,120
I'm single and my home isn't in the city.

469
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,600
I usually order takeaway
and eat in the office.

470
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,400
-Hello?
-Mr. Zhou.

471
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,520
Ye Sirong's condition isn't good.

472
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,880
I'll be there soon.

473
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,760
Qingyan, I have to go out.

474
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,280
Xiaomeng.

475
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,320
What's the problem? Please tell me.

476
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,640
It's nothing.

477
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,680
Come on.

478
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,120
We're old schoolmates.
We know each other well.

479
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,240
Jiang Ze,...

480
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,560
do you miss the past?

481
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,200
I was happy in the past.

482
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,160
I'm also happy now.

483
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,120
I especially miss our days
at the sports institute.

484
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,000
At that time,...

485
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,200
I just practiced gymnastics...

486
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,000
and had culture lessons every day.

487
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,040
Those were our carefree days.

488
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,120
Back at the institute,...

489
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,240
you were the campus belle...

490
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,560
and I was the school hunk.

491
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,760
As the story goes,...

492
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,760
we should have been
together for some time.

493
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,440
You haven't changed.

494
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,520
Just like the old you.

495
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,840
Jiang Ze, can't you be more serious?

496
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,680
Now that you talk about
life at the institute,...

497
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,240
I do miss it.

498
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,160
Maybe after we've grown up,...

499
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,560
we can't forget
our simplest teenage lives.

500
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,160
Excuse me, Jiang Ze.

501
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,120
I have to go now.

502
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,920
Wait for me.

503
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:14,960
Xiaomeng!

504
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,720
Let me take you home.

505
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,600
No, thanks.

506
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,760
We're old schoolmates.

507
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,040
Do you hate me that much?

508
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,040
No, I don't.

509
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,680
I'm just not in a good mood today,

510
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,840
so I can't be a good company
for your lunch.

511
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,080
I really have to go home now.

512
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:36,920
I'm going now.

513
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,520
Please stay awhile

514
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,600
and listen to me.

515
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,960
My car

516
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,080
is still at the garage, getting fixed.

517
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,640
It'll take two to three days.

518
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,760
You know,...

519
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,560
I need a car to travel around.

520
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,880
But my car is nothing compared to yours.

521
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,000
It's alright. I can use it.

522
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,920
Let me take you home.

523
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,040
I...

524
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,760
Are you afraid that

525
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,120
I'll trade you for money?

526
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,360
You're a grown-up now.

527
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,160
Even if I want to sell you,...

528
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,600
I need to find a buyer first.

529
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,680
Seriously,

530
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,360
can't you say something nice?

531
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,280
Of course I can.

532
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,920
I'll tell you on the way home.

533
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,880
Let's get in the car now.

534
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,440
How is she?

535
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,400
She's not in a critical condition now.

536
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,120
What happened?

537
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,080
We haven't figured it out yet.

538
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,120
The patient's heart
stopped suddenly this afternoon.

539
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,520
Her arterial pressure dropped suddenly.

540
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,520
Luckily, she's been resuscitated in time.

541
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,400
She's fine at the moment.

542
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,680
This condition is normal...

543
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,600
for a patient in a deep coma.

544
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,320
She's very important to me.

545
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,200
Please help her recover
no matter what the cost is.

546
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,000
I'll do my best.

547
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,320
Based on her condition, however,...

548
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,400
she might relapse anytime.

549
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,280
Chairman Zhou,
you've got to prepare for this.

550
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,480
Please keep this...

551
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,480
between you and me for now,...

552
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,720
including Xiaomeng.

553
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,160
Xiaomeng,...

554
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,480
you said you missed your time
at the institute,

555
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,960
but what about your future plan?

556
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,560
In my heart,

557
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,480
I can't let go of rhythmic gymnastics.

558
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,400
But I've retired already.

559
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,520
In my dreams,

560
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,480
I still see myself
defeating my fencing opponents.

561
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,840
However, every time I wake up,

562
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,440
I'm clear that

563
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,920
it was just a dream.

564
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,480
You're right.

565
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,520
Something,...

566
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,880
somebody...

567
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,400
should be let go when the time comes.

568
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,600
After getting my postgraduate degree,...

569
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,640
I'll continue hosting kids' shows.

570
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,360
That's nice.

571
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,080
Gorgeous and glamorous.

572
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,080
I just love hosting kids' shows,

573
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,920
the way I love rhythmic gymnastics.

574
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,720
It's a heartfelt feeling.

575
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,440
It's not what people say

576
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,720
for the glamor of appearing on TV.

577
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,840
Alright. You're right on everything.

578
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,280
If I've got the chance,...

579
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,360
I'd like to open an art space...

580
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,480
for old friends and old teammates

581
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,840
to get together.

582
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,040
It's actually a good idea.

583
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,760
It's trendy to do this now.

584
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,080
It'll get so popular.

585
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,080
Cut it out.

586
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,080
I'm not doing this to get popular.

587
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,360
Okay, I believe you.

588
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,880
How about you, Jiang Ze?

589
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,160
What's your plan for the future?

590
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,480
Me.

591
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,400
I've just applied for a job
in Shenghai Group.

592
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,160
I still don't know if Shenghai Group
would hire me or not.

593
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,240
They'll surely do.

594
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,680
You're President Jiang's son.

595
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,720
Xiaomeng, I'm like you.

596
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,000
I just want to be myself.

597
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,360
Upon my coming back,

598
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,840
Internet Plus

599
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,160
and new energy vehicles
have caught my attention.

600
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,200
I want to give it a try.

601
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,800
That's good.

602
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,040
Let's both work hard.

603
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,360
Yep, work hard.

604
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,080
Xiaomeng,

605
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,600
what are you carrying in your bag?

606
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,720
It looks so bulgy.

607
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,280
I bought these boxing gloves for Yan.

608
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,960
Do they look good?

609
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,440
I don't want Yan
to give up the sport he likes.

610
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,640
You bought these for Yan.

611
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,640
I think...

612
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,800
the red pair looks better.

613
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,960
Don't let Xiaomeng know that...

614
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,680
I've been to the hospital.

615
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,080
Yes.

616
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,560
The feet can tell
if a pair of shoes suits them.

617
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,200
Jiang Ze, thanks for driving me home.

618
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,960
Feel free to use my car.

619
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,920
Xiaomeng, you don't have to.

620
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,320
If I take your car, how do you go to work?

621
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,360
I can call a cab.

622
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,600
That's too much trouble.

623
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,200
Where are you going tomorrow?
I'll drive you.

624
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,960
No. You don't have to.

625
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,040
Xiaomeng,...

626
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,360
have you become Miss No?

627
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,160
What do you mean?

628
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,760
Listen to yourself,

629
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,400
how many no's have you said...

630
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,240
since our lunch?

631
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,920
Is "no" the only word you know?

632
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,760
I'm sorry.

633
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,680
You're sorry again.

634
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,200
Could you please...

635
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,480
stop saying "I'm sorry" from now on?

636
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,840
(Pingwang Third Road,
Number 37 Building 5)

637
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,880
Yan!

638
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,280
Jiang Ze, you're here.

639
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,680
Yes. I told you this morning

640
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,800
my car got bumped.

641
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,280
It turned out to be Xiaomeng who did it.

642
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,320
She's lending me her car for two days.

643
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,400
It's really not your day.

644
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,840
Alright. I'll be going home now.

645
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,040
Hold on.

646
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,600
Come in and have a cup of tea.

647
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,320
We can have a good chat.

648
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,720
Forget about the tea.

649
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,560
How about we do some exercise?

650
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,840
It's been a while.
