1
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,440
(Episode 7)

2
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,040
Yan.

3
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,520
Jiang Ze, you're here.

4
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,840
Yes. I told you this morning

5
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,800
my car got bumped.

6
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,520
It turned out to be Xiaomeng who did it.

7
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,440
She's lending me her car for two days.

8
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,800
It's really not your day.

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,840
All right. I'll be going home now.

10
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,200
Hold on.

11
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,760
Come in and have a cup of tea.

12
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,640
We can have a good chat.

13
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,240
Forget about the tea.

14
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,640
How about we do some exercise?

15
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,920
It's been a while.

16
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,640
Xiaomeng's just bought boxing gloves.

17
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,760
How about we warm up?

18
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,120
How about we forget it?

19
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,560
Jiang Ze wants to warm up.

20
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,400
Don't put yourself between two men.

21
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,040
But boxing is my forte.

22
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,000
Fencing is your forte.

23
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,400
It's okay. Let's do boxing today.

24
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,240
We can go to the Sports Institute
some other day

25
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,400
for a fencing match-up.

26
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,280
Okay, follow me.

27
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,040
(Pingwang Third Road)

28
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,800
Enough. That's it.

29
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,080
I guess you both are tired.

30
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,280
Have some water.

31
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,160
Yan.

32
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,000
Not for me.

33
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,240
Tonight I have an appointment
with someone important.

34
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,480
I shall get going soon.

35
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,840
Yan.

36
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,320
I had fun boxing with you today.

37
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,040
Too bad it was a close match.

38
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,960
You're definitely no match for me
next time.

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,800
Really?

40
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,960
You'd better practice more.

41
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,200
Jiang Ze, let me see you out.

42
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,640
It's all right.

43
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,200
I know my way out.

44
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,760
He has gone now.

45
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,080
Are you not going to say something
for what happened today?

46
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,920
Yan, listen to me.

47
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,600
Today I only went to the shooting
of the public service advertisement.

48
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,000
But when I was reversing my car,

49
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,840
I accidentally bumped into Jiang Ze's car.

50
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,600
Are you explaining to me?

51
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,360
What are you guilty of?

52
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,960
Do you think I care about
who you are dating with?

53
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,760
Who do you think you are?

54
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,840
I'm not dating anyone.

55
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,960
I just don't want you to be angry.

56
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,480
Yan,

57
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,000
it's been a long time
since I last saw my mom.

58
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,840
Please I beg you.

59
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,600
Let me see her for a while.

60
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,480
Just a while.

61
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,280
Save that melodrama to yourself.

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,960
Yan.

63
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,320
I beg you.

64
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,480
You can punish me however you want,

65
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,400
but please don't hurt my mother.

66
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,800
Even if she is actually guilty,

67
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,200
please give her a chance
to atone for her misdeed.

68
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,680
Give me a chance too.

69
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,560
She is my only family left in this world.

70
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,240
If I lose her,

71
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,160
I'll be truly left with nothing, Yan.

72
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,760
Thank you.

73
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,320
Mom.

74
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,960
Mom.

75
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,080
Mom.

76
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,480
Mom.

77
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,520
Mom.

78
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,400
Mom.

79
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,360
No.

80
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,760
Don't go, Mom.

81
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,960
Mom.

82
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,360
Mom.

83
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,840
Single dream.

84
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,080
Keep in touch with, keep in touch with.

85
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,280
(Garfield)

86
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,480
Come on in, quickly.

87
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,280
Where's your mother? Is she asleep?

88
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,320
Why are you here?

89
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,120
Your hair is all wet.

90
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,400
Look at you.

91
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,440
You're already a freshman in the college,

92
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,960
yet your vocabulary is still limited.

93
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
All you know is facial mask.

94
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,760
You're in your junior year,

95
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,320
and you're still a dabbler.

96
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,120
Lower your voice, don't wake my mother up.

97
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,280
Xiaomeng.

98
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,120
Your mother.

99
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,880
-Hide yourself.
-Where should I hide?

100
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,320
There.

101
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,240
Mom.

102
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,680
You are still up?

103
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,440
I've been studying English vocabulary.

104
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,640
I've warmed up some milk for you.

105
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,840
Go to bed after drinking the milk.

106
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,560
I'll leave you then.

107
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Go to bed after finishing it.

108
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,560
Okay.

109
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,840
Come out.

110
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,760
Drink this.

111
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,080
You drink it.

112
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,880
If you don't drink it,

113
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,080
I won't let you go.

114
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,000
We share it then. Lady first.

115
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,200
Okay, you can go home now.

116
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,240
I'm leaving.

117
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,760
Bye.

118
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,600
How dare you

119
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,920
sneak out of the house at midnight,

120
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,760
and climb through the window
into people's home?

121
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,360
If I don't discipline you now,

122
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,880
I might need to pick you up
at Youth Detention Center one day.

123
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,120
I haven't seen you for the whole day.

124
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,360
Where have you been monkeying around?

125
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,840
Monkeying around?

126
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,480
Dad,

127
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,200
don't you remember what day it is today?

128
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,840
I don't care what day it is today.

129
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,080
For climbing through the window

130
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,040
into people's home,

131
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,240
-I'll give you a good whip.
-I went to see Mom at the cemetery.

132
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,680
Today's the anniversary of her death.

133
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,240
I came home late
because I went to see Mom at the cemetery.

134
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,160
Over the years,
have you ever cared for us?

135
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,440
No.

136
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,280
Even after her death,
you've never cared for her.

137
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,400
Just hit me.

138
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,240
Hit me, hit me to death.
Then I can see my mother.

139
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,640
-You thought I didn't dare to hit you?
-Hit me.

140
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,960
I'm going to hit you to death.

141
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,480
Uncle Zhou, open the door, Uncle Zhou.

142
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,080
-Open the door.
-Mr. Zhou.

143
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,600
-You're such a brat.
-Mr. Zhou, please open the door.

144
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,680
-Mr. Zhou.
-Mind your own business.

145
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,040
Xiaomeng and I are in the college now.

146
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,200
Why can't we be together?

147
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,800
What are you saying?

148
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,240
What are you saying?

149
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,320
-Uncle Zhou.
-Xiaomeng, calm down.

150
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,320
-Listen to me. Calm down.
-Mom,

151
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,200
please go inside and calm Uncle Zhou down.

152
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,400
If he keeps hitting,

153
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,800
Yan will be injured.

154
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,200
Xiaomeng, listen to me.

155
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,880
This is actually none of our business.

156
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,200
Mr. Zhou is furious at the moment.

157
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,440
There's not much we can do.

158
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,480
-Xiaomeng.
-I'll kill you.

159
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,560
I'll kill you.

160
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,800
See if I can shut your mouth.

161
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,640
Xiaomeng.

162
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,440
Uncle Zhou.

163
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,360
Please stop hitting Yan.

164
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,800
I'm begging you.

165
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,120
If you keep hitting Yan,

166
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,000
I'll keep standing here.

167
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,760
Uncle Zhou.

168
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,760
Stop hitting Yan.

169
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,200
Xiaomeng, come back, Xiaomeng.

170
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,040
You'll catch a cold in this pouring rain.
Come home now.

171
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,200
-I'm not going.
-Xiaomeng.

172
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,320
Please, I'm begging you.

173
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,680
-Uncle Zhou.
-Xiaomeng.

174
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,200
-Please.
-Let's go.

175
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,320
Stop hitting Yan.

176
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,960
-Xiaomeng. Let's go.
-Uncle Zhou.

177
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,880
-Mom, leave me alone.
-Xiaomeng.

178
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,000
Uncle Zhou.

179
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,240
-Xiaomeng.
-Xiaomeng.

180
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,840
-Yan.
-Xiaomeng, Xiaomeng.

181
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,520
-Go away.
-Yan.

182
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,960
-Let's go home, Xiaomeng.
-Xiaomeng.

183
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
-Let's go home, Xiaomeng.
-Yan.

184
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,960
-Xiaomeng.
-Go home now.

185
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,360
-Xiaomeng, Xiaomeng.
-Yan.

186
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,520
Listen to your mother. Go home now.

187
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,160
-Yeah.
-I promise you.

188
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,600
I'll stop hitting Yan.

189
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,640
Uncle Zhou.

190
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,880
You must promise me.

191
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,120
Okay, I promise you.

192
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,560
-Let's go home, come on.
-Yan.

193
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,400
-Go home.
-Go home.

194
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,360
Go home now.

195
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,120
-Let's go home now.
-Xiaomeng.

196
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,960
Let's go.

197
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,200
Come in.

198
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,480
I just dreamed of my mother.

199
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,040
She was standing on a cliff.

200
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,640
But I couldn't get near her.

201
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,400
I could only helplessly

202
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,680
watch her fall from the cliff.

203
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,040
What are you trying to say?

204
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,600
Are you trying to make me guilty
with a dream?

205
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,320
No, this is not a dream.

206
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,360
I believe my mother is not doing well.

207
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,680
Please, I beg you.

208
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,240
Let me see her.

209
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,800
Zhou Yanzhao.

210
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,160
I said I wanted to see my mother.

211
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,160
When she recovers,

212
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,960
she can definitely tell you the truth.

213
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,280
What happened to Uncle Zhou

214
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,960
surely has nothing to do with my mother.

215
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,240
We can also go back to how we used to be.

216
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,080
I disagree. No way.

217
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,560
Please, I beg you.

218
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,640
Please give me this.

219
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,880
Whatever you say in the future,

220
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,880
I'll do it.

221
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,160
Just let me have a glimpse of her.

222
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,360
Ten minutes.

223
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,720
No, five minutes will do.

224
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,360
That year,

225
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,760
I was standing under this same window,

226
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,640
begging Uncle Zhou not to hit you anymore.

227
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,600
That night,

228
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,800
it was also raining heavily.

229
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,400
I'll do the same today.

230
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,080
I'll stand in the rain

231
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,360
until you nod your head.

232
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,600
You're still so childish.

233
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,000
Why do you keep mentioning about the past?

234
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,440

Yan.

248
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,240
Are you here to plead with me?

249
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,480
If you keep doing this, you'll ruin her.

250
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,560
If she's ruined, so will you.

251
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,600
You don't understand.

252
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,800
I do understand.

253
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,840
The reason I won't allow her see Ye Sirong

254
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,720
is because I've been
to the hospital today,

255
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,640
and the doctor has told me

256
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,920
Ye Sirong has been
in a very unstable condition.

257
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,280
Her life is at risk.

258
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,520
If she goes to see Ye Sirong,

259
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,920
and brings along infectious bacteria,

260
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,240
Ye Sirong might die because of that.

261
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,880
That will definitely be
the end of Xiaomeng.

262
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,560
Now I'm being cold to her.

263
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,640
I decline all her requests.

264
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,080
But I've never ever thought of
ruining her.

265
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,800
She can torture or harm herself.

266
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,960
She will survive these.

267
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,320
But if Ye Sirong is gone,

268
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,520
her last hope will be gone too.

269
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,760
She'll be dead inside.

270
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,560

Can I go and see my mother?

295
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,280
Let's not talk about this now.

296
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,640
Do you really hate me that much?

297
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,760
Is my death the only thing

298
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,640
that can bring you forgiveness?

299
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,280
You're not going to die.

300
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,000
Both of you will be alive and well.

301
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,320
You're right.

302
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,160
Both of us will be alive and well.

303
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,200
Because...

304
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,920
you still want to know about
the truth of your father's death.

305
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,400
Don't you worry.

306
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,800
I'll find out the truth.

307
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,920
Take your medicine.

308
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,840
Can I go and see my mother?

309
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,720
Hi, Chairman Zhou.

310
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,800
Hi, Chairman Zhou.

311
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,680
Morning, Chairman Zhou.

312
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,880
I think you're late.

313
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,760
The HR Manager is having
a regular half-hour meeting this morning,

314
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,600
and I need to see her
for new employee induction.

315
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,760
It's now the right time.

316
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,320
What about you, Chairman Zhou?
Why are you late?

317
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,720
There was a loud thunder last night.

318
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,960
I couldn't sleep well.

319
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,480
I'd have thought
a person like Chairman Zhou

320
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,520
doesn't know how to joke.

321
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,240
Last time you told me

322
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,520
next time we meet, you'd tell me
the answer to that question.

323
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,560
Can you tell me now?

324
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,320
Of course.

325
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,400
If you can't hide yourself
and run away from a bear,

326
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,840
the only solution
is to climb onto its back,

327
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,720
so that it can't hurt you
with its teeth and its claws.

328
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,960
However,

329
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,920
you can tighten your grip on its neck.

330
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,800
This is the only winning move.

331
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,520
Five years ago,

332
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,720
I was asked about this question

333
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,080
during an interview on Wall Street.

334
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,840
My answer then was running away.

335
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,760
Five years have passed,

336
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,320
and I have learnt something.

337
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,440
When you have nowhere to run,

338
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,720
courage

339
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,520
will help you recover from
a seemingly impossible situation.

340
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,600
Then you must get yourself ready.

341
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,000
Because you may encounter a battle

342
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,000
every day in the future.

343
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,240
Don't you worry, Chairman Zhou.

344
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,760
I'm always ready.

345
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,680
Xiaomeng.

346
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,680
Why are you here again?

347
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,280
I've arrived on time, right?

348
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,040
But how did you know I'd be out?

349
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,920
Because I've made a call to your college,

350
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,760
I know about your class schedule.

351
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,720
Xiaomeng,

352
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,440
why are you looking so pale?

353
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,560
Are you sick?

354
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,560
Do you need to go to the hospital?

355
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,120
It's all right. I'm fine.

356
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,400
Okay, get in the car.

357
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,360
Get in the car.
I'll take you to the college.

358
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,200
A good student is never late.

359
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,280
Xiaomeng,

360
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,800
are you sure you don't want to
go to the hospital?

361
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,800
-No need.
-No need.

362
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,880
See.

363
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,400
I knew exactly what you were going to say.

364
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,240
Miss No.

365
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,760
You look sweet when you smile.

366
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,440
What time does your class end?

367
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,960
How about I'll take you home later?

368
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,200
Don't you need to work today?

369
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,720
I took a day off.

370
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,960
I don't need to work today.

371
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,840
I--

372
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,120
Do you think so too?

373
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,920
I've told him several times.

374
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,160
My friends are here.

375
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,080
I'll get going then. Bye.

376
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,640
Xiaomeng.

377
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,320
Yang Xi, Zitong.

378
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,160
Xiaomeng, who is that?

379
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,440
He was my classmate
at the Sports Institute.

380
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,800
Why are you surrounded
mostly by handsome boys?

381
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,400
Is he chasing after you?

382
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,880
No.

383
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,200
We're just classmates.

384
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,160
Xiaomeng.

385
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,720
He seems to have been born
with a silver spoon in his mouth.

386
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,520
If you don't like him,

387
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,280
you can introduce him to us, right?

388
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,280
Forget it.

389
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,800
I don't want to put you in any trouble

390
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,760
with an unreliable person like him.

391
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,320
Let's go.

392
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,800
We're almost late. Let's go.

393
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,800
Hurry up, Zitong.

394
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,840
Sigh, this world is really unfair.

395
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,600
Today I gather all colleagues
from the Department of Project Management

396
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,080
to discuss with you all

397
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,480
the project planning and the direction
of future development for Shenghai Group,

398
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,400
Chairman Zhou, whatever you have in mind,

399
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,840
we'll fully support it.

400
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,080
I have an idea.

401
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,000
I'd like to change the company's focus

402
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,320
from commercial real estate
investment and development

403
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,360
to sports culture industry.

404
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,360
I guess you all may be surprised.

405
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,720
But what I want to say is

406
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,920
this will be the new direction
of development for Shenghai Group.

407
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,720
The whole country has been promoting
national sports.

408
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,200
If we move into sports culture industry,

409
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,800
it'll be a historic step
and a brand new start.

410
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,760
When I was sorting out the data yesterday,

411
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,200
I found

412
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,320
this business proposal
of Balog Zon, Yunnan.

413
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,680
But for the past few months,

414
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,520
this project has been postponed.

415
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,560
I want to know why.

416
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,360
Chairman Zhou, regarding this project,

417
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,280
we've done some market survey.

418
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,560
The tourism in Yunnan has been heated up,

419
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,280
but the market is already saturated,

420
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,480
and the prospect is not promising.

421
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,720
So the project has been postponed.

422
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,760
I think that this project
is distinctive in a way.

423
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,200
Putting aside its market and its future,

424
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,480
I'd like to hear from you.

425
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,720
Its geographical location
is far from ideal,

426
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,520
with high altitude,
and steep rocky terrain.

427
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,040
The prospect of development
is at high risk.

428
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,320
Yeah, it's too difficult to handle.

429
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,840
Yes, it's too risky.

430
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,200
It'll be a waste of money.

431
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,120
Sun Lingxi.

432
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,880
Let me introduce.

433
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,000
Sun Lingxi is a new employee
of the Department of Project Management.

434
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,320
During the final round of the interview,

435
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,520
the question she got

436
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,960
was similar to this project.

437
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,400
Her analysis was very comprehensive.

438
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,880
You can listen to what she says.

439
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,520
Chairman Zhou, I'm a newcomer.

440
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,720
I'm not quite familiar with it yet.

441
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,240
It's probably not a good idea.

442
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,240
There's no veteran
or newcomer at Shenghai.

443
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,160
Everyone has a fair chance.

444
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,480
Fire away, Miss Sun.

445
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,840
I think this project is not mature yet.

446
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,400
It needs further research.

447
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,320
Because the rate of return is low.

448
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,400
the profit cycle is long.

449
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,880
If it's in remote areas,

450
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,240
the cost will be increased
due to undeveloped roads.

451
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,680
so will the risk of investment .

452
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,200
It seems everyone shares similar opinions.

453
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,560
But yesterday I only read
a small part of the document.

454
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,920
After I read the whole document today,

455
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,080
I've changed my mind.

456
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,000
Go on.

457
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,520
Every historical site in Yunnan

458
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,720
has been commercially developed.

459
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,200
I've been to some of them.
They're all the same.

460
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,680
But in other countries

461
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,920
the tourism development
has different themes.

462
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,160
For example,

463
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,920
Fontainebleau in France

464
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,800
has a rich artistic atmosphere.

465
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,080
And Queenstown in the U.S.

466
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,160
is renowned for adventurous activities.

467
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,560
These examples of success
tell us something.

468
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,600
The development of a tourist location

469
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,720
depends on its soul and core.

470
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,000
Balog Zon has geographical advantage

471
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,760
with rich geographical resources.

472
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,560
We can use
the tourism resources as foundation

473
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,840
to build a sports-themed resort village,

474
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,080
integrating the element of sports

475
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,480
with the element of tourism.

476
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,720
This will not only attract tourists,

477
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,000
but at the same time we can also organize
some sports events at the resort,

478
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,440
creating a new concept that
integrates tourism and vacation.

479
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,720
To my knowledge,

480
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,120
there isn't any sports-themed resort
in China yet.

481
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,960
This is a pretty new idea.

482
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,640
I hope this project

483
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,080
can be resumed as soon as possible.

484
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,160
Sun Lingxi,

485
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,360
please prepare a detailed and workable
project proposal as soon as possible,

486
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,640
and submit it to the board of directors.

487
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,760
I hope you can
add some elements of guest houses.

488
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,480
Guest houses?

489
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,480
Yes.

490
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,120
This is my personal idea.

491
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,120
I think combining the idea of
sports-themed resort

492
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,600
with that of guest houses

493
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,720
will result in a greater positive outcome.

494
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,920
Sure, Chairman Zhou.

495
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,520
Chairman Zhou.

496
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,320
Doesn't Jiang Ze
belong to this department too?

497
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,080
Why isn't he here?

498
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,240
He's taken a day off.

499
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,000
Surprise.

500
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,840
Xiaomeng.

501
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,040
Why are you still here?

502
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,160
Well,

503
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,520
am I not doing a good job as a chauffeur?

504
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,120
Even if you don't need to work,

505
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,640
do you have nothing better to do

506
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,120
than to wait for me
at the gate of the college?

507
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,600
It's my pleasure to be at your service.

508
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,400
Jiang Ze.

509
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,280
Why are you following me?

510
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,640
Because...

511
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,600
because your car crashed into mine,

512
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,160
I have to drive your car now.

513
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,520
But I take pity on you,

514
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,880
so I'm following you.

515
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,920
This is my payroll card.

516
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,560
Take it for your car repair.

517
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,640
It should be enough.

518
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,800
My old pal,

519
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,760
this is the second time
you're offering me money.

520
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,240
Are you planning to keep me as your pet?

521
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,120
Jiang Ze.

522
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,000
My life is already in a mess.

523
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,960
If you add more to the mess

524
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,200
I'll collapse.

525
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,600
So I beg you,

526
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,360
leave me alone for some time, okay?

527
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,200
I'm sorry.

528
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,440
Xiaomeng, don't you want your car back?

529
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,840
Xiaomeng.

530
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,640
Just take the car.

531
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,440
You can return it whenever you want.

532
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,680
Zhou Xiaomeng, you've got me.

533
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,680
Ze.

534
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,440
Have you been to the office yet?

535
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,440
No, I had something else to do.

536
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,320
Today was supposed to be
your first day at work.

537
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,080
Where did you go then?

538
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,680
Haven't I told you?

539
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,720
I was tied up.

540
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,480
What is more important
than reporting to work?

541
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,000
I've told you.

542
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,680
This is the best timing
for you to join the company.

543
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,920
I'm the son of Jiang Qingcheng.

544
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,720
You're the vice president
of Shenghai Group.

545
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,080
I thought I could report to work

546
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,480
whenever I want?

547
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,040
Even if I don't go,

548
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,960
nobody will even dare to say anything.

549
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,280
Do you know?

550
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,520
Zhou Yanzhao was hired from outside
as the chairman.

551
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,640
It was all his father's credit.

552
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,320
I want my son

553
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,000
to join the company with dignity.

554
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,920
Dad, what's the point of you saying this?

555
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,480
Zhou Yanzhao is a born businessman,

556
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,760
but this is not what I want.

557
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,840
It's apples and oranges.

558
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,080
You--

559
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,400
Should these words
be coming out of my son's mouth?

560
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,800
Fine, I'll go to work.

561
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,760
But don't include me in on
whatever ideas you have in mind.

562
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,680
I'm totally not interested in your plans.

563
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,680
What about Zhou Xiaomeng?

564
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,880
If you marry Zhou Xiaomeng,

565
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,640
the share she's holding

566
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,320
are enough for us
to match Zhou Yanzhao in strength.

567
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,920
Business deals

568
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,800
have nothing to do with Xiaomeng.

569
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,800
This is for your own good.

570
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,520
What goes on between me and Xiaomeng,

571
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,480
I'll handle it by myself.

572
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,680
I hate it the most
when people tell me what to do.

573
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,840
You-- I--

574
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,320
(I'm waiting for you
at the stadium of the Sports Institute.)

575
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,160
You asked me to come here.

576
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,480
What do you want to tell me?

577
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,080
Yan,

578
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,280
during the days when I fell sick,

579
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,000
you were the one taking care of me,
weren't you?

580
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,800
Did you ask me to come here for this?

581
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,440
Deep down in your heart,

582
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,120
you still care about me, don't you?

583
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,080
This is no longer important.

584
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,920
Do you still remember?

585
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,840
That day we were here.

586
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,400
You held me hand

587
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,840
-and said to me--
-Xiaomeng.

588
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,600
What are you trying to say?

589
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,440
Sorry.

590
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,960
I just don't understand.

591
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,680
Not long ago,

592
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,280
we were so close,

593
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,520
so happy, weren't we?

594
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,520
But why did everything

595
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,560
change overnight?

596
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,640
I don't understand.

597
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,200
Do you still remember?

598
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,600
That day we were here.

599
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,240
You said you'd always be by my side.

600
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,120
You said even if everything changed,

601
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,560
your love for me would never change.

602
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,200
Yan, why?

603
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,080
How could you forget
all our sweet memories so easily?

604
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,760
How can you let go

605
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,800
of everything so easily?

606
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,760
Teach me please, Yan.

607
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,560
I can't do that.

608
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,080
I really can't.

609
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,920
Let the past be the past.

610
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,240
It's better that you let it go.

611
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,720
Yan.

612
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,720
Do you know?

613
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,880
I really wish to install a switch
in my heart.

614
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,680
So that

615
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,080
I can love you when I want to.

616
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,080
And when I don't,

617
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,160
I just can stop loving you.

618
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,880
You used to enjoy
accompanying me for my training.

619
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,000
Do you remember?

620
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,160
You said

621
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,760
you loved watching me
dancing around on the floor.

622
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,880
You said I looked like an elf.

623
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,680
Yan, how about today

624
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,760
you accompany for the training again?

625
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,160
It will be like before,

626
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,440
like what we used to do.

627
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,600
Yan.

628
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,880
Is there...

629
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,600
really no way for us to go back
to that day?

630
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,280
The crime committed can't be changed.

631
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,360
People who died can never return.

632
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,080
Some things are never possible.

633
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,560
If you have that love switch
in your heart,

634
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,480
you can switch it off now.

635
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,200
Yan, I don't want to.

636
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,960
I don't want to.

637
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,280
I don't want to turn off my love for you.

638
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,720
People who died can never return.

639
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,200
If you have that love switch
in your heart,

640
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,320
you can switch it off now.

641
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,200
Yan, I don't want to.

642
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,680
I don't want to turn off my love for you.
