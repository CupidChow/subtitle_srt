00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,440
(Episode 43)

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,680
I believe you have the capability.

3
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,840
Lingxi, as I've said before, you did well.

4
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,480
Your effort will not go unrewarded.

5
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,360
The money in here is enough
to let your sister and her child

6
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,600
migrate overseas.

7
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,680
Let them go abroad,

8
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,920
while you stay and work for me.

9
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,760
I'll also find a way to send him overseas
in a few years' time.

10
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,720
He will be reunited with his family.

11
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,200
Listen, the two of us

12
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,400
are comrades in the same trench.

13
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,960
If I fall, you'll fall.

14
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,440
So, I must escape unscathed.

15
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,920
You have to steer...

16
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,080
my getaway boat.

17
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,920
Why can't I have my own happiness?

18
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,680
President Jiang.

19
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,240
Lingxi.

20
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,560
What happened to you?

21
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,000
You look awful.

22
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,120
Are you sick?

23
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,560
I'm fine.

24
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,640
Why are you here?

25
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,320
I came here to take a breather.

26
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,400
Just now,...

27
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,880
were you with President Jiang?

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,240
I did not see him.

29
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,840
I was making a call up here.

30
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,920
Are you sure you are okay?

31
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,200
Did Jiang Qingcheng say something to you?

32
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,320
Chang Qingyan, I told you
I did not see President Jiang.

33
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,680
Don't bother me again.

34
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,320
Let's go, let's go.

35
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,480
Let's go. Time to get off work.

36
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,080
-Let's go.
-Okay.

37
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,440
Time to get off work. Aren't you leaving?

38
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,680
Qingyan,...

39
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,160
can I buy you dinner as an apology?

40
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,320
I really shouldn't get angry with you.

41
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,440
Are you talking about just now?

42
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,840
It really does not matter.

43
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,080
Think of it as accompanying me to dinner.

44
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,840
Okay. My treat.

45
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,960
Are you working overtime?

46
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,080
You rarely eat out with me.

47
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,480
I can do my work when I come back.

48
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,040
What is this?

49
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,880
Data that I have to give to Chairman Zhou.

50
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,160
They are the receipts
signed by all the directors.

51
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,120
Really?

52
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,080
You should take good care of them.

53
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,360
Of course.

54
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,040
Let me put them away first

55
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,440
before we go out.

56
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,040
-Okay.
-Okay.

57
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,120
Please input password, press...

58
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,160
The safe is unlocked.

59
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,200
Okay, Let's go.

60
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,280
Okay.

A Yan!

66
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,280
-A Yan is back!
-He is back!

67
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,720
Aunt Ye, you are back.

68
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,480
What did you call her?

69
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,040
Mom.

70
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,920
The doctors at the nursing home said
Aunt Ye could be discharged,

71
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,720
and we rushed here immediately

72
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,080
so that she can have a reunion
with you all.

73
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,640
Thank you, Dr. Xiao.

74
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,680
A Yan, why don't I take a look
at the dishes with your mom

75
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,880
while you young people have a chat?

76
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,680
-Let's go.
-Excuse me.

77
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,520
Let's go.

78
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,440
Let's go take a look.

79
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,840
Xiaomeng told me about your wedding.

80
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,240
So, I proposed to Xiaomeng

81
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,160
to hold a simple and small wedding
in the house this evening.

82
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,680
Your marriage is an important event.

83
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,400
You must celebrate it.

84
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,880
A Yan, is my wedding dress pretty?

85
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,960
Mom helped me choose it.

86
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,760
Pretty. You look pretty in any dress.

87
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,280
Our house is also very beautiful today.

88
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,640
Okay. Keep your sweet words for tonight.

89
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,800
I have a gift for you.

90
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,440
I wish you two a happy union,

91
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,720
-Thank you.
-and grow old together.

92
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,200
I hope you two will be like
Dr. Xiao and I,

93
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,400
and live a sweet and happy life.

94
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,480
Only Zhen understands me.

95
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,600
Thank you, Zhen.

96
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,800
Director Lin and Sister Hua
prepared a feast for us.

97
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,680
They're waiting for us.

98
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,760
The food will get cold.
Let's enjoy the wedding feast.

99
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,080
-Let's go, A Yan.
-Let's go.

100
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,680
All of you, come.

101
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,240
-Come and sit down.
-Sit here.

102
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,000
Looks great!

103
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,480
Be careful with your dress.

104
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,000
Here's to the marriage
of Xiaomeng and A Yan.

105
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,280
Cheers!

106
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,320
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

107
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,480
Thank you for helping Xiaomeng
and I celebrate today.

108
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,920
Frankly,

109
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,800
perhaps we could get married today

110
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,240
because of circumstances.

111
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,520
We did it for the Zhou family
and Shenghai's future.

112
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,000
But I want to say this.

113
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,120
I promise you, Xiaomeng,...

114
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,320
after everything is over,...

115
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,120
I will give you a grand wedding.

116
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,400
At that time, you will be
the prettiest bride.

117
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,600
I don't want any wedding ceremony.

118
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,960
I only hope that you will always

119
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,960
be with me in the future.

120
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,680
Fate is so unpredictable.

121
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,920
It brought us together,

122
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,480
and then separated us.

123
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,120
But now,

124
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,320
it is binding us firmly together again.

125
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,680
It gave us a rough emotional path,

126
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,080
but brought us closer because of that.

127
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,880
See how people talk.

128
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,360
You're so dumb.

129
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,360
I...

130
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,920
Qiao Zhen, words do not matter.

131
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,480
What counts is the deed.

132
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,240
From what I know of Dr. Xiao,...

133
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,400
he is a good boy.

134
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,240
Just wait and enjoy your life.

135
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,600
Yes. Dr. Xiao is a good man.

136
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,480
At the nursing home,
he was busy taking care of me.

137
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,840
He did a lot.

138
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,280
In that case,

139
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,200
let me make a toast to Qiao Zhen.

140
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,600
Don't talk like that.

141
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,760
We're friends.

142
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,760
Helping you makes us happy.

143
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,360
-Here!
-Here!

144
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,160
-Here!
-Together!

145
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,200
Mom.

146
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,320
We would like to make a toast to you.

147
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,680
Fate likes to play jokes on people.

148
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,160
You are finally together
after all the difficulties.

149
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,720
May you...

150
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,040
have peace and happiness.

151
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,880
Cheers!

152
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,480
Mom,...

153
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,640
A Yan and I would like to
make a toast to you as well.

154
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,440
Good, good.

155
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,040
A Yan, Xiaomeng,...

156
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,680
I wish you...

157
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,040
a lifetime of happiness together
until you are old.

158
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,840
Yes.

159
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,840
A lifetime of happiness together
until we are old.

160
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,600
Thank you, Mom.

161
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,480
Silly boy. Here.

162
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,640
I have a gift for you.

163
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,400
Xiaomeng,...

164
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,000
this is from Tiankong.

165
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,280
Put it on A Yan quickly,

166
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,560
so that you can keep him on a tight rein.

167
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,360
A Yan, from now on,

168
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,640
you are mine.

169
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,560
You cannot go anywhere.

Thank you.

179
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,480
See what you want to eat.

180
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,360
I would like to drink red wine.

181
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,520
Lately I've been under a lot of pressure.

182
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,320
I want to drink some wine to de-stress.

183
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,480
If that's what you want,
I'll drink with you.

184
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,520
Waiter.

185
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,720
Fate brings us together in our work.

186
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,160
Cheers to you.

187
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,560
Cheers to our rare fate today.

188
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,280
You helped me a lot in my work.

189
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,760
Although I did not say anything,

190
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,000
I remember it in my heart.

191
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,560
I'm really grateful.

192
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,160
Another toast to you!

193
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,280
Lingxi,

194
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,440
I'm a light drinker,

195
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,000
but after hearing what you said
from the bottom of your heart,...

196
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,520
I think I have to drink this glass.

197
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,880
Cheers!

198
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,480
Lingxi, do you know that...

199
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,200
from the time you joined the company,

200
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,760
I've felt that you are

201
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,920
a very hardworking, smart woman?

202
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,520
Especially when you handle customers,...

203
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,720
every twinkle and every smile of yours
is elegant and gentle.

204
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
However,...

205
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,240
I have been keeping this in my heart,...

206
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,000
and didn't dare to tell you.

207
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,200
Today I am very happy
I can get it off my chest.

208
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,400
Qingyan,

209
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,720
don't drink anymore, you'll get drunk.

210
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,840
It's only this much. No problem.

211
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,800
Here.

212
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,280
Cheers!

213
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,840
Eat something.

214
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,160
I am really happy today.

215
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,880
Qingyan.

216
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,880
Qingyan.

217
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,600
Qingyan, are you okay?

218
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
Qingyan. Qingyan, Wake up.

219
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,480
Qingyan.

220
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,680
Keep the change.

221
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,240
Please come again.

222
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,040
The safe is unlocked.

223
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,240
Here!

224
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,720
Come on, continue...

225
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,640
Say...

226
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,600
Lingxi, is this a bit too fast?

227
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,160
Why not we drink a bit slower?

228
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,840
It's not often that
it's only the two of us like tonight.

229
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,560
We will not stop until we are drunk.

230
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,840
What you said really made me very happy.

231
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,600

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,160
I have a very poor memory. what about you?

254
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,240
I can remember.

255
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,480
I did well in math when I was little.

256
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,920
Really?

257
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,760

259
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,440
Of course.

260
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,640
Do you remember
your cell phone PIN number?

261
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,400
Cell phone PIN?

262

It is 833445.

266
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,560
What about the code for the safe?

267
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,040
-For the company's safe.
-The code for the company safe?

268
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,040
It is a secret.

269
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,600
I cannot mention it at will.

270
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,800

for the lot in the tender,...

294
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,400
our base price was leaked.

295
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,120
Do you remember that?

296
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,720
I remember that...

297
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,800
only you and I knew about
our bidding document.

298
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,360
Chairman Zhou, I...

299
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,120
Don't talk.

300
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,720
I never doubted you.

301
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,840
You were at my father's side
from the time he held this position.

302
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,160
How could I doubt your loyalty?

303
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,920
Do you think it is her too?

304
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,040
Chairman Zhou,...

305
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,480
do you also suspect it was Sun Lingxi?

306
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,840
It is just a suspicion.

307
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,280
But why?

308
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,400
The person in charge of Ronghui

309
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,120
was Sun Lingxi's brother-in-law.

310
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,720
Ronghui was running a deficit.

311
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,600
The person who helped make up
for the shortfall...

312
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,680
was Vice President Jiang.

313
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,680
Chairman Zhou, what should we do?

314
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,480
We can't do anything.

315
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,840
We have no evidence.

316
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,600
We will alert him if we make a move.

317
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,840
We can only wait and see.

318
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,400
Qingyan, if something happens,

319
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,960
please tell me at any time.

320
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,160
Yes.

321
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,280
Regrettably,...

322
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,080
she may not be the right one for you.

323
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,880
It has always been my wishful thinking.

324
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,920
Chairman Zhou, don't worry.

325
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,200
I know what is more important.

326
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,680
The safe is unlocked.

327
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,000
Not bad.

328
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,440
Your efficiency
is indeed beyond my expectation.

329
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,000
I've given you what you want.

330
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,240
Can I go free now?

331
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,640
(DK Commercial City Project,
Shenghai Group Co., Ltd.)

332
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,080
(Funding Transfer Agreement)

333
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,600
The two of us cooperated so happily.

334
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,800
We should continue our cooperation.

335
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,080
What do you mean?

336
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,520
You promised me this is the last time.

337
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,040
The day when Shenghai is destroyed,

338
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,000
we will end our cooperation.

339
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,080
You want to destroy Shenghai?

340
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,320
Do you think

341
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,440
I can still take over Shenghai now?

342
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,480
I have thought it through.

343
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,000
I will destroy what I can't have.

344
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,240
No.

345
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,120
I will not participate in your plan.

346
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,440
You will be punished for what you've done.

347
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,440
Do you think you can get away with it?

348
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,840
If I am punished, you will be too.

349
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,480
My advice to you is to obey me.

350
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,280
When Shenghai is destroyed,

351
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,880
you will be free.

352
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,440
I've given you the turnover document.

353
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,600
You can get out unscathed.

354
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,040
Why won't you let go?

355
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,400
Aren't you afraid
of being punished by law?

356
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,920
I can't sleep and I am uneasy everyday.

357
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,680
I beg you to let me go.

358
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,520
I will let you go when the time comes.

359
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,240
Keep your eyes on Zhou Yanzhao.

360
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,560
Report to me immediately
if something happens.

361
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,760
Qingyan,...

362
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,280
why are you here?

363
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,280
Did something happen in the company?

364
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,920
Chairman Zhou,
I have something to report to you.

365
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,760
It is about Sun Lingxi.

366
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,200
Come in first.

367
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,600
What happened?

368
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,760
What did she do again?

369
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,000
You guessed it correctly.

370
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,800
On the night before the bidding,
I was with Sun Lingxi.

371
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,200
She got me drunk and then
stole the code for the safe.

372
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,440
Then she went to my office,

373
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,200
and looked at our base price
for the tender.

374
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,200
Everything matches up.

375
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,880
All your guesses were correct.

376
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,520
In short,...

377
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,480
the person I trusted most in Shenghai...

378
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,000
and who has always stayed by my side
had betrayed me.

379
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,640
At first I thought that with her ability,

380
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,400
she would not resort to such means.

381
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,720
You must also know
some other things about her.

382
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,560
After you reminded me last time,

383
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,960
I've been paying attention.

384
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,880
A few days ago, Sun Lingxi
went to see Vice President Jiang alone.

385
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,520
But when I asked her about this again,...

386
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,760
she was evasive.

387
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,800
Yesterday, after Sun Lingxi
talked to Vice President Jiang,...

388
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,600
she went to the printing room,

389
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,880
and then to the finance office.

390
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,120
I guess she was looking for something
about Vice President Jiang.

391
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,440
I confirmed with the finance office,

392
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,360
and found out that
when you were suspended,

393
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,640
Jiang Qingcheng, as the acting chairman,

394
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,720
approved a sum of money.

395
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,840
So, I faked a fund turnover list,
and put it in the safe.

396
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,760
But I did not expect

397
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,920
Sun Lingxi to steal the list
after she got me drunk.

398
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,040
It was Jiang Qingcheng after all.

399
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,240
How could he resort to such means?

400
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,680
Chairman Zhou, I visit you today

401
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,360
not just to tell you about this,...

402
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,520
but also to tell you what I think.

403
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,040
What do you think?

404
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,640
From what I know about Sun Lingxi,

405
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,480
she is not this kind of person.

406
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,040
She is professionally competent,

407
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,560
and very amicable.

408
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,280
I suspect she was forced.

409
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,960
I know.

410
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,520
This matter caused the company
a huge loss,...

411
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,040
but can we not use legal means
to deal with her first?

412
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,560
If you can talk to her instead,

413
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,640
the outcome may be better.

414
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,160
Maybe, she did it under duress.

415
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,920
You hope...

416
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,400
for me to give her a chance.

417
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,880
This is only my opinion.

418
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,760
A Yan, I think what Qingyan said

419
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,160
is logical.

420
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,600
I've met Ms. Sun many times.

421
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,040
From what I know about her,

422
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,240
she has no intention of hurting you.

423
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,720
Maybe she has some problems.

424
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,480
Qingyan,...

425
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,560
don't worry.

426
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,920
I will ask A Yan to visit Ms. Sun.

427
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,680
Thank you.

428
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,200
President Jiang.

429
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,800
Sun Lingxi, how dare you lie to me?

430
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,240
You gave me a fake list of fund turnover.

431
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,760
What is the meaning of this?
Do you want out?

432
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,280
How could this be?

433
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,280
How could this be?

434
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,920
This is a warning.

435
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,760
Do you have other ideas?

436
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,480
Let me tell you,
if you dare have other ideas,

437
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,880
your brother-in-law
and his family will pay.

438
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,240
I don't know what happened.

439
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,440
Yesterday, I took this
out of Chang Qingyan's safe.

440
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,640
Do you think I will believe you?

441
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,760
I warn you, if you want to keep

442
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,640
you brother-in-law and his family safe,

443
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,280
you must obey me,

444
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,600
and hand the thing over to me,

445
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,320
or you will bear the consequences.

446
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,080
Xuanxuan, help Mommy open the door.

447
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,040
Auntie is here.

448
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,880
Auntie.

449
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,360
Auntie.

450
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,800
Xuanxuan.

451
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,040
Good boy, Xuanxuan.

452
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,960
Where is Mommy?

453
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,240
She is in the kitchen.

454
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,600
She heard you are coming,

455
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,360
and cooked a lot of nice dishes.

456
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,200
Auntie, last time you promised me
that you would buy me a toy.

457
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,360
Did you?

458
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,160
Sorry, Xuanxuan. I forgot.

459
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,160
Next time I come, I will buy it. Okay?

460
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,360
I have been busy lately.

461
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,960
Okay, Auntie. Don't forget next time.

462
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,760
Okay. Go play.

463
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,160
Sis.

464
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,320
What have you been so busy with lately?

465
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,880
I haven't seen you for days.

466
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,480
Nothing much.

467
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,720
Just company business.

468
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,760
You look terrible.

469
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,520
You don't have a fever.

470
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,160
I'm okay, sis.

471
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,920
Xi,...

472
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,520
my family has dragged you down.

473
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,440
Don't say that, sis.

474
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,720
We are family. Don't say that.

475
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,800
You brought me up.

476
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,360
I should do this.

477
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,680
Look at you.

478
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,240
Why do you talk like this
to your own sister?

479
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,280
I think you didn't have enough rest,
and didn't eat well.

480
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,040
Let me give you some nourishing food
today.

481
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,200
Sis,...

482
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,320
I have something to tell you.

483
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,360
I've helped you and Xuanxuan
complete the immigration procedures.

484
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,280
You should go there soon and check out
the house and school.

485
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,440
Why so sudden?

486
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,920
Brother-in-law arranged this.

487
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,520
He asked me not to tell you earlier.

488
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,120
How can I leave him like that?

489
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,400
Sis, don't interfere in his matter.

490
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,560
I've figured out what to do.

491
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,480
If both of you are here,

492
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,440
it is a bit inconvenient for me
to deal with the matter.

493
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,560
Xi, tell me the truth.

494
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,920
Has the matter about your brother-in-law
caused you trouble?

495
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,800
No, sis. Don't ask me again.
Can you listen to me this time?

496
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,560
I'll meet up with you soon.

497
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,440
How long before you can come?

498
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,880
I promise that once I finish my work,

499
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,800
I will go there immediately.

500
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,920
Our family will be reunited very soon.

501
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I will listen to you.

502
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,120
Something urgent from the company.
I'll leave first.

503
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,880
Go ahead and eat. Don't wait for me.

504
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,040
Hello, the number you have dialed...

505
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,680
Hello, the number you have dialed
is not available.

506
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,000
Ms. Sun.

507
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,400
Xiaomeng, why are you here?

508
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,640
Your family member must be living here.

509
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,200
If you are here,...

510
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,080
Chairman Zhou should be here too.

511
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,600
He is in the car.

512
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,760
You are in a much better shape
than before.

513
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,840
I imagine that is the same
with Chairman Zhou.

514
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,680
We are fine,

515
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,320
but you are looking worse.

516
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,760
Whatever it is, don't say it here.

517
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,280
No matter what it is,

518
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,160
I do not want to involve my family member.

519
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,800
Ms. Sun,

520
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,720
I came to see you today.

521
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,000
The police didn't come.

522
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,200
I think

523
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,280
you should understand my intention.

524
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,680
I have a request.

525
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,160
I want to talk to Chairman Zhou
alone first.

526
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,520
Okay.

527
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,320
Chairman Zhou,...

528
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,480
I...

529
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,600
It has been a difficult time for you.

530
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,040
Sorry.

531
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,200
I betrayed you.

532
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,440
But you should know

533
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,400
how much I love you.

534
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,440
I did not want to betray you,...

535
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,200
but I had to.

536
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,880
Do you know that...

537
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,600
when you gradually hurt me
until there was nothing left,

538
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,160
and when I was so broken
I couldn't stand up,...

539
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,600
betrayal didn't make me feel shameful,...

540
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,600
but gave me the pleasure of revenge.

541
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,360
But when I have calmed down,...

542
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,360
and watched you...

543
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,320
suffer and face so much trouble
because of me,...

544
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,520
I blamed myself.

545
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,760
I hate myself.

546
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,400
I should be the one apologizing.

547
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,200
I caused the misunderstanding
and illusion.

548
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,440
This is not about betrayal.

549
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,200
Lingxi.

550
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,640
Okay.

551
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,280
I got my wish.

552
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,320
I said what I wanted to say.

553
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,920
Now I can have a good talk with you all.

554
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,840
Okay. Let's go somewhere else.

555
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,200
What do you want to ask?

556
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,160
Go ahead.

557
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,040
Did you scheme to join Shenghai?

558
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,560
Yes.

559
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,560
Did you lurk by my side to win my trust...

560
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,440
and get the information you want?

561
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,520
Yes.

562
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,120
Thank you.

563
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,720
Thank you for your frankness.

564
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,280
In the last auction,

565
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,960
our base price was leaked.

566
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,280
Consequently,
Shenghai suffered huge losses.

567
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,400
Did you do that?

568
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,480
Yes.

569
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,640
Who told you to do that?

570
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,000
By now, do you still want to cover up?

571
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,840
In fact, Ms. Sun,

572
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,920
someone has been trying to persuade A Yan
to give you a chance.

573
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,880
I think you know who he is.

574
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,280
Chang Qingyan.

575
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,800
He is convinced that

576
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,320
you were forced by someone.

577
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,040
You didn't do it voluntarily.

578
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,880
Sun Lingxi,...

579
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,600
I promise you that

580
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,600
if you identify the person working
behind the scenes,

581
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,360
we will let bygones be bygones.

582
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,240
You can continue to work in Shenghai.

583
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,600
Actually, I know who the person is.

584
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,920
I just want you to confirm it.

585
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,240
Is he Jiang Qingcheng?

586
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,280
I think you have already confirmed it.

587
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,440
Thank you.

588
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,560
When Jiang Qingcheng approached me
initially,

589
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,120
he made me a generous offer,

590
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,160
and got me into Shenghai.

591
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,200
But I did not expect things

592
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,320
to become so serious gradually.

593
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,760
When I realized this,

594
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,080
I wanted to stop,

595
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,720
but he threatened me.

596
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,160
He knows too much about me.
I can't do anything.

597
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,880
When you communicated with him,

598
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,120
he would have left some clues.

599
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,720
In fact, A Yan and I

600
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,760
want you to step forward
and expose his crimes to the police.

601
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,760
He has always been careful
and left no details out.

602
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,440
He contacted me with
a different phone number every time.

603
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,200
He would regularly delete
his short messages.

604
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,760
Basically, there is no information
that you can use.

605
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,880
In this case,

606
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,040
we have to find another breakthrough.

607
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,000
However, before my brother-in-law
was imprisoned,

608
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,200
he told my sister

609
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,440
to hand over a recording to me.

610
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,760
This file contains the evidence of
the bribe given to Jiang Qingcheng.

611
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,320
If you insist on bringing him to trial,

612
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,320
the recording might be helpful.

613
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,960
Ms. Sun, I didn't expect you to have this.

614
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,640
We really need this recording.

615
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,560
I have the file.

616
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,440
I can go back and get it
for you immediately.

617
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,120
But Jiang Qingcheng is sly.

618
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,600
I am afraid I might make him nervous.

619
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,160
Sun Lingxi, I promise you

620
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,360
I will guarantee the safety
of you and your sister's family.

621
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,000
I will hand this matter to Xiao Guang.

622
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,200
Do not worry.

623
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,800
Thank you, Chairman Zhou.

624
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,240
I never expected you to forgive me.

625
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,320
I just hope...

626
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,160
that you understand,
even a bit, that I was coerced.

627
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,440
Ms. Sun, we forgive you,...

628
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,960
but we hope you will forgive yourself too.

629
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:42,960
Also,

630
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,120
Chang Qingyan asked me to tell you that

631
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,200
no matter what you do,

632
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,120
he will wait for you.

633
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:06,320
♪ I know love is not reliable ♪
