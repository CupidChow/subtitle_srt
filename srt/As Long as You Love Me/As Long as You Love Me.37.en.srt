1
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,680
(Episode 37)

2
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,760
Why are you here, Dad?

3
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,440
Why can't I be here?

4
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,120
The problem that Luofeng City

5
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,040
Commercial Integrated
Sports Center project

6
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,480
is facing is getting a lot of attention

7
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,680
from both the public

8
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,120
and within our group.

9
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,400
Everyone's talking about it.

10
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,600
The board is concerned.

11
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,600
As the Group's Vice President,

12
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,400
it is my duty to check on it.

13
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,760
Decades of work in the business world

14
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,840
has earned me experience

15
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,240
and connections.

16
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,720
I might be of help.

17
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,880
I mean...

18
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,000
It's fine.

19
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,400
You are a busy man, Uncle Jiang.

20
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,200
Thanks for attending the meeting.

21
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,960
I hope our crisis management

22
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,160
won't let you down.

23
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,800
Please proceed with your meeting.
I shall listen attentively.

24
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,440
How's the implementation of the solutions

25
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,920
that we discussed previously?

26
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,640
Is there any difficulty?

27
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,360
Chairman Zhou, the PR department

28
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,280
has spoken to

29
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,320
the media.

30
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,120
There will be

31
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,360
no more reports

32
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,440
that exaggerate the safety risk

33
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,800
and potential accidents

34
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,040
of Luofeng City project.

35
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,120
We also asked the media

36
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,200
to convey the message to the public

37
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,000
that Shenghai Group is developing

38
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,360
comprehensive measures

39
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,960
to produce a more professional

40
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,040
and wholesome risk assessment.

41
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,280
We won't push out

42
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,400
a risky project

43
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,600
to the society.

44
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,040
How long will the

45
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,760
risk assessment take?

46
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,320
Well...

47
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,400
We still need time

48
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,720
for the details.

49
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,240
Chairman Zhou.

50
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,320
Risk assessment

51
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,560
is not the problem.

52
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,760
Your attitude and resolution

53
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,120
will solve the problem eventually.

54
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,240
I am concerned about

55
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,720
Lingtian Group's divestment

56
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,280
creating a funding gap.

57
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,600
What are we going to do?

58
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,200
That's true.

59
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,520
We can't start work

60
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,880
without funds.

61
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,560
The funding problem will be solved.

62
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,920
The meeting today

63
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,640
is to make sure

64
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,520
we stick to the original plan.

65
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,000
I shall handle the funding.

66
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,560
I've contacted

67
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,120
a few overseas financing companies.

68
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,160
We will be signing financing agreements
with them soon.

69
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,360
Thus...

70
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,040
Luofeng City
Commercial Integrated Sports Center

71
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,960
second phase will proceed as planned.

72
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,080
Overseas financing?

73
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes.

74
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,720
They are companies I worked with before.

75
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,320
Now that Lingtian has divested,

76
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,600
we restarted

77
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,720
some projects

78
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,880
with those companies.

79
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,240
They are interested.

80
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,200
Boss.

81
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,120
It's about Lin Yueling.

82
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,480
I've discovered something.

83
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,760
Say it.

84
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,280
Lin Yueling

85
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,440
studied in Sydney.

86
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,960
She returned to Nanyue

87
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,560
to live here for some time

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,200
before returning to Sydney again.

89
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,480
The following time she came back,

90
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,640
she became the director
of the Children Welfare Center.

91
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,160
Sydney.

92
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,200
Zhou Yanzhao...

93
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,320
There's more.

94
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,400
I found that

95
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,680
the school expelled her

96
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,920
when she was in Sydney

97
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,600
because she was pregnant.

98
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,720
Was the child born?

99
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,080
Where was it born?

100
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,200
In a maternity hospital in Sydney.

101
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,840
Zhou Yanzhou went to Sydney once.

102
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,960
It might be related to this.

103
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,920
What about his birth date?

104
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,280
It's a match.

105
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,000
The child's birth date
is the same as Zhou Yanzhou's.

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,480
What a coincidence!

107
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,080
What's our next move, boss?

108
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,880
What next move?

109
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,280
Try to prove

110
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,080
their relationship!

111
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,840
I know what to do.

112
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,080
A coincidence?

113
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,360
No way...

114
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,600
No way...

115
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,800
(Nanyue Children Welfare Center)

116
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,800
Careful, careful.

117
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,760
-Don't drop it.
-Ok.

118
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,520
Put it over there.

119
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,360
Do it quickly.

120
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,240
Put it here.

121
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,640
-Okay.
-Thanks.

122
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,520
-Hello.
-Is Director Lin here?

123
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,920
Director Lin...

124
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,440
She is in the office.

125
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,440
Do you have a business with her?

126
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,680
These children's tables and chairs

127
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,680
is a donation

128
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,440
from Shenghai Group's partner, Boloni.

129
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,880
The Shenghai Group

130
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,680
also wishes to donate some computers.

131
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,200
I wish to talk to Director Lin.

132
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,720
Thanks a lot.

133
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,440
Follow me.

134
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,920
-Thanks.
-This way.

135
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,720
Come in.

136
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,520
Director Lin, this is the coordinator

137
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,200
who oversees the donation
from Shenghai Group.

138
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,440
He wants to have a word with you.

139
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,920
-Hello.
-Hello.

140
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,920
I'll handle it.

141
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,560
I shall join the teachers

142
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,560
and workers

143
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,760
to assemble the furniture.

144
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,080
Sure, thank you.

145
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,040
See you.

146
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,920
Sure.

147
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,040
-Hello, Director Lin.
-Hello.

148
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,960
Chairman Zhou

149
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,840
wishes to give you some computers.

150
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,560
He asked me to come over

151
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,360
to check if you have any brand in mind?

152
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,800
We are grateful.

153
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,640
Is Chairman Zhou fine?

154
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,960
He is good.

155
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,000
He is just busy at work.

156
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,960
So he sent me

157
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,160
to send his regards.

158
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,000
Thanks. Send him

159
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,240
mine as well.

160
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,360
I thank him

161
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,200
for his care

162
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,400
for the children amidst his work.

163
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,280
By the way, may I use your computer?

164
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,960
-Well...
-I have some information

165
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,960
to show you.

166
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,440
Okay, please come here.

167
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,600
Over here.

168
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,800
That's a lot of information.

169
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,240
Take a look at this first.

170
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,280
Tell me if you have any question.

171
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,280
Sure. I shall

172
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,240
take a look.

173
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,520
This looks nice.

174
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,080
That's also nice.

175
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,360
I'm done.

176
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,720
Is this your choice?

177
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,920
I think this brand

178
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,400
is easy to use.

179
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,640
It's easier for

180
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,120
the children to learn.

181
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,960
I shall go back and tell Chairman Zhou.

182
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,320
Thanks for the trouble.

183
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,920
I'll be going now.

184
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,640
-Goodbye.
-Sure.

185
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,120
Safe travel.

186
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,720
The Planning Department

187
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,040
has to draw up the financing plan

188
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,960
for the overseas financing companies
quickly.

189
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,680
It should present
the Commercial Integrated Sports Center

190
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,560
in detail.

191
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,000
Moreover...

192
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,920
Chairman Zhou!

193
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,560
We have a problem.

194
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,040
-What's the matter?
-The workers have not been paid

195
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,560
for two months since work halted.

196
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,880
They are protesting.

197
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,960
They are protesting?

198
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,280
What happened?

199
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,720
They heard

200
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,200
there is a problem with our funding.

201
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,560
They thought we

202
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,600
can't pay them.

203
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,760
A few of them

204
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,920
are radical.

205
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,320
They plan to send representatives

206
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,640
here in Nanyue.

207
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,000
Didn't the PR Department
try to pacify them?

208
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,480
Mr. Li is at it.

209
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,800
But it doesn't work.

210
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,520
The funding problem

211
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,840
has lingered for two months.

212
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,840
We haven't solved it.

213
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,720
We should prioritize

214
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,120
fundraising.

215
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,320
Director Xu.

216
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,880
Has your department
come up with a loan plan?

217
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,880
The finance department has worked hard

218
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,720
to formulate a loan plan.

219
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,120
But the funding gap

220
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,280
is too huge.

221
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,480
The loan amount required

222
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,400
is very high.

223
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,640
Our project

224
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,680
generates low cash flow.

225
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,640
Banks probably wouldn't give us loans.

226
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,240
We can do asset mortgage.

227
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,840
Don't they trust our

228
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,360
goodwill?

229
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,400
I've contacted two

230
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,840
of my most reliable bank associates.

231
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,960
They said it's too risky

232
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,120
and they aren't able to help.

233
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,480
It's fine.

234
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,960
We'll find a way.

235
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,800
That's it for today.

236
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,920
Get back to work.

237
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,840
Guess who I am?

238
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,240
Those hands...

239
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,600
belong to a capable woman.

240
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,560
So who am I?

241
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,840
OK, Qiao Zhen.

242
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,600
Stop playing.

243
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,080
You know it's me?

244
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,480
Did you smell it?

245
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,640
So doctors have good noses?

246
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,800
Have you been busy?

247
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,720
We haven't met for some time.

248
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,080
There were lots of patients.

249
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,720
There was no time to rest.

250
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,120
It must be hard on you.

251
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,400
Do I look nice?

252
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,320
Beautiful.

253
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,200
Which part?

254
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,920
Every part.

255
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,960
Especially the necklace.

256
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,480
It's exquisite.

257
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,680
You sure have taste.

258
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,760
I spent a day

259
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,880
looking for it.

260
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,640
Is it really nice?

261
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,680
Everything looks good on you.

262
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,960
What drink do you want?

263
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,560
Strawberry smoothie.

264
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:56,960
Waiter.

265
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,600
May I have your order?

266
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,520
A strawberry smoothie

267
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,680
and a mango smoothie.

268
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,920
Sure.

269
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,960
Last night

270
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,720
I dreamt of you.

271
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,520
What was I doing?

272
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,360
I dreamt that

273
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,880
we were travelling in Thailand.

274
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,680
We walked past a huge river.

275
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,360
You provoked a crocodile

276
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,280
and it ate you up.

277
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,680
I was worried.

278
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,040
You would be featured on news headlines

279
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,680
if you really get eaten up by a crocodile.

280
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,000
Thus I must meet up with you

281
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,800
and remind you

282
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,080
not to

283
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,320
provoke crocodiles.

284
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,520
Do you always have weird dreams?

285
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,720
I missed you.

286
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,040
I dreamt of you because I missed you.

287
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,000
Hello, here's your smoothies.

288
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,240
Thanks.

289
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,080
Thank you.

290
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,520
Please enjoy.

291
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,760
It's delicious.

292
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,280
I remember the last time

293
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,040
I came here, I was with Xiaomeng.

294
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,080
Speaking of her...

295
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,800
I haven't seen her for days.

296
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,960
I haven't see her for some time as well.

297
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,680
I wonder

298
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,280
how she is doing.

299
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,840
Since this is your treat,

300
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,560
I shall take you

301
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,280
to a KTV later.

302
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,280
Sure.

303
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,000
I will go wherever

304
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,120
you want to go.

305
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,080
By the way...

306
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,840
-There is a great song...
-I...

307
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,000
Hello?

308
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,040
I'm not in the hospital.

309
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,960
Okay, I'll go back.

310
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,240
What's wrong?

311
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,240
A patient got worse.

312
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,520
I have to go back now.

313
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,600
I'm sorry.

314
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,600
I can't go to a KTV with you.

315
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,320
I will make up for it.

316
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,360
Go quickly.

317
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,560
Okay.

318
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,400
He's so busy...

319
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,840
there's not even time for a meal.

320
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,560
I haven't seen you for a long time.

321
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,520
Let's have a nice meal.

322
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,600
Sure.

323
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,920
How about hot pot?

324
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,520
Sure, as long as you like it.

325
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,840
Director Lin.

326
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,320
Qiao Zhen.

327
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,000
Come sit here.

328
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,360
Why are you here?

329
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,560
I had tea

330
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,600
with a friend nearby.

331
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,200
He always helps

332
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,320
the Welfare Center.

333
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,880
There are always

334
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,240
donations at the end of the year,
be it in cash or in kind.

335
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,640
While having tea,

336
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,560
he received a call from home and left.

337
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,120
I took a stroll

338
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,560
after that.

339
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,840
I'm getting old.

340
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,480
I can't walk much.

341
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,720
My back aches.

342
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,680
I was taking a break when I saw you.

343
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,640
Are you alone?

344
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,840
Are you here for work?

345
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,320
I'm not here for work.

346
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,080
Have you had dinner, Director Lin?

347
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,760
Let me treat you to a meal.

348
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,840
No thanks.

349
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,120
I had some snacks

350
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,200
when I had tea.

351
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,760
I'm still full.

352
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,040
I want to ask

353
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,480
if you have met Xiaomeng lately.

354
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,120
She hasn't visited

355
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,080
the welfare center for a while.

356
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,160
The kids,

357
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,520
especially Tiankong, keep asking

358
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,760
when she will go

359
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,160
to play with them.

360
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,280
What can I do?

361
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,600
I'm busy these days

362
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,240
and I didn't call her.

363
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,400
Don't worry.

364
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,240
I will call Xiaomeng

365
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,680
and tell her to visit you.

366
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,760
Oh don't.

367
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,240
Maybe she is busy.

368
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,480
We shall meet

369
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,120
when she's free.

370
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,480
I shall pay you and the kids

371
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,840
a visit with my friend.

372
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,320
I am grateful.

373
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,200
I'm so lucky

374
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,360
to meet

375
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,160
loving people like you.

376
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,440
You helped the welfare center a lot.

377
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,280
You know that

378
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,760
Do you know A Yan gave us lots

379
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,040
of chairs and tables recently?

380
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,880
He also said he would

381
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,920
give us some computers.

382
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,920
The kids

383
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,200
were rejoiced.

384
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,800
Zhou Yanzhao is the chairman of Shenghai.

385
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,440
He is also a man

386
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,680
who loves charity.

387
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,040
Indeed.

388
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,960
I can see that

389
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,880
A Yan, Xiaomeng,

390
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,840
Dr. Xiao and you

391
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,560
are all kind-hearted people.

392
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,720
Thanks for your compliment, Director Lin.

393
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,360
Let me guess

394
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,800
who you are waiting for.

395
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,880
Is it Dr. Xiao?

396
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,880
I won't bother you.

397
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,880
I shall go.

398
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,760
Remember.

399
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,640
You must invite

400
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,960
me to your wedding with Dr. Xiao.

401
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,920
Director Lin, Dr. Xiao and I

402
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,760
are not at that stage yet.

403
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,520
What are you talking about?

404
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,880
I think you two

405
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,800
are made for each other.

406
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,760
So befitting.

407
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,440
Okay, I shall go.

408
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,520
Please drop by.

409
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,280
Good bye, Director Lin.

410
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,640
I think we are a good match.

411
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,600
Chairman Zhou.

412
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,760
Is it ready?

413
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,280
This way.

414
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,720
The directors are here.

415
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,720
Only Chairman Deng from Qida Corporation

416
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,040
can't make it.

417
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,240
His secretary said he

418
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,360
would treat you dinner

419
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,280
as an apology.

420
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,880
I don't need that.

421
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,200
I don't like

422
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,480
business dinners like this.

423
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,920
Chairman Zhou.

424
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,880
You may need to drink a lot of wine.

425
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,040
Drink this yogurt first.

426
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,080
It's calming.

427
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,440
Thank you.

428
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,800
Let's feast.

429
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,840
Eat and drink at will.

430
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,800
-He will pay for it.
-Sure.

431
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,760
Come on.

432
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,280
Come on, eat.

433
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,840
The wine is fine.

434
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,840
Such fine wine.

435
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,040
Enjoy the meal.

436
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,720
-Good wine.
-Indeed.

437
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,160
You ordered it?

438
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,680
The food is good.

439
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,120
Chairman Zhou.

440
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,280
You are late.

441
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,280
Come here.

442
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,360
Take a seat.

443
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,520
Please sit.

444
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,560
I had urgent matters

445
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,680
to attend to.

446
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,760
I'm late.

447
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,800
Sorry.

448
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,840
It's fine.

449
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,320
We are sorry.

450
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,920
We started eating before you come.

451
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,920
-Come on.
-Don't stand on ceremony.

452
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,480
I shall drink three glasses of wine
for being late.

453
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,560
There's no need.

454
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,160
What a great alcohol tolerance!

455
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,000
You lead

456
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,760
a multi-billion dollar company with ease.

457
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,600
I'm not your match.

458
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,520
I need to work hard.

459
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,840
You are modest.

460
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,640
We are all friends.

461
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,480
I shall go straight to the point.

462
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,400
Thank you

463
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,160
for all the help
you've been giving Shenghai

464
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,520
and the care

465
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,840
and guidance that you've been giving me.

466
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,240
I hope you can enjoy yourselves tonight.

467
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,600
-Sure.
-Sure.

468
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,960
Come on.

469
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,240
Cheers.

470
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,960
Chairman Zhou.

471
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,080
We are all friends

472
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,320
and partners.

473
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,720
Everyone here

474
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,120
has received help from Shenghai.

475
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,960
That's true.

476
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,000
Chairman Zhou is a straightforward man.

477
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,600
I won't beat around the bush.

478
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,080
You didn't invite us to dinner

479
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,680
just for a gathering, am I right?

480
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,600
Honestly,

481
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,360
there's something

482
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,200
I need help with.

483
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,080
Are you are trying to raise funds for

484
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,320
your Commercial Integrated Sports Center?

485
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,240
Director Liu is well-informed.

486
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,800
Don't praise me.

487
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,840
I'm not that well-informed.

488
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,120
I'm just straightforward.

489
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,080
I guess everyone here

490
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,440
clearly knows

491
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,320
why you've invited us.

492
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,040
My company

493
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,360
got help from Shenghai before.

494
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,000
But we've also given

495
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
Shenghai business benefits.

496
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,400
We will help you

497
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,680
if we can.

498
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,240
But we're all suffering

499
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,680
from the economic downturn.

500
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,360
It's hard to do business.

501
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,200
There's no surplus funds

502
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,680
to help Shenghai.

503
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,600
-Yes.
-Indeed.

504
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,920
Director Liu is more than straightforward.

505
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,560
You are saying

506
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,080
as if Shenghai

507
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,040
is begging for money.

508
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,840
We are just having

509
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,760
a little problem with project funds.

510
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,600
We need financing from you.

511
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,280
Once we generate new cash flows,

512
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,080
we can all make a profit.

513
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,080
Director Liu

514
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,680
is too straightforward.

515
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,920
Don't take it to heart.

516
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,440
I've also heard that

517
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,520
your project

518
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,880
is facing difficulties.

519
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,640
Like what Director Liu said,

520
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,880
I would have helped

521
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,080
before you ask for it

522
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,600
if I could.

523
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,080
But I really can't

524
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,080
help you know.

525
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,000
-Yes.
-It's the same for us.

526
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,520
Indeed.

527
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,400
Since all of you have your difficulties,

528
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,440
I shall not make things
any more difficult for you.

529
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,200
The fact that Shenghai can grow

530
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,960
this large from a small company

531
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,720
is because we have
a good investment sense.

532
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,760
If you are interested,

533
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,600
you can come visit our office.

534
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,400
Our project department

535
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,560
will introduce the project

536
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,320
of the Commercial Integrated
Sports Center to you.

537
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,160
Sure.

538
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,560
I will be there.

539
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,520
I will be there if I have time.

540
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,840
I shall pay a visit when I'm free.

541
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,920
Please dig in.

542
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,080
Sure.

543
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,320
Director Xu!

544
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,320
Let's drink.

545
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,160
Water.

546
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,600
What?

547
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,920
I want water.

548
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
Here's water.

549
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,200
I want to drink water.

550
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,840
Xiaomeng.

551
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,520
Don't go, Xiaomeng.

552
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,560
Sister Hua.

553
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,720
How long have you been cooking?

554
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,560
Why isn't it done yet?

555
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,920
This brain-nourishing recipe

556
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,160
that you've got for your mom

557
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,720
needs to boil for two hours.

558
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,920
It's still early.

559
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,000
I told you to let me handle it

560
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,280
but you wouldn't.

561
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,240
Look how tired you are. It's still early,

562
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,360
go back to sleep.

563
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,160
No way.

564
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,480
I should be the one who cooks this

565
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,240
for my mom.

566
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,440
You didn't let me do it.

567
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,200
I can only sit and wait.

568
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,000
I'm just bored

569
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,040
and feel sleepy.

570
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,320
I didn't know that

571
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,320
you woke up at five

572
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,560
to make this

573
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,240
for your mother.

574
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,080
Look at yourself.

575
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,000
You might burn

576
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,160
the kitchen down

577
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,280
if I let you do the cooking.

578
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,040
This medicine

579
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,480
has to be taken

580
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,680
before breakfast.

581
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,600
I doubt if it works.

582
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,960
Now, I have to wake up early
every morning.

583
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,760
Sister Hua, you are the best.

584
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,720
Why not we do this?
You help me make this medicine

585
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,920
and I'll cook you breakfast.

586
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,360
No need.

587
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,960
A Yan should

588
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,120
wake up soon.

589
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,080
He didn't come back yesterday.

590
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,320
Where did he go?

591
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,040
I don't know.

592
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,000
I checked his room last night

593
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,120
because I was worried.

594
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,720
Did he call home

595
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,120
last night?

596
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,480
He didn't.

597
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,520
It isn't right of him to do that.

598
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,640
He should've told us

599
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,560
if he wasn't coming back.

600
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,800
I must give him a tongue-lashing on that.

601
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,680
A Yan.

602
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,560
Xiaomeng.

603
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,280
A Yan was drunk last night.

604
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,800
He is with me now.

605
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,280
Can I speak with him?

606
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,680
How about

607
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,760
I ask him

608
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,640
to call you when he wakes up?

609
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,560
You are awake.

610
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,200
The breakfast that I ordered just came.

611
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,080
It's the right time.

612
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,120
Take a seat.

613
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,080
Lingxi...

614
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,520
Eat now.

615
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,800
You have two crucial meetings.

616
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,080
You can't be late.

617
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,840
I'm sorry.

618
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,160
I used up the hot water.

619
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,360
You may need to wait.

620
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,000
It's fine. I'll wait.

621
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,120
I'll just take a break.

622
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,520
You seem busy.

623
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,040
Yes, I'm tired.

624
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,320
I always work overtime.

625
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,880
The company

626
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,640
is having a hard time.

627
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,960
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

628
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,400
It's fine.

629
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,040
I just noticed that your skin

630
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,240
looks so good.

631
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,080
Staying up late don't seem to bother you.

632
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,160
Unlike me.

633
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,280
I look terrible after

634
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,680
staying late with the boss.

635
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,280
The boss? Chairman Zhou?

636
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:26,920
Of course.

637
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,920
Who else?

638
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,440
I got to go. See you.

639
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,440
Sure.

640
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,440
Hello. Qiao Zhen.

641
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,760
If I remember correctly,

642
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,640
you don't have to go to the station today.

643
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,840
Tell you what.

644
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,080
I swapped duty today.

645
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,640
Let's go sing karaoke.

646
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,120
I'll send you

647
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,200
the room number once I'm there.

648
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,120
Sure.

649
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,480
(Makeup Room A)

650
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,360
Not too much makeup.

651
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,720
Make it lighter.

652
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,320
Do you doubt my skill?

653
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,600
I promise

654
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,640
your makeup

655
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,040
will take

656
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,400
your boyfriend's breath away.

657
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,920
You will steal his soul.

658
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,080
Really?

659
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,720
I have a question.

660
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,720
Do you think
men pay more attention on a woman's

661
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,760
look or virtue?

662
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,360
Well, I think...

663
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,320
Most men focus on

664
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,560
women's looks.

665
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,640
Only a few value

666
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,760
women's virtues.

667
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,000
When you polish my nails,

668
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,400
don't use bright red.

669
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,040
But you like

670
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,000
bright red.

671
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,000
Dr. Xiao sees too much
blood in the hospital.

672
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,080
If he sees that

673
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,200
my nails

674
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,840
are red like blood,

675
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,320
he might collapse.

676
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,320
You tough girl has never been

677
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,040
so thoughtful for someone.

678
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,280
He's such a lucky guy.

679
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,920
Let's finish my makeup.

680
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,000
Okay, no bright red.

681
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,720
Listen up.

682
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,640
We have to make more noise

683
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,520
or they won't pay. Is that clear?

684
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,520
Sure. They owed us

685
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,440
for two months.

686
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,360
We must get it.

687
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,320
-Right.
-Sure.

688
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,560
We have to get it back.

689
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,280
Look.

690
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,080
It's really them.

691
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,080
I didn't know that before.

692
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,320
What brings you here, Ms. Zhou?

693
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,600
Is Chairman Zhou here?

694
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,880
He's in the office.

695
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,960
I'll tell Chairman Zhou now.

696
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:23,960
Hold on.

697
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,360
Bad news, Chairman Zhou.

698
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,560
The workers are

699
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,160
protesting at the doorstep.

700
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,000
So that's what she is.

701
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,560
I didn't figure it out.

702
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,520
Seriously.

703
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,400
She's got skills.

704
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,360
Do we have

705
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,960
-to call her lady-boss?
-No way.

706
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,520
She's taken

707
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,240
our handsome chairman.

708
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,840
She's shrewd.

709
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,120
Why are you here, Xiaomeng?

710
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,720
Is that real?

711
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,960
Say something.

712
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,400
I can't...

713
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,760
When did that happen?

714
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,400
Xiaomeng, this is the office.

715
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,680
Let's not talk about it here.

716
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,160
It has nothing to do with you.

717
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,560
I shouldn't be here.

718
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,480
A Yan...

719
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,160
Xiaomeng!

00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:07,920

721

Congratulations.

729
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,600
You are our lucky guests.

730
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,240
Here's a bucket of popcorn.

731
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,360
Hope you like it.

732
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,720
Thank you.

733
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,720
Xiao Sizhi.

734
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,360
Are you trying to take advantage of me?

735
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,160
I...

736
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,480
Don't say it.

737
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,080
You can really sing.

738
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,800
You can sing his song.

739
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,400
He's my idol.

740
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,040
When I was in the college,

741
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,680
I formed a band.

742
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,040
My band mostly played

743
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,080
his songs.

744
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,520
Really?

745
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,680
You had a band.

746
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,880
Don't lie to me.

747
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,440
I'll get Xiaomeng and my friends

748
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,800
to hear you sing.

749
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,960
Encore. What do you what to sing?

750
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,840
Another call.

751
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,000
What?

752
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,320
Okay, I'll be there.

753
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,560
You're leaving again?

754
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,440
Jiang Ze and Xiaomeng had an accident.

755
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,000
How did that happen?

756
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,040
Is it serious?

757
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,080
I don't know.

758
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,480
Jiang Ze seems to be
in a serious condition.

759
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,160
Xiaomeng seems fine.

760
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,640
I'll go with you.

761
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,120
I'll go back first.

762
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,000
Go now.

763
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,360
Chairman Zhou, about the photo...

764
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,840
I don't know how others saw it.

765
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,200
And it was shared quickly.

766
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,200
Someone took a photo of my phone.

767
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,880
What happened last night?

768
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,520
Nothing happened.

769
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,960
I just took a picture.

770
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,760
I would never send it out.

771
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,040
Chairman Zhou.

772
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,080
You know I love you.

773
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,680
-I...
-Lingxi.

774
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,800
Stop it.

775
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,600
I'll delete the photo on my phone
and in the office.

776
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,040
I'll stop the staff from talking

777
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,720
and halt the damage.

778
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:11,920
Chairman Zhou.

779
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,600
You didn't explain it to Xiaomeng.

780
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,160
Will she think
there's something between us?

781
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,440
I won't blame you for the photo.

782
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,480
You don't have to worry about Xiaomeng.

783
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,760
That's my problem.

784
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,040
I'll handle it.

785
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,520
What's important now is to focus

786
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,680
on dealing with the sports center problem.

787
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,280
I hope you can do your job well.

788
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,200
Ignore everything else.

789
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,520
I get it.

790
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,640
Chairman Zhou.

791
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,080
A bunch of men came

792
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,520
and fought the protesters.

793
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,600
What?

794
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,320
Jiang Ze and Xiaomeng
have been taken to hospital.

795
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,240
Do you know

796
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,320
what the consequence is?

797
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,120
It isn't as simple as you think.

798
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,840
Xiaomeng. Sun Lingxi and I...

799
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,200
How dare you mention
Sun Lingxi to Xiaomeng.
