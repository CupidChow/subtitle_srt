00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,520
(Episode 38)

2
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,080
Xiaomeng, Sun Lingxi and I...

3
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,360
Why aren't you ashamed of mentioning
Sun Lingxi in front of Xiaomeng?

4
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Xiaomeng, are you okay?

5
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,080
Leave me alone.

6
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,800
You'd better find Miss Sun.

7
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,400
She is right.

8
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,240
If it hadn't been for Jiang Ze,

9
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,720
I'm afraid that the one on the sickbed
would have been me.

10
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,880
Xiaomeng, let's talk outside.

11
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,720
Are you trying to hide something?

12
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,720
Zhou Yanzhao, are you serious?

13
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,000
You flirted with Sun Lingxi
behind Xiaomeng?

14
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,040
What on earth is going on?

15
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,920
Jiang Ze,

16
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,600
stop talking nonsense
if you don't know anything.

17
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,360
Xiaomeng...

18
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,200
I...

19
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,680
She doesn't want to talk to you.

20
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,800
Leave her alone.

21
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,360
You...

22
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,680
Boss.

23
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,320
Is everything taken care of?

24
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,080
We have taken care of the workers,

25
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,680
-but...
-But what?

26
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,200
Your son were at the scene.

27
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,440
What?

28
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,600
What happened to him?

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,800
He...

30
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,760
He was accidentally hurt
and taken to the hospital.

31
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,240
It's a serious injury.

32
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,320
This fool.

33
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,720
Xiaomeng,

34
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,680
please listen to my explanation.

35
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,520
I don't want to listen.

36
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,960
Stay away from me.

37
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,480
Xiaomeng,

38
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,360
don't you know what kind of person I am?

39
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,520
Sister Hua.

40
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,080
What happened to Aunt Ye?

41
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,160
What?

42
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,840
All right, I'll come back right away.

43
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,400
What happened to my mom?

44
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,080
She's not feeling very well.

45
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,040
Did you give her the wrong medicine?

46
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,000
I've found a folk prescription
for nourishing the brain.

47
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,360
It shouldn't have caused any problems.

48
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,880
Sister Hua has called an ambulance.

49
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,640
We should go back now.

50
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,600
Where is he? Go find out.

51
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,880
It seems that the nurse has sent him
to the x-ray room for examination.

52
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,440
Let's go.

53
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,240
A Ze, are you okay?

54
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,400
Why are you here?

55
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,960
You got hurt, so I come to see you.

56
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,280
How serious is your injury?

57
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,840
I'm fine,

58
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,280
except that my leg is broken.

59
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,080
Boss...

60
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,000
My brother has been beaten badly.

61
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,920
I want justice.

62
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,040
You should pay for the medication.

63
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,880
Shut up.

64
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,760
What are you doing?

65
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,720
Go away...

66
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,280
-What's the matter with you?
-All right, I get it.

67
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,840
You arranged all of this.

68
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,280
It must have been difficult for you

69
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,840
to come here and pretend
to be a good person.

70
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,360
My injury is part of your plan, isn't it?

71
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,680
Nonsense.

72
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,080
Jiang Ze, you are my son.

73
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,120
How can I bear to see you suffer?

74
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,480
You don't harm me
but you can harm the others?

75
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,320
Those workers who protest out there

76
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,560
deserve to be beaten, don't they?

77
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,760
I'm telling you

78
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,360
I've done this to get Zhou Yanzhao

79
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,600
expelled from Shenghai
as soon as possible.

80
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,000
These are all necessary actions,
understood?

81
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,280
Those workers won't sacrifice for nothing.

82
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,040
I'll compensate them.

83
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,120
Look at how severely
you hurt those people.

84
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,720
Do you really think you can just pretend
nothing happened, after they get better?

85
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,280
The business world is
no different from the battlefield.

86
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,200
This is necessary sacrifice.

87
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,920
You think it's fine
to just compensate people.

88
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,120
You make people sacrifice
without a second thought.

89
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,040
What do you think of these people?

90
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,160
Dad,

91
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,120
I really can't accept the way
you handle things.

92
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,840
If I want something,

93
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,680
I'll strive to do my best
and fight for it.

94
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,920
And I will receive recognition from others

95
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,280
without making people sacrifice for me.

96
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,560
All right...

97
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,000
you will understand sooner or later.

98
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,800
I need further examination

99
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,120
and don't bother to come see me again.

100
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,520
Nurse.

101
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,400
Idiots.

102
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,560
Doctor, how is my mom?

103
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,480
She should be fine.

104
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,840
She is now in stable condition,

105
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,920
but she still has some headache.

106
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,200
I'll arrange

107
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,080
an MRI scan for her within two days.

108
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,640
If the result shows nothing wrong

109
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,680
she will be discharged.

110
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,760
It's not good for her

111
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,320
to keep staying at home.

112
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,480
I suggest she rehabilitate
in a nursing home.

113
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,000
Okay. I understand.

114
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,920
Thank you, doctor.

115
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,800
You know, I need to warn you

116
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,080
you should never give her
any strange medications

117
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,320
and those folk prescriptions.

118
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,400
We provide treatment based on science.

119
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,920
Sorry, doctor.

120
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,080
I'll never do that again.

121
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,560
Why do you two come back?

122
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,120
It is my mom.

123
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,520
Right,

124
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,960
I already know

125
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,440
who sent those thugs.

126
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,520
What?

127
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,200
Who sent them?

128
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,400
I'll only tell Xiaomeng.

129
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,360
Jiang Ze, this is related to work.

130
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,120
Okay.

131
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,520
My dad did this.

132
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,280
I've never thought

133
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,720
that the one who caused me to break my leg

134
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,440
was actually my dad.

135
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,760
What a joke.

136
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,560
Anyway, you were trying to save Xiaomeng.

137
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,040
Thank you.

138
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,040
Save it.

139
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,320
After all,...

140
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,120
I was willing to do this.

141
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,200
I don't need you to thank me.

142
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,200
Whatever you say,

143
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,920
I still have to thank you, Jiang Ze.

144
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,320
Doctor said

145
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,440
it's better for Aunt Ye
to rehabilitate in a nursing home.

146
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,560
You should stay there as well.

147
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,640
Me?

148
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,480
Yes.

149
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,440
No one will take care of you here anyway.

150
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,720
Fine.

151
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,600
I don't really want to
see my father for a while anyway.

152
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,800
It's settled then.

153
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,920
I'll make the arrangement.

154
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,080
Let me make it clear.

155
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,800
I go there because I don't want
Xiaomeng to worry about me.

156
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,040
It has nothing to do with you.

157
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,560
Boss,

158
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,920
this is the DNA maternity test report
of Lin Yueling and Zhou Yanzhao.

159
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,520
(Legal DNA Testing Agency)

160
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,920
Xiaoyu can leave the Zhou family now.

161
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,160
She is no longer needed there.

162
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,640
Yes, boss.

163
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,800
Hello.

164
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,480
What have you just sent me?

165
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,760
That is the DNA maternity test report
of Lin Yueling and Zhou Yanzhao.

166
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,400
How could it be possible?

167
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,920
Did you forge it?

168
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,160
It just happens

169
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,880
however impossible it seems.

170
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,280
It's science, a fact

171
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,920
and evidence.

172
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,200
What are you planning?

173
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,400
It's not only a DNA test report.

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,560
It's more like a noose
attached to the gallows.

175
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,040
I'll tie the noose
around the neck of Zhou Yanzhao.

176
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,120
I'll send him to hell,

177
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,800
make him suffer forever

178
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,520
and die without peace.

179
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,160
I really can't stand

180
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,760
your despicable means.

181
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,720
Dad, even if you want
to take over Shenghai,

182
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,600
you don't have to destroy him.

183
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,080
We have good
healthcare standards nowadays,

184
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,520
so it is most likely that
Aunt Ye will recover her memory.

185
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,080
Go away.

186
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,840
Xiaomeng,

187
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,720
-I want to explain about the photos.
-It's okay.

188
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,840
My only concern at this moment
is the condition of my mother.

189
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,200
-Xiaomeng, Lingxi and I...
-It's been a while.

190
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,720
The check-up for my mom should have ended.

191
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,880
I have to go.

192
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,600
We have the results of her scan.

193
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,200
It has been sent to the computer
of our chief physician.

194
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,360
Let's go there.

195
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,480
Let me go with Dr. Xiao
and check the results.

196
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,400
Then I'll take my mom for a walk,

197
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,840
so she can relax.

198
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,280
Chairman Zhou, this way please.

199
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,720
Mom, let's go out for a walk.

200
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,000
Mom,

201
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,640
do you still remember
what happened when you got injured?

202
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,160
Did I get injured?

203
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,880
I'm feeling rather good.

204
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,800
You remember me. You remember Yan.

205
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,520
You even remember sister Hua.

206
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,280
But how come you just can't...

207
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,440
remember Uncle Zhou?

208
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,040
Uncle Zhou.

209
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,920
Which Uncle Zhou?

210
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,360
That Uncle Zhou, Zhou Binli.

211
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,440
Mom, I believe you.

212
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,000
You would never do anything
to hurt Uncle Zhou.

213
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,360
Zhou Binli.

214
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,800
Zhou Binli.

215
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,800
-Mom.
-Xiaomeng, my head hurts.

216
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,600
Mom, let's sit down.

217
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,160
It really hurts.

218
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,480
It's fine. Stop thinking.

219
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,720
Mom,

220
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,960
I won't let anyone force you.

221
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,400
Mom,...

222
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,200
you must get well soon.

223
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,960
According to the current condition,

224
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,840
the recovery of the patient
is relatively good.

225
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,960
The cerebral hemorrhage

226
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,480
has been dissipating,

227
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,440
but the process is still slow.

228
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,640
As to the memory loss...

229
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,720
Is there any other treatment?

230
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,680
In terms of the healthcare standard
of all the hospitals in Nanyue,

231
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,360
we are the best.

232
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,680
Chairman Zhou,

233
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,600
I suggest you consider

234
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,880
neurologists from abroad
to treat the patient.

235
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,160
They have more extensive studies

236
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,920
on this kind of patients.

237
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,680
They have studied it
for a longer period of time

238
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,640
and have more research results

239
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,480
and richer experience.

240
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,800
Please continue.

241
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,920
The solution was first suggested to me
by Dr. Xiao.

242
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,120
We had a thorough discussion.

243
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,080
For now,
it's the most possible solution...

244
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,600
that can improve Ms. Ye's condition.

245
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,880
I've consulted several hospitals

246
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,000
specializing in neurology
in the US, the UK and Australia.

247
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,120
They told me about
some other similar cases.

248
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,800
Indeed their experience
is much richer than ours.

249
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,320
Can we invite
some foreign specialists to come here?

250
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,840
Well,

251
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,600
we have never thought about it before,...

252
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,320
but we can try.

253
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,640
All right then.

254
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,000
Dr. Xiao,

255
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,080
please contact some foreign neurologists.

256
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,040
I'll send her to the nursing home
as soon as possible.

257
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,880
Okay. No problem.

258
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,520
By the way,

259
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,040
please also contact some
of the best orthopedists in the city.

260
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,280
Why orthopedists?

261
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,280
It's for Jiang Ze.

262
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,440
I hope he can get well soon.

263
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,440
Then I'll contact them
as soon as possible.

264
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,240
Thank you.

265
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,560
Xiaomeng,

266
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,880
when can we go home?

267
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,120
Mom,

268
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,400
if you are tired,
you can sleep for a while.

269
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,840
When you wake up, we'll arrive home.

270
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,920
Really?

271
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,120
Okay...

272
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,680
-Sleep well.
-Okay.

273
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,120
Don't you want to know the conclusion
drawn by the doctors and me?

274
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,280
Did they say there's still hope
for my mom to recover her memory?

275
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,920
Of course there is hope.

276
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,520
We've found a new solution for Aunt Ye.

277
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,200
Are you inviting foreign experts?

278
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,080
You've learned the news so fast.

279
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,120
You're right.

280
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,560
I'll invite foreign neurologists
to the nursing home

281
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,320
and give Aunt Ye specific treatment.

282
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,880
Yan,...

283
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,440
thank you.

284
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,400
You should move
to the nursing home at once.

285
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,600
What about you?

286
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,520
I...

287
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,280
If we move out,

288
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,560
you'll be alone at home.

289
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,280
I'm the master of the Zhou family now.

290
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,680
I can manage the business
of Shenghai by myself.

291
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,280
Take care of your mom.

292
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,600
Don't worry about me.

293
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,080
Chairman Zhou,

294
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,760
the current situation
has put us at a disadvantage.

295
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,880
Right now the media
are watching us closely.

296
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,880
The scuffle has been widely reported.

297
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,800
All efforts made by our PR department

298
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,160
so far have seen no effect.

299
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,960
The truth...

300
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,760
will come out eventually.

301
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,040
If we delay the problem any longer,

302
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,000
we will have more disadvantages.

303
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,920
Sun Lingxi,...

304
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,880
organize a press conference,

305
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,720
and invite all the media in the city.

306
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,720
We'll release a statement
about the scuffle.

307
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,200
Shenghai Group would never allow
such despicable behavior.

308
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,160
You'll tell everyone

309
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,840
that Shenghai Group
has reported to the police,

310
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,360
and we believe that the criminals
will be punished severely by law.

311
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,560
Okay, I understand.

312
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,040
We've already pacified
the representatives for the protesters.

313
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,280
The injured workers
have received the best treatment,

314
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,040
and the workers still on the site

315
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,080
have accepted our suggestion
of raising the wage.

316
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,680
However,

317
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,240
if we keep delaying paying the workers,

318
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,800
more and more workers

319
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,800
will join the protest.

320
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,640
The most important thing right now

321
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,720
is to make good use
of all the capital chain we have.

322
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,680
The reason why there is a protest

323
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,760
and a strike on the site

324
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,160
is because of the chain reaction

325
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,320
triggered by insufficient funds.

326
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,320
I know what you are talking about.

327
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,840
It's just the first negative impact.

328
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,040
Very soon,

329
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,720
it will lead to a drop
in the share price of Shenghai,

330
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,360
which is the deadliest blow.

331
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,600
Chairman Zhou,

332
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,120
we can't procrastinate anymore.

333
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,800
Sun Lingxi,

334
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,360
find several more companies
which can cooperate with us.

335
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,160
Select some suitable companies,

336
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,280
and I'll talk to them personally.

337
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,160
Yes, Chairman Zhou.

338
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,400
I'll get right to it.

339
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,120
Qingyan,...

340
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,680
do you think that...

341
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,320
someone wants me to fail?

342
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,280
They won't stop until I fail,

343
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,080
so I can only continue confronting them.

344
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,480
Chairman Zhou,

345
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,760
don't you think
that the problems of the project

346
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,640
are obviously caused by someone
deliberately hindering our project?

347
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,640
Can we defeat them after all?

348
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,280
I'm sure we both know

349
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,480
whom you are referring to.

350
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,440
Now that Shenghai Group
has been handed over to me,

351
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,600
I'll safeguard it

352
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,400
and never give up.

353
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,160
Lingxi,...

354
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:19,960
wait.

355
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,560
How can I help you, Secretary Chang?

356
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,800
If you're free,

357
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,920
I want to talk to you.

358
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,000
All right, I'll wait for you
in the office.

359
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,160
Secretary Chang, have you figured out

360
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,600
any solutions
that could solve the difficulties

361
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,880
faced by Shenghai right now?

362
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,680
-No.
-Then what are you going to talk about?

363
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:39,960
Well...

364
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,360
Actually it's nothing.

365
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,320
We may talk about it some other day.

366
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,440
Good.

367
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,200
Chairman Zhou.

368
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,600
Dr. Xiao,

369
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,840
have you heard back
from the foreign experts?

370
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,880
I've got good news.

371
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,720
A top-notch neurologist in the US

372
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,160
has already accepted our invitation.

373
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,320
He'll come to China
with his team in a few days.

374
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,960
Dr. Xiao,...

375
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,560
can I ask you one more favor?

376
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,360
Chairman Zhou, please say it.

377
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,360
I hope you can also go

378
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,400
to the nursing home
with Xiaomeng and Ye Sirong

379
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,680
and take care of them there.

380
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,040
Me?

381
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,280
You have a good understanding
of Ye Sirong's condition.

382
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,840
If you go there with them,

383
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,160
it'll be very beneficial to her treatment.

384
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,480
Chairman Zhou,...

385
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,720
this is quite out of the blue,

386
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,040
so I need some time to think about it.

387
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,440
I hope you can make the decision quickly.

388
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,120
If Qiao Zhen is willing to go,

389
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,480
it would be even better.

390
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,320
All right, Chairman Zhou.

391
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,760
I'll go back first

392
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,760
and get back to you soon.

393
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,720
Guang, can you drive a bit faster?

394
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,560
Yes.

395
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,840
I need to tell you about something.

396
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,040
What is it?

397
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,600
When we went to the hospital previously,

398
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,960
I could feel we were
either being watched or spied on.

399
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,920
But today it was too quiet.

400
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,880
Have you seen the guy who's spying on us?

401
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,360
At first,

402
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,440
I encountered him once or twice.

403
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,680
He was cunning and I couldn't catch him.

404
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,920
Thank you, Guang.

405
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,080
We need to find a way to catch him.

406
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,480
I need to know who he is

407
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,040
and whether he's working for someone.

408
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,960
I believe...

409
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,680
they've changed their plan.

410
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,720
We are an easy target for them,

411
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,720
while they are conspiring in the shadow.

412
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,760
But I roughly know
who is conspiring against us.

413
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,400
After Xiaomeng and Ye Sirong

414
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,640
have settled down in the nursing home,

415
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,280
we'll have to pay more attention.

416
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,920
Once we've discover any evidence,

417
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,880
we should hand it in
to the police immediately.

418
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,440
No problem, Brother Yan.

419
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,560
Xiaomeng, let's have dinner.

420
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,720
Sit down and have dinner.
Where is Aunt Ye?

421
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,760
She doesn't have
much of an appetite today.

422
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,560
I'll take some food and feed her upstairs.

423
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,800
Is she sick again?

424
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,960
No.

425
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,520
Just a bit loss of appetite.

426
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,720
It's a pity.

427
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,440
The dishes I've cooked tonight

428
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,840
are all Dr. Ye's favorite dishes.

429
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,560
I can take the food upstairs

430
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,600
and have a chat with her.

431
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,080
Maybe it can relax her,

432
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,440
and get her appetite back.

433
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,280
That's okay. Sister Hua.

434
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,840
I can do that myself.

435
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,720
You eat first.

436
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,520
Xiaomeng, please sit.

437
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,960
Let her do that.

438
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,600
I want to talk to you.

439
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,680
Xiaomeng.

440
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,040
Listen to Yan.

441
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,640
Have a seat and eat something.

442
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,880
I'll give you a smaller portion.

443
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,360
Sister Hua, thank you.

444
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,680
You're welcome.

445
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,200
All right, I'll go upstairs first.

446
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,480
I need to explain myself

447
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,080
about the photos.

448
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,840
That's your own business.

449
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,680
You don't have to explain yourself to me.

450
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,240
Xiaomeng,

451
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,600
I have never lied to you
for all these years.

452
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,440
No matter what it is,
if I've done it, I will admit it.

453
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,600
If I haven't done it, I'll deny it.

454
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,680
This is my principle,

455
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,680
and you know that.

456
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,320
That day I got really drunk
because I was entertaining the clients.

457
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,400
I have no idea what happened,

458
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,720
-and I didn't know about those photos.
-That's a convenient excuse.

459
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,000
Xiaomeng.

460
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,920
I swear

461
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,760
if I've ever lied to you,
I will be struck by lightning right away.

462
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,240
I don't want you to swear.

463
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,400
Let's eat.

464
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,040
Xiaomeng, thank you.

465
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,480
There's one more thing I want to tell you.

466
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,960
I have made arrangement
with the nursing home.

467
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,720
That's fast.

468
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,120
And Dr. Xiao has found
the best neurologist team in the US.

469
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,720
They'll come to Nanyue
and provide treatment to Aunt Ye.

470
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,080
That's great news.

471
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,240
I've also invited Dr. Xiao
to the nursing home with you,

472
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,120
and he has agreed.

473
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,120
Why does Dr. Xiao need to go with us?

474
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,800
He is the most suitable person

475
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,400
to communicate with the foreign doctors,

476
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,320
and he knows very well about
the condition of your mother.

477
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,400
If he stays there,

478
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,360
he'll make a great contribution
to the treatment.

479
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,800
Moreover,

480
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,280
I'll ask sister Hua to go with you.

481
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,280
She is going too?

482
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,280
if she's there,
she can take care of you two.

483
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,720
We have to take care of Jiang Ze too.

484
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,280
This arrangement gives me peace of mind.

485
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,080
But if we all leave,

486
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,680
you'll be left alone.

487
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,520
Will you visit us?

488
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,040
Do you want me to come with you
to the nursing home?

489
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,160
If you can let go of everything,

490
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,160
leave Nanyue

491
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,920
and start a new life with us,

492
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,800
I would be very happy.

493
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,080
-I...
-But I know...

494
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,400
you won't leave Shenghai.

495
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,800
Xiaomeng,

496
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,120
I have never lied to you
for all these years.

497
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,920
No matter what it is,
if I've done it, I will admit it.

498
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,000
If I haven't done it, I'll deny it.

499
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,040
This is my principle, and you know that.

500
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,960
That day I got really drunk
because I was entertaining the clients.

501
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,040
I have no idea what happened,

502
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,440
-and I didn't know about those photos.
-That's a convenient excuse.

503
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,880
I swear

504
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,840
if I've ever lied to you,

505
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,160
I will be struck by lightning right away.

506
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,320
Here.

507
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,040
It's not easy to meet with old friends.

508
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,000
Yes.

509
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,040
We are all old friends.

510
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,840
If there is a profitable business,

511
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,600
I'll share with you.

512
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,880
Today there is a good opportunity

513
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,040
right in front of you.

514
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,520
President Jiang, tell us then.

515
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,960
I believe
what President Jiang wants us to do

516
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,960
is somehow a bit challenging.

517
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,160
It's not challenging.

518
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,640
If it's challenging,

519
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,920
I won't let you take the risk.

520
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,360
President Jiang,
we've known each other for years.

521
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,400
Don't keep us in suspense.
Cut to the chase.

522
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,920
We won't forget you
if you bring us some benefits.

523
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,760
You are aware

524
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,480
of the situation of Shenghai, right?

525
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,320
Right now,

526
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,440
Shenghai has serious shortage of funds.

527
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,160
Think about it.

528
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,840
It's a great opportunity
for you guys, isn't?

529
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,840
President Jiang,

530
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,880
are you kidding us?

531
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,920
President Jiang

532
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,720
is definitely joking.

533
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,920
I would like to make a toast
to President Jiang.

534
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,360
When President Jiang drinks happily,

535
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,120
he'll be more serious about the business.

536
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,240
Let me explain it.

537
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,440
Shenghai currently has
an urgent need for funds

538
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,520
in order to support several
ongoing huge projects.

539
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,400
The money from the three of you

540
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,600
could make Shenghai

541
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,520
rise again.

542
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,520
Moreover, you could be

543
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,320
the new directors of Shenghai Group.

544
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,440
The profitability of Shenghai Group

545
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,320
ranks top in the whole city,
and even the whole province.

546
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,240
This is well-recognized.

547
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,600
Wouldn't you agree?

548
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,960
President Jiang,

549
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,320
you understand
the current situation of Shenghai.

550
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,840
We also know a bit about that.

551
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,080
The share price of Shenghai has plunged,
and everyone is concerned.

552
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,600
It's too risky

553
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,240
to invest money in Shenghai
at this moment.

554
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,000
President Jiang, I've heard

555
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,480
that the Wanrong Company you own

556
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,720
has been growing rapidly

557
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,840
in recent years.

558
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,000
Right,

559
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,640
if President Jiang feels
a deep affection for Shenghai Group,

560
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,880
why don't you acquire
a shareholding of Shanghai

561
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,080
on behalf of Wanrong.

562
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,680
Wanrong can fill the shortage of fund
by its own.

563
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,600
You don't need us at all.

564
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,760
My old friends,

565
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,040
there are somethings you don't know.

566
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,200
If Wanrong invests in Shenghai,

567
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,440
the problem of fund shortage

568
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,200
can be immediately solved.

569
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,480
However, have you ever thought

570
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,040
if I do that,

571
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,680
I'll be the major shareholder of Shenghai.

572
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,160
Does it mean

573
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,240
I should take over the position
of chairman?

574
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,160
It's good, isn't it?

575
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,480
Everyone wants to be the chairman.

576
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,200
I don't want that.

577
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,080
Zhou Yanzhao is the chairman
of Shenghai right now.

578
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,160
He is the son
of my best friend, Zhou Binli.

579
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,840
You all know well about my friendship
with Zhou Binli.

580
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,640
If I do that,

581
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,920
it's like usurping the throne
of Zhou Binli.

582
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,880
I couldn't do such thing.

583
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,320
Although I'm a businessman,

584
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,760
I'll never forget our brotherhood.

585
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,560
I can't invest in Shenghai via Wanrong,

586
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,640
so I ask for your help.

587
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,920
President Jiang, I respect you.

588
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,960
You cherish friendship and loyalty.

589
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,760
You are such a great example
of an entrepreneur.

590
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,880
But the risk of investing Shenghai

591
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,520
is enormous.

592
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,240
I still need time to think about it.

593
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,400
President Jiang, I'm sorry.

594
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,880
I agree with President Zhang.

595
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,440
What about you, President Xu?

596
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,200
It's a serious matter

597
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,640
which has to be considered carefully.

598
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,400
Listen.

599
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,440
If you invest in Shenghai,

600
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,840
I would offer you
with equal shares of Wanrong.

601
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,280
In this way, you can rest assured.

602
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,000
Even if you lose money from Shenghai,

603
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,080
you can still earn money back
from Wanrong.

604
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,200
Actually,

605
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,240
it is the only possible solution.

606
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,960
You see, I want to save Shenghai,

607
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,280
but I can't ruin my relationship
with the Zhou family.

608
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,160
What should I do? Right?

609
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,120
You have listened to my proposal now,

610
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,320
if you aren't willing
to acquire a shareholding.

611
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,600
That's perfectly okay.

612
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,480
I'll think of another way.

613
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,360
Let's drink.

614
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,880
Whether we could make a deal or not,

615
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,920
we are still good friends.

616
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,000
Yes.

617
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,200
Let's drink.

618
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,320
President Jiang, I'm sold.

619
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,360
I'll go to your office tomorrow,...

620
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,760
and discuss the details.

621
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,080
I appreciate it.

622
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,080
President Jiang,
I'll be there too tomorrow.

623
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,800
Let's go together.

624
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,920
Thank you very much...

625
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,840
Come... Let's drink...

626
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,480
Cheers.

627
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,040
A toast to our cooperation.

628
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,040
Why are you calling at this hour?

629
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,200
Boss,

630
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,360
tomorrow morning, Zhou Yanzhao
is taking Mr. Jiang, Zhou Xiaomeng

631
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,280
and Ye Sirong to the nursing home.

632
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,760
Will Zhou Yanzhao do anything
to harm Mr. Jiang?

633
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,320
I see.

634
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,840
Should I...

635
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,320
Follow my orders.

636
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,560
Yes.

637
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,800
A Ze, are you sleeping now?

638
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,440
No, what do you want?

639
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,520
A Ze, don't be mad at your father.

640
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,440
Your injury was really an accident.

641
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,080
That despicable thing

642
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,000
becomes an accident in your eyes.

643
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,480
Son,...

644
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,120
it really pains me to see you get hurt.

645
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,480
You're going to the nursing home tomorrow,

646
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,320
so I want to see you now.

647
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,880
I don't want to see you.

648
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,680
You have to understand

649
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,520
that I only do this for you.

650
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,760
Don't make excuses anymore.

651
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,320
Instead of wasting both our time,

652
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,520
how about we sleep?

653
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,880
You have to remember

654
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,840
we are family.

655
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,360
Zhou Yanzhao is our enemy.

656
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,520
Family? You remember your family?

657
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,960
Jiang Qingcheng,

658
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,040
please don't tarnish the word "family."

659
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,360
A Ze.

660
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:15,920
A Ze.

661
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,360
(Xiaomeng, are you awake?)

662
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,200
(Dad)

663
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,360
(Please don't bother to call me anymore)

664
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,800
If you're busy at work,

665
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,840
you don't have to come.

666
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,240
I'll come back to you soon.

667
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,960
I don't really want you to leave.

668
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,920
I don't want to leave you either.

669
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,640
But I'm familiar with Aunt Ye's condition.

670
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,760
If I go to the nursing home,

671
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,280
I can help explaining the condition.

672
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,760
All right.

673
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,600
Take care of yourself.

674
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,080
Don't worry.

675
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,000
Aunt Lin,

676
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,400
it's late and you're still awake.

677
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,760
Yes.

678
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,960
I've heard that

679
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,960
you are moving to the nursing home
with your mother.

680
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,200
Yes.

681
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,040
Yan has arranged the nursing home for us.

682
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,960
He has also invited
some foreign specialist.

683
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,800
I think he has done a good job.

684
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,520
However,

685
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,400
when you and your mother move out,

686
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,400
he'll be left alone in the house.

687
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,520
Yes.

688
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,120
We are worried about him.

689
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,640
But he said to me that

690
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,960
he had confidence in himself.

691
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,280
Do you think I should...

692
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,000
You know

693
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,640
I always want to see him.

694
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,160
Aunt Lin,

695
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,120
I know you miss him
very much at the moment.

696
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,520
I can understand your feeling,

697
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,600
but the timing is not right.

698
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,120
You should be more patient.

699
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,960
It won't be long

700
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,920
before you can live with him together.

701
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,640
I will wait. I've been waiting every day.

702
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,040
Aunt Lin,

703
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,480
it must be hard for you.

704
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,800
Not at all.

705
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,600
All right, let's not talk about this.

706
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,880
It's late. You should go to bed early.

707
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,840
Okay. You too.

708
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,000
Good night.

709
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,440
Good night.

710
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,560
Do you often sneak out of the office
and look at the moon here,

711
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,920
when you are working night shift?

712
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,280
Don't say it.

713
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,040
The moon tonight is quite beautiful.

714
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,840
Ever since I grew up,
I haven't gazed at the moon.

715
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,360
But when I was little,

716
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,360
I always gazed at the moon.

717
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,360
Really?

718
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,640
Don't try to make yourself romantic, okay?

719
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,320
When I was little, my family was poor.

720
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,800
Even though the TV was broken,
we didn't have money to repair it.

721
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,160
When the other kids went home
and watched TV,...

722
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,440
I could only find an open space

723
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,400
and gazed at the stars and the moon.

724
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,360
So when I was little,

725
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,520
I particularly wanted to own

726
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,960
a telescope.

727
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,840
Then I could see all the stars
and the moon clearly.

728
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,360
So did you get a telescope?

729
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,360
Then I got a part-time job

730
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,760
and bought a telescope for 300 dollars.

731
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,240
So tell me,

732
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,480
are they more beautiful
when you use the telescope

733
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,520
to gaze at the stars and the moon?

734
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,560
Qiao Zhen,...

735
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,440
they are the most beautiful
only when I gaze at them with you.

736
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,800
I haven't realized

737
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,240
when you've learned to be a romantic.

738
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,120
Right,

739
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,240
I've heard there'll be meteor shower
at the end of the year.

740
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,400
Let's come here and see it together
at that time.

741
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,480
Of course.

742
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,120
Let's see the meteor shower together.

743
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,200
At that time,

744
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,720
what would you wish for?

745
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,320
I wish that we could...

746
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,240
You must not say it out loud.

747
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,360
It won't come true.

748
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,160
Look! it's a meteor.

749
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,640
Really?

750
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,560
Is it really a meteor?

751
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,760
Be quick. Make a wish.

752
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,080
Look how lucky you are.

753
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,520
We were just talking about meteor
and then you saw a meteor.

754
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,400
Don't be a doctor anymore.

755
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,400
Work for me.

756
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,320
All right, I will work for you.

757
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,080
All right. I was just kidding.

758
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,400
You could never quit your job.

759
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,400
We should go back
and go to bed early tonight.

760
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,400
You are going to the nursing home
tomorrow morning.

761
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Qiao Zhen,

762
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,160
when Aunt Ye gets better,

763
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,200
I'll come back to the city and see you.

764
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,360
I don't want to see you.

765
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,800
I want to see you.

766
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,680
Let's go.

767
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,080
Xiaomeng,

768
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,640
these are the moon and the clouds
that Dr. Xiao and I see together.

769
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,800
Aren't they beautiful?

770
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,400
Dr. Xiao won't be able to sleep tonight.

771
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,960
Mom,...

772
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,400
why you are not sleeping?

773
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,360
I couldn't sleep.

774
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,560
I come to see you.

775
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,000
If you are not sleeping,
then what are you thinking?

776
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,920
I am thinking...

777
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,600
I want to take you to school.

778
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,200
Mom, sit down first.

779
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,680
Mom,...

780
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,920
when I was hosting Fairy Tale Street,

781
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,840
I told the children
a story about the moon.

782
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,160
Would you like to hear it?

783
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,040
You're telling a story?

784
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,720
It's great.

785
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,080
A Qiu was a child
who liked to help others.

786
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,360
One day he lost his favorite gloves.

787
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,840
He was sad.

788
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,720
But one day,

789
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,920
He suddenly met a bird

790
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,720
that he had helped before.

791
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,440
The bird flew him to the moon

792
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,840
to see the goddess of moon.

793
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,920
The goddess of moon said to him

794
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,160
that she would help

795
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,800
every child who liked to help others.

796
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,720
Xiaomeng is good girl.

797
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,720
Xiaomeng,

798
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,920
are you getting married soon?

799
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,320
Then you will become a mother.

800
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,320
Mom, what are you talking about?

801
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,760
It's not happening anytime soon.

802
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,240
Mom, it's late now.

803
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,920
Go back and sleep.

804
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,000
We are going to the nursing home tomorrow.

805
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,480
Yes, the nursing home.

806
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,320
Then I'll go back and rest.

807
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,320
-I'll walk you to your room.
-No. You...

808
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,480
You don't have to.

809
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,040
I can go back by myself.

810
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,680
Come on. Don't walk with me.

811
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,240
I can do this alone.

812
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,560
Bye-bye.

813
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,760
Xiaomeng, are you getting married soon?

814
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:57,400
Then you will become a mother.
