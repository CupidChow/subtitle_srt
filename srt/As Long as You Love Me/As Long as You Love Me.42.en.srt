1
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,800
(Episode 42)

2
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,400
How can this be?

3
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,320
How can Zhou Xiaomeng
be Zhou Binli's biological daughter?

4
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,400
Mr. Zhou Binli did this DNA paternity test
while he was alive

5
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,320
to prove his biological relationship
with Zhou Xiaomeng.

6
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,840
The results are provided
by a professional organization.

7
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
I can guarantee

8
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,880
this is legitimate

9
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,120
and legally valid.

10
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,160
Everyone, please have a look.

11
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,840
Please.

12
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,280
Furthermore,

13
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,840
since Zhou Xiaomeng
is Zhou Binli's biological daughter,

14
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,440
according to the law,

15
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,720
if there is no other legal heir,

16
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,120
Zhou Xiaomeng will be entitled

17
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,560
to inherit all assets of Zhou Binli,

18
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,080
including all of Zhou Binli's shares
of Shenghai Group.

19
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,600
And Xiaomeng has appointed me

20
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,880
as her attorney

21
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,480
to handle inheritance proceedings.

22
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,200
Next, Xiaomeng will personally
make an announcement.

23
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,000
Dear Directors,...

24
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,200
as I have inherited my father's shares,

25
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,240
I should be entitled to decide

26
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,000
on every matter in Shenghai Group.

27
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,040
Although Zhou Yanzhao
is not my father's biological son,

28
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,920
while my father was alive,

29
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,320
he intended Zhou Yanzhao
to manage Shenghai Group.

30
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,080
Therefore, there is no better fit than Yan

31
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,640
to be the chairman of Shenghai Group.

32
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,080
Xiaomeng!

33
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,280
Xiaomeng...

34
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,600
You...

35
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,440
You probably don't understand.

36
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,920
Zhou Binli...

37
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,080
No, your father...

38
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,760
Before he passed away,

39
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,480
your father had no idea of his parentage.

40
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,640
It is clear now

41
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,000
that he doesn't belong to the Zhou family,

42
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,560
he can't be the chairman anymore.

43
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,760
The board of directors
won't approve of it.

44
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,520
Therefore, we've just voted to remove him.

45
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,640
As you are Zhou Binli's
biological daughter,

46
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,240
are you going to be the chairman?

47
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,760
So...

48
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,640
what I'm going to announce is that...

49
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,880
Zhou Yanzhao and I
are going to get married.

50
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,960
Zhou Yanzhao will be my legal husband

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,600
and he'll help me manage Shenghai Group.

52
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,400
Uncle Jiang,

53
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,400
will it be reasonable for Yan

54
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,040
to stay in Shenghai?

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,360
I didn't expect that.

56
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,240
-Zhou Xiaomeng is impressive.
-Yes.

57
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,960
It all happened so suddenly...

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,040
Meeting dismiss...

59
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,120
Why did you come here?

60
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,360
Why didn't you listen to me?

61
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,400
I'm sorry, Yan.

62
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,120
I thought about it for a long time.

63
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,280
If I just did nothing like you said

64
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,000
and let you endure all this,

65
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,720
I would regret for my whole life.

66
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,320
Do you know what your announcement
in the board meeting means?

67
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,240
Why didn't you discuss it with me first?

68
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,160
Yan, listen,

69
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,720
I've asked the attorney, Mr. He.

70
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,840
He told me it's the only way I could do

71
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,400
to keep your position

72
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,800
and safeguard my father's legacy for us.

73
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,440
But it is going to
drag you into this mess.

74
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,600
You saw the look
on Jiang Qingcheng yourself.

75
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,840
He will act against you.

76
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,840
He will do everything possible
to crush you.

77
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,320
Even if he will act against me,

78
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,320
as the daughter of Zhou Binli,

79
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,000
I still have the duty
to shoulder the burden.

80
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,760
Besides,

81
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,680
you will help me, right?

82
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,720
I'm already in such a mess.

83
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,320
Once I leave Shenghai,

84
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,840
I will be flat broke.

85
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,040
How am I going to protect you?

86
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,360
Even if you become flat broke,

87
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,040
I will never leave you.

88
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,320
Yan,...

89
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,120
we will face it together.

90
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,960
You have no idea how dangerous this is.

91
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,280
I'm already walking on thin ice.

92
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,040
Now I have to bring you along
to play with fire?

93
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,560
Marriage.

94
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,320
If we get married,

95
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,640
the problem will be solved, won't it?

96
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,440
What makes you think
marriage is that simple?

97
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,440
Now I'm about to be removed,

98
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,840
that means I will be
driven away from Shenghai any minute.

99
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,800
Who am I to propose to you?

100
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,240
How can I give you your dream wedding?

101
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,280
Yan, I don't care.

102
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,000
Whether rich or poor,

103
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,960
as long as I can be with you,

104
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,640
I'm willing to do anything.

105
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,080
Silly.

106
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,520
Every time I think about what dirty trick
Jiang Qingcheng would play,

107
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,040
and how keeping you with me
would put you in danger,

108
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,720
I feel painfully distressed.

109
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,080
Never mention anything...

110
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,080
about getting married.

111
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,960
Trading your most important life event
for this?

112
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,640
I won't agree to this.

Xiaomeng...

124
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,520
What's wrong?

125
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,960
It's your dad.
He's pushing us to the edge.

126
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,320
What did my dad do this time?

127
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,600
You dad just convinced

128
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,600
over half of the board members...

129
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,840
to vote to remove Yan.

130
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,680
What?

131
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,320
Where's Yan? Is he all right?

132
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,960
Your father's plot didn't succeed.

133
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,720
Yan has found a DNA paternity test report

134
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,040
proving that
I'm Zhou Binli's biological daughter.

135
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,640
I brought Mr. He to the board meeting

136
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,000
and announced that
Zhou Binli is my father,...

137
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,880
and that I'm going to
get married with Yan.

138
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,560
Yan will be my husband

139
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,800
and help me manage Shenghai.

140
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,920
But Yan refuses to get married with me.

141
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,680
Jiang Ze, what should I do?

142
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,720
That's the only option he has.

143
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,760
Xiaomeng,

144
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,320
do you really have no idea
why I must crash in Yan's place?

145
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,120
I do.

146
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,000
And that's...

147
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,560
one of the reasons I did this.

148
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,120
I wanted to do this long ago.

149
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,600
I just didn't think...

150
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,720
that it would happen so soon.

151
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,240
All right, I've got it.

152
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,320
Xiaomeng, you have changed so much.

153
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,840
Jiang Ze,...

154
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,640
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,240
Don't be.

156
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,840
It's just wishful thinking on my part.

157
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,120
If I help Yan safeguard Shenghai,

158
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,200
will you still get married with him?

159
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,600
-Yes.
-Don't say it.

160
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,040
Let me keep my dream alive.

161
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,200
Thank you, Jiang Ze.

162
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm not doing these for Yan,

163
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,280
but you.

164
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,680
I...

165
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,960
Don't be touched just yet.

166
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,360
My father will not give up.

167
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,840
He will do everything possible
to put his claws into Shenghai.

168
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,600
But I will do whatever I can to help Yan.

169
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,760
But at the end of the day,
he's your father.

170
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,240
Wouldn't it be too difficult for you?

171
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,440
He's already been blinded
by personal gain.

172
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,120
No one can persuade him otherwise.

173
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
I actually hope
he can be defeated once and for all.

174
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,280
Then,

175
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,840
I can help him start over.

176
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,280
President Jiang,...

177
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,000
we all thought

178
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,800
it was the final nail in the coffin
for Zhou Yanzhao.

179
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,840
I can't believe he's survived this again.

180
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,320
How could this have happened?

181
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,280
I want to know how as well.

182
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,720
I thought if we forced
Zhou Yanzhao to admit

183
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,240
he didn't belong to the Zhou family,

184
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,840
and that I brought in
the investment funds.

185
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,280
It should have been easy

186
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,080
to force Zhou Yanzhao out of Shenghai,

187
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,400
and snatch his position of the chairman.

188
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,320
Who'd have thought
Zhou Xiaomeng would come in?

189
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,200
How could she be

190
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,880
the daughter of Zhou Binli?

191
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,800
But she brought with her an attorney,

192
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,200
and the DNA paternity test report here.

193
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,160
Apparently Zhou Xiaomeng
came prepared for this.

194
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,640
Our plan went down the drain today.

195
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,000
If Zhou Yanzhao
manages to get back his footing,

196
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,240
we'd have a hard time in Shenghai.

197
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,080
Despite my best effort,

198
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,800
I never would have expected
this coming from them.

199
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,320
I thought Zhou Binli
was the difficult one.

200
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,520
I just didn't expect these two brats
would be our obstacles.

201
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,040
But we can't just
throw in the towel, right?

202
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
You are a fount of ideas.
Please think about what we can do.

203
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,800
Let me think about it...

204
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,280
You really should.

205
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,800
President Jiang,

206
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,320
we would like to remind you

207
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,600
that you were behind this all along.

208
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,320
We just gave you a helping hand.

209
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,680
If you could succeed,

210
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,880
we'd help you become Shenghai's chairman.

211
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,160
If not,

212
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,760
we would not go down in flames with you.

213
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,160
What do you mean by that?

214
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,400
We are on the same boat.

215
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,280
Same boat.

216
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,400
But if the boat is about to sink,

217
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,600
we've got to find a way to survive, right?

218
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,640
We can't be dragged
into the water like that.

219
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,760
After all, Shenghai is a big ship.

220
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,800
It doesn't really matter for us
who is at the helm.

221
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,760
President Jiang,...

222
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,120
you've been
in the business world for years, right?

223
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,960
You've been playing
with the eagle all your life.

224
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,440
Be careful not to let the eagle
peck your eyes out.

225
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,720
Give me some time, all right?

226
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,360
Just give me some time.

227
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,520
Even if Zhou Yanzhao

228
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,320
manages to keep his position
as the chairman,

229
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,880
I will do everything possible
to make it difficult for him.

230
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,600
Brother Yan, I'm sorry.

231
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,920
It's me who told Xiaomeng about this.

232
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,720
It's not your first time

233
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,960
to take it upon yourself.

234
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,200
I know you did this for my own good.

235
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,520
But you've got to be more alerted
about Xiaomeng's safety.

236
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,720
Now that all eyes are on her...

237
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,680
and she's got a lot of shares in Shenghai.

238
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,640
I don't want anything to happen to her.

239
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,520
I've got it.

240
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,200
Right,...

241
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,520
have Jiang Qingcheng's underlings
made any move?

242
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,720
Not much these days.

243
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,560
As you requested, I gave the photos

244
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,720
to the detectives
investigating your father's case.

245
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,880
They said
they will look into it immediately,

246
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,440
and see if they could find any clues

247
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,560
about the murder of your father.

248
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,520
Meanwhile, they will investigate

249
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,960
if Jiang Qingcheng and his underlings

250
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,280
had done anything else.

251
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,800
Good.

252
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,480
If that's the case, you don't have to
investigate this anymore.

253
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,000
From now on,

254
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,400
Xiaomeng's safety will be your priority.

255
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,520
Yes, Brother Yan, I've got it.

256
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,840
Yan,

257
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,480
you're back.

258
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,920
It was my fault today.

259
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,080
I shouldn't have treated you like that.

260
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,440
I did not discuss with you first

261
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,440
before I went to Shenghai recklessly.

262
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,840
I was too impulsive.

263
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,680
Come in.

264
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
You didn't do anything wrong.

265
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,600
Were it not for you,

266
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,280
I'd have lost everything.

267
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,560
Does it mean...

268
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,520
you agree with my idea?

269
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,280
About that,...

270
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,640
I probably still have to think it over.

271
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,560
You mean

272
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,440
our marriage announcement?

273
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,560
It all happened so quickly today

274
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,240
not only for me,
but also for Jiang Qingcheng.

275
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,320
He won't just let this go.

276
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,040
We are safe for now.

277
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,560
But there may be more challenges
ahead of us.

278
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,520
Don't you...

279
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,000
want to get married with me?

280
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,680
Of course I do.

281
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,760
You know my heart.

282
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,120
But if I marry you like this now,

283
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,080
I'm not being responsible for you.

284
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,720
Since we feel the same about each other,

285
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,400
we should register
our marriage immediately.

286
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,720
Once we've got married,

287
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,240
my shares will become valid.

288
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,240
Whatever Jiang Qingcheng wants to do

289
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,520
won't change the outcome.

290
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,080
But if we announce our marriage now,

291
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,040
Jiang Qingcheng won't take it lying down.

292
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,040
We can discuss about it later,

293
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,200
but we just can't do it now.

294
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,760
But what if anything happens,

295
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,160
and we lose each other again,
what should we do?

296
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,520
Xiaomeng,...

297
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,880
if anything happens,

298
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,640
your safety is always my top priority,

299
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,240
our future comes second.

300
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,480
You've got it?

301
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,560
Thank you for today.

302
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,600
The moment you bulged into
the board meeting,...

303
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,920
you showed remarkable courage,
determination, and fearlessness

304
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,200
just like Dad.

305
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,960
Really?

306
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,200
Yes.

307
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,280
So I have to work harder now,

308
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,440
or it's going to be
the beauty saving the hero.

309
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,760
I'll be embarrassed.

310
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,760
Don't worry.

311
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,960
Things will get better.

312
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,960
With you by my side,
things will definitely get better.

Eventually,
you both find your way back together.

318
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,200
I wish you happiness.

319
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,960
One more glass, please.

320
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,000
I'll have the same, please.

321
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,800
Why are you here?

322
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,520
I'm here to drink with you.

323

to lay hands on him?

332
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,800
Zhou Yanzhao won't be a problem.

333
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,720
However,

334
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,680
that guy, Guang, is always on his guard.

335
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,320
Besides,

336
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,920
a lot of things happened recently.

337
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,360
He won't move an inch away from them.

338
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,800
To lay my hands on Xiaomeng...

339
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,560
is difficult.

340
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,320
If Zhou Xiaomeng

341
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,160
gets married with Zhou Yanzhao,

342
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,840
Zhou Yanzhao would be able

343
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,960
to legitimately keep his position
as the chairman.

344
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,000
Things would be more difficult
for us then.

345
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,800
Therefore,

346
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,320
by any means necessary

347
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,760
we must make Zhou Xiaomeng
disappear for a few days

348
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,680
until the regular board meeting is over

349
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,800
and Zhou Yanzhao has been removed.

350
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,480
It's not too late to let her out then.

351
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,560
What are you trying to do?

352
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,720
Please give us a moment.

353
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,200
A Ze,

354
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,840
why didn't you tell me
that you were coming home?

355
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,400
I just heard that you planned to
do something to Zhou Xiaomeng.

356
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,720
Are you for real?

357
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,600
So what?

358
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,960
Do you know that
she destroyed my plan today?

359
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,840
I don't care if you harm Zhou Yanzhao.

360
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,600
But if you dare touch a hair
on Zhou Xiaomeng,

361
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,160
I will not forgive you!

362
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,040
Enough!

363
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,720
She announced personally
at the board meeting today

364
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,480
she would get married with Zhou Yanzhao.

365
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,360
If they get married,

366
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,120
Zhou Yanzhao would be
the legal heir of Shenghai Group.

367
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,680
Zhou Xiaomeng...

368
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,080
She never loves you.

369
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,360
What is she to you?

370
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,720
I'm your father!

371
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,880
How dare you gang up on me

372
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,880
with those outsiders

373
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,120
over and over again!

374
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,480
If you had listened to me
and become the chairman,

375
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,840
today's incident wouldn't have happened!

376
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,440
You really have no other choice?

377
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,360
You are the Vice President
of Shenghai Group.

378
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,800
You are a successful businessman.

379
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,640
You have so many
projects and opportunities.

380
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,560
Can't you just use your own strength
to defeat Zhou Yanzhao?

381
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,600
What you did today

382
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,400
is basically surrendering to Zhou Yanzhao.

383
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,560
I will never surrender to him!

384
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,120
Even if it's just business,

385
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,840
a kid who's still wet behind the ears

386
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,200
is no match for me!

387
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,640
I just don't want to compete with him.

388
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,600
This position belongs to our family.

389
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,560
Dad, stop lying to yourself.

390
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,240
If you keep doing this,

391
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,920
there will be no turning back.

392
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,080
I don't care about Shenghai Group.

393
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,600
I don't care about being the chairman.

394
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,040
I only care about you!

395
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,360
Just let me think it over.

396
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,800
Leave me.

397
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,040
Get out!

398
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,920
Listen,

399
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,760
put this on hold.

400
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,880
You lay low for a few days.

401
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,200
We'll wait
until they let their guard down.

402
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,400
Then we'll figure out another way.

403
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,840
Yan,

404
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,720
are you home alone?

405
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,560
I'm home, and so is Xiaomeng.

406
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,600
What's the matter?

407
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,080
I have something to talk to you.

408
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,280
All right, where are you?

409
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,360
Why?

410
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,000
Why doesn't he like me?

411
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,480
Why?

412
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,360
Why doesn't he like me back?

413
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,760
You're here.

414
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,520
Jiang Ze, what's the matter with you?

415
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,160
I've been sitting here
for half an hour,...

416
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,920
the chair for the chairman
of Shenghai Group.

417
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,600
My dad is dying to sit on this chair
even in his dreams.

418
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,440
Tell me,...

419
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,320
why do so many people desire
to take up the position

420
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,000
as the chairman of Shenghai Group?

421
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,200
Both you and my father

422
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,640
want to get this seat.

423
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,400
I've been sitting here, thinking about it.

424
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,200
Is this room bigger,

425
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,600
or more spacious?

426
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,120
Or is it the view outside better?

427
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,000
I just think...

428
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,360
it's not that much of a big deal.

429
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,240
I have to take this seat...

430
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,240
because I have to.

431
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,840
If you were given another chance,...

432
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,400
would you have chosen to sit here?

433
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,440
No.

434
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,240
Then why would my father

435
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,400
go to extreme lengths

436
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,720
to get this seat?

437
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,000
He has done so many unscrupulous things.

438
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,840
He would definitely get
a taste of his own medicine at the end.

439
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,840
My father is planning to harm Xiaomeng.

440
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,040
What?

441
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,520
What did you say?

442
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,880
You have to marry her as soon as possible.

443
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,320
This is the best way to protect her.

444
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,160
Why would I have such a father like him?

445
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,200
How could he do this...

446
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,760
just for his personal gain?

447
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,400
I really don't want
to give up on Xiaomeng.

448
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,680
But at the end of the day, he's my father.

449
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,280
I can't give up on him.

450
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,640
I just can't.

451
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,360
Jiang Ze,...

452
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,760
this is not your fault.

453
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,920
You've done more than enough.

454
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,960
Aunt Lin, how are you doing lately?

455
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,920
I'm doing fine.

456
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,440
It's late now. Why isn't Yan home yet?

457
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,440
Mom.

458
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,000
You chatted with Jiang Ze
the entire night.

459
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,960
How are you now?

460
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,080
I'm fine. I drank a little bit of wine.

461
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,640
Come.

462
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,000
I'm a bit worried about you two.

463
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,680
So I thought I'd come over to see you.

464
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,920
I'm sorry, mom.

465
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,320
I should've come to see you

466
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,240
and save you the trip.

467
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,240
What are you talking about?

468
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,960
I have time to spare.

469
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,000
And I understand that
you are busy at work.

470
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,160
I wanted to see Xiaomeng as well.

471
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,200
Yan,...

472
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,480
about the marriage announcement,...

473
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,400
Aunt Lin actually knew about it long ago.

474
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,520
Yan,...

475
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,480
all these years,...

476
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,080
I haven't been by your side.

477
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,640
I couldn't help you with a lot of things.

478
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,560
Now we are finally reunited.

479
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,200
I heard from Xiaomeng
about the things between you two.

480
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,800
I really wanted to talk to you

481
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,960
but I was worried that

482
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,480
I wouldn't have the ear of you.

483
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,920
Mom, I'm all ears.

484
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,800
I like Xiaomeng

485
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,840
from the bottom of my heart.

486
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,720
She's innocent and kind.

487
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,520
Especially after seeing the way
she treats Tiankong,

488
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,600
I deeply respect her.

489
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,160
So when I knew
you guys were in a relationship,

490
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,960
I was over the moon.

491
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,920
I think you two are
a match made in heaven,

492
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,160
and deserve to be together.

493
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,960
Mom, I understand what you mean.

494
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,200
Actually, Xiaomeng and I

495
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,480
have always seen each other
as the one and only.

496
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,440
For the rest of my life,

497
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,880
I'll never love any other woman than her.

498
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,320
Then why do you hesitate?

499
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,200
Aunt Lin,

500
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,280
Yan just thinks that
now is not the best time

501
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,200
to get married.

502
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,920
Then when would be the best time?

503
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,160
As long as you love each other enough,

504
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,680
now or later won't make any difference.

505
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,680
Mom,

506
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,400
now a lot of people in Shenghai
know Xiaomeng's shares

507
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,080
can make me the major shareholder.

508
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,360
I'm worried that they'd harm Xiaomeng.

509
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,200
So I think we should wait.

510
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,080
When those people have given up,

511
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,280
we can then lead a better life.

512
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,600
Son,

513
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,360
I have to say that
you don't understand women.

514
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,760
In situations like this,

515
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,320
you should make her feel protected.

516
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,640
What do you think marriage is?

517
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,640
Making ends meet as a family?

518
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,360
Just living life together?

519
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,680
That's not the case.

520
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,600
The true meaning of marriage

521
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,120
is that when you've got married,

522
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,680
you are able to
go through challenges together.

523
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,520
You always think

524
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,360
the best way to protect Xiaomeng

525
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,120
is to keep her away from danger.

526
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,840
Am I right?

527
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,360
You've largely underestimated
how much she can take.

528
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,400
She's much tougher

529
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,120
than you think.

530
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,760
On the contrary,

531
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,520
when you face challenges on your own,...

532
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,320
it will add to her worries and fear.

533
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,800
Do you realize that?

534
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,240
You've been through thick and thin.

535
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,880
You should come to a conclusion on this.

536
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,400
Xiaomeng,...

537
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,200
do you really think so?

538
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,320
What Aunt Lin has said

539
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,440
is exactly what I think.

540
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,000
It's just that...

541
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,920
I can't put them into words.

has come up in the office.

I have to get on it now.

Guang will drive you home.
You wait for me there.

The office?

629
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,680
Is it about Jiang Qingcheng?

630
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,960
Have they caused trouble again?

631
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:31,960
No,...

632
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,080
it's just some simple issues
about a business deal.

633
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,560
I will fix that quickly.

634
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,320
You have to come home early.

635
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,760
I'll be waiting for you.

636
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,280

637
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,360

00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,840
All right.

639
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,720
Hello, please have some tea.

640
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,720
-Thank you.
-Okay.

641
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,880
Sorry to keep you waiting.

642
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,400
-No worries.
-Please have a seat.

643
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,640
Mr. Zhou, we've come here today

644
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,440
because we've been investigating the case
about your father for a long time,

645
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,480
and we finally have some breakthrough.

646
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,880
Does that come from the photos I send you?

647
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,360
We have compared those photos

648
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,640
against the surveillance footage
in the neighborhood,

649
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,880
and the CCTV footage in the vicinity.

650
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,160
We can basically confirm
that the person in the photos

651
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,880
once drove near your house.

652
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,480
The video footage shows that

653
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,280
once that person got to the neighborhood,

654
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,680
he changed into an electrician's uniform
in his car.

655
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,520
We've also checked against

656
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,960
the employee profiles
of the electric company.

657
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,360
The person in the photos is not in there.

658
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,160
There was no electrical problem

659
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,440
in the neighborhood on that day.

660
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,440
So it's very likely that
before the day of the crime,

661
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,440
this person disguised himself
as an electrician

662
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,440
and entered your house.

663
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,040
He's a primary suspect now.

664
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,240
What do you want from me after all this?

665
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,080
I just want to tell you

666
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,960
you did a great job previously.

667
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,680
We racked our brains

668
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,560
but Zhou Yanzhao
still managed to find a way

669
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,120
to get a firmer foothold in the company.

670
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,880
We tried separating him and Zhou Xiaomeng.

671
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,720
But now,...

672
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,160
they are getting closer.

673
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,480
Never mind.

674
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,040
Although things have played out like this,

675
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,400
there is always a way out.

676
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,480
Right now, you still have to
keep a close eye on Zhou Yanzhao for me.

677
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,360
In Shenghai,

678
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,640
you can still get him to trust you.

679
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,560
I...

680
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,160
I don't stand a chance.

681
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,000
I've failed.

682
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,800
As I see it...

683
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,560
Just spit it out.

684
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,200
I think...

685
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,920
your plan has pretty much failed too.

686
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,760
We haven't failed.

687
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,960
Outwardly,

688
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,320
Zhou Yanzhao has a firm foothold.

689
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,320
But that doesn't mean

690
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,960
he can walk a smooth path in the future.

691
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,920
But I...

692
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,160
What's wrong? You want to quit?

693
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,880
I'm going leave Shenghai and start again.

694
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,920
Are you switching sides?

695
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,520
Do you really think you can quit on me?

696
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,880
Even if you want to quit,...

697
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,400
what about your family?

698
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,240
Your brother-in-law is still in jail.

699
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,560
Who's going to take care of him?

700
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,200
Have you thought about this?

701
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,520
Don't tell me...

702
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,800
that you've fallen in love
with Zhou Yanzhao.

703
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,680
No.

704
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,280
I'm glad to hear that.

705
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,680
Listen,...

706
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,080
I need you to go to the Finance Department

707
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:24,560
and get the funding transfer agreement
for the Dikai project.

708
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,000
My signature is on it.

709
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,080
That is my application form
for funding transfer.

710
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,000
Zhou Yanzhao is coming back.

711
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,560
We can't let him know about this.

712
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,520
You must get the agreement back
as soon as possible.

713
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,880
Get it? How?

714
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,360
Zhou Yanzhao has put Chang Qingyan

715
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,320
in charge of the finance.

716
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,880
I'm sure you'll figure out a way.

717
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,360
But you have to make sure

718
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,080
Chang Qingyan

719
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,000
will not suspect anything.

720
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,440
If the agreement
ends up in the hands of Zhou Yanzhao,

721
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,960
the consequences would be unimaginable.

722
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,400
It won't be good for neither you nor me.

723
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,280
What if he's already got the agreement?

724
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,400
If that's the case,

725
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,840
then take it back from him.

726
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,440
-But I...
-Lingxi!

727
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,280
You brother-in-law is still in jail.

728
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,920
You still have to take care of

729
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,640
your sister and her child.

730
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,200
What if...

731
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,880
they've got into
some sort of trouble accidentally.

732
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,440
Lingxi, what do you think you should do?

733
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,480
This is the last time.

734
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,960
I'll help you this one last time.

735
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,080
I trust your ability.

736
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,280
Lingxi, I just told you
you did a great job.

737
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,880
I will pay you handsomely for your work.

738
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,600
The money in this card

739
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,680
is enough for your sister and her child

740
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,920
to emigrate abroad.
