00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,600
(Episode 40)

2
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,160
Qingyan.

3
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,920
Thank you.

4
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,360
The elevator is here.

5
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,200
Mr. Zhou.

6
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,880
They won't get away with this.

7
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,920
Go back and get some rest.

8
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,600
I'll let you know right away
if anything happens.

9
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,800
I won't let my father's life work
be destroyed...

10
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,760
on my watch.

11
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,520
I have faith in you.

12
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,480
You will succeed.

13
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,600
Qingyan.

14
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,680
Everyone else is avoiding me now.

15
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,880
Only you are standing up for me
and helping me.

16
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,560
I don't want to thank you too much.

17
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,120
But after this blows over,

18
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,480
I will place you in an important position.

19
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,240
Mr. Zhou, all I'm doing
is what I should be doing.

20
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,680
Thank you for always
thinking highly of me.

21
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,520
You may go up.

22
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,760
Mr. Zhou. Goodbye.

23
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,480
Goodbye.

24
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,680
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

25
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,640
Brother Yan.
There are many reporters at the gate.

26
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,320
Shall we come back later?

27
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,520
I just want to be left in peace at home.

28
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,200
But these reporters are just like flies
hanging around my gate.

29
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,600
I have an idea.

30
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,920
What?

31
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,760
You may have to suffer a bit.

32
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,800
Zhou Yanzhao!

33
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,160
Quick! It's Zhou Yanzhao!

34
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,840
-Mr. Zhou!
-Mr. Zhou!

35
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,000
Mr. Zhou! Wait!

36
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,480
Talk to us, Mr. Zhou!

37
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,320
Mr. Zhou!

38
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,280
Mom, look at the sea.

39
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,120
It's so beautiful.

40
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,600
Let's take a seat.

41
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,600
Sister Hua, look after my mother.

42
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,440
I'm going to make a call.

43
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,160
Here, cover yourself up.

44
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,280
I feel pretty warm.

45
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,440
(Xiaomeng)

46
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,480
(Xiaomeng)

47
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,800
(Xiaomeng)

48
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,600
(Xiao Sizhi)

49
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,920
(Qiao Zhen)

50
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,360
Qiao Zhen, why do you call me
at this time?

51
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,520
Shouldn't you be at work?

52
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,880
Is Xiaomeng with you?

53
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,120
No, she's not.

54
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,720
I'm outside. She's probably in her room

55
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,880
taking care of Aunt Ye.

56
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,320
What's wrong?

57
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,000
Let me tell you then.

58
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,360
Have you seen the online news lately?

59
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,200
I haven't been online.

60
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,160
I've been so busy.

61
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,560
I don't have time for online news.

62
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,680
Besides we don't get good signal here.

63
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,240
Has something happened?

64
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,200
I'll tell you simply.

65
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,880
Zhou Yanzhao isn't Zhou Binli's son.

66
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,560
He's Director Lin's illegitimate son.

67
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,400
What?

68
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,280
Zhou Yanzhao is Director Lin's son?

69
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,080
Yes. This is blowing up
in Nanyue right now.

70
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,840
The press is going to town with it.

71
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,240
They're even making things up
and distorting the facts.

72
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,400
How is Zhou Yanzhao now?

73
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,120
Since it happened,

74
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,240
he hasn't appeared in public.

75
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,960
Shall we tell Xiaomeng?

76
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,080
No, we mustn't let Xiaomeng know.

77
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,640
Looking after Aunt Ye
is already taking up all her energy.

78
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,440
If she finds out,
she might not be able to take it.

79
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,800
That's what I'm afraid of.

80
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,360
That's why I called you first.

81
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,000
No matter what happens,

82
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,240
you must keep me updated.

83
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,240
I'll try...

84
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,480
to keep them here as long as I can.

85
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,760
That's all we can do.

86
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,400
We'll hide it from her as long as we can.

87
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,600
All right, I'm going back to work.

88
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,560
Take care of yourselves.

89
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,400
You too. Take care.

90
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,360
Xiao Sizhi.

91
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,600
I miss you.

92
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,800
I miss you too.

93
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,760
Couldn't you have said that first?

94
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,120
Idiot.

95
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,760
All right, I'll go now.

96
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,240
Bye.

97
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,120
Dr. Xiao.

98
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,080
Was that Qiao Zhen on the phone?

99
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,160
Yes. Who else could it have been?

100
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,240
There's nothing much.

101
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,280
She asked how we are.

102
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,360
How are they in Nanyue?

103
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,920
How's A Yan?

104
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,120
He's doing really well.

105
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,640
Qiao Zhen just said they're doing fine.

106
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,760
We shouldn't worry.

107
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,280
Is Aunt Ye asleep?

108
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,680
She is asleep.

109
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,680
You should rest early too.

110
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,200
Take care of yourself.

111
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,440
I'm not tired. But you have been so busy.

112
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,720
You must be exhausted.

113
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,800
We shouldn't be so polite with each other.

114
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,080
Take care of yourself.

115
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,920
Get some rest.

116
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,240
I won't bother you then.

117
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,080
Okay.

118
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,880
Brother Yan.

119
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,840
(Xiaomeng)

120
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,960
I've made some noodles.

121
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,800
Have some.

122
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,240
No thanks.

123
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,360
You've been boxing for a long time.

124
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,200
Your body won't be able to take it.

125
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,920
I'm not hungry.

126
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,960
(Xiaomeng)

127
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,360
Xiaomeng called you several times.

128
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,800
They don't live here anymore.

129
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,080
I'm alone in such a big house.

130
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,920
It's making me think too much.

131
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,000
Boxing helps me to calm down

132
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,120
and think clearly about what to do.

133
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,240
Xiaomeng, is that you?

134
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,320
What are you doing here?

135
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,160
I don't want to see you.

136
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,120
You only want to see Xiaomeng
and not your own dad.

137
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,920
That's not right of you.

138
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,400
Have you ever done a single thing right?

139
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,520
You're still young.

140
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,200
You can only see the surface
of many issues.

141
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,240
All I did was for you.

142
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,040
By the time you grow up,
when you reach my position,

143
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,560
you'll understand.

144
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,640
Here's some bird's nest.

145
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,200
It's good for you.

146
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,320
Get better and come back to help me.

147
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,080
Are you done?

148
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,360
If you're done, please leave.

149
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,240
Take your bird's nest with you.

150
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,880
Stop being childish.

151
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,200
You are the future CEO of Shenghai Group.

152
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,800
What does that mean?

153
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,160
What have you done now?

154
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,120
Listen.

155
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,680
You saved Ye Sirong.

156
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,880
Now make Xiaomeng marry you.

157
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,040
She won't turn you down.

158
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,560
If you marry her,

159
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,920
we'll be able to get all
the Shenghai shares she owns.

160
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,040
You're pretty up to date.

161
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,160
I do like Xiaomeng.

162
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,680
But I will never use that to get her.

163
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,920
Sit down.

164
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,760
I want to talk to you.

165
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,920
There's nothing to talk about!

166
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,920
To you, your son is just a pawn

167
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,720
for you to get more power and money.

168
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,840
Have you ever considered my feelings?

169
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,680
You've ruined my life

170
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,040
because of your desire.

171
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,360
From today onwards,

172
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,120
you, Jiang Qingcheng, and I, Jiang Ze,

173
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,320
are no longer father and son.

174
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,360
Is that understood?

175
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,520
Let me repeat myself.

176
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,960
We are no longer related to each other.

177
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,800
Leave now. I never want to see you again.

178
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm doing this for you! Don't you get it?

179
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,320
What a hypocrite.

180
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,720
All you did is for yourself.

181
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,840
You're my son. I'm your father.
You have to listen to me!

182
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,200
Marry Xiaomeng and you will
become the biggest shareholder

183
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,280
in Shenghai Group.

184
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,480
If you don't listen to me...

185
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,400
If I don't listen to you,
what will you do to me?

186
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,360
If you don't listen to me,
you will be my enemy!

187
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,400
Great.

188
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,960
You're finally saying how you really feel.

189
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,080
I will be your enemy then!

190
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,960
You!

191
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,480
Stop!

192
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,560
Where are you going?

193
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
Stupid kid.

194
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,560
He drives me crazy.

195
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,240
Mom, the cucumber salad is really good.

196
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,080
Have more of it.

197
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,920
Okay.

198
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,400
-Thank you.
-Sister Hua, you eat some too.

199
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,280
Sister Hua, the carrots are really good.

200
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,240
Really?

201
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,080
Let me try them.

202
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,160
A Yan,

203
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,440
how have you been?

204
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,040
I'm doing well here at the nursing home.

205
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,000
Mom is doing well too.

206
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,120
But...

207
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,080
I really miss you.

208
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,800
Brother Yan.

209
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,160
Are you really keeping this from Xiaomeng?

210
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,040
I told her to go to the Home

211
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,680
because I wanted her
to leave before everything happens.

212
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,680
She doesn't need to know

213
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,600
about my problems.

214
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,000
You can't keep it from her.

215
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,640
She'll find out when she comes back.

216
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,840
Then I'll send her away again.

217
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,000
That's all...

218
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,080
I can do for her now.

219
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,600
I'll let her take care of her mother,

220
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,720
while I deal with things here alone.

221
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,920
Brother Yan, you're not alone.

222
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,400
I'm here.

223
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,800
Guang, go home.

224
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,440
They'll go after everyone around me.

225
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,320
Staying here...

226
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,360
will get you into trouble.

227
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,640
I promised Uncle to protect you
with all my life.

228
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,680
I'm all about principles.

229
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,800
If I leave now, I'll be a terrible person.

230
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,920
Aren't you afraid
I'd get you into trouble?

231
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,240
If I were, I wouldn't be working for you.

232
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,040
Now

233
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,520
everyone is avoiding me.

234
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,320
They're avoiding me as much as they can.

235
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,920
Only you are willing to stay by me.

236
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,000
Uncle Fang was right about you.

237
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,600
He worked for your father his entire life.

238
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,680
I want to do the same with you.

239
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,280
Thank you.

240
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,080
By the way, Brother Yan.

241
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,000
Do you still want me to follow
the person you asked me to?

242
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,160
Follow him closely.

243
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,400
At this moment,

244
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,280
he'll definitely meet the person
who instigated him.

245
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,600
If we get a hold on him,

246
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,160
we'll get a hold
of the person behind all these.

247
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,280
Don't worry.

248
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,480
I'll get it done.

249
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,680
Guang.

250
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,320
Thank you. Be safe.

251
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,520
Don't worry about me, Brother Yan.

252
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,080
Just protect yourself.

253
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,120
See you.

254
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,000
Okay.

255
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,520
(Lin Yueling)

256
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:32,920
Zhou Yanzhao!

257
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,520
Quick!

258
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,280
Don't run! Mr. Zhou! Don't run!

259
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,920
Mr. Zhou, talk to us.

260
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,720
-Talk to us.
-Yes.

261
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,120
-Answer us.
-Mr. Zhou.

262
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,080
Talk to us.

263
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,160
Please talk to us.

264
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,600
Please help us.

265
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,440
Take our questions.

266
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,280
We want an interview, Mr. Zhou.

267
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,120
Yes, Mr. Zhou.

268
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,360
Tell us.

269
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,160
Is the news on TV true?

270
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,680
Yes, Mr. Zhou.

271
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,240
All right, photograph me.

272
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,200
You want to photograph me?

273
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,080
That's not Zhou Yanzhao.

274
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,640
Photograph me. Come on.

275
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,880
Where are you going? Come on.

276
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,120
Let's go.

277
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,200
Don't you want to photograph me?

278
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,480
What are you doing here?

279
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,520
Shouldn't you be at the nursing home?

280
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,800
Do you have alcohol? I came for a drink.

281
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,800
Yes.

282
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,200
I heard about the company

283
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,160
and your mother.

284
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,120
What about Xiaomeng? Does she know?

285
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,080
She doesn't know.

286
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,440
If she had known,

287
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,120
I wouldn't be the one talking to you here.

288
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,440
That's good then.

289
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,800
What are your plans?

290
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,840
You plan to deal with it alone?

291
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,720
Xiaomeng has too much on her plate.

292
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,000
I don't want to add this to her worries.

293
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,040
I don't want her to worry
about me anymore.

294
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,120
If she hadn't known you from before,

295
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,240
I would've thought you're just
putting on an act.

296
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,280
How is Xiaomeng doing?

297
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,040
It's pretty tough on her.

298
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,360
But you can tell she's happy.

299
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,920
That's good.

300
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,280
After I heard about this,

301
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,320
I plan to take her away from here.

302
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,600
Why are you so nervous?

303
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,440
I was just joking.

304
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,080
Even if you were serious,
Xiaomeng would never go with you.

305
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,760
You could keep that to yourself.

306
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,200
You didn't have to say that out loud.

307
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,360
Be kind to me.

308
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,880
I'd thought many times

309
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,960
about taking Xiaomeng away.

310
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,880
But I can't leave.

311
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,560
I can't just watch my father's life work

312
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,880
getting destroyed.

313
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,480
Don't think too much. Let's drink.

314
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,240
Bro,

315
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,240
hang in there.

316
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,400
I'm leaving now.

317
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,320
Mom.

318
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,480
-I've brought food.
-You're home.

319
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,160
You must be hungry.

320
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,720
I'm okay.

321
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,240
I had some fruits earlier.

322
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,080
I'm okay.

323
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,440
I'm going to get cutlery.

324
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,560
Mom, today

325
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,760
I made you pork ribs soup.

326
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,440
You know, I had to go really far
to get vegetables.

327
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,840
I walked so far before I found
some carrots and corn.

328
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,000
Smell it. Does it smell good?

329
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,040
Yes.

330
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,440
Let me get you a bowl.

331
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,760
Xiaomeng,
you're getting so good at cooking.

332
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,440
And that is all for today's news.

333
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,040
Now for a piece of breaking news.

334
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,640
Shenghai Corp is embroiled
in another scandal

335
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,080
-Mom.
-since the fiasco with its last project.

336
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,120
Don't watch TV while eating.

337
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,040
We can watch it later.

338
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,840
The current CEO of Shenghai, Zhou Yanzhao,

339
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,640
isn't the biological son of ex-CEO,
Zhou Binli.

340
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,520
Zhou Yanzhao was someone else's son.

341
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,840
His mother is the director

342
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,440
of the Children Welfare Center,
Lin Yueling.

343
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,400
This has caused a stir in society
and the business sector.

344
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,800
It has a great impact
on Shenghai Group itself.

345
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,920
Its shares have crashed.

346
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,240
According to a source,

347
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,080
Zhou Yanzhao has been fired by the board.

348
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,520
He will not be responsible
for any more projects.

349
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,720
Since this happened,

350
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,080
Zhou Yanzhao has not appeared in public.

351
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,520
Many questions are still left hanging.

352
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,840
What?

353
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,440
A Yan isn't Zhou Binli's son?

354
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,520
How did they find out?

355
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,440
How could it be?

356
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,480
How could it be?

357
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,280
Aunt Ye, what's wrong with Xiaomeng?

358
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,040
Xiaomeng.

359
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,280
We just heard on the news

360
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,880
that A Yan isn't Zhou Binli's son.

361
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,200
What?

362
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,480
He isn't his son?

363
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,640
You found out about it after all.

364
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,920
You already knew.

365
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,480
I planned to keep it from you longer.

366
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,680
Qiao Zhen and I didn't want you to know.

367
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,880
Dr. Xiao,
you shouldn't have kept it from me.

368
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,320
I know.

369
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,240
I see it now.

370
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,040
A Yan didn't want me to go back.

371
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,640
He wanted me to stay here with my mom

372
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,480
because of this.

373
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,200
He didn't want to get me involved.

374
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,360
That's why he hid everything from me

375
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,200
and took it all upon himself.

376
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,560
Xiaomeng.

377
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,840
He wants you to live well
without troubles.

378
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,600
But I want to be with him! Especially...

379
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,640
Especially at times like this.

380
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,400
You should try to see his point of view.

381
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,840
What about mine?

382
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,280
He's having problems now.

383
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,480
I can't face them with him.

384
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,080
He's facing all this backlash alone.

385
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,760
What does he take me for?

386
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,040
A flower in a greenhouse?

387
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,200
Xiaomeng.

388
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,040
Dr. Xiao.

389
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,040
I'm going back to my mom.

390
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,600
Mom, why didn't you eat at all?

391
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,960
Is the news right about A Yan?

392
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,200
Don't worry.

393
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,200
He'll find a way to resolve this.

394
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,640
So you already knew.

395
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,800
For A Yan's sake,

396
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,600
Aunt Lin and I promised

397
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,440
not to tell it to anyone.

398
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,400
But I don't know how the press found out.

399
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,200
Mom.

400
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,960
I want to be with A Yan.

401
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,520
Xiaomeng, I've thought about it.

402
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,520
I have Sister Hua and Dr. Xiao here.

403
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,760
A Yan is all alone.

404
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,840
You should be with him.

405
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,200
But I'm worried about you.

406
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,680
Don't worry about me.

407
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,560
I was too rash before.

408
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,960
I did a stupid thing.

409
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,680
I'll never do anything like that again.

410
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,680
I won't abandon you ever.

411
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,760
Mom.

412
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,240
Go.

413
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,520
I'll be fine.

414
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,160
A Yan needs you.

415
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,520
I won't give you more trouble
at a time like this.

416
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,480
Don't worry about me.

417
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,880
Thanks, Mom.

418
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,000
I'll come back as soon as I can.

419
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,280
Be careful.

420
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,840
Take care of A Yan.

421
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,280
Go now.

422
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,960
Xiaomeng, I have faith in you.

423
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,320
You need to go back

424
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,160
to help A Yan protect Shenghai.

425
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:44,880
Xiaomeng.

426
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,680
Xiaomeng.

427
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,120
Sister Hua, where's Xiaomeng?

428
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,280
She has gone back.

429
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,040
She went back after all.

430
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,360
Dr. Ye just told me about what happened.

431
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,920
I was planning to go back soon.

432
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,000
But now I will stay

433
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,120
and take care of Aunt Ye instead.

434
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,240
Thank you, Dr. Xiao.

435
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,160
Aunt Ye.

436
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,800
Please don't stand on ceremony with me.

437
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,720
Hello?

438
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,800
Qiao Zhen.

439
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,760
Xiaomeng has found out
about A Yan's matter.

440
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,600
She's gone back.

441
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,080
Didn't we agree to keep it from her?

442
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,320
Why did you let her come back
to the tiger's den?

443
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,360
I tried to hide it from her.
But she saw it on TV.

444
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,080
Oh no, what a silly girl.

445
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,320
She'll definitely be embroiled
in the scandal here.

446
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,000
Whatever the case,
please take care of her.

447
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,920
Don't worry. I will protect her

448
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,000
once she's back.

449
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,280
Take care of Aunt Ye over there.

450
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,520
Don't worry. I will.

451
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,480
Take care of yourself too.

452
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,000
Also, Qiao Zhen. Be very careful.

453
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,480
I know.

454
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,840
Qiao Zhen?

455
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,040
What are you doing here?

456
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,040
Xiao Sizhi told me you came back.

457
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,680
So I came here to wait for you.

458
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,080
I knew it.

459
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,400
Dr. Xiao would tell you everything.

460
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,800
Do you know how much trouble
you'll get into by being back?

461
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,040
Everyone's talking about Zhou Yanzhao now.

462
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,640
But Qiao Zhen,

463
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,760
I can't let A Yan face
these problems on his own.

464
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,560
I won't ask about your relationship.

465
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,040
But it's really dangerous now.

466
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,400
Zhou Yanzhao hasn't appeared
in a few days.

467
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,280
All the reporters are waiting
in front of his gate.

468
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,880
But I want to go home right now.

469
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,800
Qiao Zhen.

470
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,800
What should I do?

471
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,560
I'll help you.

472
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,640
Go over there. I'll distract them.

473
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,760
Okay. Go on.

474
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,280
Xiaomeng!

475
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,600
Xiaomeng is over there!

476
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,640
Let's go after her! It's Zhou Xiaomeng!

477
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,440
She said Zhou Xiaomeng is over there.

478
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,440
Let's go!

479
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,600
Let's go! Quick!

480
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,160
-Quick!
-Hurry!

481
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,320
Where is she?

482
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,160
-Maybe she's ahead.
-I can't see her!

483
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,240
She's ahead!

484
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,480
A Yan. A Yan.

485
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,840
A Yan.

486
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,960
A Yan, are you all right?

487
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,240
Are you all right?

488
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,400
You look awful.

489
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,480
How much have you drunk?

490
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,080
Xiaomeng.

491
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,440
I'm back.

492
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,440
Who told you to come back?

493
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,600
I saw the news

494
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,840
and came back right away.

495
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,080
Why do you come back?

496
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,160
Go back there. You're not needed here.

497
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,240
Please.

498
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,680
Stop pushing me away.

499
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,880
No matter what happens,

500
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,280
I'll face it with you.

501
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,120
No!

502
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,920
Come on, Iet me take you to bed.

503
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,720
Get up.

504
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,440
Lie down.

505
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,440
Wait here.

506
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,440
I'll bring you some medicine.

507
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,520
Come on.

508
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,640
I made seafood congee.

509
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,280
I don't know if it tastes good.

510
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,680
Try it.

511
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,080
How is it?

512
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,240
It isn't good?

513
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,680
I know I'm not as good as Sister Hua.

514
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,520
It's pretty good.

515
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:21,880
Really?

516
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,800
Try it.

517
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,080
It's a little watery.

518
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,480
Why did you wear the ring again?

519
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,520
A Yan, I'm wearing this ring

520
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,680
to let you know

521
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,240
that no matter what others say about you,

522
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,520
it's not because
you're someone's son that I love you.

523
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,960
I love you for who you are.

524
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,400
Whether it was in the past, now,
or in the future,

525
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,760
my feelings for you will never change.

526
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,520
Ignore it.

527
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,520
It's probably those reporters.

528
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,880
Hello? Qiao Zhen.

529
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,920
Open the door.

530
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,480
So that was you?

531
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,400
Yes, I pushed the doorbell

532
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,520
but nobody came.

533
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,480
Okay, got it.

534
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,360
I'll come now.

535
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,280
Qiao Zhen, come in.

536
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,480
You weren't mobbed by reporters?

537
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,360
How did you get in?

538
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,440
They're almost all gone.

539
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,760
I managed to lure them away.

540
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,120
Lure them away?

541
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,360
You're so impressive.

542
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,320
Come, take a seat.

543
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,200
Qiao Zhen, thanks for coming
at such a time.

544
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,600
Don't be so formal.

545
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,720
Xiaomeng is my friend.

546
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,760
Her problems are my problems.

547
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,120
There are still some reporters out there.

548
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,920
So I bought some things for you guys.

549
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,840
Thank you, Qiao Zhen.

550
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,720
Let me take it.

551
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,640
Qiao Zhen, take a seat.

552
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,160
I was pretty worried about you guys.

553
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,360
But A Yan is looking so radiant,
thanks to you.

554
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,560
Xiaomeng, be strong.

555
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,320
No matter what happens,
we're here for you.

556
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,160
She's lucky to have friends like you.

557
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,880
By the way, Mr. Zhou, what are your plans?

558
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,760
Instead of being a sitting duck,

559
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,720
I think I should go on the offensive.

560
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,960
Whatever happen, it will happen.

561
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,080
We'll have to face it eventually.

562
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,120
I totally agree.

563
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,360
I think no matter what happens,

564
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,840
you will face it with courage.

565
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,640
I'm really sorry.

566
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,000
With all this happening,

567
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,280
you and Xiao Sizhi
have no time left to date.

568
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,800
It's okay, we're doing well.

569
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,040
I was actually really
worried about you guys.

570
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,160
But seeing you guys now

571
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,280
put my mind at ease.

572
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,640
Xiaomeng.

573
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,320
Can we talk?

574
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,560
Sure.

575
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,200
Am I worth to come back to?

576
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,640
If I said you were worth it,

577
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,520
you'll definitely laugh at me.

578
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,760
But even so,

579
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,400
I still want to say,

580
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,200
you're worth it.

581
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,480
I've done so many nasty things to you.

582
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,360
Don't you hate me?

583
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,120
No.

584
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,240
The more forgiving you are,

585
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,240
the more I feel like a scoundrel.

586
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,800
I understand what you did.

587
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,440
If I were you,

588
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,120
I probably would've done the same.

589
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,080
Don't try to make me feel better.

590
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,840
I'm not making you feel better.

591
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,880
I know what you are really like.

592
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,920
That's why I want to be with you
this time.

593
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,120
We'll go through this together.
