00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,760
(Episode 45)

2
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,200
Don't answer it.

3
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,600
Mobile phones emit harmful radiation
that's bad for your health.

4
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,520
Why?

5
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,080
What if there are urgent matters?

6
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,960
What should I do?

7
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,240
I will answer it for you.

8
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,400
Hello.

9
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,800
Sister Xiaomeng.

10
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,200
Is that Tiankong?

11
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,000
This is Brother Yan.

12
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,280
Sister Xiaomeng
cannot answer the call right now.

13
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,280
You can tell me anything.

14
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,400
I miss Sister Xiaomeng.

15
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,240
She hasn't visited me for a long time.

16
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,640
Hello, Tiankong.

17
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,040
This is Sister Xiaomeng.

18
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,400
Have you been a good boy?

19
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,320
Sister Xiaomeng, I've been good.

20
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,120
Why didn't you come to see me?

21
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,360
Do you know that I came in first

22
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,800
in a drawing competition?

23
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,800
Tiankong, you are amazing!

24
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,040
I will visit you
at the welfare center soon.

25
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,880
It's Children's Day tomorrow.

26
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,320
Mom Lin has prepared us

27
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,240
to put up a performance.

28
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,480
Can you come?

29
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,760
Sister Xiaomeng,

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,800
I really want you to come.

31
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,120
Tomorrow?

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,800
Sure, I will see you tomorrow.

33
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,960
Great! Thank you, Sister Xiaomeng.

34
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,080
We will be waiting for you.

35
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,440
Alright. I won't do it again.

36
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,800
Don't get mad. Smile.

37
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,600
It's moving.

38
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,040
Really moving.

39
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,920
It's moving.

40
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,280
How can it be so soon?

41
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,400
I can really feel it.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Qingyan?

43
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,160
Aren't you going to let me in?

44
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,480
Please come in.

45
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,200
Thank you.

46
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,080
Why are you here?

47
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,040
Is there something wrong?

48
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,560
We have submitted the USB flash drive,

49
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,320
which you gave to Chairman Zhou,
to the police.

50
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,120
It won't be long before

51
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,600
the police contacts you.

52
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,560
Are you alright, Lingxi?

53
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,480
I deserve punishment
as I've made mistakes.

54
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,560
I am prepared.

55
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,080
Just tell me

56
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,360
if you need any help.

57
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,080
It's really fine.

58
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,720
Lingxi,

59
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,480
you may reject my feelings for you,

60
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,120
but you can't

61
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,480
reject my help.

62
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,280
You said

63
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,640
we would be friends forever.

64
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,120
Shouldn't friends help each other

65
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,600
in troubled times?

66
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,480
I'm sure this period of time,

67
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,760
there must be many things
that you need to see to.

68
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,640
Please let me help you.

69
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,920
-Mom, I'm fine.
-Be careful.

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,160
-Be careful.
-It's really not necessary.

71
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,640
Be careful.

72
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,800
What's the occasion today?

73
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,400
That's a feast for a breakfast.

74
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,480
Isn't it too much?

75
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,800
Alright. Be careful.

76
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,560
Call me once there's updates.

77
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,280
-Sit down.
-Come here, take a seat.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,960
Xiaomeng, this is A Yan's idea.

79
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,480
I guess every meal
is going to be like this

80
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,000
from now on.

81
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,360
Exactly, Xiaomeng.

82
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,320
It's how A Yan shows his concern for you.

83
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,600
This is too exaggerated.

84
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,000
These are

85
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,480
all prepared by mom.

86
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,560
They are good for pregnant women.

87
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,120
You must eat it.

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,560
-The medicinal soup is here.
-Here it comes.

89
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,000
Come on. Try it.

90
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,400
Sure.

91
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,320
What's wrong?

92
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,040
What is it?

93
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,720
It smells bad.

94
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,400
It is good for you.

95
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,680
Finish it all.

96
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,600
Finish it.

97
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,120
This is ten tonics soup.

98
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,560
It is packed with goodness for the baby.

99
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,280
As you are weak,
you need to build up your body

100
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,800
with such nutritious food.

101
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,920
Have some.

102
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,360
Don't burn your lips.

103
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,040
This...

104
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,800
is nasty.

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,280
Bitter medicines are good for health.

106
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,040
Just do this for the baby.

107
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,560
Will I be released

108
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,800
after I've finished this?

109
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,840
Wherever you go,

110
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,680
we have to ensure the safety of the baby.

111
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,600
No, I...

112
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,920
I am still worried.

113
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,120
I will accompany you wherever you go.

114
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,200
Go on.

115
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,480
Go on.

116
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Have more.

117
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,360
Let's eat, mom.

118
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,360
You should eat too.

119
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,720
Come on.

120
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,320
Take one of these.

121
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,520
-This...
-It is stewed with black chicken broth,

122
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,480
it's very nutritious.

123
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,960
Watch out. Don't blast it.

124
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,480
Watch me.

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,080
That's clever.

126
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,400
-Here.
-Thank you, Teacher.

127
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,720
Teacher will hang them up together.

128
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,840
Teacher, take a look at this.

129
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,560
-Teacher, check out mine.
-Come, let's hang it here.

130
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,520
Teacher, I like this color.

131
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,480
Here, do it yourself.

132
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,800
Hello.

133
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,920
Hello.

134
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,160
Is this Zhou Xiaomeng's home?

135
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,360
Yes, may I know who this is?

136
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,800
I am her colleague at the TV channel.

137
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,760
I want to give her some files.

138
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,040
Is she home?

139
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,080
Xiaomeng is not at home.

140
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,360
She is at the welfare center
for an activity.

141
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,920
Why not

142
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,480
you send it to our home directly?

143
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,560
I'm at home.

144
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,320
Sure, thank you.

145
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,480
(Celebration of Children’s Day)

146
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,560
Here, I will give you another one.

147
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,520
Hold it.

148
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,080
Sister Xiaomeng.

149
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,800
Sister Xiaomeng.

150
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,320
-You are here.
-Tiankong.

151
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,000
Tiankong.

152
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,680
-Do you miss me?
-Yes.

153
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,880
But I miss Sister Xiaomeng more.

154
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,200
You have such a fickle mind,

155
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,520
I've wasted my efforts
buying you so many toys.

156
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,040
Sister Xiaomeng.

157
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,720
Our performance is about to start.

158
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,560
Will you be our host?

159
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,960
Sure.

160
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,840
Can you show me around?

161
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,720
Sure.

162
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,920
Good.

163
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,400
Let's go.

164
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,360
Sure.

165
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,400
Don't blast it.

166
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,840
(Guang)

167
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,000
-Sister Xiaomeng, you sit here.
-Sure.

168
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,440
Balloons will be put here later.

169
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,640
This is our stage.

170
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,400
There will be singing, dancing

171
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,880
and a short play.

172
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,800
How is it?

173
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,360
I have been searching

174
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,920
but I have no clues.

175
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,360
Alright.

176
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,160
Keep in touch with Qingyan.

177
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,160
See if there are any updates
in the company.

178
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,080
Brother Yan,

179
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,200
why are we helping Jiang Qingcheng?

180
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,400
Jiang Qingcheng is Jiang Ze's father.

181
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,960
We are helping Jiang Ze now.

182
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,200
I see.

183
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,280
But I think

184
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,800
after Jiang Qingcheng's escape,

185
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,480
he is most likely to go after you.

186
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,440
I'll be careful.

187
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,000
What are you going to perform?

188
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,280
I'll be in a short play.

189
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,160
I created the story for the script

190
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,160
and Ms. Qin wrote it down for me.

191
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,120
Sister Xiaomeng,

192
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,080
don't tease me when you see it.

193
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,480
Tiankong, you can write a play now.

194
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,600
That's amazing!

195
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,680
I will definitely applaud for you.

196
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,600
How about that?

197
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,120
Great. You are going to

198
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,800
-like my story.
-Mom.

199
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,280
Sit down.

200
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,720
You have a baby bump.
Don't stand too much.

201
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,880
You need to take care.

202
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,720
Mom, it's fine.

203
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,040
The doctor said

204
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,920
everything can remain as usual.

205
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,160
You don't have to be so worried.

206
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,760
I am not worried.

207
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,920
Your husband is the one who's worried.

208
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,960
My son.

209
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,040
Now that he's going to be a father,
he's a changed person.

210
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,080
He has become more mature than before.

211
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,080
Xiaomeng.

212
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,920
-Be careful.
-There's a guy with a bouquet outside.

213
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,280
He said it is a delivery for you

214
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,440
and he asked you to sign for it.

215
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,560
Who sent it?

216
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,440
How does he know I am here?

217
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,520
I think

218
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,240
it might be a surprise from A Yan.

219
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,920
Go.

220
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,120
Walk slowly.

221
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,880
Keep in touch.

222
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,800
Alright, slower.

223
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,040
Be gentle.

224
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,760
Be careful.

225
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,840
Don't blast it.

226
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,200
Slower.

227
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,280
Mom.

228
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,400
Wasn't Xiaomeng

229
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,520
chatting with you here?

230
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,760
She's gone out.

231
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,160
There is a delivery of a bouquet

232
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,680
that requires her signature.

233
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,840
Did you send it?

234
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,640
Mom, I will check on her.

(Zhou Yanzhao)

237
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,320
Hello.

238
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,640
Jiang Ze, Xiaomeng is missing.

239
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,080
What did you say?
How can Xiaomeng be missing?

240
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,040
Have you searched for her?

241
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,960
If,

242
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,720
just if...

243
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,000
your dad contacts you,

244
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,040
please tell me at once.

245
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,400
Don't worry.

246
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,080
I won't let anything happen to Xiaomeng.

247
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,360
I have called the police.

248
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,640
I am working with the police
to search for my dad in full force.

249
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,920
We will talk again

250
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,880
if there's any update.

251
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,800
I don't want to lose her.

252
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,440
I dare not think about it.

253
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,320
My dad is a criminal suspect now.

254
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,200
I hope he won't make mistakes again.

255
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,040
This is Zhou Yanzhao.

256
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,000
Zhou Yanzhao, did I surprise you?

257
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,480
I told you

258
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,720
I would be the winner in the end.

259
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,600
I'll give you anything you want,

260
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,280
as long as you don't hurt Xiaomeng.

261
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,040
Great. Since you are so frank,

262
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,880
I will cut to the chase.

263
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,000
Firstly, don't call the police.

264
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,000
Okay.

265
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,840
Secondly,

266
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,040
turn all your shares in Shenghai

267
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,840
into cash

268
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,720
and transfer it to my designated account.

269
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,880
Okay. I promise you.

270
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,720
Anything else?

271
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,240
Do these

272
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,440
and you will see Zhou Xiaomeng again.

273
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,320
Calm down.

274
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,440
Don't hurt Xiaomeng.

275
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,520

276
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,720
Where is Jiang Ze?

277
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,200
He said he was going to the police.

278
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,720
He won't be back so soon.

Zhou Yanzhao, did I surprise you?

282
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,480
I told you

283
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,560
I would be the winner in the end.

284
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,600
Qingyan,

285
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,640
draft a document now.

286
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,640
I am appointing you as Assistant Chairman.

287
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,720
During my absence,

288
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,800
you may handle
the duties of Chairman in full power.

289
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,000
Chairman Zhou, you...

290
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,120
Jiang Qingcheng has to flee now.

291
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,120
I have to get Xiaomeng back.

292
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,720
I'm worried

293
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,080
it may take some time for me
to go after Jiang Qingcheng.

294
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,440
I might even have to follow him abroad.

295
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,160
During this period,

296
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,520
I may not be able to
handle the company business.

297
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,840
I'm relying on you.

298
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,200
Yes, Chairman Zhou.

299
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,080
Brother Yan,

300
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,400
I have found the GPS

301
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,320
of the yacht you told me to check.

302
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,680
Send me the location.

303
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,680
Okay.

304
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,880
Come in.

305
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,480
Chairman Zhou.

306
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,880
I'm going off now.

307
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,800
Alright, Chairman Zhou.

308
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,560
Is there a yacht called Larson?

309
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,600
I'm sorry.

310
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,840
I can't tell you.

311
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,120
You'd better tell me now.

312
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,960
Do you know the consequences
of being an accomplice of crimes?

313
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,200
Well...

314
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,680
Go straight that way

315
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,680
and you'll see the yacht.

316
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,480
Hello.

317
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,520
Mr. Jiang Ze.

318
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,160
There was a man who angrily asked about
your father's yacht just now.

319
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,200
Really?

320
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,720
Not bad.

321
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,760
You don't look afraid at all.

322
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,000
Why should I be afraid?

323
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,480
I know you only want money

324
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,520
and you won't hurt me.

325
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,520
You're smart.

326
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
But do you know

327
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,520
how much

328
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,600
the total assets of Shenghai is worth?

329
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,240
Get on the yacht.

330
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,240
Jiang Qingcheng!

331
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,920
A Yan.

332
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,960
Don't come over.

333
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,160
Uncle Jiang, let Xiaomeng go.

334
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,440
I will give you anything.

335
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,520
Money, Shenghai,

336
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,520
everything you want.

337
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,680
Who would believe you would

338
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,760
give me the money just like that?

339
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,360
But I'm impressed

340
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,680
you can find me here.

341
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,000
Was it my silly son

342
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,920
who told you my whereabouts?

343
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,920
I found you today not because of Jiang Ze.

344
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,400
Also, everything he did

345
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,280
was for your good.

346
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,680
He doesn't want you to fall deeper.

347
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,160
Cut the crap.

348
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,240
I need money.

349
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,000
Have you brought it with you?

350
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,600
To put it plainly, you just don't

351
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,520
want to give up your shares in Shenghai!

352
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,840
What's the deal? Coming to me

353
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,240
empty-handed today?

354
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,680
You know the shares of Shenghai
will translate to a big amount.

355
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,160
I need time to get the money ready.

356
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,320
I have already informed the bank.

357
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,600
I will give you the money

358
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,600
once the procedures are through.

359
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,680
You're returning me the money,
not giving it to me!

360
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,000
Shenghai is mine!

361
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,120
Your dad took it away from me.

362
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,680
Even if my dad was wrong,

363
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,920
he had died.

364
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,120
Isn't that enough?

365
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,680
Not enough! Never!

366
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,160
It's not enough that I killed him.

367
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,280
I'm going to kill you!

368
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,160
The Zhou's will never have a chance
to thrive again.

369
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,640
What did you say?

370
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,040
What?

371
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,600
It's okay to let you know.

372
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,840
I killed your father

373
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,520
and I plotted the car crash of Ye Sirong.

374
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,040
I wanted to set her up

375
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,480
but I didn't expect you to buy it.

376
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,560
Since you've joined Shenghai,

377
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,760
I've been behind your every trouble,

378
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,240
including now.

379
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,600
You lose and I win.

380
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,760
Alright, you've won.

381
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,320
Let Xiaomeng go

382
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,920
and I will give you everything you want.

383
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,440
You said it yourself.

384
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,880
Good.

385
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,840
Do you see that?

386
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,840
Handcuff yourself.

387
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,480
Hurry.

388
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,400
Don't.

389
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,520
-Shut up.
-A Yan.

390
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,080
Hurry.

391
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,240
Handcuff yourself.

392
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,560
Put them on.

393
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,520
Jump into the sea.

394
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,880
-Now!
-Don't do it, A Yan!

395
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,880
Shut up!

396
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,160
Hurry.

397
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,880
Dad! Don't make another mistake!

398
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,120
Let Xiaomeng go!

399
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,000
You brat! What are you doing here?

400
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,600
Xiaomeng!

401
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,280
A Yan!

402
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,040
Run!

403
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,600
A Yan!

404
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,840
Xiaomeng!

405
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,080
A Yan!

406
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,560
Come out, A Yan!

407
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,320
Xiaomeng! Calm down!

408
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,720
Let go of me!

409
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,680
Calm down!

410
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,720
-A Yan!
-Calm down, Xiaomeng!

411
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,080
A Yan!

412
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,600
A Yan!

413
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,000
(Ambulance)

414
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,440
A Yan!

415
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,760
Get in the car, please.

416
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,600
(Nanyue Ambulance)

417
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,040
Mission accomplished.

418
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,160
The suspect is under arrest.

419
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,800
Dad! Dad!

420
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,320
Dad!

421
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,600
(Emergency Center)

422
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,280
To the Emergency Room! Hurry!

423
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,360
A Yan!

424
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,440
We are at the hospital now.

425
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,480
Hang in there!

426
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,880
Hang in there!

427
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,640
Excuse us.

428
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,800
-You can't go in.
-You can't.

429
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,280
-You can't go in.
-A Yan.

430
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,400
-A Yan.
-You can't go in.

431
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
You can't go in.

432
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,800
-Doctor!
-Xiaomeng!

433
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,360
-Doctor!
-Hurry!

434
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,440
-Be quick!
-Hurry!

435
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,720
-Come on, hurry!
-Xiaomeng!

436
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,120
The patient has severe bleeding
on his head.

437
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,600
The patient is in a coma,

438
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,680
with no other symptom.

439
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,280
His eyes are not responsive to reflection.

440
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,640
Coma Scale level three.

441
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,360
Defibrillator.

442
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,040
Are you ready?

443
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,640
Let's go.

444
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,200
Qingyan.

445
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,720
I can go in on my own.

446
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,600
Let me go in with you.

447
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,560
I want to face it on my own.

448
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,680
I want to keep
the good image of Sun Lingxi

449
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,280
in front of you.

450
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,520
Thank you, Qingyan.

451
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,920
Thank you so much.

452
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,240
A Yan.

453
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,440
-A Yan.
-Xiaomeng, you're awake.

454
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,480
Where's A Yan?

455
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,800
Xiaomeng, Xiaomeng, don't be like this.

456
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,440
Calm down. Xiaomeng, don't be like this.

457
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,560
Calm down, Xiaomeng! Xiaomeng!

458
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,720
-Mom!
-Xiaomeng!

459
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,080
I saw A Yan

460
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,040
lying there in blood.

461
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,120
I have to look for him.

462
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,360
Where is he? Tell me.

463
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,760
Xiaomeng, Xiaomeng, calm down.

464
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,880
Xiaomeng, don't be like this.

465
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,840
-I want to see A Yan.
-Doctor!

466
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,040
Nurse! She's awake!

467
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,200
-I want to see A Yan.
-Doctor! Nurse!

468
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,480
-Let me go!
-Xiaomeng!

469
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,000
Xiaomeng! Xiaomeng!

470
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,000
Xiao Sizhi! How is A Yan?

471
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,200
Where is he? Tell me!
Where is he? I have to see him.

472
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,640
Xiaomeng, calm down first.

473
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,480
-Calm down first.
-Take me to him.

474
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,640
-I want to see him!
-Calm down.

475
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,520
It's not good for you.

476
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,880
Xiao Sizhi. Why are you holding back?

477
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,920
Zhou Yanzhao is not dead.
Why can't you tell me?

478
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,240
He is not dead.

479
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,000
How badly is he injured?

480
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,080
-Is it serious?
-Xiaomeng.

481
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,040
-Take me to him.
-Xiaomeng.

482
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,200
-I want to see him.
-Xiaomeng.

483
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,320
Xiaomeng, you're pregnant.

484
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,040
You can't be too agitated.

485
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,560
You are pregnant.

486
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,840
I'm begging you.

487
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,960
Let me see him.

488
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,320
Xiaomeng,

489
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,840
I understand how you are feeling,

490
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,040
but you are carrying a baby.

491
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,560
You have to think for the child.

492
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,800
You have to trust

493
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,600
that we'll try our best
to help Chairman Zhou.

494
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,000
When you are feeling better,

495
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,520
I will take you to him.

496
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,080
Yes, Xiaomeng.

497
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,440
Xiaomeng.

498
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,720
Listen to mom.

499
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,920
Take some rest.

500
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,480
When you're feeling better,

501
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,720
we will take you to A Yan.

502
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,800
Jiang Qingcheng,

503
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,360
you'd better tell the truth.

504
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,040
We have got hold of

505
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,320
sufficient evidence.

506
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,880
We have
complete knowledge of everything you did.

507
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:51,960
Be honest.

508
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,440
Don't make futile struggles.

509
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,760
In order to take over Shenghai Group,

510
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,640
you killed Zhou Binli.

511
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,160
Did you send someone to

512
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,320
cut the electricity supply
of Zhou's residence

513
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,080
to create an illusion of a power outage?

514
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,040
You took the chance

515
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,960
to send someone to Zhou residence

516
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,880
to replace Zhou Binli's cardiac medicines

517
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,240
with poisons

518
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,360
that would trigger a heart attack.

519
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,640
Is that what happened?

520
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,000
You set Ye Sirong up.

521
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,920
To silent her,

522
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,440
when Ye Sirong was in hospital care,

523
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,800
you sent someone

524
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,120
to murder Ye Sirong several times.

525
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,960
It doesn't matter if you don't confess.

526
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,480
Even if Zhou Yanzhao

527
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,520
won't wake up for now,

528
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,520
do you think you can get away with

529
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,640
the tort of intentional assault?

530
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,120
Evidence? You don't have any evidence.

531
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,360
Evidence.

532
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,520
Don't worry. The police

533
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,920
will not wrong a good person.

534
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,560
Sun Lingxi, your capable subordinate,

535
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,800
has confessed to us

536
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,200
everything she knows.

537
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,240
I knew I couldn't count on this woman.

538
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,560
You'd better spill out honestly.

539
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,640
It won't be the same

540
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,520
after we have done
a thorough investigation.

541
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,000
A Yan!

542
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,400
A Yan.

543
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,800
A Yan!

544
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,640
Don't die.

545
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,480
I don't allow you to die.

546
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,200
Wake up now, please!

547
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,280
Wake up now!

548
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,560
I won't let you die.

549
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,280
I don't allow you to die.

550
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,400
Dr. Xiao.

551
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,400
-How is he?
-A Yan.

552
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,920
How is he?

553
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,280
The doctor said his brain
is seriously injured.

554
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,240
He might...

555
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,320
What might happen?

556
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,080
He will wake up.

557
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,320
A Yan.

558
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,120
Wake up, please.

559
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,920
You... don't scare me.

560
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,280
You... you will wake up,

561
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,600
won't you?

562
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,120
Take it that you're doing it for me.

563
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,840
And

564
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,880
for our child.

565
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,120
Come on. Touch it.

566
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,080
Can you feel it? She's moving.

567
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,440
I guess...

568
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,800
she must be a girl.

569
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,840
Because you said that

570
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,760
you liked girls.

571
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,120
I will take good care of her.

572
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,040
Don't worry.

573
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,960
I am here.

574
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,240
I will take care of everything.

575
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,960
A Yan.

576
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,080
I am Xiaomeng.

577
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,200
We will be fine.

578
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,360
Everything will be fine.

579
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,320
A Yan, do you remember

580
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,600
our time in the Sports Institute?

581
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,560
We were so young

582
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,080
back then.

583
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,600
Summer days, the strong sunshine,

584
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,760
and you being all sweaty

585
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,760
right after training.

586
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,680
I wish to see you

587
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,360
sweaty right now.

588
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,440
Do you still remember

589
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,400
once I was too sick to get out of bed

590
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,960
and you took care of me day and night?

591
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,160
Although you hated me at that time,

592
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,800
you didn't leave me alone.

593
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,600
I knew

594
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,360
you wouldn't leave me.

595
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,960
It's the same now.

596
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,040
You won't abandon me.

597
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,520
Didn't you say you would

598
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,120
always protect me?

599
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,160
And we have

600
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,800
made so many promises

601
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,840
that are not fulfilled yet.

602
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,040
What should I do

603
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,080
if you are not around?

604
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,320
Xiaomeng.

605
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,040
Xiaomeng.

606
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,280
You haven't eaten for days.

607
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,000
You will collapse if this goes on.

608
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,120
Why are you so shy?

609
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,720
It's not like you haven't seen it before.

610
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,960
You are not having

611
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,880
evil ideas, are you?

612
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,440
I am not.

Xiaomeng,

621
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,800
how can you not have any rest
and food for days?

622
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,640
Just eat a little. Will you?

623
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,840
I really can't eat.

624
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,920
Xiaomeng, cry it out.

625
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,320
You may feel better

626
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,560
after crying.

627
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,560
Qiao Zhen, do you know

628
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,920
my heart

629
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,920
hurts

630
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,560
at every breath.

631
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,400
It hurts at every deep and shallow breath.

632
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,560
But I can't cry.

633
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,800
When A Yan wakes up, I want him to

see me

635
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,560
strong and brave.

636
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,600
Zhou Yanzhao, have you heard it?

637
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,440
If you still have a heart,

638
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,120

-Doctor, he has woken up!

646
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,560
Open your eyes! Look at me!

647
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,880
Look at me! I am Xiaomeng.

648
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,680
Xiaomeng.

649
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,760

650
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,280

656
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,480
A Yan.

657
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,560
Wake up. Look at me. A Yan!

658
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,480
How is he?

659
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,840
Wake up!

660
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,640
A Yan, wake up!

661
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,320
Don't fall asleep again, please!

662
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,800
I'm begging you. Please wake up!

663
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,160
Don't sleep anymore. Please.

664
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,080
Don't sleep anymore. Wake up, A Yan.

665
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,360
Wake up!

666
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,840
This is the blood clot in his brain.

667
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,440
That is the reason for his coma.

668
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,760
Taking all factors into consideration,

669
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,840
this is the best treatment we can propose.

670
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,160
It may sound a bit conservative,

671
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,200
and we need some luck too.

672
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,200
If he is lucky,

673
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,480
the blood clot in his brain

674
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,720
will shrink slowly and disappear.

675
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,640
Tell me

676
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,080
what's the chance of his recovery.

677
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,400
Xiaomeng, you have to trust me

678
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,960
and science.

679
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,240
I trust you.

680
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,960
But can you please

681
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,320
tell me the truth?

682
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,520
Less than 10%.

683
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,360
So low?

684
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,640
Dr. Xiao.

685
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,280
Xiao Sizhi.

686
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,240
We are good friends, right?

687
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,160
Yes.

688
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,560
I beg you.

689
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,080
I beg you.

690
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,400
Find a way to
remove the blood clot in his brain.

691
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,040
Let him wake up, please!

692
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,760
I really

693
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,160
can't bear this

694
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,080
anymore.

695
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,880
Xiaomeng, don't worry.

696
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,040
Sizhi will try his best without saying.

697
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,800
Xiaomeng,

698
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,400
we really know how you feel.

699
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,840
I've just told you

700
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,080
to believe in science.

701
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,840
But I have to believe in science too.

702
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,120
It's particularly because we are friends

703
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,360
that I can't take this risk.

704
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,560
So you just stand by

705
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,800
and put the patient in danger?

706
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,920
If the blood clot in his brain
doesn't go away,

707
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,240
is he going to remain in coma

708
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,240
and in an acute situation?

709
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,120
Qiao Zhen.

710
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,920
This is the best hospital.

711
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,480
If there is a better way,

712
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,000
do you think I won't do it?

713
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,000
But...

714
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,640
I believe,

715
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,680
I believe A Yan will recover.

716
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,800
He won't let himself

717
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,760
stay in coma.

718
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,000
I agree with the conservative treatment.

719
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,200
Because I believe in him.

720
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,120
-Xiaomeng.
-Xiaomeng.

721
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,840
How's it, doctor?

722
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,320
Is the baby healthy?

723
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,720
Everything is normal.

724
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,200
The baby is developing very well.

725
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,760
All indexes are normal.

726
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,200
You are a bit malnourished though.

727
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,280
You have to get more nutrition.

728
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,960
The baby has to

729
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,000
absorb abundant nutrition at this stage.

730
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,920
If the mother is malnourished,

731
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,720
it will seriously affect

732
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,120
the development of the baby.

733
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,280
I understand.

734
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,520
Do you experience
any pregnancy discomfort,

735
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,920
such as vomiting and nausea?

736
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,200
No.

737
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,400
You are lucky.

738
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,320
Some pregnant women

739
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,520
have pregnancy discomforts

740
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,000
starting from the fifth week of pregnancy.

741
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,080
By the time the baby is born,

742
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,240
the mother is exhausted.

743
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,560
The husband also loses weight

744
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,960
because of exhaustion.

745
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,760
I'm sorry, Ms. Zhou.

746
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,040
I didn't know what I was saying.

747
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,080
It's fine.

748
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,840
Alright.

749
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,560
Ms. Zhou, everything is normal.

750
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,480
The baby is so small.

751
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,600
So cute.

752
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,520
Yes.

753
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,560
Pregnancy is a miraculous journey.

754
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,360
The next time you come,

755
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,800
it will have

756
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,120
a bigger change.

757
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,000
Thank you, doctor.
