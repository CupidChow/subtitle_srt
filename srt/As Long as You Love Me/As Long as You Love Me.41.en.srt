00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,720
(Episode 41)

2
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,800
I understand.

3
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,800
If it's me,

4
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,040
I may do the same thing.

5
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,160
You don't have to comfort me.

6
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,680
I'm not.

7
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,720
I know what type of person you are.

8
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,640
So I'll definitely

9
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,760
stay by your side

10
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,000
and help you overcome this.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,120
Do you still remember?

12
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,800
I used to

13
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,720
write on your palms.

14
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,720
Yes, I remember.

15
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,160
Once I thought I hated you.

16
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,160
Once I thought

17
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,440
the switch of love in my heart

18
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,720
had been switched off for good.

19
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,840
But later I've found out

20
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,640
that the switch of love

21
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,760
is not under the control of myself.

22
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,440
If you can switch it on

23
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,280
and switch it off as you like,

24
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,200
then it's not real love.

Yan,

33
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,040
let's leave together.

34
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,600
Let's go somewhere far away.

35
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,720
I can't leave. Neither can you.

36
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,440
Why?

37
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,680
Can't you bear to lose
the Zhou Family's fortune?

38
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,120
Yan,

39
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,720
all these don't belong to us.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,720
Let it go and leave with me.

41
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,040
We can't.

42
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,640
Xiaomeng,

43
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,640
I need to show you something.

44
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,920
What's this?

45
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,040
Open it and see for yourself.

46
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,000
(DNA Paternity Test Result
of Zhou Binli and Zhou Xiaomeng)

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,840
I'm sorry

48
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,320
I've kept this from you until now.

49
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,000
This is why I can't leave.

50
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,920
Because of you,

51
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,680
I can't leave.

52
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,320
This...

53
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,360
How can this be possible?

54
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,720
This is a DNA paternity test result.

55
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,400
It has been kept
in a safe under Dad's name.

56
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,000
Only your mom knows where the key is.

57
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,160
She handed it to me the other day.

58
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,280
It was then that I found out you're
Dad's biological daughter.

59
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,840
I'm Uncle Zhou's biological daughter?

60
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,920
So Mom and Uncle Zhou are...

61
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,880
Yes.

62
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,840
I've figured that out much later.

63
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,520
Aunt Ye had always
wanted me to leave China

64
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,680
because she thought

65
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,360
we were half siblings.

66
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,440
She was afraid we'd be together,

67
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,680
and thus thought of ways and means

68
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,560
to make me leave

69
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,480
so that she wouldn't feel guilty.

70
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,400
That's why Mom wanted to bring me abroad

71
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,480
the moment you came back.

72
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,600
And I always wonder

73
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,720
why I was given shares
in Uncle Zhou's will.

74
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,640
Those are yours to begin with.

75
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,640
You're the legal heir to Shenghai Group.

76
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,960
But Dad was not aware

77
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,560
of the various crises
Shenghai was already in.

78
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,960
He thought he left you a fortune

79
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,760
but in fact,

80
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,960
it was a responsibility
too much for you to carry.

81
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,200
You've hidden my identity in secret,

82
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,440
keeping it from me,

83
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,360
because you want me

84
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,360
to stay away from the disputes
and crises of Shenghai Group.

85
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,760
I just want to return you

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,200
what is rightfully yours.

87
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,800
I owe you this much.

88
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,920
So you rather
take on all these by yourself?

89
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,440
I know those people too well.

90
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,960
They're all cunning crooks who have been
playing dirty in the business for decades.

91
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,600
If they find out your real identity,

92
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,960
you'll become a target for all of them.

93
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,840
I don't want you to face that situation.

94
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,080
But when will be the end for you
to carry this burden by yourself?

95
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,520
I don't know.

96
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,280
Although...

97
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,400
I may not be related to Dad biologically,

98
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,000
I still owe him for raising me.

99
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,160
So I must bring Shenghai

100
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,280
back to the right track

101
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,120
before returning it whole to you.

102
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,840
Yan,

103
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,040
you shouldn't be shouldering this alone.

104
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,640
I'm more obligated than you

105
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,920
to take on these responsibilities.

106
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,520
Why won't you let me face this with you?

107
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,640
At this point,

108
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,400
we can no longer
face each other like before.

109
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,400
And I'm...

110
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,440
not the one who can accompany you
for the rest of your life.

111
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,480
Xiaomeng,

112
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,440
you deserve better choices.

113
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,480
We've come so far.

114
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,800
What else can separate us?

115
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,400
Even if you deny it,

116
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,880
everything you've done for me

117
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,520
already shows your love for me.

118
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,080
Yan,

119
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,160
trust me.

120
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,000
I can share your burdens,

121
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,240
and I want you to let me.

122
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,680
Shenghai Group is Uncle--

123
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,240
is Dad's lifework.

124
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,960
I want to safeguard it,

125
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,960
but I can't do it on my own.

126
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,640
Please help me, okay?

127
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,760
You've always loved me.

128
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,080
Your feelings for me have never changed.

129
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,960

Dad,

147
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,560
we've came to visit you.

148
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,200
This is my first time calling you Dad.

149
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,160
Unfortunately,

150
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,880
you can't hear it.

151
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,440
I've come with Yan today to tell you

152
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,080
since you've been gone,

153
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,480
a lot has happened to the Zhou Family.

154
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,960
But the Zhou Family hasn't crumbled,

155
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,120
and never will.

156
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,840
I don't know why...

157
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,400
you and Mom...

158
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,280
kept this a secret.

159
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,920
Perhaps it's to protect me.

160
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,200
Perhaps there are other reasons.

161
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,200
But now I know...

162
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,080
I'm your biological daughter.

163
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,560
I'm also a part of Zhou Family.

164
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,640
So there're responsibilities
I've to bear as Zhou Binli's daughter.

165
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,120
Rest assured, I'll do my best

166
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,840
to keep Shenghai intact.

167
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,520
I will safeguard...

168
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,480

Let's go.

174
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,720
Xiaomeng, give me a moment.

175
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,360
I have something to tell Dad.

176

180
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,840
No matter what has happened,

181
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,240
you're always my dad.

182
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,440
Don't worry, Dad.

183
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,000
I'll help Xiaomeng,

184
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,120
and safeguard Shenghai,

185
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,720
even if it's at the expense of my life.

186
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,960
I believe this is what you wish too.

187
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,000
Are you saying Xiaomeng
has come back to Nanyue alone?

188
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,520
Yes, Boss.

189
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,720
I'm sure she's come back alone.

190
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,440
Either Zhou Yanzhao
has asked her to come back,

191
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,600
or Xiaomeng has come back to help him.

192
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,960
So, in your opinion,

193
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,000
which of the two is more likely?

194
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,560
I can't be sure.

195
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,320
Base on my understanding of Zhou Yanzhao,

196
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,960
since he made Xiaomeng leave Nanyue,

197
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,280
he wouldn't ask her to come back.

198
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,400
I'll continue to monitor them.

199
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,000
Let's see if Zhou Yanzhao makes any move.

200
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,040
Continue to monitor Xiaomeng

201
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,320
and report to me immediately
if there's any new development.

202
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,400
Understood.

203
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,640
This is hot.

204
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,560
Come in.

205
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,280
Brother Yan,

206
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,600
Jiang Qingcheng's man has surfaced.

207
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,280
I saw them meeting at a teahouse.

208
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,080
Jiang Qingcheng
went to the teahouse he frequents.

209
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,920
Moments later, this man went in too.

210
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,200
They talked for a while.

211
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,240
The man hurriedly left after the meeting.

212
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,440
Were there only the two of them?

213
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,480
Yes.

214
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,640
This man's most likely working
for Jiang Qingcheng in secret.

215
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,000
It looks like Jiang Qingcheng
is planning some new schemes.

216
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,360
Could he have found out
that Xiaomeng's back?

217
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,360
Or did he gather some new information?

218
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,720
He may have found out
that Xiaomeng is back long ago.

219
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,080
Did they see you?

220
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,160
They've spotted my presence,

221
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,520
but they still don't know who I am.

222
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,880
Good.

223
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,640
They must not find out about you.

224
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,960
This person's very cautious.

225
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,920
I'll take extra care.

226
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,800
Brother Yan, have you
seen this person before?

227
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,000
He looks like the person
I saw in the hospital.

228
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,120
Send these photos to Dr. Xiao now.

229
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,360
Ask him if he has seen this person before.

230
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,760
Okay, I'll do it right away.

231
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,600
Chairman Zhou,

232
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,880
I've looked through the photos.

233
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,480
Is he the one captured on
the hospital's CCTV?

234
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,680
From the physique, he should be.

235
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,920
But we can't see his face clearly.

236
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,880
As of now, we can't say for sure.

237
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,120
Okay. I see.

238
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,280
I've sent people to follow him.

239
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,160
Once we've found hard evidence,

240
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,760
we'll inform the police.

241
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,600
How's Xiaomeng after she's back?

242
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,480
Don't worry.

243
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,240
I'll take care of her.

244
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,280
What about Aunt Ye?

245
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,840
The psychiatrist's been talking to her

246
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,360
but she's not showing any improvement.

247
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,880
Dr. Xiao,

248
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,040
I'm tied up here,

249
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,400
so I'll have to trouble you.

250
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,360
Don't worry, Chairman Zhou.

251
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,160
By the way,

252
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,400
Sister Hua mentioned something
the other day.

253
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,960
What is it?

254
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,280
She recalled something odd.

255
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,520
She said the circuit in the house
broke down suddenly one day

256
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,880
and she got someone to come to repair it.

257
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,320
Coincidentally, that was one day
before your father's incident.

258
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,840
And right on the next day,

259
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,880
the CCTVs in the area also broke down.

260
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,480
This technician was very suspicious

261
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,280
but this happened too long ago.

262
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,720
Sister Hua can't remember
what he looks like.

263
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,040
I see.

264
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,120
Come in.

265
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,800
Yan.

266
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,720
Why haven't you slept yet?

267
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,560
Too many things happened these few days

268
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,000
and my mind is a mess.

269
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,040
I wanted to sleep,

270
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,760
but I kept turning and tossing on the bed.
I just couldn't fall asleep.

271
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,400
Don't worry.

272
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,880
Leave everything to me.

273
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,000
By the way, did you get in touch

274
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,760
with Aunt Lin lately?

275
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,680
No, I didn't.

276
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,120
Don't you want to meet her?

277
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,160
I think it's not the time for us to meet.

278
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,720
It's better for both of us.

279
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,600
If we meet now,

280
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,240
we may cause trouble to each other.

281
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,600
But have you considered

282
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,840
this matter has already been exposed?

283
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,800
If the media fails to obtain
any news from you,

284
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,120
Aunt Lin will become their target.

285
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,760
I've experienced that before,

286
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,720
so I know how terrible it is.

287
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,400
Putting aside

288
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,120
all these troubles from the outside world,

289
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,920
have you ever
considered Aunt Lin's feelings?

290
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,880
She lives in the same city
as her own son does.

291
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,200
She knows where he is, but can't meet him.

292
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,920
Do you know how much she'll be hurt?

293
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,120
At this time, all the more

294
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,760
she needs someone to be with her,

295
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,440
especially you.

296
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,720
Sometimes I wonder

297
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,640
if all people related to me

298
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,640
will suffer pains and troubles.

299
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,560
I thought I was protecting all of you

300
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,800
but I might be wrong.

301
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,760
So I won't run away this time.

302
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,320
Once the time's right,

303
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,920
I'll get my mom

304
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,160
to meet the media with me

305
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,880
and tell them

306
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,600
I'm not a part of the Zhou Family.

307
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,920
My mom is Lin Yueling.

308
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,240
Yan,

309
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,040
wait no further.

310
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,560
This is what I've learned lately.

311
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,120
Don't put off anything.

312
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,440
There may be times

313
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,120
when we miss an opportunity

314
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,200
and live to regret it
for the rest of our life.

315
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,320
Okay,

316
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,120
I'll heed your advice.

317
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,040
Let's go tomorrow.

318
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,400
It seems we all have to...

319
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,800
accept the life laid out in front of us.

320
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,280
We share this life together.

321
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,760
No matter what happens in the future,

322
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,880
I'll face it with you.

00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,360
Hello, Aunt Lin.

328
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,320
We're at your doorstep.

329
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,200
Okay... give me a second.

330
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,160
Why are you here?

331
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,520
Aunt Lin,

332
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,880
let's talk inside.

333
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,280
Sure, come on in.

334
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,600
Come in...

335
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,320
Don't worry. I've made arrangements.

336
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,840
The reporters won't follow us here.

337
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,520
That's good then.

338
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,120
Take a seat.

339
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,640
I'll heat up some food for you.

340
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,160
Aunt Lin, it's all right.

341
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,600
Please take a seat.

342
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,480
Okay. Let's all sit.

343
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
Come. Sit down.

344
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,520
Aunt Lin,

345
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,960
I'm sorry.

346
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,640
Yan and I...

347
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,080
have waited until now to visit you.

348
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,880
It's fine.

349
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,280
Mom.

350
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,320
I'm sorry.

351
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,240
It's my fault.

352
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,720
I've made you suffer.

353
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,760
Mom!

354
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,840
Not at all.

355
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,320
I'm sorry.

356
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,680
Not at all, my son.

357
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,920
It's my fault. I've made you suffer.

358
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,680
No, it's my fault.

359
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,000
I've caused you all these troubles.

360
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,760
I feel so bad, my son.

361
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,360
Are you all right?

362
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,480
Mom.

363
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,120
I've come today

364
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,560
to tell you that

365
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,480
you don't have to hide anymore.

366
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,040
We'll go downstairs together in a moment.

367
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,360
I want to tell those reporters in person

368
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,320
that I'm your biological son.

369
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,480
Mom!

370
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,520
Yan.

371
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,480
No, you can't. Yan.

372
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,200
That's not a good idea. You'll get hurt.

373
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,720
Don't do it.

374
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,880
Don't worry, Mom.

375
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,080
Leave everything to me.

376
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,120
Everybody, please wait.

377
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,560
Here they come.

378
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,880
Chairman Zhou, what's this about?

379
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,600
I know you have a lot of questions for me

380
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,600
but allow me to speak first.

381
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,320
First, I want to tell you

382
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,240
Madam Lin Yueling standing beside me now

383
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,320
is my biological mother.

384
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,560
In other words,

385
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,880
I'm not the son

386
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,720
of Zhou Binli.

387
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,480
I'm not a part of the Zhou Family.

388
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,680
When did you find out the truth?

389
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,840
Why did you stay silent
and hide this earlier?

390
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,800
I guess anyone

391
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,280
who encounters similar situation

392
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,400
will be as confused as I have been,

393
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,880
or even deny the fact.

394
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,920
However,

395
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,800
there's absolutely no conspiracy in this.

396
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,720
Today I'm standing here

397
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,440
to publicly acknowledge this matter,

398
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,280
because it is my responsibility.

399
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,400
I'm grateful to the Zhou Family
for raising me

400
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,760
and giving me what I have today.

401
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,040
Likewise,

402
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,000
I have to thank
my mother for giving me life.

403
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,760
I should fulfill
my responsibility as a son.

404
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,800
This is a biological relationship
that we can never change.

405
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,080
That's very well-said.

406
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:51,920
Yes...

407
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,160
Lastly,

408
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,320
I want to thank the person
who's disclosed this news to the media.

409
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,040
Thanks for giving me a chance
to acknowledge my biological mother.

410
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,720
Thank you

411
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,640
for letting me find myself.

412
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,680
Look, Dad.

413
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,680
Zhou Yanzhao's thanking you.

414
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,560
Your plan has shaped him
into a tragic hero.

415
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,840
So what if he's a tragic hero?

416
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,680
To win the sympathy
and approval of the audience?

417
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,320
That's naive.

418
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,200
Zhou Yanzhao has done this.

419
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,440
He must have known

420
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,080
what the consequence will be.

421
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,200
Dad, there are times
when I really don't approve

422
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,600
of the way you handle things.

423
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,840
Comparatively,

424
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,560
I find him more honest and open.

425
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,120
My son,

426
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,280
do you think I've crossed the line?

427
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,080
However,

428
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,280
whether I admit it or not,

429
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,560
to compete against Zhou Yanzhao,

430
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,200
whose IQ and EQ both surpass most people
by a huge margin,

431
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,560
this is my only choice.

432
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,440
Got it?

433
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,520
Then tell me.

434
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,200
If Zhou Yanzhao is no longer
the chairman of Shenghai,

435
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,760
who else can do the job?

436
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,120
You?

437
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,640
No, you.

438
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,040
Me?

439
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,160
You want me to be
the chairman of Shenghai?

440
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,800
I've told you long before

441
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,520
that I'm getting old.

442
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,880
Even if I become the chairman,

443
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,720
I can't hold on to the position for long.

444
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,720
So I have to capitalize on this moment

445
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,560
while I'm still in power

446
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,080
to chase Zhou Yanzhao away,

447
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,680
and make you the chairman.

448
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,760
You mean

449
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,960
I'm your last chess piece?

450
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,680
You'd better know
what's good for yourself.

451
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,600
Listen to me.

452
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,560
Once you become the chairman,

453
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,680
Shenghai will be ours.

454
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,360
Then the blood and sweat
I've shed in this life

455
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,240
are worth it.

456
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,560
Why are you all riled up?

457
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,040
From my perspective,

458
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,720
you're just worried being the chairman
will expose yourself to gossips

459
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,440
and put you in a difficult position.

460
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,000
By using me as your pawn,

461
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,280
you get to exercise
the power of a chairman,

462
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,720
and preserve your reputation.

463
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,680
You kill two birds with one stone.

464
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,400
President Jiang,

465
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,600
have you been learning from Cao Cao?

466
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,400
"Even if fate is with me,

467
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,400
I'll be King Wen of Zhou at most."

468
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,800
Rascal!

469
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,880
Even if I'm Cao Cao,

470
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,360
I'll eventually
hand this big empire to you.

471
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,720
You get to become the chairman
for doing nothing.

472
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,880
What else do you want?

473
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,160
But you've miscalculated one thing.

474
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,160
I'm not Cao Pi,

475
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,160
and I have no desire to become Cao Pi.

476
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,120
I don't care for your great empire at all.

477
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,560
And I've never thought of
reaping without sowing.

478
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,840
Even if I actually get it one day,

479
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,520
I'd have done it my own way.

480
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,200
Save the position of Shenghai's chairman

481
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,080
for yourself.

482
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,760
Rascal,

483
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,880
You must accept the position
of the chairman,

484
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,080
whether you like it or not.

485
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,400
You can't escape it.

486
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,520
Are you all right?

487
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,720
Yes.

488
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,080
Watch your steps.

489
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,480
Jiang Ze, why are you here?

490
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,360
My dad has disowned me.

491
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,560
I'm homeless now.

492
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,320
Xiaomeng,

493
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,120
can you take me in?

494
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,840
Jiang Ze,

495
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,680
this is my home.

496
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,120
Don't cross the line.

497
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,880
Sit down and tell us what happened.

498
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,200
Yan,

499
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,240
you know about Jiang Ze's situation.

500
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,680
Let him stay here.

501
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,680
Xiaomeng,

502
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,640
he's obviously claiming credit
and putting pressure on you.

503
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,720
But he did got hurt because of me.

504
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,160
It's only right that I take care of him.

505
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,160
Do you really think
I've come empty-handed?

506
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,040
I've brought the full series for my rent.

507
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,480
Is it enough?

508
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,280
You knew about this?

509
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,360
Ever since Xiaomeng left the nursing home,

510
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,920
I couldn't even swallow a bite.

511
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,960
The food in the nursing home

512
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,680
is so much worse than your cooking.

513
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,400
Fine...

514
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,280
During your stay here,

515
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,480
I'll cook for you every day.

516
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,720
-Okay?
-Okay.

517
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,760
Yan,

518
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,080
it's a fair competition between us now.

519
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,360
I will be watching you.

520
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,800
I won't let you enjoy

521
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,000
the advantage of staying with her.

522
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,880
Jiang Ze,

523
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,480
stop spouting nonsense.

524
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,880
Xiaomeng,

525
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,480
I'm hungry.

526
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,120
Can you make me pork ribs soup?

527
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,880
Xiaomeng, he has obviously
set a trap for you.

528
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,280
Don't fall for it.

529
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,280
Don't worry, Yan.

530
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,320
Once he recovers,

531
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,720
I'll...

532
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,040
throw him out.

533
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,480
Okay, as you wish.

534
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,560
I'll go make the soup then.

535
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,960
Zhou Yanzhao, what are you doing?

536
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,160
These are meant for Xiaomeng.

537
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,400
Too bad.

538
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,960
They're mine now.

539
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,320
How can you be so shameless?

540
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,360
Whatever.

541
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,560
Anyway, this is my home.

542
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,040
If you're not happy,

543
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,200
you can leave!

544
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,240
You...

545
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,320
Enough.

546
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,800
What are you guys quarreling about?

547
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,240
Have some tea.

548
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,800
The pork ribs soup will be ready soon.

549
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,120
It smells good.

550
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,320
No matter what, I'm not leaving today.

551
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,440
You two, be careful.

552
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,280
Be careful.

553
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,200
Be careful not to knock yourself.

554
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,320
Tiankong,

555
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,360
Recently I haven't been
at the Children Welfare Center.

556
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,920
Have you been behaving yourself?

557
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,880
Yes, I have.

558
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,840
Madam Lin, you haven't been around lately.

559
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,320
We all miss you very much.

560
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,120
Where have you been?

561
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,080
I've got caught up

562
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,560
with something at home,

563
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,120
but everything's fine now.

564
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,040
We saw you on the television.

565
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,680
And Brother Yan too.

566
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,360
I don't understand what he's saying.

567
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,560
Why did both of you
appear on television together?

568
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,120
Forget it if you don't understand.

569
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,840
Anyway, there're things

570
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,960
that you'll understand
only when you grow up.

571
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,560
Simply put,

572
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,800
Brother Yan has found
his mother and he's happy.

573
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,840
I see.

574
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,120
If Brother Yan is happy,

575
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,560
I'm happy too.

576
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,640
How sweet of you.

577
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,000
Tiankong. Aunt Lin.

578
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,400
-You're here.
-Miss Xiaomeng.

579
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,800
Tiankong, let me take a look.

580
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,080
You've grown taller.

581
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,920
It's been a while
since I last visited you.

582
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,600
Are you mad at me?

583
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,320
I know both you and Brother Yan are busy.

584
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,480
Madam Lin said

585
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,680
Brother Yan has found his mother.

586
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,800
Is it true?

587
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,400
Yes,

588
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,200
Brother Yan has found his mother.

589
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,320
When he's less busy in a few days.,

590
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,840
I'll bring him to visit you.

591
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,760
Okay?

592
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,920
Okay.

593
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,960
Miss Xiaomeng, you must come again.

594
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,600
Sure.

595
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,400
Come, let me hug you.

596
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,280
Are you saying...

597
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,200
Yan wants to solve this by himself?

598
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,480
He refuses to let me help.

599
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,800
But how can he handle this alone?

600
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,440
All those directors of Shenghai

601
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,120
are not easy to deal with.

602
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,840
Afterall, Yan is all by himself.

603
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,600
I don't understand how things work
in the business circle,

604
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,800
but I believe Yan asks you
to stay out of this

605
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,320
to protect you.

606
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,160
Of course I understand

607
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,760
his intention.

608
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,920
But the thought of him

609
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,800
carrying so many burdens by himself

610
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,600
really pains me.

611
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,200
The directors of Shenghai

612
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,720
will soon be taking action

613
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,080
to chase him out of Shenghai.

614
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,600
So we must help Yan defend Shenghai

615
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,400
from falling into the hands of outsiders.

616
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,560
Xiaomeng,

617
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,960
I really hate myself

618
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,200
for not understanding what you're saying.

619
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,440
Neither can I think of a better solution.

620
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,720
What about you?

621
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,520
Aunt Lin,

622
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,640
actually I've thought of a solution.

623
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,640
However,

624
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,800
I have to tell you first

625
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,920
so that you can help me persuade Yan.

626
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,600
This may sounds a bit out of the blue,

627
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,560
but I believe he'll agree
if you talk to him.

628
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,640
Sure, tell me.

629
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,200
So long as I can help Yan,

630
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,840
I'll do anything you ask of me.

631
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,760
Tell me.

632
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,960
Here...

633
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,800
Really?

634
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,680
Of course I'll agree.

635
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,360
I'm too happy for words.

636
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,320
But I've not discussed this with Yan.

637
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,920
I'm afraid he may not agree.

638
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,760
He won't disagree.

639
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,120
I'll talk to him.

640
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,280
Once this is done,

641
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,720
you'll be Yan's biggest savior.

642
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,000
Take the call.

643
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,240
Hello, Guang.

644
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,280
Xiaomeng, where are you?

645
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,560
I'm at the Children Welfare Center.

646
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,520
Okay, I'll come pick you up now.

647
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,440
Guang, what happened to Yan?

648
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,880
Brother Yan wouldn't let me tell you,

649
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,520
but I think you should know.

650
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,440
There's a board meeting at Shenghai today.

651
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,120
Jiang Qingcheng has called
all the directors to the company.

652
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,400
What? That's fast.

653
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,000
Where is Yan now?

654
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,680
He's in the office.

655
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,400
I just drove him there before coming here.

656
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,080
What is Yan thinking?

657
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,160
He knows very well those people
at Shenghai are out to get him.

658
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,520
Why would he go?

659
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,040
We'd have stayed at home

660
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,200
and think of a solution before going.

661
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,600
I tried to persuade him,

662
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,800
but Brother Yan said
it'll come sooner or later,

663
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,480
and hiding won't solve the problem.

664
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,720
Guang, drive me to a place.

665
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,640
Are we not going to Shenghai?

666
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,080
I need to find someone

667
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,560
and take him to Shenghai.

668
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,760
Where are you going?

669
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,480
Aunt Lin, I have to run now.

670
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,360
Remember to help me on that matter.

671
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,920
Take care.

672
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Mr. He, please get in the car.

673
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,280
Hello.

674
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,760
I reckon everyone knows

675
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,520
the agenda for the board meeting today.

676
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,000
Yan,

677
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,160
we know you've just acknowledged
your biological mother,

678
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,480
but the affairs of Shenghai Group

679
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,200
concern the interests of everyone here.

680
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,280
We wish to hear your thoughts.

681
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,360
Like everyone here,

682
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,880
the truth that I'm not
Zhou Binli's biological son

683
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,440
has really shocked me.

684
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,240
But this is the truth

685
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,920
and I don't want to hide or deny it.

686
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,760
As for my position in Shenghai,

687
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,280
since Zhou Binli has handed the group
to me in his will,

688
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,920
it's clear evidence that
regardless who I am,

689
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,760
he's acknowledged my ability.

690
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,520
It's also my responsibility
to take Shenghai to a greater future.

691
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,000
So my dear directors,

692
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,600
please give some thoughts
to the future of Shenghai

693
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,880
and recall the days
after I've joined the group.

694
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,480
I reckon you already

695
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,080
have an answer.

696
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,240
-Yan has a point.
-Yes.

697
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,280
Yan's right.

698
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,520
We're all doing it for Shenghai.

699
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,800
But let's think about...

700
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,120
the time Yan has been the chairman.

701
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,640
How has he performed?

702
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,880
I'm sure you all have your own views.

703
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,160
How about we share them with everybody?

704
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,960
Let me start the ball rolling.

705
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,920
Chairman Zhou has the ability,

706
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,480
or rather, he has the potential.

707
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,200
We can probably agree on this.

708
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,240
Afterall, he's young
and has a fighting spirit.

709
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,640
He's brave and astute.

710
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,840
But during his time as the chairman,

711
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,040
Shenghai's reputation has plummeted

712
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,080
and the share price has kept dropping.

713
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,840
I don't think he's qualified
to lead Shenghai Group.

714
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,520
Moreover...

715
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,320
Chairman Zhou,

716
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,400
you've even admitted your parentage
in front of the camera.

717
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,920
In the future,

718
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,200
if you continue representing Shenghai

719
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,520
by virtue of your position
as the chairman,

720
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,880
what will our business partners think?

721
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,280
And what will the public opinions be like?

722
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,400
This is the main issue

723
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,920
that Shenghai should avoid.

724
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,520
I get where both of you are coming from.

725
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,000
Actually the board of directors

726
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,080
has always held Yan in high regards.

727
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,480
But ever since this incident happened,

728
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,680
we've been facing intense pressure
due to public opinions.

729
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:03,880
This has a very bad impact
on Shenghai Group.

730
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,960
Am I right?

731
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,680
Yan, actually...

732
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,720
you still hold
some shares of Shenghai Group.

733
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,840
Even if you can't be the chairman,

734
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,840
you're still one of the directors.

735
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,200
If you can't prove that
the will of Zhou Binli is fake,

736
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,800
then the will represents his last wish.

737
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,000
You don't have the right to remove me.

738
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,400
Actually, this has
nothing much to do with the will.

739
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,760
If you're the biological son
of Zhou Binli,

740
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,520
then legally and rightfully,

741
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,480
you can inherit his chairman's position.

742
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,200
But now, you're not.

743
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,160
If you add in the investment funds

744
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,120
of six billion dollars
I've brought in earlier,

745
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,200
you're no longer the biggest shareholder.

746
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,200
Considering the harm
you've brought to the group,

747
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,520
whether you get to continue
to be the chairman

748
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,880
is something we have to vote to decide.

749
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,880
Right now,

750
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,320
for the development
and reputation of Shenghai Group,

751
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,320
I would like to make a motion
to remove Zhou Yanzhao

752
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,280
from the chairman's position.

753
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,320
Please raise your hand to vote.

754
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,520
I agree.

755
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,560
I agree too.

756
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,200
-I agree.
-I agree too.

757
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,160
-I agree.
-I agree.

758
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,240
I agree too.

759
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,400
Mr. He, this way please.

760
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,920
Yan,

761
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,640
it's not that I don't want to help you.

762
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,520
This is the decision of all directors.

763
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,520
We can only vote to remove you.

764
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,920
Directors,

765
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,080
let's move to the second agenda

766
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,760
and nominate candidates
for the new chairman position.

767
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,920
Please name your nominations.

768
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,840
My nomination

769
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,680
for the new chairman of Shenghai Group

770
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,800
is Jiang--

771
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,880
My apologies, Directors.

772
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,000
Zhou Xiaomeng has
an important announcement to make.

773
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,040
Uncle Jiang.

774
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,160
Xiaomeng,

775
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,360
we're having a board meeting now

776
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,720
to discuss an important matter.

777
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,480
Can we talk after the meeting?

778
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,520
I'm sorry, Uncle Jiang.

779
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,000
My announcement is equally important.

780
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,800
Moreover, Uncle Zhou has given me
half his shares in his will.

781
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,080
So the affairs of Shenghai concern me too.

782
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,640
Ladies and gentlemen,

783
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,000
I reckon you know Uncle Zhou's lawyer.

784
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,840
His will is written and notarized
by this lawyer.

785
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,880
I've come with Mr. He today

786
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,680
because we have an announcement to make.

787
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,520
Mr. He, please proceed.

788
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,360
According to the latest evidence
we have obtained,

789
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,520
there's a biological parent
and child relationship

790
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,320
between Zhou Xiaomeng and Zhou Binli.

791
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,520
This means that

792
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,200
Zhou Xiaomeng is the biological daughter
of Mr. Zhou Binli.

793
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,680
How can this be?

794
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,560
How can Zhou Xiaomeng
be Zhou Binli's biological daughter?
