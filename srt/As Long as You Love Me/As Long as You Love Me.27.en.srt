1
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,760
(Episode 27)

2
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,680
Zhou Yanzhao,

3
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,200
how can you do this to us?

4
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,920
Even today,

5
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,760
you're still asking me this question?

6
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,880
It is you who have convicted my mom
based on your assumptions.

7
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,560
What she said last night could prove that

8
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,040
although she wasn't thinking clearly,

9
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,440
she knew very well what she had done.

10
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,240
You know nothing, Zhou Yanzhao!

11
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,440
You have no right to condemn us

12
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,160
because you're not a member of the Zhou...

13
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,000
What did you say?

14
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,920
Tell me.

15
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,840
What did you say? What am I not?

16
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,760
One day you will realize

17
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,280
that you are wrong.

18
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,160
You have been hopelessly wrong!

19
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,240
A Yan,

20
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,800
I have only one question for you.

21
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,840
If one day

22
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,440
you have realized
that you have been wrong,

23
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,400
and everything is not
what you think it is,

24
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,080
what would you do?

25
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,200
Apologies are like confession.

26
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,200
One has to own up to his.

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,960
If one day you can prove that I am wrong

28
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,880
and have wronged you,

29
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,200
I'm willing to take the responsibilities.

30
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,920
I'll do anything you ask me to.

31
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,160
What do you think you should do

32
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,360
to make up for what has happened today?

33
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,600
A Yan,

34
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,760
if there'll be a day

35
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,360
that we have come to that ending,

36
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,160
I only hope...

37
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,440
you can somehow forgive yourself.

38
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,480
(Longcheng Squad)

39
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,000
Uncle Zhou.

40
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,480
Uncle Zhou,

41
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,080
what should I do?

42
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,800
Can you tell me?

43
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,360
A Yan hates me.

44
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,040
My mom hates me.

45
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,760
What should I do?

46
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,560
Can you tell me...

47
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,600
when you passed away,

48
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,920
what actually happened?

49
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,920
And A Yan,

50
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,240
he is not even your biological son,

51
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,680
but he hates me so much because of you.

52
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,240
I want to tell him the truth so badly.

53
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,720
But I can't.

54
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,000
I can't ruin everything for him.

55
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,160
Uncle Zhou,

56
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,640
can you hear me?

57
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,160
If you can hear me,

58
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,920
can you tell me

59
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,120
what I should do?

60
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,280

Nice to meet you, Mr. Zhou.

Madam Lin, do you have your own child?

If it was really my mom
who killed Uncle Zhou,

77
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,280
I'm willing to atone for her.

78
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,600
You can ask me to do anything.

79
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,720
Atonement?

80
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,760
What can you do to compensate
for my dad's life?

81
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,800
You can never pay this debt.

82
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,880
A Yan,

83
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,080
do you only have hatred for me now

84
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,720
and no other feelings?

85
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Other feelings?

86
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,800
What other feelings?

87
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,640
If you were in my shoes,
what would you have done?

88
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,800
Why?

89
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,320
Why would it come to this?

90
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,560
If it's possible,

91
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,640
I wish everything could go back
to how it was.

92
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,440
Leave me alone. Let go of me.

93
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,680
Spit it out!

94
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,520
I don't want to be awake.

95
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,200
I just want to be left alone

96
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,120
and have a good sleep alone.

97
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,400
I don't want to be awake.

98
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,280
My mom is now

99
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,840
lying in bed in a death-like coma.

100
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,520
Everything is ruined for me.

101

102

Zhou Yanzhao and Zhou Xiaomeng

126
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,080
stand with nothing
but a door separating them.

127
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,280
They are both suffering
from unspeakable pain

128
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,600
that they want to share.

129
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,520
However, they still can't face each other.

130
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,040
They can only do this.

131
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,440
Even though they know the other is there,

132
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,880
they still can't open the door
separating them

133
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,360
and walk into the arms of their love.

134
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,720
The Yunnan Sports-Themed Resort
with Guest Houses

135
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,240
is currently in the following status.

136
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,280
The development of Phase One
is close to an end.

137
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,240
The promotion plan is ready to go.

138
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,320
We will put our focus
on the tourism expo next month.

139
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,760
We have tasked the Marketing Department
to follow up with the promotion plan.

140
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,960
Yet there are a few promotion plans
taking place in our province.

141
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,840
Does Chairman Zhou have any suggestions?

142
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,400
Chairman Zhou?

143
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,760
What?

144
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,680
Are you listening to what I've just said?

145
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,920
There are a few promotion plans in Yunnan.

146
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,960
Do you have any good suggestions?

147
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,640
Nope.

148
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,080
It sounds good.

149
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,160
There's no problem.
Just go ahead with your plans.

150
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,400
If there's nothing else,
meeting dismissed.

151
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,200
What's wrong with him today?

152
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,240
I don't know.

153
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,320
What's the matter?

154
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,440
The Marketing Department has sent us
this promotion plan.

155
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,600
Have a look first.

156
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,320
Did you find that Chairman Zhou
was absent-minded at the meeting?

157
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,240
I wonder if there's anything
in the company

158
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,400
that has distracted him.

159
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,840
All projects

160
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,600
are being executed according to plan.

161
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,320
I don't see any problems.

162
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,400
Right.

163
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,600
It must be something at home then.

164
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,520
It seems that

165
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,520
you care about Chairman Zhou very much.

166
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,680
As subordinates,

167
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,440
we need to read the boss's mind.

168
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,800
I'm getting back to work.
Read the plan first.

169
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,240
We can discuss later.

170
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,840
You came to see me out of the blue.

171
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,680
What is it about?

172
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,880
Is it about your family or Xiaomeng?

173
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,120
I've been worrying.

174
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,120
Is it about Xiaomeng? What about her?

175
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,880
I will handle it.

176
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,080
I've come to ask you
something about Ye Sirong.

177
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,200
Aunt Ye?

178
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,000
Is her condition getting worse again?

179
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,240
If necessary, I can pay her a home visit.

180
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,880
Ye Sirong has been improving.

181
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,480
She can recognize me now.

182
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,760
But she still can't remember anything.

183
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,520
It is perfectly understandable.

184
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,840
She has suffered from severe trauma,

185
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,720
so her mind resists everything.

186
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,960
When her brain receives such signals,

187
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,880
it reflects on her behavior.

188
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,080
You have a point here.

189
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,680
However, I have an intuition recently.

190
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,000
It's very strong.

191
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,400
What is it?

192
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,760
I've found some clues at home.

193
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,040
I think that Ye Sirong

194
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,200
is not the murderer of my father.

195
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,240
The person has been hiding in the corner

196
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,920
and he won't let it end there.

197
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,560
Have you found any evidence?

198
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,920
Not yet.

199
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,280
But I remember

200
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,760
Ye Sirong has a fear of heights.

201
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,960
She wouldn't have been
to such a high place by herself.

202
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,000
Someone must have taken her there.

203
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,080
I am also looking for evidence.

204
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,000
We are just speculating

205
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,440
without any solid evidence.

206
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,840
Regardless of who this person is,

207
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,160
why he set Ye Sirong up,

208
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,680
and what is hidden behind this,

209
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,920
he is definitely deeply involved
in everything.

210
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,840
He must have visited this place
and planned the route in advance.

211
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,200
That's why he could perfectly evade

212
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,160
the frontal areas
covered by the CCTV cameras.

213
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,800
But it is a large area.

214
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,760
It is impossible
to completely conceal himself.

215
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,600
He must have left some traces.

216
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,120
How about this?

217
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,160
I will check all video footage again

218
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,600
to look for clues.

219
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,160
Thank you.

220
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,840
I can only rely on you with this.

221
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,320
I should do it, Chairman Zhou.

222
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,760
Don't worry.

223
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,920
I will help you find out the murderer.

224
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,640
Xiaomeng,

225
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,360
let's sit down.

226
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,520
What's on your mind?

227
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,040
It has just been a few days,

228
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,240
how come you look so tired?

229
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,920
Aunt Lin,

230
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,880
today

231
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,400
A Yan's girlfriend came over.

232
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,440
Girlfriend?

233
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,680
Since when does he have a girlfriend?

234
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,960
They have not made it public yet.

235
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,080
But I can tell,

236
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,200
A Yan likes her very much.

237
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,320
Miss Sun

238
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,760
seems to like A Yan very much, too.

239
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,040
They...

240
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,760
probably will make public
about their relationship soon.

241
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,880
That boy...

242
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,920
Xiaomeng, I really don't know

243
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,360
how to comfort you.

244
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,320
I can understand your feelings right now.

245
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,840
It's nothing.

246
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,640
I'm fine.

247
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,360
You like A Yan.

248
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,720
I know it.

249
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,080
You have been so nice to him.

250
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,760
The boy...

251
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,040
He...

252
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,520
He probably doesn't really know
what you feel deep down.

253
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,720
It's all right, Aunt Lin.

254
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
You don't have to console me.

255
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,880
Actually, I have known for a long time

256
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,200
that there's no chance

257
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,160
for A Yan and me.

258
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,720
Even if he learns of his birth,

259
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,760
so much has happened between us.

260
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,440
We have hurt each other.

261
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,280
Moreover,

262
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,360
the switch of love in my heart

263
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,200
has been turned off already.

264
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,480
Don't say that.

265
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,080
You are both young.

266
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,920
There's still a long journey ahead of you.

267
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,840
In my view,

268
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,280
your obstacles are just temporary.

269
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,000
Maybe, one of these days

270
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,640
you could still be together.

271
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,560
I really wish this day would come.

272
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,480
There won't be such a day

273
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,760
for A Yan and me.

274
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,080
Xiaomeng, do you know that

275
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,560
love is the only unpredictable thing
in this world?

276
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,760
Not until the last moment

277
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,560
are there always
hundreds of possibilities for love.

278
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,280
But...

279
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,680
I really don't see any hope now.

280
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,080
Let's put this aside.

281
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,200
Let's talk about your work.

282
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,760
How's your progress?

283
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,520
Same, not much progress.

284
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,400
There are some job offers,

285
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,680
but I don't think
those are suitable for me.

286
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,640
I still

287
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,280
don't want to do a job that I don't like.

288
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,520
Don't worry.

289
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,760
Some things take a bit of patience.

290
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,480
As always,

291
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,880
I believe in you.

292
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,400
You have the courage to face everything.

293
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,200
A nice girl like you

294
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,360
deserves a better life.

295
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,200
Thank you, Aunt Lin.

296
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,640
However,

297
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,840
I don't ask for much now.

298
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,120
I have planned everything.

299
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,000
Once I got a job

300
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,200
and settled down,

301
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,080
I will take my mom

302
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,800
to leave the Zhou family,

303
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,840
and leave A Yan.

304
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,160
What are you saying, Xiaomeng?

305
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,560
You said you'd leave A Yan?

306
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,640
No, you...

307
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,320
I...

308
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,320
I admit it's selfish of me to say this,

309
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,640
but I...

310
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,040
I think if one day you really leave A Yan,

311
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,200
he might turn into a very terrible person.

312
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,880
But do you know that

313
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,040
if I don't leave him,

314
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,560
I fear that my life

315
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,560
would be even more terrible.

316
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,720
How about this?

317
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,800
Give me a chance. I'll help you.

318
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,280
I'll help you find a job, Xiaomeng.

319
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,760
How about that, Xiaomeng?

320
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,800
It's not necessary.

321
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,760
I can find a job myself.

322
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,960
Now, I really

323
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,400
don't want help from anyone.

324
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,320
Didn't you say you believe in me?

325
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,600
You just need to wish me good luck.

326
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,880
All right then.

327
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,120
I respect your decision.

328
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,800
But please listen to me, Xiaomeng.

329
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,640
You have to promise me that

330
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,240
whenever and wherever

331
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,240
you need help,

332
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,520
I'll be the first person you call, okay?

333
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,640
Sure.

334
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,400
I'll remember that, Aunt Lin.

335
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,480
I'm so sorry

336
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,200
that you have to suffer.

337
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,080
I'm sorry.

338
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,680
I'm leaving now.

339
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,320
Aunt,

340
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,320
it's late. I'm leaving now.

341
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,600
I'll visit you again.

342
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,240
You're leaving?

343
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,600
You have to come more often.

344
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,640
I am alone here. I'm bored.

345
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,800
Are you leaving now?

346
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,200
I will see you out.

347
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,440
Please don't trouble yourself, Aunt.

348
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,560
Chairman Zhou, I'll see myself out.

349
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,880
Take care of Aunt.

350
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,840
Guang is not here. I'll give you a ride.

351
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,800
Chairman Zhou, it's really not necessary.

352
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,960
I'll take a taxi. It's fine.

353
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,040
A Yan,

354
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,040
it's dangerous for a young girl
to go home alone at night.

355
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,600
You'd better drive her.

356
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,440
Let's go. Don't say no to Aunt.

357
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,640
I shall oblige then.

358
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,440
Thank you, Auntie.

359
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,400
You're welcome.

360
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,440
Miss Sun,

361
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,840
you have to come more often to talk to me.

362
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,560
I will come more often.

363
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,280
Bye-bye.

364
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,520
I'd like to get off for some fresh air.

365
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,640
May I?

366
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,680
It's a nice view.

367
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,480
What do you think, Chairman Zhou?

368
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,360
Yes, it is.

369
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,480
Actually, I'm feeling a bit dreamy
right now.

370
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,720
I feel like I am enjoying the night view
with my boyfriend here.

371
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,680
A Yan,

372
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,440
I...

373
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,440
Can I stay by your side forever?

374
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,280
Since when do you feel like that?

375
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:42,920
Chairman Zhou,

376
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,040
don't you feel anything at all?

377
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,840
I'm sorry. I don't understand
what you're talking about.

378
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,160
Since I first met you at the pub.

379
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,360
Since I met you at my interview
at Shenghai.

380
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,000
Since we worked overtime together.

381
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,720
Since you took me
to the celebration party.

382
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,560
Since we had a business trip together.

383
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,720
I don't know since when

384
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,240
you have slowly become

385
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,000
the most important person in my heart.

386
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,080
You are serious. You are smart.

387
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,240
You are focused. Everything about you,

388
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,800
has enchanted me and impressed me.

389
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,720
Chairman Zhou, I...

390
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,680
I'm sorry.

391
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,880
If you don't like me,

392
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,680
why have you never rejected me?

393
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,760
That's why I've said I'm sorry.

394
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,640
I have never thought about being with you.

395
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,360
I don't know why you have misunderstood.

396
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,360
Why don't you give me a chance?

397
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,240
You have someone you love already.

398
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,720
Am I right?

399
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,000
That is private.

400
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,680
I see.

401
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,200
It's me who should apologize.

402
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,760
I've misunderstood.

403
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,160
I've thought too much.

404
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,360
I've put our relationship
in an awkward situation.

405
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,880
I hope you could find someone
that deserves you.

406
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,960
This is not comforting at all.

407
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,680
On the contrary,
it makes me feel even worse.

408
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,760
Chairman Zhou,

409
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,280
I guess you have never consoled

410
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,640
anyone that has been hurt by you.

411
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,840
(Investment and Partnership Party
for Dikai Commercial City)

412
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,560
Dad,

413
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,880
does our presence
at these pretentious banquets

414
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,440
have any positive effect?

415
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,120
Of course.

416
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,920
Today, we came for

417
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,200
the Dikai Commercial City Project.

418
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,840
The owners of some big brands
will be here.

419
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,000
They will be the targeted
business partners

420
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,280
of our Commercial City.

421
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,280
If they open their shops in Dikai,

422
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,680
other brands will follow suit.

423
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,720
If there are female CEOs,

424
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,520
do I need to flirt with them?

425
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,960
Be serious.

426
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,520
You have to put on a good show tonight.

427
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,920
President Jiang.

428
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,360
President Zhang.

429
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,760
The Farmer's Spring

430
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,720
is looking forward to working
with Miss Zitong.

431
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,160
(Nongfu Spring)

432
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,800
Thank you, Director Liu.

433
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,960
I wonder if Miss Zitong is interested
in our brand, Boloni?

434
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,600
Boloni, I've heard of it.

435
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,040
I like your products very much.

436
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,360
Thank you.

437
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,760
Miss Zitong is so young and pretty.

438
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,800
Yes.

439
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,120
Excuse me. I have a friend over there.

440
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,040
I'll be back in a minute.

441
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,000
Sure. Please.

442
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,840
Do you remember me?

443
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,960
Sure, you're Zitong,

444
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,280
Xiaomeng's friend.

445
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,080
I didn't expect to see you here.

446
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,600
They want me to endorse their brand,

447
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,920
so they've invited me.

448
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,800
How about you?

449
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,560
I am in charge
of a Commercial City Project.

450
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,440
We are currently inviting brands
to join us,

451
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,000
so...

452
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,320
my dad forced me to come and socialize.

453
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,760
Actually, I don't enjoy
these occasions either.

454
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,280
I don't know what to say.

455
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,400
And those bosses

456
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,280
keep staring at me.

457
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,960
It is a compliment that they stare at you.

458
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,200
How about you? Won't you compliment me?

459
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,800
You already have so many compliments.

460
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,240
You don't need mine.

461
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,800
A Ze!

462
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,720
A Ze, come here.

463
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,440
The kids nowadays...

464
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,200
It's all right.

465
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,440
I'm getting out of here.

466
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,960
The air outside is much fresher than here.

467
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,240
Sure. I will accompany you.

468
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,760
You are Xiaomeng's classmate.

469
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,680
Are you around the same age with her?

470
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,360
Yes, we are the same age.

471
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,440
You seem to have a more mature look.

472
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,560
Do you mean that I look older?

473
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,800
Of course not.

474
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,360
Being mature is a merit.

475
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,800
You and Xiaomeng have different styles

476
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,080
and different strengths.

477
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,280
Actually, this is not my usual self.

478
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,040
I am here to socialize today.

479
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,080
All right. I'm praising you.

480
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,280
Don't think too much.

481
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,640
Right.

482
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,400
Have you met Xiaomeng recently?

483
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,600
Yes, of course.

484
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,080
We are best friends.

485
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,960
Yes, I know.

486
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,960
How is Xiaomeng lately?

487
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,480
The last time I met her,

488
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,160
she was worried about job hunting.

489
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,400
She...

490
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,160
Those previous incidents
have a great impact on her.

491
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,800
So it's not easy for her to find jobs.

492
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,680
This is my fault.

493
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,760
I didn't expect those photos

494
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,720
would bring such a negative impact on her.

495
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,800
Well, are you and Xiaomeng

496
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,880
in a romantic relationship?

497
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,640
Of course not.

498
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,400
I like her very much,

499
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,840
but she has never accepted my love.

500
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,480
Actually, Xiaomeng

501
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,680
has someone in her heart.

502
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,880
Has she told you that?

503
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,120
She,

504
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,080
mentioned it in passing.

505
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,200
Actually, an excellent man like you,

506
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,200
has no need to confine yourself
to Xiaomeng alone.

507
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,080
My point is,

508
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,480
a rich and handsome bachelor like you

509
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,600
can have better options

510
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,440
if you want.

511
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,200
Actually, I have had many girlfriends,

512
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,160
when I was young and all about fun.

513
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,360
But since I've met Xiaomeng,

514
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,360
I only want to be with her.

515
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,200
Although she looks weak on the outside,

516
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,240
she has a very strong mind.

517
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,480
Sometimes, she even has a little temper.

518
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,080
I can't really tell how she attracts me.

519
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,440
But every time when I see her,

520
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,000
I just feel very happy.

521
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,640
Actually, I understand your feelings
very well.

522
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,280
Xiaomeng is a lucky girl

523
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,040
to have you protecting and caring for her.

524
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,160
I hope Xiaomeng

525
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,360
would treasure your love.

526
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,840
Thank you.

527
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,880
I'm so jealous of Xiaomeng.

528
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,440
Please excuse me.

529
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,200
I have to go back in
to greet those brand owners.

530
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,840
Will you return with me?

531
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,400
I think I'll pass.

532
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,720
I'm glad to see you today.

533
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,480
Shall we meet again some other time?

534
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,320
Zhou Xiaomeng,

535
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,080
I have to take everything from you.

536
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,240
A Yan,

537
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,040
have you driven Miss Sun home?

538
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,840
I think Miss Sun

539
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,520
is very pretty and very sweet.

540
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,360
Does she like you?

541
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,560
It's late now. You should rest early.

542
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,160
I think she...

543
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,680
-Xiaomeng, you're back.
-Mom.

544
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,080
Miss Sun was here just now.

545
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,480
A Yan gave her a ride back home.

546
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,760
I'm telling you,

547
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,720
Miss Sun is very fond of A Yan.

548
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,920
A Yan, do you like her?

549
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,320
You should rest now.

550
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,200
A Yan...

551
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,040
Mom, it's late.

552
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,560
Let's get back to our room and rest.

553
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,800
I mean it. Miss Sun is very pretty.

554
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,040
I like her, too.

555
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,560
Qiao Zhen.

556
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,040
I'm sorry, Xiaomeng.

557
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,520
It has been so busy in the station.

558
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,680
I could hardly take a break and sneak out.

559
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,840
How are you?

560
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,600
I'm fine.

561
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,000
My mom is very emotional though.

562
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,720
She even hits me sometimes.

563
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,480
Don't worry, Xiaomeng.

564
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,280
I believe Aunt will get well soon.

565
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,560
I hope so.

566
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,240
Right.

567
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,840
Didn't you had a job interview previously?

568
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,080
Have you heard from them?

569
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,240
I went,

570
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,400
and met with the person in charge.

571
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,640
-However...
-Did they love you so much

572
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,600
that they hired you on the spot?

573
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,600
Qiao Zhen,

574
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,720
I think that production company

575
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,040
is not suitable for me.

576
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,040
I will figure out something else.

577
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,200
How come?

578
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,400
I thought it was going quite well.

579
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,600
It's nothing. It's just me.

580
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,600
I think that

581
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,120
their company has a public frontage
after all.

582
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,560
At the moment,

583
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,480
I may bring a negative image
to the company.

584
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,120
It's fine.

585
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,920
I can look for other jobs.

586
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,320
I have just graduated, so there's no rush.

587
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,280
I'll take it slowly.

588
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,400
It's just a job. It's not a big deal.

589
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,520
If this one doesn't work for you,
we'll find another.

590
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,320
Don't worry.

591
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,000
After a while,

592
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,160
our channel will hire you back.

593
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,840
I don't think it's going to happen.

594
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,280
I met Zitong some time ago.

595
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,840
She seems to be doing well

596
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,320
and the channel is giving her
opportunities.

597
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,840
I'm really happy for her.

598
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,640
She has been working very hard.

599
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,240
Xiaomeng,

600
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,240
don't be so pessimistic.

601
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,440
I know that

602
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,120
you need a job desperately.

603
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,280
Yes, I want to earn money
and be independent as soon as possible.

604
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,800
I am my mother's only hope.

605
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,320
What's the urgency about?

606
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,720
Did something happen at home again?

607
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,760
Don't stress yourself out.

608
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,360
Leave that to me.

609
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,960
Right.

610
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,200
My friend

611
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,920
gave me this today.

612
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,280
Their children's theater

613
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,760
is recruiting actors
for a children's play.

614
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,640
The wage and benefits are not bad.

615
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,680
You shall give it a try.

616
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,440
Children's play?

617
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,440
Can I do it?

618
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,040
Why not?

619
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,760
You are popular among children.

620
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,440
They are going to like you.

621
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,560
But recently,

622
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,440
many parents hold a strong view
against me.

623
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,480
They are afraid that I would have
a bad impact on their children.

624
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,360
Xiaomeng,

625
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,280
the incident has been dying down
gradually.

626
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,240
You can't let it hinder your life forever.

627
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,360
Give it a try.

628
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,080
Furthermore,

629
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,840
they allow flexible working hours,

630
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,640
so it won't be a problem for you
to take care of your mom.

631
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,120
All right, I will give it a try.

632
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,480
(Project Introduction, Peter Pan)

633
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,040
Peter Pan.

634
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,680
Are you crazy?

635
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,320
(Resume)

636
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,240
Hurry.

637
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,440
Look here.

638
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,720
-It's so pretty.
-Come quickly.

639
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,720
It's beautiful!

640
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,520
-It looks so nice.
-So pretty.

641
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,280
Look at this.

642
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,760
It's beautiful.

643
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,240
Peter Pan is here.

644
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,040
-I...
-What's the matter?

645
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,520
Say the lines.

646
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,280
Haven't we just rehearsed?

647
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,960
All right. Let's take five.

648
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,080
Wendy, memorize the lines.

649
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,760
You girls, come over here.

650
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,960
I'm telling you,

651
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,000
you all have to push yourself harder.

652
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,440
It's different from the script. Look.

653
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,880
The tone is different.

654
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,000
Yes, look here.

655
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,200
It's different indeed.

656
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,920
What's the matter?

657
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,080
I saw you on the stage.

658
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,320
Did you forget your lines?

659
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,280
I was a bit nervous.

660
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,280
I didn't know what I was thinking.

661
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,680
Are you still in school?

662
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,760
Peter Pan and I are both freshmen
in the university.

663
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,600
We don't have many experiences
in performing art.

664
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,760
It's fine.

665
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,520
When you get more familiar with the lines

666
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,640
and the stage,

667
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,680
you will act more natural.

668
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,040
I still remember my first time
being in front of the camera,

669
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,320
I also did very poorly.

670
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,880
Are you an actor, too?

671
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,680
I...

672
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,080
I was a host for a children's program.

673
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,880
You...

674
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,400
You are Miss Xiaomeng.

675
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,360
That's me.

676
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,040
I have heard about you.

677
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,880
Yes,

678
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,080
I had some negative news previously.

679
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,480
After that,

680
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,800
I quitted being the host.

681
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,080
No, I don't think it was your fault.

682
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,120
What you did behind the camera

683
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,600
is your private life.

684
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,920
You don't have to care about

685
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,200
the moral judgment
and censure of the public.

686
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,520
People who like you
would not care what you do.

687
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,880
People who don't like you

688
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,680
would not be happy with anything
that you do.

689
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,040
So I think you don't need to care about
what the others think.

690
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,720
I didn't expect you to be so...

691
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,560
Weird, right?

692
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,480
I think you are right.

693
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,760
You are so brave.

694
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,160
I believe

695
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,000
you could do a much better
performance on stage.

696
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,240
After chatting with you,

697
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,800
I feel less nervous now.

698
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,720
Thank you, Xiaomeng.

699
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,560
It's fine.

700
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,400
Director.

701
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,480
This is Zhou Xiaomeng.

702
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,480
She used to be a host for a TV show.

703
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,880
Hello, Director.

704
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,120
My friend told me that

705
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,240
your theater is recruiting.

706
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,080
I am here for an audition today.

707
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,640
This is my resume.

708
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,200
Okay.

709
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,960
Let me finish the rehearsal
of this scene first.

710
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,160
We will talk later.

711
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,200
Sure.

712
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,160
Action.

713
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,720
Peter, we are talking about
how to go back.

714
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,480
I have prepared an elf

715
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,520
to escort you back.

716
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,840
What I mean is,

717
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,680
you should come back with us.

718
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,840
And then, what?

719
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,880
They'll send me to school and work.

720
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,720
Soon, I will become another person.

721
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,440
I don't want that.

722
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,080
I want to be a child forever

723
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,200
to be happy forever.

724
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,080
You can't think like that.

725
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,840
Grow up, Peter.

726
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,720
Good.

727
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,600
Very good. Keep up the good work.

728
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,120
Okay. Prepare for the next scene.

729
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,680
Let's go.

730
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,840
Director.

731
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,800
I've read your resume,

732
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,520
and I know who you are.

733
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,800
I can explain about that incident.

734
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,680
It is actually not
what everyone thinks it is.

735
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,960
Zhou Xiaomeng,

736
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,200
the host of children's program,

737
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,560
Fairy Tale Street.

738
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,280
You have also published
some audio children books, right?

739
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,600
I thought you looked familiar.

740
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,840
I didn't expect

741
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,600
you would come here for an audition.

742
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,000
Thank you, Director.

743
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,120
But those are all things of the past.

744
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,640
You were doing well as a host.

745
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,560
Why did you quit?

746
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,600
I don't know if you have heard
about what happened to me.

747
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,480
Now, I am

748
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,720
no longer fit for hosting
children's program.

749
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,040
Is that about the photos on the Internet?

750
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,360
That was nothing.

751
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,680
It's natural for young people
to be ruthless and make mistakes.

752
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,840
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

753
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,320
I think what's shameful is

754
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,920
the person who took your photos

755
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,360
and put them on the Internet.

756
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:16,880
What do you think?

757
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,760
When can you start joining our rehearsal?

758
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,040
I...

759
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,440
You mean I am hired?

760
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,560
Strictly speaking, you are on probation.

761
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,000
As you know,

762
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,880
theaters are having a hard time nowadays.

763
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,720
The pressure is huge.

764
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,840
We produce children's plays

765
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,840
which have even less audience
and hence more pressure.

766
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,400
So the wage

767
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,320
can't be compared with what you got
as a TV host.

768
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,400
I understand. It's all right.

769
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,680
Wage is not a problem.

770
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,840
It's a deal then.

771
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,600
Our staff will contact you
for the remaining details.

772
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,440
At the beginning,

773
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,880
you will help
with the on-site coordination,

774
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,160
getting familiarized with our scripts

775
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,800
and taking notes.

776
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,880
Meanwhile,
let's get to know each other better.
