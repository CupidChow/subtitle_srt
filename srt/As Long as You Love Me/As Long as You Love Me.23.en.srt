1
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,760
(Episode 23)

2
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,240
Xiaomeng,

3
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,880
is there anything for calling me

4
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,240
at this hour?

5
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,360
It's nothing.

6
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,200
I just miss you.

7
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,280
I see.

8
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,440
How have you been?

9
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,640
Don't worry, Uncle Fang.

10
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,760
I'm good. My work's going well

11
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,480
and I'm quite happy.

12
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,120
But I need to check something with you.

13
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,680
Sure, go ahead.

14
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,080
Uncle Fang, were you present

15
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,920
when A Yan was born?

16
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,000
Xiaomeng,

17
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,120
why are you asking this?

18
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,880
I wanted to celebrate
A Yan's birthday with him earlier

19
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,320
but he seemed reluctant.

20
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,480
That's why I wanted to check with you.

21
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,320
Well, A Yan

22
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,280
behaves differently

23
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,600
from other kids since young.

24
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,960
He's born in Sydney.

25
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,120
At that time, Boss and I

26
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,280
were tied up in an acquisition project

27
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,080
in China.

28
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,480
As you know,

29
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,760
I had to stay with Boss.

30
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,280
We had planned

31
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,800
to go to Sydney

32
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,680
at the time of A Yan's birth.

33
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,040
But right after we signed the contract,

34
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,720
A Yan's mother told Boss

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,560
that she had given birth.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,320
In other words,

37
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,920
neither Uncle Zhou nor you

38
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,200
was present

39
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,240
when A Yan was born.

40
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,120
That's right.

41
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,760
A Yan was born

42
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,520
two weeks before the estimated due date.

43
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,320
Boss and I couldn't make it

44
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,640
so A Yan's mother

45
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,480
had to stay in an overseas hospital

46
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,920
all by herself.

47
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,800
Even after many years later,

48
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,280
Boss still felt guilty about it.

49
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,760
I see.

50
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,240
Xiaomeng,

51
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,080
did you guys quarrel?

52
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,280
Do think of a way to patch up.

53
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,800
No, we did not.

54
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,920
We're getting along fine.

55
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,080
Uncle Fang, please send my regards

56
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,240
to Haixing and Sister Li.

57
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,280
I miss you guys.

58
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,760
I'll go visit you

59
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,240
on the island sometime later.

60
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,800
That's great.

61
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,680
This child...

62
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,240
Mom,...

63
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,320
I've to go somewhere far.

64
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,920
Be well.

65
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,000
Perhaps when I'm back,...

66
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,680
no one will misunderstand you anymore.

67
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,480
My most beloved dad is here.

68
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,440
I've always disliked

69
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,680
the offices on this floor.

70
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,840
You can choose not to come.

71
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,240
Shenghai is big.

72
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,800
You can go anywhere you like.

73
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,680
Look.

74
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,640
The buildings in front

75
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,440
totally block the view

76
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,600
and I can't see the sunrise and sunset.

77
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,720
I simply don't understand

78
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,200
why Zhou Binli chose this floor

79
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,040
as the executive's office area.

80
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,640
Dad, everyone has his own preference.

81
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,840
Just like I hate coming to work here.

82
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,360
You hate this?

83
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,000
So what do you want?

84
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,000
It doesn't matter.

85
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,920
At the end of the day,
I still have to listen to you.

86
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,840
A Ze, you must understand that

87
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,280
every choice we make

88
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,560
needs to be thought over carefully.

89
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,080
Just like when you learnt fencing,

90
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,600
doing as you please

91
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,040
would not win you any mark.

92
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,520
Stop playing.

93
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,640
Listen.

94
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,960
My project needs you.

95
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,760
What do you mean?

96
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,480
What do I mean?

97
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,400
I want you to join me.

98
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,520
No way, I've yet to

99
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,840
complete my projects on hand.

100
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,120
If I go over now,

101
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,520
everyone in Shenghai
would call me a good-for-nothing.

102
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,400
I'll get someone more suitable

103
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,720
to take over your projects.

104
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,760
A Ze,...

105
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,600
I've dumped all my cash

106
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,640
into the Dikai Commercial City project.

107
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,880
Since you find this project promising,

108
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,120
you're free to dump in
as much money as you like.

109
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,280
Listen to me.

110
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,320
Zhou Yanzhao bid for
that piece of land at a very high price.

111
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,200
His capital chain...

112
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,400
I'm sure he'll think of ways

113
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,920
to hang on to this project.

114
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,440
I'll give you three days

115
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,640
to consider.

116
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,560
Familiarize yourself with Dikai.

117
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,720
Think about it through

118
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,840
a commercial angle.

119
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,440
Fine, let's talk again three days later.

120
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,680
When I asked Zhou Yanzhao to consider,

121
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,320
he gave me an answer within three seconds.

122
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,400
At the Sports Institute
when we fought for championship,

123
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,440
I was already not his match.

124
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,680
Why do I still have
to compete with him now?

125
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,240
Give it some thought.

126
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,760
I want you to win this time.

127
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,480
(Shenghai Hospital)

128
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,720
Xiaomeng, you're here.

129
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,760
Director Lin.

130
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,280
You've not been here these few days.

131
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,680
Tiankong misses you.

132
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,520
I had something to attend to.

133
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,440
I was away.

134
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,800
How's Tiankong recovering?

135
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,200
He's recovering well.

136
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,400
The doctor said

137
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,360
he's getting better.

138
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,880
Leave it here.

139
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,160
Director Lin,

140
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,520
can I have a word with you?

141
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,640
Sure.

142
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,800
Let's talk outside.

143
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,640
Okay.

144
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,680
Let's go out.

145
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,560
Come on.

146
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,320
Xiaomeng, you said

147
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,480
you've something to tell me.

148
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,880
We can talk here.

149
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,360
Does this ring comes in a pair

150
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,800
with the ring

151
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,560
you gave Tiankong?

152
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,520
You knew about it.

153
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,120
You knew about it all along.

154
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,480
That's why you deliberately
approached him.

155
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,040
No,

156
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,200
I...

157
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,080
I don't understand what you mean.

158
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,720
You knew long ago who Zhou Yanzhao is.

159
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,280
That's why you suggested Shenghai Group
helping the Children Welfare Center

160
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,720
to bring you and him closer.

161
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,040
You came back from overseas

162
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,600
because of him, right?

163
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,960
I was away...

164
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,000
because I went to Sydney.

165
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,560
I found a person in Sydney.

166
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,520
He told me a story.

167
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,520
Who is he? What did he tell you?

168
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,960
He's a doctor.

169
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,640
He told me...

170
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,600
he once helped...

171
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,720
to deliver the babies...

172
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,760
of two Chinese women
more than 20 years ago.

173
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,280
He remembers the incident...

174
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
that day...

175
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,160
very well because...

176
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,200
that incident...

177
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,160
made him lose his job...

178
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,720
and ruined his future.

179
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,680
I'm sure you're well aware

180
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,960
of that incident too,...

181
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,760
Director Lin.

182
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,280
Why?

183
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,520
Why were you so heartless?

184
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,400
You abandoned your own child.

185
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,600
I did not!

186
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,680
I did not...

187
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,480
I was very young then.

188
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,760
I was still in college.

189
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,200
I was too young

190
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,440
and I knew nothing.

191
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,880
I was stupid

192
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,280
and got pregnant.

193
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,200
I thought...

194
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,080
it was real love...

195
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,520
and we'd be together.

196
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,320
Later, the doctor said

197
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,160
I was too weak

198
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,000
to have an abortion.

199
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,760
My family objected
to me giving birth to the baby.

200
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,680
Even then,
I still gave birth to that baby.

201
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,040
Doctor,...

202
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,200
how is my niece?

203
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,760
Both the mother and baby are fine.

204
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,280
They're just tired
and haven't woken up yet.

205
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,400
Thank you.

206
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,440
It's two weeks premature
but she still gave birth nonetheless.

207
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,560
I already told you
to ask her to abort the baby

208
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,800
but you refused to listen.

209
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,440
Keep your voice down.

210
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,040
The baby's born but

211
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,440
he doesn't have a father.

212
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,520
Ling Ling's not married yet.

213
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,800
With that child,

214
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,880
her whole life will be ruined.

215
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,000
No, she must not

216
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,680
keep the baby.

217
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,840
On the day

218
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,240
I gave birth to the child,

219
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,120
my uncle and aunt told me...

220
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,920
he's dead.

221
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,200
It can't be...

222
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,200
It can't be...

223
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,600
It can't be...

224
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,880
-My baby's not dead!
-Yueling...

225
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,960
-Aunt, you must be lying.
-Yueling...

226
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,560
-Yueling.
-You must be lying.

227
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,680
Yueling,

228
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,920
it's all fated, Yueling...

229
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,000
How can this be?

230
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,000
How can this be? My baby...

231
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,360
My baby...

232
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,760
My baby...

233
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,720
She told me he's dead.

234
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,720
Xiaomeng, I had

235
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,600
no other choice at that time.

236
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,840
I could only believe her.

237
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,560
And you...

238
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,400
found out later

239
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,880
that the child's still alive?

240
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,200
Yes.

241
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,560
Aunt suffered from cancer...

242
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,720
and told me this secret

243
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,760
before she passed on.

244
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,120
I've to tell you a secret.

245
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,800
You child is still alive.

246
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,560
Aunt... Aunt, what did you say?

247
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,000
My child is still alive?

248
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,560
Where is he then? Where is he?

249
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,800
We gave him to a woman...

250
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,680
by the name of Fang Meijiao.

251
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,640
Baby, sleep well.

252
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,520
Miss, please give me the baby.

253
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,360
It's already been 12 hours since he died.

254
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,760
We must take him away.

255
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,000
No, he's not!

256
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,680
He's my baby.

257
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,320
-Miss, it's okay.
-My baby just falls asleep.

258
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,120
Come, help me please.

259
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,240
Please...

260
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,000
don't take my baby away.

261
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,920
-Please...
-We'll take care of him.

262
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,280
I can't live without him.

263
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
Please...

264
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,320
-It's okay.
-don't take my baby away.

265
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,960
Please...

266
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,760
don't take my baby away.

267
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,240
Please...

268
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,600
don't take my baby away.

269
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,120
Please...

270
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,480
Please...

271
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,880
don't take my baby away.

272
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,840
Miss,...

273
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,800
I can save your baby.

274
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,280
What did you say?

275
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,640
You should...

276
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,120
calm down first.

277
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,080
If you wish,

278
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,120
your baby can be alive again.

279
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,880
Really?

280
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,800
Your child is well.

281
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,680
Your uncle and I did you wrong.

282
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,640
But we did it for your good.

283
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,120
Please don't blame us.

284
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,680
After I found out my child's alive,...

285
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,080
I looked for him everywhere.

286
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,080
I finally found him.

287
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,440
He's with the Zhou Family.

288
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,840
His name is A Yan.

289
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,240
He was already this tall.

290
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,080
He had everything

291
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,720
a young man dreams of.

292
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,800
And that family treated him well.

293
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,160
So I couldn't take him back.

294
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,880
I was afraid of ruining everything he had.

295
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,920
I dared not take him back.

296
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,840
Yes.

297
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,960
You suffered a lot and I should pity you.

298
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,800
But you know what?

299
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,760
Your son hates me

300
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,920
and my mother.

301
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,880
He thought my mother and I

302
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,560
killed his father.

303
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,480
No, he's his adoptive father.

304
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,640
He has changed so much

305
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,480
I almost couldn't recognize him.

306
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,080
What's even more funny

307
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,480
is that I only find out now that

308
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,560
he's not even

309
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,960
a part of the Zhou Family.

310
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,320
He has no relation to the Zhou Family.

311
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,080
Xiaomeng, I'm sorry.

312
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,080
I'm sorry, Xiaomeng.

313
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,680
I don't need your apology.

314
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,600
I was really kept in the dark.

315
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,120
If my child

316
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,280
has hurt you

317
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,680
or your family,

318
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,400
I'll apologize on his behalf.

319
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,920
I'm sorry.

320
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,240
But I've

321
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,240
to ask you for a favor.

322
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,960
You must keep this a secret.

323
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,760
You must not tell anyone.

324
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,000
Why?

325
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,120
If you let this secret out,

326
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,400
everything that A Yan has will be ruined.

327
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,560
His career,...

328
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,000
his future...

329
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,520
everything!

330
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,520
So you must keep this secret.

331
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,280
You must not tell anyone.

332
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,520
I've another question for you.

333
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,040
You approached me

334
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,360
because of A Yan, right?

335
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,920
Xiaomeng,...

336
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,800
from the first time I met you,...

337
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,800
you reminded me of myself.

338
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,600
The girl who loved A Yan's father

339
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,200
with all her heart.

340
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,720
You're kind and innocent.

341
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,920
You believe in love.

342
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,440
So I know

343
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,120
you love A Yan.

344
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,600
You're willing
to do anything for him, right?

345
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,960
The word "love"...

346
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,480
is too heavy for me.

347
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,560
Do you intend to...

348
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,880
keep this from him forever?

349
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,560
How can I...

350
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,240
How can I tell him?

351
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,040
What can I tell him?

352
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,400
I can't be asking for more.

353
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,160
Now that I've found my child,...

354
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,160
I'll just look at him...

355
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,960
from afar.

356
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,760
I'll leave...

357
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,800
the rest to God.

358
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,600
I'm tired.

359
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,520
I'm going home.

360
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,760
Xiaomeng!

361
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,360
You'll keep this secret for me, right?

362
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,720
I don't know.

363
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,320
Xiaomeng!

364
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,400
You must keep this a secret.

365
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,760
You must not tell anyone.

366
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,280
If you let this secret out,

367
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,120
everything that A Yan has will be ruined.

368
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,160
Guang,...

369
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,600
A Yan just came back from a business trip.

370
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,080
Why did he attend a social engagement
instead of resting?

371
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,680
The company needs money.

372
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,920
He's literally using his life
to raise funds.

373
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,560
All right.

374
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,880
Go back and rest.

375
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,800
-I'll take care of him.
-Let me do it.

376
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,680
Don't worry. I can do it.

377
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,480
Okay. If Brother Yan asks for me,

378
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,360
-call me anytime.
-Okay.

379
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,520
You drank so much.

380
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,480
Don't you feel terrible?

381
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,280
No. Leave me alone.

382
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,040
I've heard what you did for Tiankong.

383
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,640
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

384
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,280
Ten bottles...

385
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,280
I want 10 bottles.

386
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,800
Waiter, get me 10 bottles!

387
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,760
You're drunk. Rest now.

388
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,800
I'm not drunk...

389
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,080
Chairman Yang said he'll lend me

390
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,520
a million for each glass I drink.

391
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,720
How much did you drink?

392
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,600
Fifty... fifty million.

393
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,240
I drank fifty million.

394
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,280
I'm wide awake. I'm not drunk.

395
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,240
Fifty million in one day.

396
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,280
I'll have three billion
in two months' time.

397
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,200
It's three billion!

398
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,600
Don't you care for your life?

399
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,720
Life?

400
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,480
All I want now is to keep

401
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,920
the life of Shenghai.

402
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,120
My life is nothing.

403
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,840
I don't care for it.

404
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,920
But Shenghai

405
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,400
is already very established.

406
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,120
Why do you have to fight so hard?

407
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,800
Shenghai has no money.

408
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,680
It's an empty shell.

409
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,120
I don't know how Dad

410
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,680
managed to survive all these years.

411
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,160
Dad! You're amazing.

412
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,080
You have my respect.

413
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,160
You're Xiaomeng, right?

414
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,040
I've let my dad down.

415
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,000
My dad slogged all his life for Shenghai.

416
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,280
I can't allow it

417
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,480
to be ruined in my hands.

418
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,840
I've let my dad down.

419
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,360
I've let my dad down!

420
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,080
You're drunk.

421
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Lie down.

422
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,760
Lie down.

423
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,400
Sister Hua.

424
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,760
My mom likes to go to those

425
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,040
lively places like the park.

426
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,560
Please bring her out for a walk.

427
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,120
But don't stay out too late.

428
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,320
Okay...

429
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,080
With me around,
you don't have to worry about Dr. Ye.

430
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,280
I guarantee she'll have a good time.

431
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,040
Take care and stay safe.

432
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,480
Beware of the traffic.

433
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,080
Xiaomeng,

434
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,920
I used to be the one
telling you all these.

435
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,160
How come our roles changed today?

436
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,680
Come on, Dr. Ye.

437
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,120
Let's go out for some fun.

438
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,600
Mom, go on.

439
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,840
-I'm off.
-Let's go.

440
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,240
We'll go to the park, okay?

441
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,440
The air's fresh
and there're many people there.

442
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,680
It's very lively.

443
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,480
There're lots of kids there too.

444
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,440
Let's go and enjoy ourselves.

445
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,600
Are you feeling better?

446
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,920
I'm fine. I'm awake now.

447
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,600
Thanks for helping Tiankong.

448
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,280
What?

449
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,080
Dr. Xiao told me everything.

450
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,400
Thanks to you, Tiankong managed

451
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,640
to have his operation earlier.

452
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,880
I'd blamed you wrongly.

453
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,560
It's all right.

454
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,840
Did you visit Madam Lin recently?

455
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,840
Why should I visit her?

456
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,040
She wants to see you.

457
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,240
She wants you to visit Tiankong.

458
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,440
After all, you helped Tiankong a lot.

459
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,440
You should give him some encouragement.

460
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,280
I'll get ready then.

461
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,040
Just a minute.

462
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,040
I don't remember
you talking to me like this before.

463
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,360
Indeed, I've never spoken

464
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,360
to your current self before.

465
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,240
Anything else?

466
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,240
No.

467
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,440
Do it slowly.

468
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,000
Sister Hua.

469
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,600
I'm thirsty.

470
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,320
You're thirsty?

471
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,920
Let's go to the store there

472
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,640
to get a drink.

473
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,680
I don't want to go.

474
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,240
I still want to play for a while.

475
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,200
Okay, Dr. Ye.

476
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,560
I'll go buy it for you.

477
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,400
Be good and sit here.

478
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,000
Don't go anywhere and wait for me.

479
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,640
I'm so forgetful.

480
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,000
I keep forgetting things.

481
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,800
Dr. Ye,

482
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:51,920
I'm sorry.

483
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,080
Look at me.

484
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,440
I'm so forgetful.

485
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,920
When we came out just now,

486
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,440
I brought nothing

487
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,120
but the keys.

488
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,840
I don't have a cent with me now.

489
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,240
Shall we go back?

490
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,480
I'll make you nice food and drinks.

491
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,040
Okay.

492
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,000
Let's go.

493
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,800
Come on.

494
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,160
Didn't I tell you not to go again?

495
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,920
You were almost caught last time

496
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,800
and now you acted without permission.

497
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,880
Will you be happy only after

498
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,040
you ruin my plan?

499
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,080
I just want to get this settled.

500
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,160
Don't try to act smart.

501
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,080
Just do what I instruct you.

502
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,160
Don't ever do things

503
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,040
without my knowledge again, get it?

504
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,800
-Yes.
-Get out!

505
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,520
The doctor said

506
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,240
Tiankong hasn't fully recovered.

507
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,880
He needs more rest and care

508
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,280
before he can regain his eyesight.

509
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,640
Okay.

510
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,280
Let's go out. Don't wake him up.

511
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,840
-Director Lin.
-Xiaomeng, you're here.

512
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,240
A Yan, you're here too.

513
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,360
Director Lin,

514
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,640
we came to visit Tiankong.

515
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,440
Thank you.

516
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,600
I've been tied up at work recently,

517
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,280
so I couldn't visit

518
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,520
Tiankong and you.

519
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,960
Yes, it's been a while

520
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,080
since I last met you.

521
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,240
I've missed you.

522
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,680
Aunt Lin.

523
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,600
I've something to tell you.

524
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,640
Can you spare me some time?

525
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,040
Now?

526
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,120
Director, you guys can talk outside.

527
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,520
I'll take care of Tiankong.

528
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,280
Okay, let's go to the garden.

529
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,360
We can talk on the way.

530
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,560
Okay.

531
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,800
(Inpatient Department, Washroom)

532
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,520
A Yan, I...

533
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,760
Aunt Lin,...

534
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,160
feel free to speak your mind.

535
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,520
We...

536
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,520
have not met for some time.

537
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,120
That's right.

538
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,200
We've not met for some time.

539
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,560
Thanks for...

540
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,000
helping Tiankong.

541
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,840
Don't mention it.

542
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,320
Aunt Lin,...

543
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,520
I need to ask you for a favor.

544
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,080
Tell me.

545
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,760
I want to buy Tiankong's paintings.

546
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,440
Shenghai Group is working on

547
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,640
a sports stadium project.

548
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,440
In our vision,

549
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,960
a part of it
is designed specifically for the kids.

550
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,360
We hope they get to enjoy

551
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,400
the happiness of doing sports

552
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,400
in this sports stadium.

553
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,800
I've seen Tiankong's paintings.

554
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,160
It's exactly what we want.

555
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,960
So I hope to buy them...

556
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,120
and fit them into
the design of the sports stadium.

557
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,280
This is a good idea.

558
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,960
I don't think there'll be any issue...

559
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,680
but I need to discuss this

560
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,760
with the other teachers

561
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,760
in the welfare center.

562
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,240
Sure. I'll wait for your news.

563
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,120
Aunt Lin,...

564
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,840
can you give me Xiaomeng's

565
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,520
fairytale works as well?

566
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,040
Of course.

567
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,560
I want to keep it from her for now.

568
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,040
Can you help me keep this secret?

569
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,080
Sure. I know

570
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,880
you want to give her a surprise.

571
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,440
By the way,

572
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,120
why do you want to construct

573
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,440
a sports stadium?

574
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,800
You may not be aware...

575
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,720
but I used to be

576
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,600
an athlete in boxing.

577
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,000
What a surprise.

578
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,120
At that time,...

579
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,000
both Xiaomeng and I
were with a sports school.

580
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,440
I was with the boxing team

581
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,960
while she was
with the artistic gymnastics team.

582
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,400
Come to think of it,...

583
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,440
we were so carefree.

584
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,240
How I wish you could be less busy.

585
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,480
Then you can tell me
more about your young...

586
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,200
you and Xiaomeng's

587
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,080
younger days.

588
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,000
But who would expect...

589
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,200
the boxer to become...

590
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,880
the boss of a real estate company now.

591
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,720
All he faces every day
are graphs and reports,...

592
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,000
and invisible opponents

593
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,240
who constantly threaten him.

594
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,240
A Yan, although I don't know

595
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,960
much about the business sector,

596
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,320
I believe

597
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,600
you can do it.

598
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,760
You'll succeed.

599
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,680
I fully support you.

600
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,600
Aunt Lin,...

601
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,000
I wonder what's wrong with me today.

602
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,320
When I saw you, I felt close to you

603
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,320
and wanted to tell you more.

604
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,360
Me too. Seeing you

605
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,920
reminds me of my family.

606
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,880
Excuse me, Aunt Lin.
I've to take this call.

607
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,920
Okay.

608
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:12,960
Hello.

609
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,520
Okay, I get it.

610
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,560
I'll go back to the office now.

611
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,520
Aunt Lin, you...

612
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,000
Lately, my eyes tend to become watery

613
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,840
whenever wind blows into my eyes.

614
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,720
Something urgent crops up in the office.

615
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,840
I've to go back.

616
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,520
Work is more important.

617
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,040
Take care and drive carefully.

618
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,320
Okay. I'll see you again.

619
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,480
Tiankong, tell me

620
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,520
if you need anything.

621
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,640
You must not touch your eyes
with your hands.

622
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,360
It's a little bear.

623
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,160
Tiankong, you're so smart.

624
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,600
You know everything.

625
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,440
Sister Xiaomeng,

626
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,240
I had a dream just now.

627
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,240
It's a colorful dream.

628
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,520
There was a forest.

629
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,400
There were lots of beautiful flowers,

630
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,200
many animals and...

631
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,600
What else?

632
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,080
Father and Mother.

633
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,520
Father and Mother?

634
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,480
Yes, I saw Father and Mother just now.

635
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,160
Have you met them before?

636
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,440
Mom Lin said I'm an abandoned baby.

637
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,360
Someone picked me up on a roadside

638
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,320
and brought me to the welfare center.

639
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,000
Sister Xiaomeng,

640
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,640
they didn't want me.

641
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,400
Is it because I was not good enough

642
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,520
so they didn't like me?

643
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,640
Tiankong,

644
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,640
it's not true that they don't like you.

645
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,160
They're just...

646
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,600
afraid they can't take good care of you.

647
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,480
Mom Lin told me that too.

648
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,040
But I'm their child.

649
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,920
I don't need them to take care of me.

650
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,600
I can take care of myself.

651
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,840
I just miss them

652
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,400
and want to live with them.

653
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,840
Even in my dream, I don't know

654
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,160
how they look like.

655
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,560
But I'm very sure

656
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,440
they're my father and mother.

657
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,320
They waved and smiled to me.

658
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,120
Tiankong,

659
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,960
if you find your parents one day,...

660
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,800
will you blame them?

661
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,600
No, I'll forgive them.

662
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,080
Then they'll love me more

663
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,800
and stay by my side.

664
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,480
Tiankong, do you know this?

665
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,360
You're the most understanding child

666
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,520
I've ever met.

667
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,520
Right?

668
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:49,880
Director Lin.

669
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,760
Director Lin!

670
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,920
What's wrong?

671
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,240
Nothing.

672
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,120
Is it because of A Yan?

673
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,680
No.

674
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,320
We had a good talk.

675
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,720
That's good.

676
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,840
I was worried.

677
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,680
Director Lin,

678
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,320
is there anything wrong

679
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,600
with A Yan?

680
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,680
He doesn't know anything.

681
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,880
It's me.

682
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,480
Xiaomeng, the problem

683
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,480
lies with me.

684
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,120
I'm afraid I can't hold it in.

685
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,560
You've no idea.

686
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,280
Whenever I see his eyes, I...

687
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,880
They look almost the same

688
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,640
as mine when I was young.

689
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,200
Whenever I see him, I want to tell him...

690
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,560
that I'm his mother.

691
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,320
I'm his mother.

692
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,600
Calm down.

693
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,240
Now isn't the time yet.
