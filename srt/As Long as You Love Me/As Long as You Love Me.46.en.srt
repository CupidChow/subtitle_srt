1
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,720
(Episode 46)

2
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,520
Doctor.

3
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,000
Where is the VIP intensive care unit?

4
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,680
It's over there.

5
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,080
Okay, thank you.

6
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,560
You still have the cheeks to come here?

7
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,640
I thought you would never

8
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,360
appear in front
of Xiaomeng and A Yan again.

9
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,920
How is A Yan's condition?

10
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,160
That's none of your business.

11
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,040
It's because of your father
that he's in a coma now.

12
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,640
Isn't that bad enough?

13
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,360
Stop putting up a front
that you're concerned about him.

14
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,680
What's up your sleeve?

15
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,160
-Qiao Zhen.
-Qiao Zhen.

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,400
Jiang Ze is--

17
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,880
It's okay.

18
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,200
I've been busy dealing

19
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,400
with my father's affairs
the last two days.

20
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,960
Jiang Ze.

21
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,880
None of this

22
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,840
is what we wanted.

23
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,440
Are you okay?

24
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,800
I'm okay.

25
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,440
I finally have the time today

26
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,440
to visit A Yan.

27
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,600
That's all I wanted.

28
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,040
Please believe me.

29
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,600
I just want to see him.

30
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,040
I know.

31
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,760
Qiao Zhen was wrong about you.

32
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,080
Don't take it to heart.

33
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,160
It's okay.

34
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,840
Come, I'll take you to A Yan.

35
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,000
Let's go.

36
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,040
Jiang Ze, you don't have to do that.

37
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,880
Xiaomeng. You and Yanzhao
are the biggest shareholders

38
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,560
in Shenghai Group now.

39
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,320
Shenghai

40
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,920
is facing so many problems.

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,280
Do you want Shenghai to continue on?

42
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,800
Shenghai is my father's life work.

43
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,160
It's also what A Yan

44
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,280
fought to protect with his life.

45
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,920
We'll never give it up.

46
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,480
No matter how difficult it is,

47
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,840
we will keep Shenghai running.

48
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,560
Besides, it was A Yan's dream

49
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,360
to build that sports center.

50
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,480
If he can't complete it,

51
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,240
I'll complete it for him.

52
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,120
If you don't mind,

53
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,880
I would like to help you with that.

54
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,320
I don't know much

55
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,280
about business,

56
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,040
but A Yan has always

57
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,640
wanted you to help him with this project.

58
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,360
That much I know.

59
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,080
I'm sorry, A Yan.

60
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,040
I finally understand

61
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,840
why you wanted
to build this sports center.

62
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,240
Don't worry.

63
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,880
I will make your dream come true.

64
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,600
Qingyan?

65
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,160
What brings you here?

66
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,840
I've some work affairs

67
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,080
to discuss with you.

68
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,400
And I wanted to visit Chairman Zhou too.

69
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,000
He's still the same.

70
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,600
What about work?

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Construction of the sports center
has reached its key stage,

72
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,240
but Chairman Zhou isn't around.

73
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,320
There are many specific areas

74
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,920
we can't execute well.

75
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,440
That's why I wanted to talk to you

76
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,000
about hiring

77
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,200
a professional in this area

78
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,880
to preside over the subsequent work.

79
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,880
Qingyan.

80
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,000
You're the assistant to the Chairman.

81
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,360
You have full power
to execute the chairman's duties.

82
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,680
You can make decision on that.

83
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,840
I have someone

84
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,040
to recommend though.

85
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,160
Who?

86
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,680
Mr. Jiang?

87
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,000
How could I have forgotten you?

88
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,560
If you need any help,

89
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,000
I'll be glad to do it.

90
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,960
A Yan, Jiang Ze

91
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,400
is finally helping you now.

92
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,680
You have one more person

93
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,280
to make your dream come true.

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,040
Are you happy?

95
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,120
Let's think about it.

96
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,040
I have a daughter.

97
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,960
Before

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,640
she was my daughter,

99
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,120
she belonged to me.

100
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,400
You often pass

101
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,040
such comments casually.

102
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,040
A Yan!

103
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,240
You're awake!

104
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,720
I thought you would never wake up again!

105
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,360
Xiaomeng, I just woke up.

106
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,080
Don't choke me to death.

107
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,960
Well, do you feel pain anywhere?

108
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,600
I feel like I've just woken up from sleep.

109
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,440
Everything is good.

110
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,120
I feel good all over.

111
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,640
You scoundrel!

112
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,480
You scared me to death!

113
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,360
I thought you left me.

114
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,680
I thought you'd never wake up.

115
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,280
Do you know how worried I was?

116
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,720
Look at you.

117
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,640
You're crying like a kitten.

118
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,760
I'm awake now, aren't I?

119
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,760
I promise

120
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,480
I'll never leave you again.

121
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,440
I'll never leave you alone.

122
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,120
Don't ever leave me.

123
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,240
A Yan.

124
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
A Yan.

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,120
You will wake up, won't you?

126
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,080
A Yan, what's going on?

127
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,560
You're scaring me!

128
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,760
Doctor! Doctor!

129
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,560
Nurse! Help!

130
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,440
What's wrong, Xiaomeng?

131
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,200
A Yanzhao started breathing very quickly.

132
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,960
Even the alarm went off.

133
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,680
Please help him!

134
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,680
Prepare for emergency rescue.

135
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,040
Xiaomeng, you can't be here.
Leave the room.

136
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,520
No, I want to be with him.

137
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,920
Every minute counts now. Take her out.

138
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,280
A Yan!

139
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,160
Miss, this way.

140
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,960
Xiaomeng, what happened?

141
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,360
A Yan.

142
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,840
A Yan is...

143
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,240
What happened to A Yan?

144
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,440
Don't cry. It'll be okay.

145
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,120
A Yan will be okay.

146
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,760
He'll be okay.

147
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,760
Dr. Xiao, tell me.

148
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,120
I'll be able to accept it

149
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,200
no matter what.

150
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,520
Things are looking bad.

151
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,640
The pressure caused
by the blood clot on his nervous system

152
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,800
is getting worse.

153
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,880
The most likely scenario

154
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,080
is that he'll remain in a coma forever.

155
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,320
And he's started to show

156
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,600
signs of complications.

157
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,200
His thigh muscles

158
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,160
have begun to atrophy.

159
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,640
Did you just say

160
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,520
he has complications?

161
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,840
What complications?

162
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,000
The most serious one

163
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,560
will be respiratory failure.

164
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,720
A Yan.

165
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,400
He'll be fine.

166
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,360
He'll be fine.

167
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,160
Xiaomeng, as a doctor,

168
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,240
I need to formally ask his family.

169
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,720
Do you plan to keep him alive?

170
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,240
Yes. Of course!

171
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,840
For as long as he's still breathing,

172
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,280
I...

173
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,240
Xiaomeng! Xiaomeng! Xiaomeng!

174
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,600
I want him alive.

175
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,320
My child, don't get so upset.

176
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,040
You're carrying

177
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,080
a child in your womb.

178
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,760
Take care of yourself.

179
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,720
Mom.

180
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,880
I can't live without A Yan.

181
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,240
My baby

182
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,080
can't lose her father!

183
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,840
I want her to have a complete family.

184
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,400
I know. I know.

185
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,440
Don't get so worked up.

186
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,040
A Yan will get better.

187
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,120
He will get better.

188
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,200
He'll get better.

189
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,720
He'll get better.

190
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,000
He'll be fine. He'll be fine.

191
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,040
Why do these two kids

192
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,480
have it so tough?

193
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,120
So much has happened to them.

194
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,760
May the heavens bless them.

195
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,560
May A Yan get better soon.

196
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,760
Xiaomeng is about to give birth.

197
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,240
Guang.

198
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,560
Guang.

199
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,920
-Sister Hua.
-Here.

200
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,520
Take this to the hospital.

201
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,200
Tell Xiaomeng to have it while it's hot.

202
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,640
Okay.

203
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,600
It hasn't been easy

204
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,040
for both of you.

205
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,240
Sometimes I feel

206
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,800
life is really unfair.

207
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,080
We've been through so much.

208
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,360
And now we're here.

209
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,040
Grumbling can't solve anything.

210
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,280
What we're facing now

211
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,120
is just another obstacle.

212
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,240
A Yan used to tell me

213
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,240
not to be afraid because he's with me.

214
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,280
Now I want to tell him that too.

215
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,480
Don't be afraid. I'm with you.

216
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,800
Have you ever thought of turning back?

217
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,200
You have a long life ahead.

218
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,720
And you're with child now.

219
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,960
Without A Yan,

220
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,200
a long life

221
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,440
would just be a lonely journey.

222
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,920
Only with him around

223
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,040
will I find meaning

224
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,200
in whatever you mentioned.

225
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,000
Why do you think so?

226
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,160
Because I love him.

227
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,600
Xiaomeng.

228
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,560
Mom.

229
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,120
If you need anything
or want to eat anything,

230
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,320
just give me a call.

231
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,000
Mom.

232
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,240
Thank you.

A Yan, I want you to wake up.

264
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,600
I want us to be together

265
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,320
forever, and never be apart.

266
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,600
(Shenghai hospital)

267
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,640
What I'd feared
has happened after all.

268
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,760
What happened?

269
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,560
Is A Yan okay?

270
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,760
Severely comatose patients

271
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,240
usually lose

272
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,360
their gag reflexes after a while.

273
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,720
That means he's unable to swallow.

274
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,960
The fluids from his mouth

275
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,520
and nose

276
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,120
and the remnants of food

277
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,920
might enter the lungs

278
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,720
and cause a lung infection

279
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,360
or choke him.

280
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,120
So that was

281
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,000
what happened earlier?

282
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,960
Thank God you were around.

283
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,280
We caught it early,

284
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,120
and so it didn't lead to worse things.

285
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,200
What should we do in future?

286
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,240
I just examined him.

287
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,760
His gag reflex

288
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,280
has gotten very weak.

289
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,400
He might lose it completely.

290
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,520
Dr. Xiao.

291
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,200
Please save A Yan.

292
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,000
Xiaomeng.

293
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,240
The only way now

294
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,360
is to perform a tracheotomy.

295
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,200
Tracheotomy?

296
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,280
What is that?

297
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,320
It involves making an incision
in his throat

298
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,280
and sticking two tubes in.

299
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,360
No!

300
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,760
Don't say anymore.

301
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,520
A Yan is such a proud man.

302
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,080
He wouldn't want

303
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,440
to live on a machine.

304
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,720
It'll be so painful for him.

305
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,840
Xiaomeng.

306
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,760
A Yan is my friend too.

307
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,760
I don't want him
to suffer like this as well.

308
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,480
But as a doctor,

309
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,040
this is the best treatment for him.

310
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,440
If we don't do it,

311
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,560
I can't guarantee he will survive.

312
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,720
Let me think about it.

313
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,160
It's only when A Yan is being examined

314
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,120
that you get a break.

315
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,160
Don't think about it.

316
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,080
Just do what the doctor advises.

317
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,000
You've been feeling down.

318
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,840
That can't be good for your baby.

319
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,880
Although A Yan can't move

320
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,360
or talk now,

321
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,040
but if we stick two tubes

322
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,080
down his throat,

323
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,880
he'd be in so much pain.

324
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,440
Whenever I imagine that,

325
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,320
I feel as if it's me being intubated.

326
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,800
There's nothing we can do.

327
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,720
Didn't Sizhi say

328
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,960
that is the best treatment method for now?

329
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,160
I know

330
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,720
you don't want to lose A Yan.

331
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,880
Neither do we

332
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,480
want to see his life in danger.

333
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,560
Do you love Dr. Xiao?

334
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,080
Why do you suddenly ask me that?

335
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,800
When we love somebody,

336
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,440
don't we want him

337
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,680
to be happy?

338
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,760
If the person you love

339
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,800
is always in pain

340
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,680
because of you,

341
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,640
won't that love

342
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,240
become meaningless?

343
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,120
But whatever it is,

344
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,840
he's still alive.

345
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,120
He's like Aunt Ye.

346
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,960
She might have lost her memory,

347
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,320
but she's still alive

348
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,720
and she's still with you.

349
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,760
It's not the same.

350
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,520
When facing life and death of our parents,

351
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,320
we are more like children.

352
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,720
All we want

353
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,560
is for our parents to stay as long

354
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,640
as they can with us.

355
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,960
We don't think

356
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,600
about the pain they're going through.

357
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,040
Xiaomeng.

358
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,920
What's on your mind?

359
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,200
I can't imagine.

360
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,800
If A Yan goes on

361
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,280
suffering like this,

362
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,480
I can't imagine how sad he'll be.

363
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,960
I always thought

364
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,560
once you're in love with someone,

365
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,120
your life

366
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,720
no longer belongs to you.

367
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,600
That's because his happiness

368
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,800
is tied
to the happiness of another person.

369
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,480
His pain

370
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,320
will trigger another person's pain.

371
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,960
Love is companionship. Love is sweet.

372
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,520
Love is also sacrifice.

373
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,640
We don't live in this world

374
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,240
just for ourselves.

375
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,680
It is in loving and being loved

376
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,240
that life has meaning.

377
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,080
Xiaomeng.

378
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,040
I know you love A Yan very much.

379
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,960
Very, very much.

380
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,000
If he ever wakes up

381
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,040
and hears these words,

382
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,160
he'll be really happy.

383
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,040
Whether he wakes up or not,

384
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,040
I just hope he is happy.

385
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,040
And that he won't feel pain.

386
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,240
We just gave A Yan

387
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,200
a full body checkup.

388
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,800
We have good news and bad news.

389
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,520
The good news is his body is doing okay.

390
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,800
He has survived so far

391
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,120
through sheer will alone.

392
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,560
Because he's been comatose for too long,

393
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,040
his gag reflex has gotten very weak.

394
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,760
Xiaomeng, do you want

395
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,520
to do the tracheotomy?

396
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,880
You need to make a decision soon.

397
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,880
Or A Yan

398
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,280
might be in danger.

399
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,840
A Yan.

400
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,920
Do you want to go through

401
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,200
that kind of pain?

402
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,160

A Yan.

439
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,440
I used to say

440
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,600
I wanted a baby girl

441
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,560
because you like girls.

442
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,120
But now I hope it's a boy.

443
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,280
If it's a boy,

444
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,360
he'll be like you.

445
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,000
A Yan.

446
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,400
I wish I had

447
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,800
a switch in my heart too.

448
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,720
I could turn it off

449
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,280
and not love you anymore.

450
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,320
Then, it wouldn't matter

451
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,960
if you're sad or if you're in pain.

452
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,480
A Yan.

453
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,280
Open your eyes and look at me.

454
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,160
Let me know you're okay.

455
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,440
Let me know

456
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,480
you're not in pain.

457
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,400
(Low airway pressure)

458
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,440
A Yan.

459
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,200
I feel so much pain.

460
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,520
A Yan.

461
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,680
I don't want you to be comatose.

462
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,000
I don't want to see you looking so weak.

463
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,440
I don't want to see you looking so weak

464
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,520
on the hospital bed.

465
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,240
Seeing you struggle every day

466
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,360
makes me feel like dying.

467
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,440
I can't do anything at all.

468
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,480
I'm so useless.

469
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,840
I know being upset

470
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,240
will affect our baby,

471
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,360
but I just can't make myself happy.

472
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,880
Our lives

473
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,640
have been filled with struggles.

474
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,000
Our baby

475
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,960
ought to have a nice and bright life

476
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,760
filled with happiness.

477
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,640
I'm afraid.

478
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,960
I'm afraid I can't take good care of him.

479
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,680
Everyone's worried about me.

480
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,680
I know. I...

481
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,360
I want to be okay too.

482
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,920
But I just don't know what to do.

483
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,600
Someone, tell me what to do!

484
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,200
(Five years later)

485
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,840
Watch me.

486
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,480
This button makes it go forward.
This button makes it go backward.

487
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,480
And this

488
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,760
is the steering wheel.

489
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,760
Here, try it.

490
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,080
Yes, forward, backward.

491
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,200
Turn it around.

492
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,280
Lingxi.

493
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,840
How are you? How have you been?

494
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,160
Have you decided to give your all

495
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,040
to raising this child?

496
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,800
Don't waste your effort.

497
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,920
I've told you many times before.

498
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,840
I know what I've done.

499
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,520
I'm paying the price for it.

500
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,080
I'm never going back to Shenghai.

501
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,040
I didn't come

502
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,480
to ask you to go back to Shenghai.

503
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,600
Look at this.

504
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,680
What is it?

505
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,840
The future.

506
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,880
Our future.

507
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,320
Our future?

508
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,120
These are

509
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,120
the license, documents and information

510
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,600
of Ronghui Company.

511
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,760
Ronghui? My brother-in-law's company?

512
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,520
I bought over the company.

513
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,480
I want

514
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,240

Dad, I'm here to visit you.

579
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,120
Do you know,

580
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,960
I'm the CEO of Shenghai Group now.

581
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,960
I've fulfilled A Yan

582
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,120
and Xiaomeng's dream.

583
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,960
Luofeng Commercial Integrated
Sports Center project has completed,

584
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,120
and the Yunnan Guest House Resort

585
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,120
is doing very well.

586
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,840
These were what you wanted.

587
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,880
But you chose to break the law.

588
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,960
Isn't it ironic?

589
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,840
This is your favorite wine.

590
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,040
You ran out of schemes

591
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,840
and was sentenced to death.

592
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,800
But I achieved all these

593
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,440
with my own hard work

594
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,480
and capability.

595
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,560
It's too late to say all these now.

596
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,600
You spent so much time
fighting with people.

597
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,640
I fought with you all my life too.

598
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,040
But what came out of it?

599
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,160
Love, family,

600
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,960
kinship.

601
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,280
We lost everything.

602
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,920
Now you're asleep,

603
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,680
do you feel much better?

604
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,520
Actually,

605
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,640
I feel much better now too.

606
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,440
I have my own dreams.

607
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,840
I have things I want to do.

608
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,840
I'm finally going to live my own life.

609
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,880
Dad, don't worry about me.

610
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,640
Rest well.

611
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,440
We're here to visit you.
