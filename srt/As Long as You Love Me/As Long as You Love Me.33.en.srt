00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,760
(Episode 33)

2
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,080
Xiaomeng.

3
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,280
Mom.

4
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,400
Where have you been?

5
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,360
I was at work.

6
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,920
Are you tired?

7
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm fine. I'm not tired.

8
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,000
What's the matter?

9
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,160
Did someone do you wrong?

10
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,720
No.

11
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,280
The children's play
that we have been rehearsing for

12
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,440
has been suspended.

13
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,160
Why?

14
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,080
The investment was withdrawn...

15
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,600
because the investors are not optimistic

16
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,920
about the prospect of children's plays.

17
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,560
Forget it. You won't understand

18
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,880
what I'm talking about.

19
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,840
Xiaomeng, don't be afraid.

20
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,240
You are a tough girl.

21
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,360
You can do anything.

22
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,320
Have you forgotten
when you were a child,...

23
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,800
you had such a hard time

24
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,120
in primary school.

25
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,920
Didn't you make it through?

26
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,280
It'll be fine.

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,800
It just never

28
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,080
occurred to me that...

29
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,960
money

30
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,480
is so important.

31
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,640
But I won't give up.

32
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,080
I will fight

33
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,600
for the career that I like.

34
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,120
I will work hard.

35
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,520
Moreover, A Yan is here.

36
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,840
He will help you.

37
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,120
Mom, I can't always

38
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,520
rely on A Yan's help.

39
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,480
When my work

40
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,520
has become stable,...

41
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,120
everything will be fine.

42
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,200
Then I will...

43
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,560
take you on a trip. How does it sound?

44
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,040
So, mom,...

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,560
you have to get well soon.

46
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,440
Hello.

47
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,320
A Yan, it's me.

48
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,520
Let's meet up and talk.

49
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,680
Sure, let's meet at our usual spot.

50
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,800
Qiao Zhen.

51
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,760
Xiaomeng,

52
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,080
I was very busy.

53
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,480
I'm coming over now. Wait for me.

54
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,360
There's no need.

55
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,840
I know you are busy.

56
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,720
I raised funds for a while

57
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,000
and I'm home now.

58
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,280
You distributed fliers and raised funds?

59
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,520
Yes, but I didn't

60
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,560
print out a lot,...

61
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,200
so they are almost gone.

62
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,480
Fantastic.

63
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,320
How much did you raise today?

64
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,920
Like you said,

65
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,680
people are used to fundraising.

66
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,880
I got around 700 yuan in total

67
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,640
and I have around 4,000 yuan here.

68
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,280
I plan to make it to 5,000 yuan
tomorrow

69
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,600
and transfer it to the director.

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,360
Xiaomeng, you are so kind.

71
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,160
I've just got paid.

72
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,280
I will transfer the money to you later.

73
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,600
It's alright, Qiao Zhen.

74
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,880
I know that

75
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,440
you also need money...

76
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,800
and it's not easy

77
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,760
for Dr. Xiao to earn money.

78
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,880
Don't transfer the money to me.

79
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,160
I'm telling you,

80
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,240
cut the nonsense.

81
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,600
Although I don't have much money,

82
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,120
I have to do something.

83
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,440
Round up the sum

84
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,640
with my money.

85
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,960
Just don't mind it's not much.

86
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,280
I'll make the transfer now.

87
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,040
Wait for me.

88
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,040
What are you doing now?
Have you left the office?

89
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,280
What a coincidence!

90
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,480
I just thought of you

91
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,560
and you sent me a message.

92
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,800
I'm so happy.

93
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,480
Didn't you say you want to

94
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,400
have Japanese food?

95
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,640
Let's go tonight.

96
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,520
Forget it.

97
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,160
Japanese food is too expensive.

98
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,200
Let's have Malatang tonight.

99
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,400
How's the progress

100
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,320
of your financing?

101
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,120
It's still in the process of negotiation.

102
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,280
I understand. It's not easy.

103
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,600
Since I took over Shenghai,...

104
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,400
there have been challenges
again and again.

105
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,520
None of it is easy to deal with.

106
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,000
The bigger the goal,...

107
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,480
the more the challenges.

108
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,440
My dad spent a lifetime to build Shenghai.

109
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,000
I will make sure

110
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,040
it does well.

111
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,360
The shrinking of capital...

112
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,800
leading to the suspension of projects
and the collapse of the company,...

113
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,720
I won't let it end up that way.

114
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,360
I know the Dikai Commercial City
incident...

115
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,240
has affected Shenghai badly.

116
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,760
I'm sorry.

117
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,200
It's no use...

118
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,160
talking about what had happened.

119
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,040
How about you? What's the matter today?

120
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,960
I just think in many occasions

121
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,400
we aren't free to do what we want.

122
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,160
We can't follow our hearts
to do what we like.

123
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,360
It's like a ship without a helm,...

124
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,200
following the flow of wind and waves.

125
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,040
We don't have a say at all.

126
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,640
Same here. We are in the same boat.

127
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,800
You know that I want to help you...

128
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,760
but there's not much I can do.

129
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,000
Also,...

130
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,120
I am a Jiang after all.

131
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,200
I'm happy enough

132
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,400
that you think this way.

133
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,000
Have you seen this guy?

134
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,080
No, who is he?

135
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,480
Someone who is...

136
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,720
related to the Zhou family.

137
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,200
It's delicious.

138
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,760
Mom, wait a minute.

139
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,280
Hello.

140
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,080
This is Zheng, Art Director of

141
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,880
Golden Bridge Culture Company.

142
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,440
Qiao Zhen sent me

143
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,400
your performance proposal.

144
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,920
Hello, Director Zheng.

145
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,560
I am very interested

146
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,840
in your performance proposal.

147
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,960
Let's find time to talk about it.

148
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,840
How does that sound?

149
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,720
Sure.

150
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,640
-When will you have time?
-Why not...

151
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,360
you come to my place now

152
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,320
to discuss about it?

153
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,080
Your place... well...

154
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,160
Don't get it wrong.

155
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,640
Today is my daughter's birthday.

156
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,960
She likes
your Fairy Tale Street very much.

157
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,240
I hope you can

158
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,480
come here and perform

159
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,600
at her birthday party.

160
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,040
If my daughter is happy,

161
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,480
it's easier for me to decide
on the investment.

162
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,560
Alright.

163
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,520
Please send me

164
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,400
your address.

165
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,800
Good. See you later.

166
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,880
Xiaoyu.

167
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,560
What is it, Sister Xiaomeng?

168
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,560
I need to go out for business later.

169
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,960
Please take care of my mom.

170
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,880
Sure, Sister Xiaomeng. Get going.

171
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,200
Don't worry. I am here at home.

172
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,120
Let me feed you, Aunt Ye.

173
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,840
Xiaomeng.

174
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,640
Jiang Ze.

175
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,760
What are you doing here?

176
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,440
I am here for business.

177
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,800
What is it about?

178
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,200
What's in your bag?

179
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,680
Isn't that your costume?

180
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,880
Why have you brought it out with you?

181
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,600
Give it back to me.

182
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,120
I won't give you back
if you don't tell me.

183
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,720
Someone is investing

184
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,840
in our children's play.

185
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,320
It's the birthday

186
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,400
of the investor's daughter.

187
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,640
He asked me to

188
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,000
come to his daughter's birthday party...

189
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,320
to perform.

190
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,000
What? How dare he asked you

191
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,200
to perform for a little girl!

192
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,080
What's his name? Where is he?

193
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,720
-I'm going to see him.
-Alright.

194
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,680
I have promised him...

195
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,400
and I need to

196
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,560
talk to him about the investment.

197
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,880
Can you not interfere in this?

198
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,800
I can't.

199
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,280
He is obviously taking advantage of you.

200
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,400
I have given him my word.

201
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,360
It's not good to go back on my word.

202
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,680
I'll go with you then.

203
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,120
Forget it.

204
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,280
You are living in the same neighborhood.

205
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,960
It'll be awkward for you to meet
each other.

206
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,440
I beg you to leave it alone.

207
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,840
At least let me see you to the door.

208
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,760
Alright.

209
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,160
Alright. This is the place.

210
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,240
You really don't need me
to go in with you?

211
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,640
There's really no need.

212
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,040
I can go in myself.

213
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,280
Hello, I am the performer

214
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,280
for the birthday party.

215
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,320
Come in then.

216
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,360
Zheng Hua?

217
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,640
Hello.

218
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,360
Are you Zhou Xiaomeng

219
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,280
of Fairy Tale Street?

220
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,200
Yes.

221
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,200
Don't seduce Director Zheng

222
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,400
with your young and pretty face.

223
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,840
-No, I won't.
-Alright.

224
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,920
Take these out.

225
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,080
Xiaomeng.

226
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,800
Director Zheng.

227
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,080
Who told you to

228
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,960
ask Xiaomeng to take these things?

229
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,840
She is invited to perform.

230
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,920
Take these out by yourself.

231
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,360
It's fine, Director Zheng.

232
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,240
I'll do it.

233
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,600
Come on, give it to me.

234
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,200
It's alright, Director Zheng.

235
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,840
I will take this in.

236
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,280
What are you looking at? Get back to work.

237
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,880
Hello.

238
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,400
You'd better come back now.

239
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,920
Come on, let's have some cake.

240
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,800
Lulu,

241
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,800
are you happy today?

242
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,000
Let's sing a birthday song

243
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,800
for Lulu.

244
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,520
Sure.

245
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,400
♪Happy birthday to you♪

246
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,560
♪Happy birthday to you♪

247
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,440
♪Happy birthday to you♪

248
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,840
♪Happy birthday to you♪

249
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,240
Lulu, Dad has arranged

250
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,360
a performance for you.

251
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,600
It's Snow White. Do you like it?

252
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,960
Yes.

253
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,600
A long time ago,

254
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,480
Snow White lived in a kingdom.

255
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,200
She was innocent and pretty,
kind and sweet.

256
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,040
She led a carefree life

257
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,120
in the kingdom.

258
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,480
However, one day...

259
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,320
the king of the kingdom...

260
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,080
passed away.

261
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,120
The queen, her stepmother,

262
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,640
took control of everything.

263
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,240
The story...

264
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,560
begins here.

265
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,720
Snow White

266
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,960
met seven dwarves

267
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,080
in a forest.

268
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,080
Hold on.

269
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,160
You don't just play Snow White.

270
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,920
You have to play the seven dwarves
as well.

271
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,040
Yes, you have to play the seven dwarves.

272
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,520
Sure, I will play dwarves

273
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,480
for you.

274
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,720
The dwarves and Snow White

275
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,680
walked in the forest.

276
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,800
Wait a minute.

277
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,960
Dwarves are short.

278
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,280
-Right, dwarves are short!
-Short.

279
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,360
Alright.

280
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,840
Then I will be...

281
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,920
a short dwarf for you.

282
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,640
Dwarves and Snow White

283
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,760
walked in the forest.

284
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,280
The dwarf is so ugly.

285
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,160
Ugly!

286
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,960
-So ugly.
-It's awful.

287
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,680
So ugly.

288
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,200
So ugly.

289
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,880
Let's run.

290
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,080
Slow down.

291
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,200
Be careful.

292
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,600
Director Zheng.

293
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,080
I'm sorry. I didn't

294
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,520
teach Lulu well.

295
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,280
The kid is immature...

296
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,800
and likes to throw a temper.

297
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,200
It's fine. She's lovely.

298
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,640
Right,...

299
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,080
about our children's play...

300
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,520
Are you okay, Lulu?

301
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,400
How are you, Lulu?

302
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,080
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

303
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,160
Thanks to Sister Xiaomeng.

304
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,560
You should thank her.

305
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,280
Thank you, Sister Xiaomeng.

306
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,680
It's alright. Go and play.

307
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,160
You are hurt.

308
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,560
I will take you to the hospital
and dress the wound.

309
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,160
I'm fine. There's no need.

310
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,120
No.

311
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,160
You got hurt at our place.

312
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,040
I can't let it be.

313
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,120
It's really fine, Director Zheng.

314
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,040
-I...
-Who are you?

315
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,680
What are you doing at my home?

316
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,520
You shameless slut!

317
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,440
No, I'm just...

318
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,080
Don't think that
you can get away with this

319
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,960
by looking innocent!

320
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,600
How dare you come to my place today!

321
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,120
You shameless slut!

322
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,320
Tell me!

323
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,800
Are you trying to get rid of me?

324
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,200
You shameless mistress!

325
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,600
I'm going to beat you up!

326
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,120
It's a misunderstanding, darling.

327
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,200
-A misunderstanding?
-She is not...

328
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,800
Do you think I don't know

329
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,160
about you and the little slut?

330
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,720
I finally caught you today!

331
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,360
See how I'm going to teach her

332
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,480
a lesson!

333
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,000
You. Stop it.

334
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,040
Stop!

335
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,400
Who are you?

336
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,120
I am her boyfriend, Jiang Ze.

337
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,680
He is a Jiang. Leave it.

338
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,680
Xiaomeng, is your hand okay?

339
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,280
I'm fine.

340
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,480
I'm sorry, Mr. Jiang.

341
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,280
I didn't know the relationship
between you and Xiaomeng.

342
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,960
What happened...

343
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,360
was a misunderstanding.

344
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,840
Misunderstanding? What misunderstanding?

345
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,520
You asked her to come to your place

346
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,800
to celebrate your girl's birthday.

347
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,840
Now...

348
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,080
you've made such a scene.

349
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,800
Do you think
I won't sue you for personal attack?

350
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,960
Alright, Jiang Ze. It's enough.

351
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,760
Apologize to her.

352
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,680
Mr. and Mrs. Zheng,

353
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,760
please don't fight

354
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,880
because of me.

355
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,560
Mrs. Zheng,

356
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,520
it's up to you to believe me.

357
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,400
There's nothing going on

358
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,800
between Mr. Zheng and me.

359
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,520
He asked me to come

360
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,920
to perform at
your daughter's birthday party.

361
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,040
Don't get it wrong.

362
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,680
Let's go, Jiang Ze.

363
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,480
Remember,

364
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,160
keep your family scandals

365
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,280
to yourselves.

366
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,120
Don't disgust us!

367
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,520
Let's go.

368
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,280
Are you happy now?

369
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,440
Let me look at your hand.

370
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,000
I need to sterilize your wound first.

371
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,960
You are so silly.

372
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,920
You should have run

373
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,120
when you saw that fierce woman.

374
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,280
I couldn't respond in time.

375
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,520
Do you think by role playing Snow White,

376
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,960
you will become a real Snow White?

377
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,760
Do you know that in this world

378
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,880
people may give you

379
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,080
poisonous apples?

380
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,720
Do you know what danger is?

381
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,760
I understand that now.

382
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,520
But I'm fine now.

383
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,840
Take it easy.

384
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,200
Can I?

385
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,160
Do you know what would happen

386
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,200
if I had come a bit later?

387
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,840
The name Zhou Xiaomeng

388
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,040
may go on

389
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,040
the headline again.

390
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,040
You would be labelled as

391
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,680
Zheng's mistress.

392
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,120
It wouldn't go to that.

393
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,200
I made a call to check.

394
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,280
Zheng, the art director,...

395
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,880
likes to flirt with

396
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,520
actresses and models.

397
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,880
His wife has known for long that

398
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,760
he has been having an affair,

399
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,400
but she doesn't have any proof.

400
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,440
And you just walked in...

401
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,040
and let her insult you.

402
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,080
I think

403
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,600
he was just using you...

404
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,120
to distract his wife.

405
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,560
You are thinking too much.
It's not that serious.

406
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,080
Xiaomeng,

407
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,640
you are too kind.

408
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,040
Do you really not know that there are

409
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,160
many bad guys in the world?

410
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,080
Many bad guys who are good at pretending.

411
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,000
Alright, alright.

412
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,520
I won't do this again.

413
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,120
I was worried about you,

414
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,360
thus I stayed by the door.

415
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,960
Had I not been there,...

416
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,240
I really don't know

417
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,120
what would have happened.

418
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,960
Don't blame me for being so worked up.

419
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,840
I'm just worried about you.

420
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,080
I know that you care about me.

421
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,760
Thank you.

422
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,960
Xiaomeng,...

423
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,480
don't be so silly again, okay?

424
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,760
Alright, I will remember that.

425
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,000
Send me home, Jiang Ze.

426
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,200
Sure, I will send

427
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,280
Snow White home now.

428
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,560
Let me take it for you.

429
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,520
Your hand is hurt.

430
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,320
It's alright. I'll take it.

431
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,400
May I come in?

432
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,120
Aunt Ye.

433
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,080
You...

434
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,480
Is that man...

435
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,560
your boyfriend?

436
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,400
No, mom. You are talking nonsense.

437
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,520
He is A Yan's colleague.

438
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,640
A Yan's colleague.

439
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,000
A Yan, are you going out?

440
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,760
It's none of your business.

441
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,320
Hello, A Yan's colleague.

442
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,680
I have prepared afternoon tea for you.

443
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,040
Do you like it?

444
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,360
Yes, I like it.

445
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,560
Please come in.

446
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,560
Sure.

447
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,600
Xiaomeng, come over.

448
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,920
I have also prepared some for you.

449
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,400
Please come in.

450
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,240
Please.

451
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,720
-There's so much food.
-Please take a seat.

452
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,840
-Thank you.
-Make yourself at home.

453
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,400
-Thank you, Aunt.
-Please sit down.

454
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,800
Xiaomeng, come quickly and sit down.

455
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,760
I'm coming.

456
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,440
Have some cake.

457
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,840
-Thank you, Aunt.
-You're welcome.

458
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,960
-Thank you, Aunt.
-Here, Xiaomeng,

459
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,840
this is for you.

460
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,840
Thanks, mom.

461
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,840
Who are you?

462
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,320
Aunt Ye, I am Xiaomeng's...

463
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,880
Xiaomeng, ask him to leave.

464
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,880
Mom, he is A Yan's colleague.

465
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,040
No, he is a bad guy.

466
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,480
Ask him to leave now.

467
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,640
Mom, haven't I told you

468
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,160
he is A Yan's colleague?

469
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,440
Ask him to leave now.

470
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,480
I have something to attend to.

471
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,240
I will visit Aunt another day.

472
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,800
Jiang Ze.

473
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,760
I'm sorry.

474
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,120
I'll see you out.

475
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,960
Sure.

476
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,080
I'm sorry that

477
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,120
my mom is in this condition.

478
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,840
-It's fine.
-Bad guy.

479
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,240
He's a bad guy.

480
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,040
I'm sorry.

481
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,640
My mom...

482
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,360
is still not back to normal.

483
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,640
I know. Don't worry.

484
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,240
Thank you.

485
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,840
You saved me today and gave me a ride.

486
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,840
It's my pleasure.

487
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,080
There's no need to say thanks

488
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,160
between us.

489
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,560
We're no strangers.

490
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,520
It has been a mess today.

491
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,880
The investor

492
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,240
did not ask you to

493
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,240
perform at all.

494
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,240
He planned to take advantage of you.

495
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,120
You have to be careful.

496
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,880
I thought if only I could perform for him,

497
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,560
he would be willing to invest.

498
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,920
I was too naive.

499
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,560
It's fine. I am here.

500
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,880
If he won't invest, I will.

501
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,680
Jiang Ze, you may be able to help me
this time,

502
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,480
but you can't keep on helping me.

503
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,120
I will think of another way.

504
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,640
What? Are you going to

505
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,080
perform at another child's

506
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,240
birthday party?

507
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,000
I won't do such a stupid thing again.

508
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,760
Alright.

509
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,840
If you are in trouble,...

510
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,520
you have to look for me at once.

511
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,640
I will immediately

512
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,640
come to help you.

513
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,000
Don't forget...

514
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,280
I am your King Kong.

515
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,240
Fine. King Kong!

516
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,320
Xiaomeng,...

517
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,080
your hand is hurt.

518
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,560
Don't touch it.

519
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,320
Make sure you rest well.

520
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,840
I get it.

521
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,000
I'm going back to take care of my mom.

522
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,600
Alright. Go back in then.

523
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,800
We didn't expect...

524
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,160
a big corporation like Shenghai

525
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,120
would be interested in our small company.

526
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,720
I told you before that...

527
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,960
Shenghai has been looking for

528
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,960
diversified development,...

529
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,840
so we are willing to invest capital

530
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,880
to acquire your company

531
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,240
and join the performance sector.

532
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,880
The letter of intent
for the acquisition...

533
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,040
and the auditing

534
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,120
are fine.

535
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,600
So we want to sign
the acquisition contract

536
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,480
as soon as possible.

537
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,520
Please take a look at the details.

538
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,560
I don't get it.

539
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,440
What is it?
Are you unhappy with the price?

540
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,640
No.

541
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,720
It's much more than

542
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,680
what we need.

543
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,480
Then you have nothing to worry about.

544
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,920
Excuse me for asking a question.

545
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,480
Do you have...

546
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,880
other requirements?

547
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,080
The reason that Chairman Zhou invests
in your company...

548
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,440
is mainly because
of the children's play projects.

549
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,640
Yes, indeed we have intentions

550
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,040
to do children's plays.

551
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,640
But from the look of the market,

552
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,520
I think...

553
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,800
it might be more profitable

554
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,760
for the company...

555
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,880
if we invest our money
in animation productions.

556
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,080
Chairman Zhou is interested

557
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,800
in your children's play projects.

558
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,920
I see.

559
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,760
It seems to me Chairman Zhou

560
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,440
has great interest
in the children's play industry.

561
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,160
After the acquisition,...

562
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,920
you will be in charge of the project,

563
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,040
which will be
the major project of the company.

564
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,040
Sure.

565
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,200
We will do

566
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,520
as Chairman Zhou says.

567
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,320
If anyone asks who is in charge
of the company

568
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,600
after the acquisition,...

569
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,400
just say it's you. Do you get it?

570
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,880
I get it.

571
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,880
If you forget about it...

572
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,120
-I won't forget.
-Then...

573
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,160
-I won't forget.
-We...

574
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,240
I understand.

575
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,680
Chairman Zhou.

576
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:30,920
Is it done?

577
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,680
It's done.

578
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,520
Do we need to tell Xiaomeng about this?

579
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,720
I get it.

580
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,520
Hello, listeners of Penguin FM.

581
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,720
I am Zhou Xiaomeng.

582
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,600
Today, I will continue

583
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,040
with the story of Peter Pan.

584
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,520
The second path on the right.

585
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,880
Go straight until dawn.

586
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,000
Peter Pan tells Wendy that

587
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,600
that's the way to Neverland.

588
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,320
But even though the birds carried
the map...

589
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,640
It's Sister Xiaomeng's voice.

590
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,400
following the route given by him,

591
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,000
they still can't find it.

592
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,840
One has to know,...

593
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,840
Peter just makes it up...

594
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,840
because he wants to get something.

595
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,000
(Penguin FM)

596
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,520
Captain Hook

597
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,120
is a wicked pirate captain.

598
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,360
He always tries all means

599
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,520
to kill Peter,...

600
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,440
so that he could take over Neverland.

601
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,160
While Wendy is on the way to

602
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,480
the magic jungle,

603
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,680
she is captured by Captain Hook

604
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,200
and the pirate fish.

605
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,480
Captain Hook says,

606
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,840
"I've been waiting for you."

607
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,160
"I have wanted to catch you long ago."

608
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,760
"Now I finally have the chance."

609
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,960
"What do you want, Captain Hook?"

610
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,160
Captain Hook says, "Nothing."

611
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,600
"Do you want to...

612
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,160
become the sharks' dinner?"

613
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,880
Captain Hook says, "You are still
talking back."

614
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,480
Captain fish says,

615
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,360
"Captain, I suggest

616
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,440
throwing her into the sea."

617
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,640
This part needs

618
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,160
a minor adjustment, right?

619
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,160
Director.

620
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,560
Xiaomeng.

621
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,200
You asked to see me so urgently,

622
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,640
is there good news?

623
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,480
How do you know?

624
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,120
I listened to

625
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,040
your voice message on WeChat.

626
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,720
It's obvious that you are happy.

627
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,880
I can't control myself.

628
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,000
You know what,...

629
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,160
I thought

630
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,480
there was no way out...

631
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,920
and there was no hope.

632
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,600
I was about to give up on the play.

633
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,400
When I was in despair,...

634
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,480
guess what?

635
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,720
The original company who invested in us

636
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,760
told me they are willing
to invest in the play again.

637
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,240
That's amazing!

638
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,400
Also,

639
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,120
they want to partner with us
in the long run.

640
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,600
You know what, I was over the moon!

641
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,520
That's wonderful!

642
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,160
Congratulations, director!

643
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,440
However,...

644
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,280
the actors of the two leading roles,

645
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,760
Peter Pan and Wendy,

646
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,080
have signed contracts with other theaters,

647
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,040
so they can't join the rehearsal.

648
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,480
So,...

649
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,440
I want you to play Peter Pan.

650
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,720
No way.

651
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,480
I can't play Peter Pan.

652
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,920
Why not?

653
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,720
Xiaomeng, I heard you telling

654
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,160
the story of Peter Pan on Penguin FM

655
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,200
last night.

656
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,800
Director,

657
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,560
that is different.

658
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,320
You were very good.

659
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,160
You should have more confidence.

660
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,640
You had played
so many fairy tale characters

661
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,320
on Fairy Tale Street.

662
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,440
And you are so familiar with the script.

663
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,960
You are the only choice for Peter Pan.

664
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,400
Fine. I will try.

665
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,680
How about Wendy?

666
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,040
I have no choice...

667
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,440
but to search for

668
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,360
another actor.

669
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,880
Speaking of actor, director,

670
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,680
I may be able to recommend someone to you.

671
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,680
She is my classmate,

672
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,000
who works in dubbing now.

673
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,680
That's great.
Ask her to come and try it out.

674
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,000
Great. I will ask her now.

675
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,880
Good.

676
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,000
Have a cake.

677
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,040
-Isn't it nice?
-Try that.

678
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,200
What are you looking at? You look serious.

679
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,920
I'm ordering facial masks.

680
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,880
I've finished all

681
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,800
the Xiaomihu facial masks

682
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,960
that you gave me.

683
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,320
Let me take a look.

684
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,200
Look.

685
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,400
Which one do you think is better?

686
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,760
This hydrating mask is quite nice.

687
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,960
Really? Let me see.

688
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,160
Take your time. There's no rush.

689
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,560
Alright. Done.

690
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,480
Xiaomeng,...

691
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,280
why are you so generous today?

692
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,560
What's up your sleeve?

693
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,080
How could you see through that?

694
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,320
I thought I would

695
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,480
ask you later.

696
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,280
You can't hide anything.

697
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,920
You put all your thoughts

698
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,120
on your face.

699
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,920
Dear Yang Xi,...

700
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,000
you have to say yes.

701
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,880
Cut it out. Tell me what it's about.

702
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,920
I've been working on

703
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,360
a children's play Peter Pan.

704
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,680
I know.

705
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,320
But our show

706
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,360
was almost shelved previously

707
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,400
because of

708
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,320
insufficient capital.

709
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,600
But guess what?

710
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,840
Today, the director told me that

711
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,960
he has found a new source of capital.

712
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,120
Our rehearsal

713
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
has officially resumed.

714
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,080
I will play the role of Peter Pan.

715
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,360
That's fantastic, Xiaomeng.

716
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,600
You're going to be a star.

717
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,280
Stop it, Yang Xi.

718
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,840
We are short of an actor...

719
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,800
for Wendy.

720
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,040
We haven't found a suitable person.

721
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,240
So I recommended you

722
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,520
to our director.

723
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,960
Me?

724
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,440
In my heart,...

725
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,600
you are the most suitable choice

726
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,520
for the role Wendy.

727
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,480
No way.

728
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,240
I will screw up.

729
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,840
Dear Yang Xi,...

730
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,840
we are best friends.

731
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,880
Now I need your help

732
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,000
very badly.

733
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,520
You have to help me.

734
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,120
Please.

735
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,080
Still no. I can't do it.

736
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,880
What if I screw up?

737
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,560
You won't. We will work hard together.

738
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,960
I will think about it.

739
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,040
Alright, I will give you

740
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,480
five minutes to consider.

741
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,320
This is wonderful.

742
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,800
We are finally going home.

743
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,840
But how should we go home?

744
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,920
We can fly!

745
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,920
Fly back?

746
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,760
Great. But what can we do

747
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,400
after we are back?

748
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,240
Wendy.

749
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,560
Peter Pan.

750
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,520
We decide to go home.

751
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,000
We all want to grow up.

752
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,280
Why do you all

753
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,320
want to go home?

754
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,600
We could be children forever,...

755
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,080
with only joy

756
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,600
and no worries. Isn't that great?

757
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,640
Listen to me, Peter Pan.

758
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,520
When you are ready,...

759
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,800
leave Neverland...

760
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,520
and join us.

761
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,760
The world is not

762
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,240
as scary as you think it is.

763
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,080
Go and feel it, touch it!

764
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,760
Great, I'll feel it.

765
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,800
Great! It's amazing.

766
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,080
Director.

767
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,160
We don't have much experience.

768
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,680
You are the best actors.

769
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,000
Believe me. The play will be a success.

770
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,360
Let's work hard together.

771
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,520
Yes.

772
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,600
Come.

773
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,880
Let's fight.

774
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,840
Come here.

775
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,240
Slow down.

776
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,120
Tiankong.

777
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,080
Slow down.

778
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,240
-You're here, Xiaomeng.
-Sister Xiaomeng.

779
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,120
Auntie Lin.

780
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,520
Slow down.

781
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,520
I'm here to see

782
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,080
if Tiankong's eyes are getting better.

783
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,600
His eyes

784
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,040
are recovering quickly.

785
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,560
Although he still suffers from

786
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,720
a little amblyopia,...

787
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
it has already turned out best

788
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,480
for him.

789
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,240
Thanks to your help that

790
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,360
Tiankong's eyes

791
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,760
can recover so quickly.

792
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,200
It's not my credit.

793
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,680
Thanks to everybody's help,...

794
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,880
especially you...

795
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,400
and A Yan.

796
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,160
Tiankong is such a good boy.

797
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,840
What should I reward you?

798
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,920
What do you want to reward me?

799
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,600
This is for you.

800
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,800
Thank you, Sister Xiaomeng.

801
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,800
Be good and listen to the director.

802
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,360
If you are a good boy,

803
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,600
I will give you

804
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,480
even better gifts in future.

805
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,200
You are invisible to him.

806
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,920
Now he is going to play with his new toys.

807
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,800
Enjoy it.

808
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,120
Xiaomeng, have you been busy lately?

809
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,160
I have started rehearsing

810
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,240
for my children's play,...

811
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,600
so I may not be able

812
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,280
to come to the welfare center
and visit you frequently.

813
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,640
I will miss you guys, Auntie Lin.

814
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,240
Don't worry.

815
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,280
I am here. Rest assured.

816
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:50,960
Focus on

817
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,040
the rehearsal of your children's play.

818
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,880
How is A Yan lately?

819
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,880
He...

820
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,960
He is fine.

821
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,040
He works very hard.

822
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,480
He is quite occupied.

823
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,160
How are things between you and him?

824
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,840
I think A Yan has changed,...

825
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,600
going back to his old self bit by bit.

826
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,920
That's great.

827
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,120
Although I am his mother,

828
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,920
I didn't grow up with him,...

829
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,760
so I have no right

830
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,760
to say anything.

831
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,560
I feel relieved to hear that.

832
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,520
Right, Auntie Lin,...

833
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,200
do you have time to

834
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,400
see my children's play in a few days?

835
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,520
Will A Yan be there?

836
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,040
I think he might go,

837
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,640
so you really have to go.

838
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,720
Thank you.

839
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,680
Thank you.

840
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,080
Sister Xiaomeng,

841
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,280
draw with me.

842
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,840
Sure, Tiankong.

843
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,960
Auntie Lin, I will go draw
with Tiankong then.

844
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,760
Sure, go ahead.

845
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,960
Tiankong, what do you want to draw?

846
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,320
Strawberries and tangerines?

847
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,720
How about pineapples?

848
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,560
Wendy says,...

849
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,640
"We are discussing about how to go home."

850
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,200
"But I have already

851
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,120
arranged elves

852
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,440
to send you home."

853
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,440
"What I mean is,...

854
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,720
you should go with us."

855
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,160
"And then?"

856
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,480
"Then they will

857
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,680
send me to school and work."

858
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,480
"Soon I will become

859
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,520
another person."

860
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,120
"I don't want that."

861
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,200
"I don't want to become another person."

862
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,080
-Another person.
-"I will always be a child,

863
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,560
always living in joy."

864
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,320
A Yan.

865
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,520
You're back.

866
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,400
A Yan is back.

867
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,720
I'll get you something to eat

868
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,760
right away.

869
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,440
This is our children's play.

870
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,040
It was suspended

871
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:00,960
because of a shortage in capital.

872
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,480
But somehow

873
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,680
the original company

874
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,120
decided to invest again.

875
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,080
Now,

876
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,480
Yang Xi and I will play the major roles.

877
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,360
You will play Peter Pan?

878
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,760
The boy who will never grow up?

879
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,080
The director...

880
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,760
said I fit this character.

881
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,720
I'd also like to be...

882
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,040
a child forever,

883
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,240
and always live in

884
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,560
a children's world.

885
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,640
I think it's a joy.

886
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,120
It's good that you're happy.

887
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,840
A Yan,...

888
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,680
will you and mom...

889
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,280
come and watch my first performance?

890
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,040
Auntie Lin will also be there.

891
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,080
We'll see when the time comes.

892
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,000
Alright. Almost done.

893
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,440
Xiaomeng, come on.

894
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,520
Let's have a selfie.

895
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,600
Sure.

896
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,320
Xiaomeng, are you nervous?

897
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:39,960
I'm fine.

898
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,720
After all, we have rehearsed many times,

899
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,960
so I'm not very nervous.

900
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,240
That's right. You'd been through a lot

901
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,600
when you were a host.

902
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,280
This is no big deal.

903
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,960
However, it has been a long time

904
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,680
since I was under the spotlight,...

905
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,840
so I'm still a little worried...

906
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,880
if the audience will like me.

907
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,720
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

908
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,160
Xiaomeng, Yang Xi!

909
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,000
Zitong.

910
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,600
-Zitong.
-All the best to your performance!

911
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,520
Thank you.

912
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,920
Xiaomeng, your makeup is fantastic today.

913
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,560
I'm so looking forward
to your performance.

914
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,440
Really?

915
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,680
Thank you, Zitong.

916
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,440
You come to see us
even though you're busy.

917
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,320
Of course.

918
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,120
You are my best friends.

919
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,200
How can I miss

920
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,720
your performance?

921
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:26,960
Right, Qiao Zhen said

922
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,920
she was held up by work at the station.

923
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
She would come later.

924
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:29,880
Sure.

925
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,240
How is it?

926
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,600
-Does it look good?
-Yes.

927
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,720
Your costume is exactly as it is described
in the book.

928
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,600
Relax.

929
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,560
Don't get nervous later.

930
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,280
There are so many people here.

931
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,760
Jiang Ze.

932
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,920
Jiang Ze.

933
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,680
Why do you have time today?

934
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,800
Good luck, Xiaomeng.

935
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,720
Why isn't A Yan here?

936
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,840
Director Lin

937
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,200
has brought Tiankong and the rest here.

938
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,640
Dr. Xiao and my mom are here too.

939
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,640
A Yan may be

940
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,160
held up by business.

941
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,280
Jiang Ze, have you come

942
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,760
to see Xiaomeng empty-handed?

943
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,160
How could that be?

944
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,600
I have prepared a whole carton

945
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,560
of French champagne.

946
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,880
We will celebrate

947
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,200
-with our superstar later.
-Champagne!

948
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,600
-Great. Fantastic.
-Come here.

949
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,520
Five minutes to go.

950
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,560
The backstage should get ready now.

951
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,720
Okay, director.

952
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,040
Alright.

953
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,120
Let's wait at the auditorium.

954
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,280
Let them calm down for a while.

955
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,800
-Let's go.
-Bye.

956
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,120
Five minutes to go.

957
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,080
-Good luck.
-I will.

958
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,360
-Let's go.
-I can't wait for your show. Good luck.

959
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,880
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

960
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,160
My Peter Pan,

961
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,720
you have to put on a good show!

962
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,920
My Wendy,

963
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,240
you are my best friend.

964
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,800
-We will fight together.
-Fight together!
