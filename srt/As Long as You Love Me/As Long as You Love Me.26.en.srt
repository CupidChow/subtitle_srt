00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,760
(Episode 26)

2
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,640
Whenever you see each other,

3
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,160
you two can't quite handle
your feelings for each other.

4
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,040
Isn't that right?

5
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,200
Yes, you are right.

6
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,040
A Yan, deep down in your heart

7
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,880
do you somehow

8
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,200
hate Xiaomeng?

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Because of the hatred,

10
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,400
there are many things

11
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,400
that you can't see and understand.

12
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,000
But I believe one day

13
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,240
you will figure it out.

14
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,600
By then, there will be no barriers
between the two of you anymore.

15
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,720
I also wish for such a day.

16
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,880
No matter what the future holds,

17
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,920
you will always love Xiaomeng, won't you?

18
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,400
Aunt Lin,

19
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,200
I should leave now.

20
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,800
I will visit you again.

21
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,600
-Brother.
-Tiankong.

22
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,560
I have to go.

23
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,520
Brother A Yan,

24
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,880
will you visit me again?

25
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,080
Of course.

26
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,160
How about tomorrow?

27
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,720
If you have time tomorrow,

28
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,400
can you come and play with me?

29
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,240
Sure.

30
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,520
Tiankong.

31
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,240
The ring necklace on your neck...

32
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,960
The ring necklace is...

33
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,040
a gift from Xiaomeng.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,800
Tiankong,

35
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,760
brother A Yan should leave now.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,440
Say goodbye to him.

37
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,920
Goodbye, brother.

38
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,200
Goodbye.

39
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,360
Madam Lin,

40
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,880
didn't you give me the ring necklace?

41
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,600
Why did you tell brother A Yan

42
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,320
that it's from Miss Xiaomeng?

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,120
I'm telling you, Tiankong.

44
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,640
This really is a gift from both me
and Miss Xiaomeng.

45
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,680
From now on, if anyone asks,

46
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,000
you should tell them
it's a gift from Xiaomeng. Understood?

47
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,560
I understand, Madam Lin.

48
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,000
Can we play the remote control helicopter
for a little longer?

49
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,480
Sure, go and play.

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,200
Every time I drive you home,

51
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,800
I wish you could live farther from me.

52
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,200
Then I can spend more time with you.

53
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,680
It's very late. You should go home soon.

54
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,400
I had a great time today.

55
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,400
Xiaomeng,

56
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,080
don't you worry too much about work.

57
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,000
I believe there would be

58
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,000
many job invitations for you in a week.

59
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,360
I have told you

60
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,360
I don't want to rely on others,

61
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,040
or get jobs by cronyism.

62
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,160
How is that the case?

63
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,440
You are very talented.

64
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,680
Why would you need cronyism?

65
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,640
You only need to stay in good shape,

66
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,760
and I can't think of
any company that would reject you.

67
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,480
Why do you always have such faith in me?

68
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,080
Because I am your number one fan.

69
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,520
All right. I'm going in.

70
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,600
You should go home now.

71
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,080
Safe journey.

72
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,320
Xiaomeng,

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,120
you have wetted my clothes
with tears today.

74
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,440
How could you turn me away so hastily?

75
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,000
Come and give me a hug.

76
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,120
Comfort me.

77
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,920
Xiaomeng,

78
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,440
let's have dessert together next time.

79
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,080
Sure.

80
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,040
A Yan.

81
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,760
You seem to be in a good mood.

82
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,400
I'm all right.

83
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,240
You had a date with Jiang Ze, didn't you?

84
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,160
I didn't.

85
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,040
I just bumped into him on the way.

86
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,240
I had a chat with him

87
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,920
and he gave me a ride.

88
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,680
Where did you go to bump into him?

89
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,040
I was looking for jobs

90
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,400
and bumped into him on the way.

91
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,560
Don't get it wrong.

92
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,640
I didn't get anything wrong.

93
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,880
I really bumped into him on the way.

94
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,960
We are just friends.

95
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,800
A Yan,

96
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,320
is that a problem to you?

97
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,360
Zhou Xiaomeng,

98
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,760
I don't want to listen to you anymore.

99
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,480
You are very smart,

100
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,160
especially good at feigning innocence
and being miserable.

101
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,240
Only a childish man like Jiang Ze
would be attracted by you.

102
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,520
Don't worry.

103
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,000
I won't be enchanted by you.

104
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,040
Zhou Yanzhao, what do you mean?

105
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,960
How did I ever feign in front of you?

106
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,560
You feigned your devotion to me,

107
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,800
yet you were in Jiang Ze's arms
soon enough.

108
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,720
Do you want me to applaud
your performance?

109
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,720
We've known each other since childhood.

110
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,840
In front of you, I could
pretend for one day or one month.

111
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,480
Could I have pretended all these years?

112
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,640
Do you not know what kind of person I am?

113
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,640
You have changed

114
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,800
and you think everyone has changed.
Am I right?

115
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,960
Good. Let me ask you.

116
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,720
Where is the ring necklace
that I gave you?

117
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,360
I...

118
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,840
You gave it to someone else.

119
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,800
Shouldn't you have at least told me first?

120
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,320
Tiankong? You saw Tiankong--

121
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,360
Yes,

122
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,200
I do wish Tiankong could recover soon.

123
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,960
But you know that the ring necklace

124
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,000
was the only gift
from my mom before she died.

125
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,480
You know it means a lot to me.

126
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,760
Yet you gave it away anyway.

127
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,520
At least you should have told me.

128
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,600
It's not like that.

129
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,840
-I...
-Xiaomeng, A Yan.

130
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,480
What are you fighting about?

131
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,360
Take it easy.

132
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,720
Mom, I'm not fighting with A Yan.

133
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,160
It's only a misunderstanding. It's fine.

134
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,640
I heard you mentioned a ring.

135
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,080
Give it back to A Yan.

136
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,240
I have many jewelry.

137
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,800
I will give you anything you want.

138
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,680
It's not like that.

139
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,760
Go back in your room and rest.

140
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,640
Well, A Yan...

141
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,040
I will ask Xiaomeng
to give you back the stuff.

142
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,520
Don't be angry.

143
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,160
Be good.

144
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,320
A Yan.

145
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,400

She's been watching over me.

156
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,960
She's never left my side.

I'm turning in if there's nothing else.

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,920
I haven't finished yet.
Why are you leaving?

172
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,800
Look at you, a grown-up!

173
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,880
How come you can't keep anything in mind?

174
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,240
I need you now!

175
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,360
Just tell me anything.

176
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,880
Am I not obedient enough to you?

177
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,200
I want to ask you.

178
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,880
How has my plan to transfer you
to the Dikai Commercial City project

179
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,840
been progressing?

180
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,320
It's just a simple task.

181
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,800
I've got it done by just asking.

182
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,160
I don't know what's the big deal.

183
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,680
Are you saying that...

184
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,840
Zhou Yanzhao has agreed?

185
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,080
He has agreed,

186
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,400
but he wants me
to take care of both projects,

187
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,960
and asked me to learn from you.

188
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,160
I don't know
what I can learn from you though.

189
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,640
Both projects?

190
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,200
What is on Zhou Yanzhao's mind?

191
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,440
I just don't get
what you are fighting for.

192
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,880
Isn't it great that

193
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,040
Shenghai makes money and then we share it?

194
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,680
It belongs to me.
No one else can touch it!

195
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,760
I have to get it back
even if I have to fight to the death.

196
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,320
That is your stuff.

197
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,520
What have I got to do with it?

198
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,840
How are you not related?

199
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,680
Am I not doing all this for you?

200
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,920
You're just fooling around all the time.

201
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,120
If only you could
quit some of your bad habits

202
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,200
and work harder on everything,

203
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,240
do I need to do so much work?

204
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,160
Dad,

205
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,240
I'm tired of your speech.

206
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,520
I'll say it again.

207
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,840
You are you and I am me.

208
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,240
Fine.

209
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,680
If you have to draw a line between us,

210
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,480
I won't say one more word.

211
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,520
You now have your hands in
the Dikai Commercial City project.

212
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,680
I want to know

213
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,080
if you have done anything today

214
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,040
to get yourself ready for the project.

215
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,000
Today...

216
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,480
Xiaomeng was in trouble today.

217
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,400
I gave her a hand.

218
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,960
Are you saying that

219
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,880
you had a date with Zhou Xiaomeng?

220
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,280
What? Is there a problem?

221
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,960
It's a good thing that
you and Xiaomeng are going out.

222
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,240
You have my full support.

223
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,960
I really don't get you.

224
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
But I'm telling you,

225
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,360
leave my business alone.

226
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,120
You brat!

227
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,600
A Yan!

228
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,160
A Yan!

229
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,600
A Yan!

230
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,920
A Yan!

231
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,800
A Yan, I'm sorry

232
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,200
I've woken you up.

233
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,440
What's the matter?

234
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,680
A Yan,

235
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,480
please forgive Xiaomeng.

236
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,120
I've found

237
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,880
what you want.

238
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,640
Is it this thing?

239
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,840
Where did you find it?

240
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,200
It's right in her room.

241
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,240
Xiaomeng must be too careless.

242
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,440
It's in the deepest corner

243
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,840
of her drawer,

244
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,360
so she couldn't find it.

245
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,280
I found it. Is it the one?

246
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,240
Xiaomeng

247
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,280
must have forgotten where she put it.

248
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,840
It's not her fault.

249
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,720
Now I've found it.

250
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,160
It can clarify

251
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,680
your misunderstanding.

252
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,120
You and Xiaomeng

253
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,520
have to get along well.

254
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Be good. Listen to me.

255
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,400
Bye-bye.

256
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,400
A Yan,

257
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,640
you've turned 18 today.

258
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,640
I have some important thing for you.

259
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,120
This is a video tape

260
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,960
from your mother.

261
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,480
She told me

262
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,840
to only give it to you
when you are 18 years old.

263
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,480
Now you can watch it.

264
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,480
A Yan, you are now 18,

265
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,480
an adult man now.

266
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,280
Mom wants to be with you,
and watch you grow up.

267
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,320
Unfortunately...

268
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,240
Sorry, I couldn't stop crying.

269
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,440
Before I started filming, I told myself

270
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,240
I couldn't let you see me cry, but...

271
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,480
Dad,

272
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,200
you still don't want to
see my mom even now?

273
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,120
Even in the video?

274
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,120
My company is in a dire predicament.

275
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,120
I have to handle it.

276
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,120
My dear A Yan,

277
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,800
are you happy on your birthday?

278
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,240
Did Dad buy you a birthday cake?

279
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,360
I wonder...

280
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,360
if you are stout or slim,

281
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,840
and how you look now.

282
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,320
It's my deepest regret

283
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,200
that I can't see you grow up.

284
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,480
But I think...

285
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,440
you must still be that amazing boy, right?

286
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,880
I am sorry.

287
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,960
Yet I am happy

288
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,600
that you are my son.

289
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,760
I will always be proud of you.

290
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,760
Happy birthday.

291
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,160
Xiaomeng.

292
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,440
Are you going to visit Tiankong now?

293
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,800
I'm going to the hospital

294
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,360
to give Tiankong some toys.

295
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,160
Give me that.

296
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,120
I'll send those over.

297
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,920
It's all right. You are busy.

298
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,440
I don't want to trouble you. Let me do it.

299
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,200
It's no trouble.

300
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,200
I want to talk to Director Lin anyway.

301
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,640
Great. You should go then.

302
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,760
Tell them

303
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,800
I'll visit Tiankong when I have time.

304
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,720
Sure.

305
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,880
Tiankong.

306
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,920
Brother A Yan,

307
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,280
you've really come to see me.

308
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,480
Yes.

309
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,080
I've even brought you some gifts
which are from Xiaomeng.

310
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,320
Tiankong,

311
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,520
why are you alone here?

312
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,920
Where is Director Lin?

313
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,160
Madam Lin is with the doctor.

314
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,640
She'll be back soon.

315
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,800
Tiankong,

316
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,760
can you tell me

317
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,920
who gave you that?

318
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,480
Madam Lin gave me this,

319
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,240
but Madam Lin asked me to say that

320
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,520
it's from Miss Xiaomeng.

321
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,440
Madam Lin told me not to tell anyone.

322
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,880
Tiankong, don't worry.

323
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,120
I'll keep the secret for you.

324
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,680
Can you take it off
and let me have a look?

325
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,400
Tiankong,

326
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,480
can you keep it to yourself that
you took this off...

327
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,400
and showed it to me?

328
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,600
We each have a secret.

329
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,120
We each have a secret.

330
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,640
Pinky swear.

331
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,600
Whoever tells the others is the bad boy.

332
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,840
Good.

333
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,840
A Yan,

334
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,240
what are you doing here?

335
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,640
Xiaomeng has been held up by business

336
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,400
so she told me to send Tiankong some toys.

337
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,280
Tiankong,

338
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,800
you've got some new toys.

339
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,160
Yes, I have new toys.

340
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,600
-I...
-I...

341
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm going to take Tiankong for a check-up.

342
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,800
I should return to the company.

343
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,200
Then I'll see you out.

344
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,040
Sure.

345
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,920
See you, Tiankong.

346
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,040
Brother A Yan,

347
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,720
you must visit me again.

348
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,840
Sure.

349
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,840
Aunt Lin,

350
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,320
goodbye.

351
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,240
Goodbye.

352
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,760
I wonder what's special about today.

353
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,960
So many people have given birth today.

354
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,640
I haven't even stopped to drink water
since last night.

355
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,400
I'm telling you,

356
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,280
no matter how busy you are,

357
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,000
you have to keep an eye
on the bracelets on the newborns.

358
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,200
Don't mix them up,

359
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,200
otherwise, there'd be
unimaginable consequences.

360
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,360
You're right. No matter how tough it is,

361
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,600
we have to be responsible.

362
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,920
We can't be careless even for a second.

363
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,040
We can never mix up the children

364
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,160
otherwise, it'd ruin two families.

365
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,040
I'm telling you,

366
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,880
no matter how busy you are,

367
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,680
you have to keep an eye
on the bracelets on the newborns.

368
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,880
Don't mix them up,

369
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,840
otherwise, there'd be
unimaginable consequences.

Uncle Fang.

373
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,280
A Yan,

374
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,200
do you miss me?

375
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,840
Uncle Fang, I want to ask you something.

376
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,960
When I was born,

377
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,520
neither you nor Dad was by my mom's side.

378
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,720
A Yan,

379
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,680
why are you bringing this up?

380
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,920
Did Xiaomeng say something to you?

381
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,200
Did Xiaomeng ask about that too?

382
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,560
She...

383
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,520
She gave me a call
and asked me a few questions.

384
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,960
What really happened at the time?

385
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,440
You were born in Sydney.

386
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,520
Boss and I were

387
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,280
in Shanghai dealing with a big project,

388
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,120
so we were not by your mom's side.

389
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,840
I don't know what exactly happened there.

390
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,400
Your mom was not well

391
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,280
and she had miscarriages a few times.

392
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,480
When she was carrying you,

393
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,320
your dad sent your mom
to Sydney for a quiet rest.

394
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,080
When your dad knew that
you were safely born,

395
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,880
he was so thrilled.

396
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,760
So when I was born,

397
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,920
neither of you was with my mom.

398
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,880
That's right.

399
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,040
Uncle Fang,

400
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,840
I see.

401
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,360
Take care.

402
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,360
I'll visit you when I have time.

Qingyan,

405
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,080
I'll be in Sydney for a few days
to take care of something.

406
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,760
Keep it to yourself. Don't tell anyone.

For the business of Shenghai,
if it's not particularly important,

408
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,680
you may handle it by yourself.

Where is Chairman Zhou?

413
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,280
Isn't he back yet?

414
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,720
Yesterday he said that

415
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,240
he had something to take care of
these few days.

416
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,240
You startled me, Lingxi.

417

Come on. Do you get startled so easily?

418

Where do you think Chairman Zhou is?

419
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,920
He didn't say.

420
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,760
Do you have anything to tell him urgently?

421
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,800
Today there's a meeting with
the contractors.

422

Let me check.

425
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,560
You forgot about it
and you need to check the schedule?

426
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,440
I saw it now.

427

calm down.

to let you know it like this.

At that time,

479
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,600
the doctor was in jail
because of this incident.

480

Is there anyone behind all this?

481

abandon her own child?

Zhen, what's the matter with you today?

490
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,040
What else can it be?

491
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,240
Of course it's your superstar classmate.

492
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,440
I set up the schedule,

493
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,800
and she wouldn't follow it,

494
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,560
insisting on doing it her own way.

495
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,240
All right, then I let her.

496
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,400
And?

497
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,640
Today our supervisor examined the clips.

498
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,640
That episode was harshly criticized.

499
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,320
Now she wouldn't admit it

500
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,440
and she put all the blame on me.

501
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,680
Tell me what I can do.

502
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,840
Zhen, it was I

503
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,400
who introduced her to you after all.

504
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,720
However, I had no idea

505
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,280
she would be so difficult to work with.

506
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,800
It's not your fault.

507
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,400
One thing has nothing to do
with the other.

508
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,520
You can't take responsibility
for the mistakes she made.

509
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,560
Right.

510
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,040
How are Tiankong's eyes?

511
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,640
He is recovering quite well.

512
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,200
He should be able to go home in a while.

513
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,600
How about you?

514
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,320
Have you made any progress with Dr. Xiao?

515
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,760
I...

516
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,160
What's wrong?

517
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,680
We are too busy.

518
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,000
We can hardly find the time to meet.

519
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,840
He...

520
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,080
How is he?

521
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,120
Has he never been

522
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,080
in a romantic relation before?

523
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,520
Really?

524
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,800
I have never asked him

525
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,040
such a personal question.

526
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,400
I wonder

527
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,640
if he even knows
how to be in a romantic relationship,

528
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,280
and what a romantic relationship
is supposed to be.

529
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,680
For example,

530
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,440
I said that my hands were cold.

531
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,400
It's an obvious hint.

532
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,360
He immediately bought
a cup of hot milk tea

533
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,280
for me to hold in my hands.

534
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,800
Let me give you another example.

535
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
We went to see a movie.

536
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,280
The lightning was perfect,
and the atmosphere too.

537
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,200
I just laid my head a bit on him,

538
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,560
then he moved away at once

539
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,800
and sat very straight.

540
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,560
He looked like a gentleman
not to be tempted at all.

541
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,360
What do you think I should do?

542
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,000
Zhen,

543
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,200
you have just started
going out for a few days.

544
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,040
And you said there was no time for dates.

545
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,960
How come you have already touched hands
and leaned on his shoulder?

546
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,240
You are moving too fast.

547
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,680
I am not moving fast.

548
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,440
Isn't it how...

549
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,960
all relationships develop?

550
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,840
Moreover, I am not asking for a lot.

551
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,680
I just think he should
treat me like a woman.

552
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,400
Show me some response.

553
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,720
Right. I get it.

554
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,800
Dr. Xiao is usually

555
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,240
a serious person.

556
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,200
But relationships

557
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,800
have to grow naturally.

558
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,960
You can't force it.

559
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,360
Everyone has a different pace

560
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,320
for their feelings to grow.

561
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,960
But he's a nice guy.

562
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,280
It's worth taking it slowly.

563
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,880
Of course I know that he's a nice guy.

564
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,600
I just am not sure...

565
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,720
if he likes me or not.

566
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,040
You know that

567
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,680
I'm used to being audacious all the time.

568
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,920
Sometimes,

569
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,960
I'm not very feminine.

570
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,160
I don't have confidence.

571
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,360
Be confident, Qiao Zhen.

572
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,480
You have to believe yourself.

573
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,720
You are the best, the most beautiful

574
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,040
and most charming.

575
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,200
Really?

576
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,920
You are the best.

577
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,960
You always have faith in me.

578
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,960
Right.

579
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,520
How about your love life?

580
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,840
Xiaomeng,

581
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,440
can't you really...

582
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,720
work it out with Zhou Yanzhao?

583
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,440
I don't know that either.

584
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,680
I can feel that

585
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,040
he really loves you and cares about you.

586
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,120
However, there seems to be...

587
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,320
too many misunderstandings
and obstacles between you.

588
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,680
It was misunderstanding at first,

589
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,840
but it has become torture.

590
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,520
It doesn't matter anymore

591
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,600
what it has become.

592
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,920
How deeply we were in love at first,

593
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,200
we hate each other equally deeply now.

594
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,400
But now,

595
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,480
I don't care anymore.

596
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,880
I only want to take care of my mom.

597
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,120
The other things are not important.

598
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,760
Xiaomeng,

599
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,160
has Aunt Ye been improving?

600
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,560
A little bit, I guess.

601
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,480
But her emotions fluctuate a lot,

602
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,040
and are very unstable.

603
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,680
You need to be patient.

604
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,280
The medicines we've prescribed
are for recovering her cranial nerves.

605
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,200
In the process of recovery,

606
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,880
it's natural that
her emotions might fluctuate.

607
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,160
Don't worry.

608
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,400
She'll be better after getting used to it.

609
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,280
I see.

610
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:06,960
Dr. Xiao,

611
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,440
I have something to ask you.

612
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,680
What is it?

613
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,680
How is it going between you and Qiao Zhen?

614
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,040
We are fine.

615
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,240
Dr. Xiao,

616
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,760
have you not been
in a romantic relationship before?

617
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,120
When I was in school,

618
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,640
I had a crush on a girl.

619
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,400
Some girls liked me too.

620
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,480
But somehow, nothing ever worked out.

621
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,400
I don't know if they count.

622
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,160
Why did you ask me that?

623
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,760
I just want to remind you that

624
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,640
sometimes a man needs to be more proactive

625
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,920
so that your relationship
may take a step further.

626
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,560
Xiaomeng,

627
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,840
are you asking me to court you?

628
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,160
Dr. Xiao, what are you talking about?

629
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,040
I'm talking about Qiao Zhen.

630
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,240
I want to tell you that,

631
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,840
sometimes you need to
express your feelings more,

632
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,880
so that she can see them.

633
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,400
Did Qiao Zhen say something to you?

634
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,840
She thinks that

635
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,560
you haven't been treating her
like a woman at all.

636
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,520
I haven't been treating her like a woman?

637
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,080
Of course I treat her like a woman.

638
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,600
Otherwise, why would I ask her
to be my girlfriend?

639
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,000
I am a doctor.

640
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,840
I have always been rational and calm.

641
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,880
You can't just ask me to be passionate
all of a sudden.

642
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,400
-It's not my style.
-All right, Dr. Xiao.

643
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,480
Take it easy.

644
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,880
I trust you and I trust her.

645
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,400
I hope you two could be happy together.

646
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,520
I should go now.

647
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,360
Xiaomeng!

648
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,320
Have I not been treating her like a woman?

649
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,560
I'm very sorry
to let you know it like this.

650
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,400
At that time,

651
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,560
the doctor was in jail
because of this incident.

652
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,120
Is there anyone behind all this?

653
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,360
You can think of it that way.

654
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,120
My mom's last name is Lin.

655
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,880
Yueling Lin.

656
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,840
That's right.

657
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,040
Why would anyone

658
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,920
abandon her own child?

659
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,160
I'm sorry, sir.

660
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,840
That's all I know. I'm very sorry.

661
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,000
Mom, let me dry your hair.

662
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,080
Come, sit down.

663
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,760
Mom,

664
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,480
what's wrong?

665
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,760
Why are we living here?

666
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,560
Mom, we live here

667
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,600
so that A Yan and sister Hua
can take care of us.

668
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,520
But I don't want to live here.

669
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,480
I want to go home. I...

670
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,960
-I want to go home.
-Mom!

671
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,320
-Mom!
-Let me go!

672
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,680
-Be patient, mom.
-I have to go home.

673
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,120
-I want to go home!
-Mom!

674
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,560
-Mom!
-Go away! Go Away!

675
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,440
Stop this.

676

Dr. Ye is hysterical right now.

Dr. Ye.

698
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,360
It's fine, Dr. Ye.
