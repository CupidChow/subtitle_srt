1
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,600
(Episode 30)

2
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,160
It's because of that

3
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,840
that I don't want to leave a stain
on Shenghai Group's reputation.

4
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,320
Whatever it takes,

5
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,120
I must get to the bottom of this.

6
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,640
Is Uncle Jiang in charge of this project?

7
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,320
And Jiang Ze.

8
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,600
They are at the helm of it.

9
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,680
Are you worried about Jiang Ze?

10
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,560
After all, he's our mutual friend.

11
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,040
Of course, as a friend,

12
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,440
it's normal to show concern for him.

13
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,880
You go check on him.

14
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,040
Go. I don't mind.

15
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,640
Dad, don't worry.

16
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,320
Regarding this matter,
I will do my best to help you.

17
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,880
Son, let me remind you.

18
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,880
You must beware of Zhou Yanzhao
at all times.

19
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,520
Dad, what's that for?

20
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,560
You know he won't do such a thing.

21
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,360
Why would he be so kind as to help us?

22
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,800
He's just worried that Shenghai
would be dragged into this mess.

23
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,400
All he wants is to save
the company's reputation

24
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,280
and completely destroy my power
in the board.

25
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,600
Those are his real goals.

26
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,360
-Dad...
-I'm doing this for your own good, son.

27
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,520
Do you understand?

28
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,240
If it's for my own good,

29
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,720
you should just let me choose my own path.

30
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,760
What?

31
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,600
Who's calling?

32
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,560
Xiaomeng's calling me.

33
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,960
If you and Xiaomeng can be together,

34
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,280
that will put my mind at ease.

35
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,240
Off you go...

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,760
Whom I'm in a relationship with
is my business.

37
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,680
Don't you worry about it.

38
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,840
I've ordered you a drink. Try it.

39
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,120
Thank you.

40
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,640
Is there a reason for asking me out?

41
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,840
I heard from A Yan that

42
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,240
this incident has dealt
a huge blow to you.

43
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,480
I'm concerned about you.

44
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,120
Don't listen to A Yan's nonsense.

45
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,960
Look at me. Don't I look just fine?

46
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,360
A long time ago,

47
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,200
when I was sad and hopeless,

48
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,440
a person once told me

49
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,280
there are always low points in our life.

50
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,160
Every step forward you take
is exceptionally difficult.

51
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,280
You're going uphill,

52
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,880
and that's why it feels tough.

53
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,880
But...

54
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,840
we just can't stay at the low point
forever.

55
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,080
Xiaomeng,

56
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,880
if you could say those comforting words
in a less philosophical way,

57
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,320
it'd be better.

58
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,840
I just don't want you
to be defeated by this incident.

59
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,000
Trust me, I'm okay.

60
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,720
Hello?

61
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,320
All right, I get it.

62
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,440
What happened?

63
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,760
The injured worker at the hospital

64
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,000
just passed away.

65
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,800
I should be there.

66
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,760
Jiang Ze, don't rush.

67
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,480
I'm sure
there's a solution to the problem.

68
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
I hope you only say this

69
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,080
to me.

70
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,040
An accident occurred

71
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,560
at the construction site
of Shenghai Group's new project,

72
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,960
Dikai Commercial City.

73
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,600
Twelve workers are injured,
three of which are in serious condition.

74
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,640
Now we're going to cover
the latest news we got.

75
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,520
One of the injured workers
in the accident was declared dead

76
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,960
after attempted resuscitation failed
half an hour ago.

77
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,640
Just like that, a family is destroyed.

78
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,560
These businessmen only care about profits.

79
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,960
They are unscrupulous.

80
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,680
I just bought Shenghai's stock
two days ago.

81
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,880
I must quickly sell it.

82
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,240
So far, Shenghai has yet to comment
on this incident.

83
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,000
We will follow it closely
and keep you updated.

84
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,960
Hello? Director Lin.

85
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,000
Come in.

86
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,880
Chairman Zhou,

87
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,360
the dead worker's family
is emotionally unstable.

88
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,640
They need us to go over now.

89
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,920
Besides,

90
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,520
the authorities

91
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,440
asked us to hold a press conference
to explain the incident

92
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,440
as soon as possible.

93
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,560
This is the investigation report
of the accident.

94
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,440
The conclusion is

95
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,280
there were severe cracks
in the load-bearing wall

96
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,720
that caused the entire floor to collapse.

97
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,040
It has been verified by professionals

98
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,200
that it was caused by the non-approved
construction material that we used.

99
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,320
This kind of material is two times cheaper

100
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,800
than what we'd planned to use.

101
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,080
Who's the main contractor?

102
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,840
It's Ronghui Company.

103
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,040
We're still unable to reach
the person in charge.

104
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,320
Go and run a background check
on Ronghui Company

105
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,640
and find out more about them.

106
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,960
Get to the bottom of it.

107
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,280
Okay, I'm on it.

108
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,760
I've watched the news.

109
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,480
This concerns a life.

110
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,520
The victim's family is very emotional.

111
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,400
I'm worried about Yan.

112
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,040
What should he do about this?

113
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,560
Tell me, do you think
I should go check on him?

114
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,920
Aunt Lin, listen to me.

115
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,760
You can't go see him
particularly in situations like this.

116
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,040
If someone senses something's amiss,
the consequences could be troublesome.

117
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,040
A Yan can resolve this problem for sure.

118
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,440
The incident already happened.

119
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,000
No matter what, we must face it.

120
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,120
A Yan is the Chairman of Shenghai Group.

121
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,080
He has the responsibility to face this.

122
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,440
I know.

123
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,560
But particularly in situations like this,

124
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,080
as a mother,
I can't help him with anything.

125
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,600
All I do is get anxious.

126
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
I'm really worried about him.

127
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,240
Aunt Lin, don't worry too much.

128
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,920
If A Yan finds out about this,
he'll be worried.

129
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,000
Xiaomeng,

130
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,280
do you think it's possible that
the police would put him in prison

131
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,280
if he gets implicated in this incident?

132
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,800
No.

133
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,080
They will get to the bottom of it.

134
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,320
Whoever's responsible for this
should take the responsibility.

135
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,240
If you've known A Yan long enough,

136
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,480
you'll realize that

137
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,320
he is someone who never gets defeated.

138
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,280
Aunt Lin, you have to believe in A Yan.

139
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,520
He'll be able to solve this problem

140
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,360
and give everyone a satisfactory closure.

141
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,440
All right.

142
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,680
For now,

143
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,160
we can only pray for the speedy recovery
of those who got injured

144
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,320
and hope that
their pain will be over soon.

145
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,000
-Aunt!
-Xiaoxi.

146
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,360
What brings you here suddenly?

147
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,880
Xuanxuan, you're a good boy.

148
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,680
Where's my brother-in-law? Not home yet?

149
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,520
Not yet.

150
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,600
I can't reach him on his phone.

151
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,720
What happened?

152
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,440
Take Xuanxuan to his room.

153
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,080
Xuanxuan, let's go.

154
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,160
Take a seat.

155
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,360
Sister, you really have no idea
where your husband is?

156
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,560
Well...

157
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,560
He's always out entertaining clients.
I'm used to it.

158
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,640
Have you heard any rumor about him?

159
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,360
Don't take those rumors too seriously.

160
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,720
For a man his age,

161
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,280
it's not that much of a big deal

162
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,600
to have a fling.

163
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,800
Haven't you watched the news?

164
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,640
What news?

165
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,120
I've been busy
looking after Xuanxuan all day.

166
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,760
I don't have time to watch the news.

167
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,080
A serious accident

168
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,040
occurred at the construction site
of Dikai Commercial City.

169
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,600
So far, there is one fatal injury.

170
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,240
The other victims
are still in the hospital.

171
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,680
That's terrible.

172
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,240
What does that have to do with my husband?

173
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,920
The main contractor is Ronghui Company.

174
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,920
That's his company.

175
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,280
But this is just an accident.

176
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,280
He has nothing to do with it.

177
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,560
If so, why can't you reach his phone?

178
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,880
And you don't know his whereabouts.

179
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,840
Xiaoxi, you must help your brother-in-law.

180
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,880
I beg you.

181
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,280
Sister, you and your husband raised me.

182
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,360
Also, he funded my education abroad.

183
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,600
Now that he's in trouble,
I will not just sit by and do nothing.

184
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,160
Don't worry. I will help him.

185
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,280
Having your help puts my mind at ease.

186
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,720
He's stubborn as a mule.

187
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,520
I tried to persuade him not to do it.

188
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,920
All he thinks about is profit.

189
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,360
When will he ever stop?

190
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,000
Can't he just retire early
and spend time together as a family?

191
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,840
He just won't listen.

192
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,440
-And now this...
-All right.

193
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,480
What's the point of saying this?

194
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,160
Now, think carefully where he might be.

195
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,480
Call me when you've got something.

196
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,760
I'd better get going.

197
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,800
Xiaoxi,

198
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,800
you must find a way
to help your brother-in-law.

199
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,480
Sister, don't you worry.

200
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,320
I will.

201
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,120
Have some tea.

202
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,480
Does my brother-in-law have anything to do
with this construction accident?

203
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,760
You're here to find out who's to blame.

204
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,240
I just want to know
where my brother-in-law is.

205
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,200
How is he?

206
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,040
Do you see it?

207
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,520
Water overflows when the cup is full.

208
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,320
It becomes unbearable
when there's too much water.

209
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,760
Your brother-in-law

210
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,600
bites off more than he can chew.

211
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,320
Things go wrong when he does that.

212
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,680
Are you aware?

213
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,840
Every time he received payments
for projects,

214
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,760
all he thought about was cutting corners.

215
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,280
Despite my numerous warnings,
he persisted.

216
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,040
Now this happens.

217
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,920
So you knew about it all along.

218
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,160
Do you know
this is a matter of life and death?

219
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,120
That's right.

220
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,360
This matter of life and death

221
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,920
has made Ms. Sun,
who used to be very calm,

222
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,000
lose her composure.

223
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,840
Vice President Jiang,
please help my brother-in-law.

224
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,120
Now you are the only one who can help him.

225
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,920
It's too late.

226
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,240
He pushed himself into a dead end.

227
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,360
There's no turning back.

228
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,080
But there is one way

229
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,480
to go forward.

230
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,680
Vice President Jiang, please tell me.

231
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,640
Go to jail.

232
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,800
That's the safest solution for him.

233
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,280
Vice President Jiang,
if you put it this way,

234
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,040
I'm afraid you also have
something to do with it, right?

235
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,480
That's right.

236
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,880
I'm somewhat

237
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,120
responsible for this.

238
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,760
If I hadn't given him a hand
when his investment failed,

239
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,800
there could be a totally different ending.

240
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,880
But I just didn't expect him

241
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,560
to be that greedy and money-hungry

242
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,960
-and pass things off as good quality...
-You--

243
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,600
I think you should just go back

244
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,400
and console you sister.

245
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,280
Vice President Jiang, I beg you.

246
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,080
Please help him one last time.

247
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,600
I can do whatever you want me to do.

248
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,800
I can do anything.

249
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,840
You can do anything?

250
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,960
You have been around Zhou Yanzhao
for a long time.

251
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,720
You really want me to tell you again
what you have to do?

252
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,560
It's because you haven't tried your best,

253
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,480
or you've actually fallen in love
with Zhou Yanzhao?

254
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,880
Ridiculous.

255
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,040
Women like you

256
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,800
are always blinded by love.

257
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Vice President Jiang,

258
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,800
there's another secret
between Zhou Yanzhao and Xiaomeng.

259
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,800
Secret?

260
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,440
Although I haven't figured out what it is,

261
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,640
my instinct tells me
there's another secret.

262
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,240
Please give me some time.

263
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,880
I will dig out the secret.

264
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,200
All right.

265
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,600
I'll trust you one more time.

266
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,080
Don't worry.

267
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,000
Your brother-in-law won't kill himself
to escape punishment.

268
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,640
But prison life is inevitable.

269
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,720
And of course, this also puts me at risk.

270
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,000
If he couldn't
keep his mouth shut inside...

271
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,040
Don't you worry.

272
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,120
If you let him off the hook,
he won't say a word.

273
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,880
That'd be perfect.

274
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,800
Come on, let's have some tea.

275
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,360
They are the victim's family.

276
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,360
I'm very sorry about this.

277
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,680
What's the point of apologizing?

278
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,840
Can an apology bring my husband back?

279
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,800
He was fine before he got here.

280
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,880
Now he is lying there

281
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,520
and will never wake up.

282
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,520
Give me back my husband! Give him back!

283
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,360
Let me know if you have any request.

284
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,760
Request?

285
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,880
Do you mean compensation?

286
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,640
I tell you.

287
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,320
Whatever amount of money you give us
is useless!

288
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,680
He's dead!

289
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,760
I want you to pay the price
for what you did to my younger brother!

290
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,480
Miss, I understand how you feel.

291
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,800
I lost someone I love before,
and I know how that feels.

292
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,960
No one wanted this accident to happen.

293
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,880
So please give me a chance to make amends.

294
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,760
Get lost! I want you to leave!

295
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,160
My son is dead!

296
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,000
-Aunt...
-What are you saying that for?

297
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,840
Aunt...

298
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,480
I want you to pay with your life!

299
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,840
-Aunt, calm down.
-Pay with your life!

300
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,120
Mom.

301
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,000
Chairman Zhou...

302
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,440
There's no point arguing like this.
You should leave.

303
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,280
Stop!

304
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,600
-Calm down...
-Mom.

305
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,240
Chairman Zhou has something else to do.

306
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,720
I'm sorry, everyone.

307
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,720
But don't you worry about it.

308
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,400
Shenghai will give you
a satisfactory closure.

309
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,160
I'm Chang Qingyan,
Chairman Zhou's secretary.

310
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,320
This is my card.

311
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,760
Give me a call anytime you want.

312
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,120
Don't go!

313
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,920
-Give me back my son!
-Give me back my brother!

314
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,840
-Give me back my son!
-Mom.

315
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,480
Give me back my brother!

316
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,400
Who is it?

317
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,560
It's me, Jiang Ze.

318
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,880
Can I go in and talk with you?

319
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,520
Please.

320
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,160
Did you just have a talk with my dad?

321
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,680
He's the Vice President of Shenghai Group
and my supervisor.

322
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,600
What's wrong with me talking to him?

323
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,920
Business matters
should be discussed in the office.

324
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,840
As a subordinate,

325
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,640
do I have the right to refuse
the commands of my supervisor?

326
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,960
All right. I'll just cut to the chase.

327
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,400
Has my father done something bad?

328
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,960
He's your father.

329
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,600
You should ask him instead.

330
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,120
I'm just a lackey
working under Vice President Jiang.

331
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,280
You're my father's lackey?

332
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,800
It's late now.
I have to go to work tomorrow.

333
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,280
Mr. Jiang, is there anything else?

334
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,480
I get it.

335
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,120
I'd better get going.

336
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,320
Please.

337
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,120
A Yan...

338
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,880
you're home.

339
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,400
You haven't eaten anything, have you?

340
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,000
I made some porridge.
I'll heat it up for you.

341
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,840
The smell...

342
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,040
I still remember
when we were on Mayi Island,

343
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,360
there was a typhoon,

344
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,480
and you made me some porridge.

345
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,760
It smelled really good.

346
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,280
I always think of that aroma.

347
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,760
Later, I tried to recreate it a few times.

348
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,080
But it just can't compare
with the one you made for me that time.

349
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,400
For some reason,

350
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,760
I managed to recreate it today.

351
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,280
Now, have a taste.

352
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,600
See if it tastes the same.

353
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,720
I can't help you much.

354
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,760
But...

355
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,920
I hope this familiar taste
can bring you comfort.

356
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,760
Thank you,

357
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,280
Xiaomeng.

358
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,800
I visited Aunt Lin today.

359
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,800
She's very worried about you.

360
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,040
She wanted to visit you,

361
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,640
but I stopped her.

362
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,480
If you have some time to spare,

363
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,640
give her a call.

364
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,480
All right.

365
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,240
You've met the victim's family, right?

366
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,440
Yes.

367
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,600
They must be disheartened.

368
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,600
Did they give you a hard time?

369
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
No.

370
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,680
No?

371
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,600
Look at your neck.

372
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,720
There are scratch marks.

373
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,800
When people lose someone they love,

374
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,960
it's understandable that
they will behave unreasonably.

375
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,200
But when you put yourself in their shoes,

376
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,000
you can only sympathize with them
in order to move on.

377
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,200
It's swollen.

378
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,200
I'll help you apply some aloe vera gel.

379
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,320
Otherwise, it'll leave a scar.

380
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,160
Does it hurt?

381
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,560
A Yan...

382
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,520
have you ever thought

383
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,120
if they don't forgive you,
what you would do?

384
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,280
♪A sudden crack ♪

385
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:33,320
♪Got on my nerves and caused me pain ♪

386
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,120
♪Everything has become pale to me ♪

387
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,840
♪Diving with my happiness ♪

388
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,280
A Yan,

389
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,480
you're tired.

390
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,480
?Our silent and broken past ?

391
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,440
?Is awaiting you to touch it
Once in a while ?

392
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,120
?Take back my heart ?

393
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,720
?Take back my soul ?

394
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,360
?Don't let me cry ?

395
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,920
?And leave me in sadness ?

396
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,200
?There must be
A parallel universe of love ?

397
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,440
?Making amends for the mistakes of time ?

398
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,120
?Take back my heart ?

399
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,720
?Take back my soul ?

400
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,280
?Don't let me cry ?

401
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,920
?I make my confession ?

402
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,160
?There must be buttons of love
In parallel ?

403
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,400
?And a reason for our love
At this moment ?

404
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,320
?Because I love you ?

405
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:33,640
Come on, drink with your dad.

406
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,800
A Ze, what's wrong?

407
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,120
Dad,

408
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,240
the construction accident
is all your doing, isn't it?

409
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,320
What are you talking about?

410
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,320
The construction accident
is still under investigation.

411
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,000
There will be an explanation.

412
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,120
What do you actually want?

413
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,320
If Shenghai is in trouble,
we'll all be affected.

414
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,440
Haven't you heard the saying,

415
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,400
"Some self-sacrifice is necessary
to kill your enemy"?

416
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,720
Who's your enemy?

417
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,280
Zhou Yanzhao? Me?

418
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,560
Sun Lingxi?

419
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,520
Or all the employees of Shenghai?

420
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,760
Why are you suddenly bringing up
Sun Lingxi?

421
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,600
She also works for Shenghai.

422
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,240
Why do you look nervous all of a sudden?

423
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,000
Enough.

424
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,920
Stop blabbering.

425
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,600
I have a lot on my plate.

426
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,080
Nothing can be kept secret forever.

427
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,400
Stop at the appropriate time.

428
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,280
A Ze...

429
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,080
Xiaomeng...

430
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,440
you've woken up.

431
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,320
Did you catch a cold?

432
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,240
No.

433
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,800
You slept like a baby.

434
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,640
I thought I'd wake you up,

435
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,480
but A Yan didn't allow me
and said you should have a restful sleep.

436
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,760
Sister Hua, where's A Yan?

437
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,680
He went out.

438
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,760
Before he left,
he told me not to wake you up.

439
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,040
You must be hungry.

440
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,920
Come, have breakfast.

441
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,240
Is that real?

442
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,360
-Isn't that Zitong?
-Why are they together?

443
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,560
Zitong is really something.

444
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,640
It can't be real. Really?

445
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,720
Qiao Zhen, take a look at this.

446
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,640
What's going on?

447
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,320
The news came out this morning.

448
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,680
Look at this photo.

449
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,280
It looks real.

450
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,360
Zitong is not just another woman.

451
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,200
She managed to hook up with Mr. Jiang.

452
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,320
But do you think

453
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,080
Xiaomeng and Jiang Ze
are seeing each other?

454
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,040
Nonsense, that's baseless.

455
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,360
Qiao Zhen, what happened?

456
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,400
What's going on between you and Jiang Ze?

457
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,600
Nothing.

458
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,880
Zitong,

459
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,320
the story between you and Jiang Ze
made headlines.

460
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,160
It's more eye-catching
than Shenghai's construction accident.

461
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,040
It was A Ze who asked me out that day.

462
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,160
And he said he wanted to send me home.

463
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,480
I didn't know
that paparazzi were taking pictures of us.

464
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,400
Zitong,

465
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,760
you are a host of children's programs.

466
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,160
You should maintain a good image.

467
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,760
Qiao Zhen, you must help me.

468
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,800
I don't want this to happen either.

469
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,520
Qiao Zhen,

470
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,360
Boss asked to see you.

471
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,680
It's about Zitong's news.

472
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,200
Qiao Zhen, you must help me.

473
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,600
All right. I'll try.

474
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,520
Boss,

475
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,960
those photos were sneakily taken
by paparazzi.

476
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,280
Even Zitong probably didn't know
what happened.

477
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,000
I don't think that's a big deal.

478
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,720
What do you think of Zitong's performance?

479
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,000
I think

480
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,760
she has a different style from Xiaomeng.

481
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,080
Maybe some children
are still not used to it.

482
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,400
But undeniably, she works hard.

483
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,320
Perhaps, after a while,
the children will get used to it.

484
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,480
Our channel is starting
a new travel experience show.

485
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,720
In terms of image and personality,
I think Zitong is a good fit.

486
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,080
And now that she's in the public eye,

487
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,440
it can bring impact to the new show.

488
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,720
What about Fairy Tale Street?

489
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,680
The management has discussed it

490
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,800
and decided to cut down
the Fairy Tale Street airtime

491
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,280
and allocate more time for cartoons.

492
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,800
The travel show is going to air weekly.

493
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,520
I doubt there will be scheduling conflict.

494
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,080
I get it.

495
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,320
I'll tell Zitong about it.

496
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,600
There's one more thing.

497
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,520
Two big names,

498
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,000
Boloni Home Decor and Nongfu Spring,

499
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,440
called in this morning

500
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,800
and mentioned they wanted to sponsor
a couple of shows.

501
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,280
But there's a condition.

502
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,720
They want Zitong

503
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,840
to be their brand ambassador
and take part in their advertisements.

504
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,680
Once the deals are sealed,

505
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,080
I will ask them to get in touch with you
for schedule planning.

506
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:29,920
All right.

507
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,480
I get it.

508
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,680
This is especially good.

509
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,680
A friend of mind brought this
from Indonesia.

510
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,040
I've consumed a few cans.

511
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,560
Is it fattening?

512
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,240
No. You see, I've consumed a few cans.
I didn't put on weight.

513
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,480
Thank you, Zitong.

514
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,040
What is the color code
of the lipstick you bought recently?

515
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,200
It's pretty. I want to buy one too.

516
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,240
Really?

517
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,240
Try it.

518
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,200
Qiao Zhen.

519
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,800
I brought everyone snacks.

520
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,800
This is for you.

521
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,720
Thank you.

522
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,560
No problem.

523
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,760
Qiao Zhen,

524
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,840
I might be the ambassador for two brands.

525
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,000
Please help me adjust my schedule.

526
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,800
News travels fast.

527
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,400
The news reached you
the moment management made that decision.

528
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,720
No, those brands contacted me earlier.

529
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,680
But I told them such matters
would be decided by management.

530
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,880
No problem.

531
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,200
I'll move your schedule around.

532
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,400
Thank you, Qiao Zhen.

533
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,200
The results of the investigation
into the accident are out.

534
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,800
The main contractor, Ronghui Company,

535
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,800
used non-approved construction material,

536
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,040
resulting in the accident.

537
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,960
The boss of Ronghui Company
has turned himself over to the police.

538
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,360
Turned himself in?

539
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,160
Wasn't he unreachable a few days ago?

540
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,400
He could have succumbed to pressure
from the public.

541
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,760
Does that mean
it has nothing to do with Shenghai now?

542
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,880
Not really.

543
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,600
I'm somewhat responsible for this.

544
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,680
This is the result
of using the wrong person

545
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,080
and the lack of supervision.

546
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,200
I'm willing to take full responsibility.

547
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,360
I visited the family of the dead worker
yesterday.

548
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,800
They insisted on getting an explanation.

549
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,920
I also went to see them,

550
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,640
and we had a positive conversation.

551
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,440
In terms of compensation,
we've made a deal.

552
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,080
They won't complain again.

553
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,320
I get it, Vice President Jiang.

554
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,880
This problem will be solved
very soon, right?

555
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,880
Yes.

556
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,560
A Ze, what do you think?

557
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,160
A Yan,

558
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,240
hold a press conference
as soon as possible.

559
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,480
All right.

560
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,840
Please inform the PR department.

561
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,120
Set up a press conference
as soon as possible.

562
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,000
Dad.

563
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,160
Dad,

564
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,000
I hope there won't be
any more accidents like this.

565
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,280
Hello, sir. How may I help you?

566
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,480
Ms. Sun, what a coincidence.

567
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,600
I'll have a medium well steak
and a fruit salad, please.

568
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,760
Ms. Sun, anything else you want to eat?

569
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,600
It's my treat.

570
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,320
No, I had enough.

571
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,320
I have an important meeting
this afternoon.

572
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,640
I'd better get going.

573
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,200
Do you detest me that much?

574
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,400
No.

575
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,240
Mr. Jiang, don't think too much. See you.

576
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,200
My father and I are not the same.

577
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,000
He is he and I am me.

578
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,520
Jiang Ze,

579
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,920
don't you think my life is bad enough?

580
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,920
Ms. Sun, what do you mean by that?

581
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,520
I saw you were sad,

582
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,760
so I thought I'd come over
to have a chat with you.

583
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,120
But now, you're venting your anger on me.

584
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,640
Mr. Jiang, thank you for your kindness.

585
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,680
Vice President Jiang also says
that he helps me out of kindness.

586
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,000
Your family is helping me.

587
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,600
For that, I live every day of my life

588
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,600
in fear.

589
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,120
In situations like this,
only a devil can smile.

590
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,560
I'm not cursing your family.

591
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,440
But sooner or later,
you will face your karma.

592
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,720
Ms. Sun...

593
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:46,040
I thought you were a smart
and sensible person.

594
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
But now you're here attacking my father
and insulting me along the way.

595
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,000
I take it as your way to blow off steam.

596
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,760
If deep down in your heart
you really think you're an innocent lamb

597
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,360
being coerced to sell your soul
to the devil,

598
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,800
then I have to ask you a question.

599
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,720
Every lamb chosen by the devil

600
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,160
sows a seed of desire in its heart.

601
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,240
Why would you listen to my father
and do things for him?

602
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,920
Aren't these all your decisions?

603
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,640
Stop!

604
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,480
I'm different from him.

605
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,040
Please don't treat us like we're the same.

606
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,720
This accident is a wake-up call to us.

607
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,840
Quality is the basis of life.

608
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,280
From now on,
we must take quality very seriously

609
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,720
and never put anything to luck.

610
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,000
The public is very concerned
about this incident.

611
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,640
Now I'm going to explain it all
to every one of you.

612
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,400
This accident happened

613
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,720
because prefabricated panels
of non-standard technical parameters

614
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,680
were used.

615
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,720
That resulted in a large-scale collapse.

616
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,880
Shenghai is largely responsible

617
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,520
for the lack of supervision
of the main contractor.

618
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,080
We're willing to cooperate with the police
in their investigation.

619
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,800
Meanwhile,

620
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,360
we promise to take full responsibility
for this accident.

621
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,240
Shenghai Group will follow the development
of this accident closely

622
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,880
with the media
as well as the general public.

623
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,320
We will definitely give you
a satisfactory closure.

624
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,800
Are you happy now?

625
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,600
What do you mean?

626
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,440
A Ze,

627
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,640
we're now in the same boat.

628
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,880
Like I said,

629
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,720
when you're standing atop the peak,

630
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,920
no one will care
how you managed to climb up there.

631
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,400
If we have to use those low tricks
to win this battle,

632
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,560
I'd rather lose.

633
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,360
(Peter Pan script)

634
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
A Yan.

635
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,440
You're back.

636
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,120
You've been working on this?

637
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,720
It's just going over the script with them
at the theater.

638
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,960
But I like that.

639
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,280
Good to hear you like it.

640
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,240
A Yan.

641
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,400
I remember

642
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,680
you telling me about your dream
many times when we were young.

643
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,960
Do you remember that?

644
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,960
Things have changed.

645
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,800
I think it's actually very simple.

646
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,240
You've been working so hard

647
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,400
just because you want to be with...

648
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,160
the things you love.
