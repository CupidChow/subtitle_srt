1
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,560
(Episode 36)

2
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,920
Please come in.

3
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,320
Director, did you ask to see me?

4
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,440
Ms. Qin, it's about this.

5
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,240
This is the guest list
for our Mid-Autumn Festival Evening Party.

6
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,960
I need you to write the invitation letters
and send to each of them.

7
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,800
Sure.

8
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,920
(Guest List for Mid-Autumn Festival
Evening Party)

9
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,560
Director, is Xiaomeng coming this year?

10
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,600
Yes, the kids like her.

11
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,080
Besides, a while back,

12
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,040
there was a bit of controversy
over Xiaomeng in the society.

13
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,800
So I thought she could come
and relax a bit

14
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,400
and it'd be a way to express our gratitude
to Xiaomeng for her kindness.

15
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,560
That's true.

16
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,480
If the kids know she's coming,
they will be over the moon.

17
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,640
Keep it down. Don't tell them just yet.

18
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,840
We'll give them a surprise.

19
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,600
I got it.

20
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,800
But Director,

21
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,840
should I write an invitation letter
for both Xiaomeng and Chairman Zhou?

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,360
For Chairman Zhou and Xiaomeng,
how about I deliver it to them myself?

23
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,920
When you finish writing it,
you can just give it to me here.

24
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,360
No problem, I'm on it.

25
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,680
All right, thank you.

26
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,600
No worries.

27
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,760
Hello?

28
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,320
Yan, I...

29
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,760
Is it convenient for you to talk now?

30
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,440
Yes.

31
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,760
It's about this.

32
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,640
Our welfare center is going to hold
a Mid-Autumn Festival Evening Party

33
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,040
and we'd like to invite you to come.

34
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,160
With you guys here,
the kids will be over the moon.

35
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,320
It's just that I'm handling
some urgent matters

36
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,040
arising from Shenghai's recent project.

37
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,160
I'm not sure if I could come.

38
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,400
But Xiaomeng will attend for sure.

39
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,240
Work is important.

40
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,800
But, Yan, if you have time to come,

41
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,400
please let me know in advance.

42
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,760
Sure. We'll speak soon.

43
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,640
Come in.

44
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,520
Did I interrupt you?

45
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,160
No, it's fine.

46
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,800
Regarding the Luofeng
Commercial Sports Center project,

47
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,480
has Lingtian Group been affected?

48
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,560
I'm not sure about the details

49
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,720
but the Finance Department told me,
according to the agreement,

50
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,800
Lingtian Group should've deposited
the second round of financing

51
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,080
into our company's bank account
two days ago.

52
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,120
But the deposit hasn't arrived yet,
as we speak.

53
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,240
Have we confirmed with them?

54
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,560
The Financial Department
of Lingtian Group claimed

55
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,040
they hadn't received
the notice of fund transfer.

56
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,600
I've been contacting them.

57
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,680
But their phone number is unreachable.

58
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,160
Hello?

59
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,360
The number you're calling
is switched off right now.

60
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,440
Please call again later.

61
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,920
Is it possible

62
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,960
they've changed their mind
after watching the news?

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,800
No way.

64
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,160
They work with us

65
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,400
because they support
Shenghai and my father,

66
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,480
not because of commercial profit.

67
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,600
Hello, Uncle Ling?

68
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,640
You are...

69
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,680
What?

70
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,960
Which hospital?

71
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,080
All right, I'll be there shortly.

72
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
What happened?

73
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,280
Something wrong happened.

74
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,120
Ling Feng was taken to the hospital.

75
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,960
Hospital?

76
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,360
It's a nice day today.

77
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,200
Yes.

78
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,960
I remember the last time
we came to the college

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,480
was before graduation.

80
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,760
Yes, at that time,
we were at the college every day.

81
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,280
You, Zitong and I

82
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,400
were like the three musketeers,

83
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,720
going to classes,
eating and drinking together.

84
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,400
Those were happy days.

85
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,560
Right, Xiaomeng,

86
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,160
you have worked with Zitong
in a Shenghai commercial.

87
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,760
When will it come out?

88
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,120
I will definitely be glued to the TV
and support you girls.

89
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,200
It's still in the process
of post-production.

90
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,040
I will let you know when it comes out.

91
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,960
Are you Zhou Xiaomeng?

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,080
Can we have your autograph?

93
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,600
Sure.

94
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,120
Thank you.

95
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,080
Xiaomeng, you're a celebrity now.

96
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,600
Stop it, let's go.

97
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,480
Let's go.

98
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,720
See, it's Zhou Xiaomeng!

99
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,840
-It's Zhou Xiaomeng!
-Yes.

100
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,040
It's Zhou Xiaomeng!
She looks more beautiful in person.

101
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,160
Xiaomeng.

102
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,160
-Let's go.
-Okay.

103
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,720
Professor.

104
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,200
-Professor.
-Xiaomeng? Yang Xi?

105
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,120
What brings you here?

106
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,360
Today we've come here to visit you.

107
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,960
Xiaomeng asked me a few times before.

108
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,360
We both have time today, so here we are.

109
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,360
You are so kind.

110
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,240
I'm really happy to see you.

111
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,160
Professor, I should be the one
to say thank you.

112
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,920
In the midst of busy schedule,

113
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,120
it's good of you to spare the time
to watch our children's play.

114
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,440
Speaking of the children's play,

115
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,080
it was an unprecedented success.

116
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,880
I learnt a lot from it.

117
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,320
Professor, that's very flattering.

118
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,800
Xiaomeng, actually...

119
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,040
I've been wanting to apologize.

120
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,000
Apologize?

121
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,400
On graduation day,

122
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,680
the college didn't allow you

123
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,560
to take graduation photos
with your classmates.

124
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,000
I was more or less responsible for that.

125
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,080
Professor, I don't blame you.

126
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,080
Because I believe the college

127
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,080
was considering
the bigger picture of things.

128
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,560
Xiaomeng, thank you
for your understanding.

129
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,040
The past has passed.

130
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,040
Let's just look past those unhappy things.

131
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,360
Xiaomeng,

132
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,240
you've become Nanyue's celebrity.

133
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,200
-Not really.
-The whole college is proud of you.

134
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,280
Of course.

135
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,280
Just as we stepped into the campus,
a lot of students came over

136
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,640
and asked for Xiaomeng's autograph.

137
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,520
Yang Xi.

138
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,640
That's good.

139
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,600
Life moves on.

140
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,480
I believe your hard work
will lead to a bright future.

141
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,440
I'm very happy that
you've come to see me today.

142
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,360
Let me treat you to dinner.

143
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,960
How does that sound?

144
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,000
Right, Zitong is also here.

145
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,000
We'll get her to join us.

146
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,400
Zitong has also come here?

147
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,880
What is she doing here?

148
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,960
She's been here a few times.

149
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,440
Every time she's here,

150
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,720
she goes to the library.

151
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,920
It's rare to see a graduate
joining the society

152
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,680
and still keeping the love of reading.

153
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,520
That's nice.

154
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,440
Professor, I'm sorry.

155
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,360
I've got prior arrangement for tonight.

156
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,440
How about I invite all the classmates
to dine with you?

157
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,400
That's so nice of you.

158
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,080
You've really got something to do?

159
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,400
Yes, that's true.

160
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,560
All right, while you're here,

161
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,240
let's come to my office and have some tea.

162
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,360
It sounds great. Let's go.

163
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,280
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

164
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,760
-How are you doing lately?
-I'm doing good.

165
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,840
The library still looks the same.

166
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,120
I missed it so much.

167
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,960
Yes.

168
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,800
I wish I could be a college student again.

169
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,640
Xiaomeng, Zitong is over there.

170
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,560
Let's go.

171
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,760
(The things that Zhou Xiaomeng did
in the Production Crew)

172
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,120
(Besides Zhou Yanzhao and Jiang Ze
that everybody knows)

173
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,560
(She had a one-night stand
with a director and a cameraman)

174
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,320
Zitong!

175
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,360
Zitong, you're despicable!

176
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,560
-How dare you--
-Shut up!

177
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,120
This is a library.

178
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,200
We'll talk outside.

179
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,320
Zitong, I can't believe

180
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,960
you're the one
who's been smearing Xiaomeng

181
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,800
on the Internet.

182
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,840
Aren't we good friends?

183
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,040
Why did you do that?

184
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,800
Why did you smear Xiaomeng?

185
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,960
It has nothing to do with you.

186
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,880
Stop meddling.

187
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,520
I know you hate me so much right now.

188
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,400
Zitong,

189
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,880
I've always regarded you
as my best friend.

190
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,920
What have I done wrong to deserve this?

191
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,760
Do you know...

192
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,400
that's exactly what I hate you most?

193
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,960
You always act like you're innocent.

194
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,280
Which part of me is not better than yours?

195
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,360
But everyone just loves you,
and cares about you.

196
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,360
In their eyes,

197
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,240
I'm always nothing compared to you.

198
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,480
-I...
-As long as you're here,

199
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,520
I can never be the best.

200
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,880
Yes, that's right.

201
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,280
I'm jealous of you.

202
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,120
But do you know why?

203
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,720
Because you don't have to do anything,
yet you can effortlessly win their love.

204
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,400
So that's why...

205
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,400
you locked me out of the hotel room
in the middle of the night?

206
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,760
It looks like you knew all along
I feigned my sickness

207
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,080
But you still acted like
you were my best friend.

208
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,240
Zhou Xiaomeng,

209
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,560
you are such a hypocrite.

210
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,240
I never act anything in front of you.

211
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,840
I just don't want to,

212
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,880
nor am I willing to believe
that you'd do something to hurt me.

213
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,600
Can you stop pulling
a display of innocence, please?

214
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,440
It works on Zhou Yanzhao, Jiang Ze
and everyone in the world,

215
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,480
but not on me.

216
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,720
Zitong,

217
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,720
-you--
-Shut up!

218
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,320
Stop talking.

219
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,080
Zitong, have you lost your mind?

220
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,080
No matter what, you can't do this.

221
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,960
We were best friends
in our four years in the college.

222
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,720
Friends?

223
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,000
We will never be friends again.

224
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,080
Remember, Zhou Xiaomeng,

225
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,800
I will prove to you

226
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,080
that I'm better than you.

227
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,720
Zitong!

228
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,280
Xiaomeng,

229
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,320
Dad, it's Chairman Zhou.

230
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,240
Uncle Ling, are you feeling better?

231
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,720
Yes, I'm fine.

232
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,040
Luckily, I was taken
to the hospital in time.

233
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,760
I'm feeling much better now.

234
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,720
So this is Chairman Zhou from Shenghai.

235
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,640
Yan, let me introduce them to you.

236
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,200
They are the seniors of Lingtian Group.

237
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,240
They were also your father's good friends.

238
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,000
You may call them
Uncle Zhao and Uncle Liu.

239
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,360
The one who called you earlier

240
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,280
was my daughter, Yuchen.

241
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,360
She's just taken over Lingtian.

242
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,160
They have been helping us
in so many aspects.

243
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,720
Uncle Zhao, Uncle Liu and Chairman Ling.

244
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,800
You can just call me Yan.

245
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,040
I've heard so much about you.

246
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,480
Chairman Zhou
surely is a fine-looking man.

247
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,400
You have the demeanor of your father.

248
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,000
Yan,

249
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,640
I know what you've come to ask.

250
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,280
I'm very sorry about it.

251
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,120
Uncle Ling,

252
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,240
I know.

253
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,840
You should take care.

254
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,320
Your health is more important.

255
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,080
We'll talk about other things someday.

256
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,400
Yan,

257
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,120
you should persuade him to take it easy.

258
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,320
We tried to urge him before.

259
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,000
Chairman Ling is getting old.

260
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,640
He should delegate some of the tasks
to the subordinates.

261
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,560
You see?

262
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,560
Yan,

263
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,360
I'm not just talking about

264
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,720
one or two rounds of financing.

265
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,360
Lingtian is facing a big crisis.

266
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,320
We can't quite continue
with some of the projects.

267
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,440
As for the Luofeng Commercial
Sports Center project,

268
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,640
our board has discussed

269
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,440
and decided

270
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,760
to withdraw all the funds.

271
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,960
Uncle Ling...

272
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,040
If it's about the issues of the project,
I think Shenghai is able to help you.

273
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,640
But now this--

274
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,400
Yan, I heard that

275
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,920
due to a news report earlier,

276
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,480
Shenghai's project of the Luofeng
Commercial Sports Center

277
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,880
has been forced to postpone.

278
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,640
Something like this

279
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,400
must have put Shenghai
in a dire predicament, right?

280
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,440
In fact, a while back,

281
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,800
Chairman Ling intended
to work with Shenghai Group.

282
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,040
There was already opposition
among the board members.

283
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,120
And yet, Chairman Ling
still insisted upon it.

284
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,000
Now you see,

285
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,200
Lingtian Group can hardly save itself.

286
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,880
That's enough.

287
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,600
Stop talking about that.

288
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
Yan,

289
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,040
I have been in the business all my life,

290
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,960
and have gone through a lot.

291
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,520
I know the news that they talked about

292
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,400
is not...

293
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,360
the problem of Shenghai.

294
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,800
Those gossips won't change
my opinion about you

295
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,520
and Shenghai.

296
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,400
What's happened is Lingtian's own issues.

297
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,880
All I can say is,

298
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,840
I have failed you,

299
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,320
as well as your late father.

300
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,800
Uncle Ling, you should have some rest.

301
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,760
I'll come visit you again.

302
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,800
Uncle Zhao and Uncle Liu,
I have to be excused now.

303
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,800
Yan,

304
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,360
business is like war.

305
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,040
Never trust anyone blindly.

306
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,120
Chairman Zhou, do you have time today?

307
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,760
I want to talk to you about something
in private.

308
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,960
I also want to ask you something
about Uncle Ling.

309
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,280
It's not convenient to talk here.
How about we go somewhere else?

310
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,160
Please.

311
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,400
Chairman Zhou, my father
has often talked to me about you.

312
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,880
He's said that you're young and capable.

313
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,480
Not long after taking over Shenghai Group,
you have great achievements.

314
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,560
You are a business genius.

315
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,400
I've just taken the reins
of Lingtian Group.

316
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,680
There are a lot of things
I have to learn from you.

317
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,680
Chairman Ling, that's very flattering.

318
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,160
Uncle Ling and my father
were friends for years.

319
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,240
You can just call me Yan,

320
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,800
and please forgive my audacity
to call you Sister Ling.

321
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,080
No problem.

322
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,400
Earlier in the ward, you could tell

323
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,920
my father couldn't say much
in front of the outsiders.

324
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,160
Yes.

325
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,400
Uncle Ling told me
not to trust anyone blindly.

326
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,400
The two guys in the ward
appeared outwardly caring about him,

327
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,400
but on the inside,
they were plotting something.

328
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,000
I believe Uncle Ling can tell too.

329
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,880
Until now, I have no idea
there's been a lot of controversy

330
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,040
over the cooperation
between Shenghai and Lingtian.

331
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,000
My father has singlehandedly
founded Lingtian Group.

332
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,040
It's his pride and joy
that he's spent his whole life to build.

333
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,920
But as he's getting older,
he's now a shadow of his former self.

334
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,800
These years,

335
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,600
I've been helping him out
with the company.

336
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,880
However,

337
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,320
there's only one Chairman Ling
in Lingtian Group.

338
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,080
I can tell over the past few years

339
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,320
some of the seniors in the company
have got other ideas

340
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,760
in view of my father's health.

341
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,280
Apart from you,

342
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,640
can no one else help Uncle Ling?

343
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,360
You know what he is like.

344
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,280
My father is obstinate
in doing things his own way.

345
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,960
The bigger Lingtian Group has grown,

346
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,040
the less people around him he can trust.

347
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,280
My younger brother has taken over
a tech company under Lingtian Group.

348
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,520
I think my father once intended
to train him to be his successor.

349
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,720
But he was spoiled as a kid growing up.

350
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,920
All he cares is having fun.

351
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,240
So,

352
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,360
my father once
had very high hopes for him.

353
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,800
This time, he's fallen ill,

354
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,400
he can only rely on his daughter.

355
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,880
I can understand that.

356
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,400
Wealth and a doting family

357
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,280
will make someone lose
their desire for success.

358
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,400
I guess Uncle Ling's sickness

359
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,800
could be a wake-up call to your brother.

360
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,440
It can at least let him know

361
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,640
what he should do
to safeguard his father's legacy.

362
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,920
Yan, the reason why
I wanted to talk to you privately today

363
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,960
is that I can tell my dad trusts
and admires you very much.

364
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,120
So there is something I can only tell you.

365
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,880
Please do tell.

366
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,800
My father and I both think

367
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,880
the crisis that Lingtian is facing
is the result of the collusion

368
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,040
between the people inside
and other companies.

369
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,760
That's why we've ended up
in this predicament.

370
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,480
And we think the main problem

371
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,280
is actually my brother.

372
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,000
Your brother?

373
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,080
But isn't he your family member?

374
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,160
Do you have any ground for saying this?

375
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,080
My brother wasn't really interested
in our company's investments.

376
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,560
But this time, he came up
with a few investment projects

377
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,800
and sought a large amount
of project funds from Lingtian Group.

378
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,560
My father and the board
discussed this in a meeting.

379
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,560
After the discussion,
some of the board members

380
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,640
unexpectedly supported my brother
and approved funding for him.

381
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,400
But then, a lot of issues suddenly
arose from those projects,

382
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,960
resulting in a huge budget deficit
for the company.

383
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,720
These incidents happened so suddenly.

384
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,680
My father was overwhelmed and fell ill.

385
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,120
Luckily, his condition is now stable.

386
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,560
So now, Lingtian Group has no choice

387
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,960
but to withdraw
some of the investment projects

388
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,560
so as to keep the business running.

389
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,000
And those include Shenghai's projects.

390
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,520
We really have no other option.

391
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,760
Sister Ling, I understand the decision
that you and Uncle Ling have made.

392
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,280
Knowing what happened inside Lingtian,

393
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,880
I'm more convinced that Shenghai's crisis

394
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,160
doesn't come only from the outside,

395
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,320
but also from the inside.

396
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,000
Therefore, I think
what you just said about my brother

397
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,560
suits our situation more.

398
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,360
No matter what, we must learn to safeguard
our fathers' precious legacies.

399
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,360
Please come in.

400
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,000
Director,

401
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,120
I've finished writing the invitation
letters for Xiaomeng and Chairman Zhou.

402
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,280
That's fast.

403
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,560
Please see if there's anything to change.

404
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,000
Sure, I'll have a look.

405
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,000
It's quite nice.

406
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,920
Thank you.

407
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,880
All right.

408
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,440
Leave the letters to me.

409
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,720
It's late. You should get off now.

410
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,600
You haven't got off yet.

411
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,880
How can I be so audacious
to leave earlier?

412
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,440
All right, I've taken up
too much of your time today.

413
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,480
Get off now.

414
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,200
Well then, I'm going now.

415
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,080
You should rest soon, too.

416
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,280
-Don't tire yourself out.
-All right.

417
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,200
-See you tomorrow.
-See you, Director

418
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,280
Who are you looking for?

419
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,080
Hey, who are you looking for?
What are you doing here?

420
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,800
I... I was just looking around.

421
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,840
I'm sorry.

422
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,680
What are you looking at?

423
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,880
The way you're sneaking around,

424
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,960
I can tell there's
something wrong with you.

425
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,920
Young lady, watch your mouth.

426
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,080
Who's sneaking around?

427
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,040
I'm looking for Chairman Zhou
and Xiaomeng.

428
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,640
You're looking for Chairman Zhou
and Xiaomeng?

429
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,360
Why didn't you say that earlier?

430
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,680
Xiaomeng and Chairman Zhou
haven't come back yet.

431
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,120
May I ask who you are?

432
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,960
Hello, I'm Lin,

433
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,520
the Director of the city's
Children Welfare Center.

434
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:42,960
It's about this.

435
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,320
Xiaomeng and Chairman Zhou

436
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,720
have been great supporters
of our welfare center.

437
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,680
The Mid-Autumn Festival is near.

438
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,640
The children are going to
give a few performances

439
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,320
at a Mid-Autumn Festival evening party.

440
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,520
So I've come to deliver
the invitation letters.

441
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,800
Since they're not home yet,
I'll come by next time.

442
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,800
Sorry for bothering you.

443
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,640
Wait!

444
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,400
Please come inside to wait.

445
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,720
Xiaomeng will be back in a while.

446
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,360
Let's take a seat inside
and wait for her, all right?

447
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,480
Director Lin,

448
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,120
have I seen you somewhere?

449
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,560
Are you Xiaomeng's mother?

450
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,840
I don't think we've met before.

451
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,760
The kids are not home yet.

452
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,960
How about I come visit you next time?

453
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,040
That's all right. We can just come inside
and wait for them.

454
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,080
-Never mind.
-It's all right. Come on.

455
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,080
-Let's come in.
-It's not appropriate.

456
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:30,920
-You don't have to do that.
-It's all right.

457
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,760
-It's fine.
-It's not very appropriate.

458
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,640
-No worries.
-Director Lin.

459
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,480
Let's come inside.

460
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,480
You don't have to worry.

461
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,000
Ms. Ye...

462
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,240
is mentally unstable.

463
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,440
How about you listen to her
and come inside?

464
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,600
What do you mean?

465
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,880
What do you mean mentally unstable?

466
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,320
You are the one who's mentally unstable.

467
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,960
I tell you, I have a clear state of mind.

468
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,080
Don't listen to her nonsense.

469
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,320
I...

470
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,600
I'm just...

471
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,280
I just can't remember...

472
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,440
certain things.

473
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,520
But you...

474
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,600
You... I...

475
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,840
I really think I have seen you somewhere.

476
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,560
Ms. Ye, we surely have never met before.

477
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,440
It's not convenient for me to visit today.

478
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,520
How about I come visit you
when I have time some day?

479
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,880
I'm sure I've met you before.

480
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,200
-I remember it.
-No...

481
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,960
Let's come inside and sit down.

482
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,880
-It's all right.
-Director Lin.

483
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,520
-Just for a while.
-Let's wait inside.

484
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,040
For the sake of Aunt Ye,
just listen to her please.

485
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,320
Let's come inside and sit down.

486
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,760
Go open the gate. Quickly.

487
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,560
-How about this? Let's come inside.
-Ms. Ye,

488
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,760
I'm just going to sit for a little while.

489
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,880
If the kids still haven't come back,

490
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,760
-I shall leave.
-All right...

491
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,640
I'll come next time, okay?

492
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,520
-Come in, please.
-Please come in.

493
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,400
Watch your step.

494
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,760
-Slowly.
-No worries. Come in.

495
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,960
Director Lin, please come in.

496
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,000
Welcome to our house.

497
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,840
Please come in.

498
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,160
Here.

499
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,480
Take a seat. Make yourself at home.

500
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,320
You too.

501
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,280
All right...

502
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,960
What a coincidence!
I bumped into you again.

503
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,320
Your earrings are beautiful.

504
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,960
Sorry for the mess, Director Lin.

505
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,880
Before I took Aunt Ye out,
she was looking at the pictures.

506
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,120
Xiaomeng said showing Aunt Ye old pictures

507
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,680
can help recover her memory.

508
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,120
I didn't expect we'd have guest today.

509
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,200
It's such a mess.

510
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,240
I'll tidy it up now.

511
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,800
It's not necessary, Xiaoyu!

512
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,000
Director Lin is a friend of Xiaomeng's.

513
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,120
She is also...

514
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,600
Right, Director Lin,

515
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,080
you know Yan, right?

516
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,040
Have we met before then?

517
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,160
Well, I don't think so.

518
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,720
Otherwise, why wouldn't I
remember any of it?

519
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,440
Never mind.

520
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,160
Right, let's look at the photos.

521
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,200
I tell you,

522
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,680
these are all childhood photos
of Xiaomeng and Yan.

523
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,760
They are all grown up.

524
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,720
Look, this is Xiaomeng.

525
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,800
She loves smiling.

526
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,960
A smug grin.

527
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,680
This is when she went to the kindergarten.

528
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,320
She was losing baby teeth then.
She didn't want to look ugly

529
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,640
so she covered her mouth when she smiled.

530
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,640
What an adorable girl!

531
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,400
Right, this is Yan in his childhood.

532
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,400
You see, when he was little,
he was very naughty.

533
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,840
He always got punished for that.

534
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,960
Look, he's grown into a handsome man.

535
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,240
This picture was taken
when he participated in a competition

536
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,560
and won a gold medal.

537
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,080
He was brilliant.

538
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,600
And look at this.

539
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,120
Director Lin?

540
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,120
Xiaomeng is back.

541
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,640
Miss Xiaomeng, you're back.

542
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,960
Mom.

543
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Director Lin,

544
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,280
what brings you here?

545
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,200
I bumped into your mother

546
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,280
outside your house.

547
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,000
She was very welcoming
and dragged me inside.

548
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,760
Xiaomeng, I've got this feeling

549
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,120
Director Lin looks familiar.

550
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,800
Have I...

551
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,120
met her somewhere before?

552
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,720
Mom,

553
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,480
it's not possible that
you've met her before.

554
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,640
But I've got this feeling...

555
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,760
she looks so familiar to me.

556
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,000
Mom, you must have seen her on TV.

557
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,080
She is the Director of the city's
Children Welfare Center.

558
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,320
She was on the news, remember?

559
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,600
You must have mistaken.

560
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,880
I guess so.

561
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,720
Mom, it's almost dinnertime.

562
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,040
It's time to eat.

563
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,520
I'll ask Xiaoyu
to take you to the dining room.

564
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,520
Xiaoyu!

565
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,440
Xiaoyu!

566
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,480
Take my mom to the dining room.

567
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,320
Sure.

568
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,320
Aunt Ye, let's go to the dining room.

569
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,200
Director Lin, please join us for dinner.

570
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,320
No, thanks. I still have something to do.

571
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,320
I'd better get going.
I'll join you next time.

572
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,280
Xiaomeng, please see Director Lin off.

573
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,880
All right, I'll see her off.

574
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,880
You eat first. I'll catch you up later.

575
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,240
Mind your step.

576
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,000
Aunt Lin, my mom...

577
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,720
why did my mom say she knew you?

578
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,880
I find it strange too.

579
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,000
As far as I know,

580
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,800
your mom and I have never met before.

581
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,760
Do you think your mom knows about
the things between Yan and me?

582
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,160
Anyway, since my mom regained conscious,

583
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,000
she's been experiencing confusion.

584
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,600
We don't know a lot of things.

585
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,280
About this,

586
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,640
probably...

587
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,680
What?

588
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,800
No one can know about this.

589
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,320
It does Yan no favors.

590
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,440
Aunt Lin, don't worry.

591
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,280
Yan and I will be careful.

592
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,480
Right, what has brought you to see me?

593
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,800
I almost forgot.

594
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,400
The Mid-Autumn Festival is coming, right?

595
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,920
The children in the welfare center
are giving a few performances

596
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,440
for you guys to watch.

597
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,080
We have a small evening party on that day.

598
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,400
So today,

599
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,720
I've come here to give you
the invitation letters.

600
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,840
The Mid-Autumn Festival Evening Party?

601
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,200
Are you saying...

602
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,680
you're inviting Yan too?

603
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,000
The children like you guys very much.

604
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,360
I also want to see you both.

605
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,880
Yan.

606
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,280
How about we take a seat over there?

607
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,800
Sure.

608
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:50,920
Yan,

609
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,400
Aunt Lin would like to invite us

610
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,000
to the Mid-Autumn Festival Evening Party
at the Welfare Center.

611
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,320
Aunt Lin,

612
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,280
I have some urgent matters
in the company to attend to.

613
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,440
So on that day,

614
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,840
I'm not sure if I could make it.

615
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,640
But,

616
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,400
if possible at all on that day,

617
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,640
I'll keep my schedule clear.

618
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,480
Don't you worry.

619
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,520
All right.

620
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,400
Lin Yueling,

621
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,320
she has been very close
to the Zhou family recently.

622
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,240
Xiaoyu called to say

623
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,720
that Lin Yueling
was very uneasy at the Zhou's.

624
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,800
First, she was sneaking outside the house,
hesitating to go in.

625
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,560
Then, when she saw the childhood photos
of Zhou Yanzhao,

626
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,320
she got emotional and even cried.

627
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,480
Furthermore,

628
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,600
And, Ye Sirong kept saying
she had met Lin Yueling before.

629
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,840
That's interesting.

630
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,040
Did she meet Zhou Yanzhao?

631
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,640
When Xiaomeng showed her way out,

632
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,920
Zhou Yanzhao just got back.

633
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,440
What did they talk about?

634
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,960
Xiaoyu didn't overhear any of that.

635
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,360
If what Xiaoyu said is true

636
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,720
and from her description,

637
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,880
there must be a connection
between Lin Yueling with the Zhou family,

638
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,680
or at least with Zhou Yanzhao.

639
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,600
Boss, I think so too.

640
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,840
Go dig up everything about Lin Yueling,

641
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,960
including her past
and every bit of her life.

642
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,720
I'll get Xiaoyu
to keep an close eye on them.

643
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,000
If she's got something,
I'll report to you immediately.

644
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,800
Go work on it.

645
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,640
Chairman Zhou, I've got some news.

646
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,200
Lingtian Group has been shut down

647
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,440
due to a huge budget deficit
in the company.

648
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,720
Possibly, it will be acquired
by another company.

649
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,360
Is the news reliable?

650
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,560
It's said that people in Lingtian Group
are all panicking.

651
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,680
Probably there's no turning back.

652
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,360
I've got it. You may get back to work.

653
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,120
Hello, Sister Ling?

654
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:26,960
It's me.

655
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,360
Standing on top of the highest peak,
the other mountains look small.

656
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,880
This is my father's favorite poem.

657
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,040
He hopes that Lingtian Group

658
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,000
could be like Mount Tai one day,

659
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,240
standing tall and firm,

660
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,400
(Shigandang)
overlooking other mountains.

661
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,560
Over the past few years,

662
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,840
Uncle Ling has done just that.

663
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,880
But only for a period of time.

664
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,880
Now this has become history.

665
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,320
Is there nothing we can do?

666
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,160
You can never defend against a thief
in your own family.

667
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,600
If the root of a tree is dead,

668
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,240
no matter how thick and strong
the trunk is,

669
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,880
how luxuriant the growth of leaves is,

670
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,720
the tree can never escape death.

671
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,800
You mean...

672
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,760
My brother...

673
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,560
Whether he deliberately did it,
or was being used,

674
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,800
he has brought irreversible damage
to Lingtian Group.

675
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,080
We can't do anything about it.

676
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,080
As I see it now,

677
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,680
his so-called
high yield investment projects

678
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,760
are nothing but scams.

679
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,000
Now Lingtian Group is just an empty shell.

680
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,040
Luckily, another company
is taking over Lingtian Group,

681
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,560
so my father won't have to
file for bankruptcy.

682
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,640
Do you think we should be sad or glad?

683
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,080
You mentioned before

684
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,640
there had been problems
in Lingtian long ago.

685
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,720
If they could use your brother,

686
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,480
the acquiring company
is probably part of their plan.

687
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,480
Chairman Zhou surely is a business genius.

688
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,760
If I were as smart as you are,

689
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,320
my father's company
wouldn't have got to this point.

690
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,240
But you have to be careful.

691
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,560
Someone smarter has been hovering
around you,

692
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,960
but he's more cunning than you.

693
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,320
He's the one who will take over Lingtian.

694
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,120
You mean...

695
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,120
It's someone from Shenghai?

696
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,880
I've checked.

697
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,480
The secret boss of the company
taking over Lingtian Group

698
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,480
is the Vice President of Shenghai,

699
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,360
Jiang Qingcheng.

700
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,760
So it's him.

701
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,400
It's his plan all along.

702
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:42,200
He has lured my brother along with
Lingtian Group into his trap.

703
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,040
He has only one goal,
that is to destroy Lingtian

704
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,160
and keep it to himself.

705
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,080
Now I know...

706
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,440
his ambition stretches far
more than Shenghai.

707
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,160
It's to kill two birds with one stone.

708
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,400
Destroying Lingtian

709
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,880
will break up the cooperation
between Shenghai and Lingtian.

710
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,000
The project I'm working on

711
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,400
will continue struggling
in a crisis of budget deficit.

712
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,080
I remember my father once told me

713
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:14,320
that he worked with your father
and Jiang Qingcheng in the past.

714
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,280
At that time he already knew

715
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,080
Jiang Qingcheng
was a crook with wicked mind,

716
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,240
so my father kept a distance from him.

717
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,440
He also reminded Uncle Zhou
to beware of Jiang Qingcheng.

718
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,200
I see.

719
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,720
Now that Jiang Qingcheng
is taking over Lingtian,

720
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,880
it's even more difficult to deal with him.

721
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,440
So you must be even more careful.

722
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,720
Once Jiang Qingcheng
puts his claws into Lingtian Group,

723
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,880
he will be able to act against Shenghai.

724
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,080
He's now targeting Shenghai.

725
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,800
Look, it's like what I'm doing.

726
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,080
Like this.

727
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,920
Kids, look who's here.

728
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,240
Hello, Miss Xiaomeng.

729
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,640
-Hello.
-Miss Xiaomeng!

730
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,120
Miss Xiaomeng, where's Brother Yan?

731
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,280
Brother Yan will be here in a minute.

732
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,160
Tiankong!

733
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,040
Brother Yan! Brother Yan!

734
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,240
-Kids! Come here.
-I'm so glad you come.

735
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,720
Presents! Presents!

736
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,680
We have presents!

737
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,720
I've brought you guys presents.

738
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,680
I want this!

739
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,720
Here. Everyone gets one.

740
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,600
-This is mine!
-I want this!

741
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,720
-This is mine!
-Give me that!

742
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,040
I was busy at work
and then I went to buy presents.

743
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,440
So I'm late. I'm sorry.

744
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,760
No worries.

745
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,840
Yan, I'm...

746
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,040
I'm very happy that you came.

747
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,560
I promised them to come
and buy them presents.

748
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,520
I hope they like them.

749
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,640
Look at them.
They couldn't be any happier.

750
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,000
So tonight,

751
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,720
they will express their gratitude to you
in their own ways.

752
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,280
Right, Aunt Lin,

753
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,760
is the performance about to start?

754
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,960
It should have started long ago.

755
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,440
Go take a seat now.

756
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,240
Right, the children have designed
the performances on their own,

757
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,080
so it's quite simple.

758
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,000
I hope you don't mind.

759
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,480
Go grab a seat.

760
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,920
Kids,

761
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,120
our Mid-autumn Festival evening party
is going to start.

762
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,400
Here comes our first performance,

763
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,840
Three Little Bears.

764
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,280
Who are going to perform?

765
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,680
-Me!
-Me!

766
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,680
So many volunteers.

767
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,080
How about all of you go on stage
and perform together?

768
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,640
Yes!

769
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,920
Girls like you seem to find dolls
irresistible.

770
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,480
I like it only because it is a gift
from Tiankong.

771
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,600
He can't see very well.

772
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,080
He must have put a lot efforts into it.

773
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,200
If you have received it,

774
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,920
wouldn't you be touched and love it?

775
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,880
I'd be touched.

776
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,280
But the doll just doesn't look pretty.

777
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,760
You're so shallow.

778
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,360
So shallow is a synonym of honest.

779
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,200
You...

780
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,600
Don't you worry.

781
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,840
I will pass your honest comment
to Tiankong,

782
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,640
if you aren't worried that it'll hurt him.

783
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,600
Whatever you like.

784
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,440
You always say you don't care,

785
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,320
but deep down, you do care about
the children's feeling, right?

786
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,200
Who says that?

787
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,440
I've known you for years.

788
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:15,920
I know you too well.

789
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,200
You bottle up your feelings in your heart,

790
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,680
and you don't share them with anybody,

791
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,840
whether you like it or not,

792
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,720
whether you care or not.

793
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,040
I think if someone
genuinely understands me,

794
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,920
without me saying it,

795
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,360
she knows what or who I love.
