00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,720
(Episode 20)

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,520
(Nanyue Children Welfare Center)

3
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,280
-Xiaomeng.
-Director Lin, what happened?

4
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,160
Tiankong had undergone
an eye re-examination earlier, right?

5
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,400
As you know, one of his eyes
is affected with amblyopia.

6
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,080
That eye suffers from lesion now.

7
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,840
If he doesn't receive treatment,
he might even be blind soon.

8
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,040
Surely I have to bring him in
for treatment.

9
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,240
As soon as I've told him, he's got worried
and become very depressed.

10
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,520
Right now he wouldn't listen to anybody.

11
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,640
I have no choice but to call you here.

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,640
Director Lin, don't worry.

13
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,080
Let me talk to him first.

14
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,320
Sure. Let's go.

15
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,960
It's been a whole day.

16
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,640
He wouldn't eat or drink.

17
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,160
He just sits there quietly.

18
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,600
He's been making a fuss with everybody.

19
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,920
No matter what we said,
he just wouldn't go to the hospital.

20
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,920
When I was a kid,

21
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,320
I would bring a small stool
and sit in the yard.

22
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,600
I would look at the clouds,
the flowers and the sky,

23
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,400
looking for the flying birds.

24
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,520
Miss Xiaomeng...

25
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,280
I thought you wouldn't visit me anymore.

26
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,720
It's been such a long time
since you last came.

27
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,200
Where have you been?

28
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,800
Tiankong, be good.

29
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,440
I've been very busy recently.

30
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,120
That's why I haven't been able
to visit you.

31
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,320
See, I've come as soon as I can.

32
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,120
Tell me, Tiankong.

33
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,160
Can you see me?

34
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,600
I can't see clearly but I know it's you.

35
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,640
I've thought of many interesting images

36
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,840
to draw with you.

37
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,840
Tiankong, let me take you to the hospital
for your eye treatment, okay?

38
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,800
After that, we can draw together.

39
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,680
You can teach me how to draw too.

40
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,080
I don't want to go to the hospital.

41
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,600
I don't want any more examination.

42
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,680
It's so scary, I don't want to go there.

43
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,720
-All right. Don't be scared.
-I don't want to go.

44
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,840
Tiankong, listen to me.

45
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,320
If you don't go to the hospital
for treatment,

46
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,120
you won't be able to draw again.

47
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,160
But if your eye is cured,

48
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,000
not only can you see me,
but also keep drawing.

49
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,480
Doesn't it sound great?

50
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,080
(Shenghai Hospital)

51
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,920
-Come in here, Tiankong.
-Go ahead.

52
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,200
Miss Zhou, let's start now.

53
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,640
-All right.
-I don't want to...

54
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,960
Tiankong, listen to me.

55
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,680
Actually,
the check-up is not scary at all.

56
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,840
I will always be by your side.

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,200
Tiankong is very brave, right?

58
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,880
Come here, little guy. Put your chin here.

59
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,680
Let's start.

60
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,200
Listen to me, it will be over soon.

61
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,440
Don't be nervous.

62
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,600
It's done, little guy.

63
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,040
Miss Zhou.

64
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
Let's chat outside.

65
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,560
It's okay, you can just say it here.

66
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,160
Tiankong's vision
has been gradually declining.

67
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,800
Now he can't distinguish colors.

68
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,640
Very soon,
everything will look blurry to him

69
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,080
At the moment,
I need to do further examination.

70
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,000
Miss Xiaomeng, I want to go back.

71
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,160
When can we go back?

72
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,480
Tiankong, Ms. Qin will take you
to the examination later.

73
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,560
I'll be waiting for you outside, okay?

74
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,000
Okay.

75
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,840
Tiankong, it's okay.
Let's take the examination.

76
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,360
-Thank you, doctor.
-Let's go.

77
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,920
It's all right.

78
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,360
-All right.
-Walk slowly.

79
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,040
Director Lin,...

80
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,160
how did you find out about
the problems with Tiankong's eyes?

81
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,600
Speaking of this,
I really want to thank Yan.

82
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,680
He has asked the medical staff
in the hospital

83
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,920
to give the children at the welfare center
consultation every week.

84
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,360
He has also set up
a specialized pediatric station.

85
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,200
It's because of the recent check-up

86
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,160
that we knew about the problem
with Tiankong's eyes.

87
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,040
Tiankong is a very sensitive child.

88
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,320
He must have known
that his eyes have problem.

89
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,160
That's why he is so scared.

90
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,440
He is too stubborn.

91
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,760
He only listens to you.

92
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,280
That's why I really need
your help this time.

93
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,200
I can't do anything.

94
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,560
But as long as I can help Tiankong,
I will do my best.

95
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,720
Let's sit down.
I want to show you something.

96
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,560
Okay.

97
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,720
Surprised?
These are all painted by Tiankong.

98
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,000
Look at this.

99
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,000
This is a fairy tale you've told before,
do you still remember?

100
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,240
-Yes.
-He just draws it out.

101
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,120
Turn a few more pages.

102
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,160
He is really smart.

103
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,760
These are all from his imagination.

104
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,200
He says they're all beautiful images.

105
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,960
That's why he wants
to record them one by one.

106
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,640
I can see that Tiankong
is very talented in painting.

107
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,120
These paintings are very vivid,
and full of imagination.

108
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,240
I think,...

109
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,280
were it not for his eye condition,

110
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,400
he surely would have become a painter
in the future.

111
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,560
Actually, I've realized long ago
he's very talented in drawing.

112
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,880
I've been telling the teachers
in the Welfare Center

113
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,600
to nurture him and focus on his talent.

114
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,840
But unfortunately,

115
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,960
now his eye condition is getting worst.

116
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,320
I don't know if it is treatable.

117
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,880
Director Lin, don't worry.

118
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,920
After I go back, I'll discuss with Yan.

119
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,880
We both will try our best to help him.

120
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,080
Thank you.

121
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,160
Tiankong is lucky
to have a sister like you.

122
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,080
Speaking of Yan,...

123
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,080
how is he recently?

124
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,880
I haven't seen him for a while.

125
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,600
He is doing fine.

126
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,120
Thank you for your concern.

127
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,360
Right, Director Lin,

128
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,080
there's one more thing.

129
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,720
I think this hospital is too far away
from the Welfare Center.

130
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,840
Every time you come here,
you have to walk very far.

131
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,480
It's got me thinking.

132
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:13,080
Can you arrange a place nearby
so that Tiankong can stay there?

133
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,520
I've thought of this.

134
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,160
My home is closest to the hospital.

135
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,480
Starting tomorrow,
Tiankong can stay at my home, okay?

136
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,960
That's really great.
You're more thoughtful.

137
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,640
-Then I will pick you up tomorrow.
-Okay.

138
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,560
Let's look at a few more.

139
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,920
Turn a few more pages.

140
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,080
There are a few really
beautiful drawings at the back.

141
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,560
-Look here.
-This puppy is so interesting.

142
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,560
Oh my gosh, Dr. Ye!

143
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,920
Stop walking! Don't move.

144
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,600
It's really dangerous!

145
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,760
-Dr. Ye, please come down.
-Sister Hua.

146
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,160
Please Stop!

147
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,280
If something happens to you,
how am I going to tell Yan and Xiaomeng?

148
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,360
Finally, somebody is here.

149
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,160
I just went to the toilet
and she climbed outside the railing.

150
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,760
-She said she wanted to run away.
-Aunt Ye.

151
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,600
Yan, let's go.

152
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,120
Let's go...

153
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,560
Aunt Ye, where are you going?

154
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,840
Xiaomeng!

155
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,160
-Mom!
-Xiaomeng!

156
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,080
Yan, stop!

157
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,200
-Run!
-Aunt Ye, don't move!

158
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,640
-Run!
-Aunt Ye!

159
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,360
-Xiaomeng!
-Mom!

160
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,360
Hold on to your mom! Here!

161
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,280
Mom.

162
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,120
Are you okay?

163
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,960
Yan, don't be afraid.

164
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,480
Aunt Ye is here.

165
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,760
I'll protect you.

166
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,360
I won't let your dad beat you again.

167
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,200
Yan, you're a good boy.

168
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,320
Xiaomeng, pull your mother away.

169
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,560
Mom,...

170
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,480
it's okay now.

171
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,520
Based on the report,
Aunt Ye's condition is getting better.

172
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,680
But according to
your description just now,...

173
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,000
all the memories she has now
are fragments.

174
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,640
In other words,...

175
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,720
she still can't recall the whole incident.

176
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,240
It seems to be the case right now.

177
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,560
She has improved quite a lot.

178
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,960
This is impressive.

179
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,560
Due to the patient's lengthy coma,...

180
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,240
her cranial nerves have suffered
degeneration to variant degrees.

181
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,160
So her current memories
are just some emotional fragments.

182
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,880
These are the emotions
deeply imprinted in her brain.

183
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,280
But what actually happened at that time

184
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,360
is absolutely confusing to her right now.

185
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,520
Can she live on like that?

186
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,600
Do you have any better treatment
to deal with this situation?

187
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,080
I don't want my mom...

188
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,840
to be continually misunderstood.

189
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,720
Xiaomeng, don't worry.

190
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,520
We will definitely try our best,

191
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,160
but I can't guarantee anything.

192
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,240
Because not everything

193
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,600
can be fully explained
by the technology of modern medicine.

194
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,160
I have read some related cases
in my own time.

195
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,520
Recovery of patients can't solely
depend on medical treatment.

196
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,040
Even more important is
the cooperation of family members.

197
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,960
What I'm trying to say is

198
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,960
you need to help her
recollect those fragments of memories.

199
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,360
Whether it is a feeling or an emotion,
it's the most important thing for her.

200
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,000
I understand, Dr. Xiao. Thank you.

201
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,960
Don't mention it.

202
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,640
Aunt Ye has given me
the opportunity to be a doctor.

203
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,360
I also hope that she will recover soon.

204
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,560
I have to do some examinations
for Aunt Ye.

205
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,640
Please leave and wait outside.

206
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,160
-Mom.
-Xiaomeng.

207
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,160
It's okay. Everything's fine.

208
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,120
Don't worry. Don't be afraid.

209
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,360
Aunt Ye, you don't have to be afraid.

210
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,880
-Bring her there.
-Aunt.

211
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,960
-Please sit here.
-Let's sit here.

212
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,440
It's okay. Come here.

213
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,920
Yan,...

214
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,040
what's on your mind?

215
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,400
I am just thinking,...

216
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,040
today she was comforting me
not to be afraid.

217
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,240
She said she wouldn't
let my dad beat me again.

218
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,640
She would protect me.

219
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,840
I did not expect that
in the memory of Ye Sirong,

220
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,720
there would be a part
she was trying to protect me.

221
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,960
What else did my mom say today?

222
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,600
She also said
she wanted to run away with you,

223
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,720
and asked me to come too.

224
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,280
Because of me, my mom agreed...

225
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,960
to be Uncle Zhou's private doctor.

226
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,560
If she was unwilling,
she could always refuse.

227
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,640
But in the end, she still hurt my dad.

228
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,480
My mom is never what you think.

229
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,560
Never?

230
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,120
Then why would she
keep saying sorry to me?

231
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,160
I...

232
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,000
Yan,...

233
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,120
I know that

234
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,840
as long as the truth remains a mystery

235
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,800
your misunderstanding about us
will never disappear.

236
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,840
But...

237
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,000
But at some point, can we let go
of the misunderstanding?

238
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,560
Even if it's only temporary.

239
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,840
I don't want the misunderstanding

240
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,920
to completely cut off our interaction.

241
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,800
What are you trying to say?

242
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,840
I went to the Welfare Center today.

243
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,760
There's a child named Tiankong.

244
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,600
I know him.

245
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,960
Director Lin has given me
two of his paintings.

246
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,040
Sometime ago

247
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,880
Shenghai Hospital gave examination
to the children in the Welfare Center.

248
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,520
They found lesion
on one of Tiankong's eyes.

249
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,200
His condition is not very promising.

250
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,960
Shenghai Hospital does not
specialize in ophthalmology.

251
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,840
We need to find
an experienced ophthalmologist.

252
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
Let me arrange it.

253
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,880
You really want to help him?

254
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,760
Because his paintings
touched me very much.

255
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,760
The biggest problem now
is Tiankong's very depressed.

256
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,480
He can't face it bravely.

257
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,120
Then you have to make him brave.

258
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,120
You have experience, don't you?

259
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,720
Come here, Tiankong.

260
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,560
Let me do it.

261
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,480
-Guang, thank you.
-It's nothing.

262
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,040
Thank you, Brother Guang.

263
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,960
Good, Tiankong.

264
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,920
-I'm leaving then.
-All right.

265
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,720
Miss Xiaomeng, where are you taking me?

266
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,360
We're going to Ms. Lin's home.

267
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:35,600
Miss Xiaomeng, why can't
I stay with the other students?

268
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,120
Am I no longer welcome
in the Welfare Center?

269
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,600
Of course not, Tiankong.

270
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,000
We just came out for a few days
before going back to the Welfare Center.

271
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,000
You understand that.

272
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,680
Who's as lucky as you
in the Welfare Center?

273
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,400
You should be happy.

274
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,280
Miss Xiaomeng.

275
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,440
Will you stay with me?

276
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,120
I'll visit you as soon as I'm free.

277
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,840
Then I would be very happy.

278
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,920
Let's go.

279
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,600
Coming.

280
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,840
Here you are.

281
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,840
Director Lin.

282
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,920
Tiankong, please come in.

283
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,280
Come in.

284
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,120
Come in, dear.

285
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,240
-Come with me.
-Listen to her.

286
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,200
-Please seat him down first.
-All right.

287
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,760
Let's go. Come in.

288
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,280
Come here, Tiankong.

289
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,480
What's the matter?

290
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,880
How about Ms. Lin shows you your room?

291
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,720
Ms. Lin, I want to go back
to the Welfare Center.

292
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,120
I don't want to stay here alone.

293
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,320
Tiankong,

294
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,800
this is Ms. Lin's home.

295
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,280
You stay with her here for a few days.

296
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,120
The auntie in the Welfare Center
will come over and take care of you.

297
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:00,000
Tiankong, let's get familiar
with this place first, okay?

298
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,880
Okay.

299
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,720
Boss, I've already asked around.

300
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,960
Ye Sirong's memory
is fragmentary right now.

301
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,520
She hasn't fully recovered yet.

302
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,280
But I've also consulted
some brain specialists.

303
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,400
There are cases of patients
waking up from deep coma.

304
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,360
It is a possibility
that she might recover completely.

305
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,240
If that is the case,
we have to tie up the loose end.

306
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,560
You're right.

307
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,520
If she fully recovers,
she'll definitely tell the truth.

308
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,640
This will put us at a disadvantage.

309
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,640
You need to decide as soon as possible

310
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,440
Do you see any opportunity for us?

311
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,680
Every Tuesday.

312
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,000
She goes to the hospital
for review every Tuesday.

313
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,640
This is our best shot.

314
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,920
Don't leave any witness.

315
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,280
Yes.

316
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,280
I've never thought that your home
has such a beautiful child's bedroom.

317
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,000
Tiankong, this will be your room.

318
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,960
-Isn't it beautiful?
-Yes.

319
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,000
There are many toys over there.

320
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,160
Go have a look.

321
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,680
You'll love this place.

322
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,880
All children born into this world...

323
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,760
are fortunate,...

324
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,000
regardless of their health.

325
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,160
Then this child's bedroom...

326
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,720
Nobody has ever used it.

327
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,440
When I was young,...

328
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,640
I once had a child.

329
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,760
But in the end, I still lost him.

330
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,440
Maybe it's our destiny.

331
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,640
But I just can't forget about him.

332
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,920
So when I bought this house,...

333
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,680
I intentionally built a child's bedroom.

334
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,600
I...

335
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:35,720
Director Lin, don't be sad.
We are all your children.

336
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,080
(Huimei Yage Boutique)

337
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,360
Good day Miss Zhou.
Are you here to pick up the clothes?

338
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,040
Is the embroidery on my cuffs done?

339
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,880
It's been tailor made
to your specification.

340
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,880
Please come here.

341
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,720
I'll bring them to you.
Please wait for a moment.

342
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,480
Hello, is there anything
I can help you with?

343
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,040
I have no interests in the ready-made.
Show me your tailor-made.

344
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,120
Sure. Please wait for a moment.
I'll bring you the sample.

345
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,440
Miss, this is your shirt.

346
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,440
The cuffs are embroidered with
the names as per your request

347
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,840
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

348
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,640
Please have a look.

349
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,200
This one looks good.

350
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,080
You really have a good taste.

351
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,880
This is the most popular style
among the tailor-made shirts this year.

352
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,280
Show me the sample.

353
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,840
Certainly. Please wait for a moment.
I'll bring it to you.

354
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,440
Xiaomeng,...

355
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,920
what a coincidence!

356
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,240
I didn't expect to see you here.

357
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,680
Miss Sun, do you shop here too?

358
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,040
Whom do you buy this shirt for?

359
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,320
Is it for Jiang Ze?

360
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,360
-I...
-Don't be embarrassed.

361
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,560
News about your relationship with him
has been spreading like wildfire.

362
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,800
I can see it with my own eyes too.
He treats you very differently.

363
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,720
Miss Sun, it's not what you think.

364
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,520
Ze and I are not that close
for me to give him a shirt.

365
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,560
I'm sorry.

366
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,080
I still have matters to attend to.
I shall get going.

367
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,320
Miss, please have a look.
This is the shirt that you look for.

368
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,640
Forget it.

369
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,400
The girl who just left with a shirt.

370
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,200
Please get me the same shirt
in the same size.

371
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,280
Certainly. Please wait for a moment.

372
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,480
(General Medicine Department)

373
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,040
Don't worry, it's just a simple test.

374
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,440
But the patient needs to
complete it on her own.

375
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,920
It won't take long.

376
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,480
I'm just worried if I'm not there,

377
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,560
my mom might be afraid to be alone.

378
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,320
There are professional nurses
and doctors here.

379
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,480
Nothing bad will happen.

380
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,760
During my previous examination on Aunt Ye,
she was very cooperative,

381
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,680
so don't worry.

382
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,680
Let's sit over there.

383
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,120
All right.

384
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,480
Now my mom is like a child.

385
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,480
It's my turn to mother her.

386
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,200
But now I can understand

387
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,560
the incredible hardship for a mother
to take care of her children.

388
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,120
You must have been very fortunate,
if you can feel like this.

389
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,720
Yes.

390
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,480
Actually,...

391
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,360
for my mom to be at my side like this,

392
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,200
I already feel very content.

393
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,000
Xiaomeng?

394
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,680
-But Xiaomeng,
-Xiaomeng...

395
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,760
Does Zhou Yanzhao
treat you and Aunt Ye well?

396
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,200
It's okay.

397
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,280
But you have to remember,
Aunt Ye's current condition is not good.

398
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,640
Don't let her get agitated.

399
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,560
But Yan has a temper.

400
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,680
Surely you've seen it too.

401
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,080
When he wants to
know the truth desperately,

402
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,480
sometimes he can't control himself.

403
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,320
I know,...

404
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,120
but I still stand by my point.

405
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,160
If it's possible,

406
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,480
you must take her to a hospital abroad
for rehabilitation therapy.

407
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,240
But I have no choice.

408
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,520
Yan won't let me and my mother leave him.

409
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,600
No matter what,
we should think for Aunt Ye.

410
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,720
-Dr. Xiao! Dr. Xiao!
-What happened?

411
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,880
Ye Sirong went missing!

412
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,120
How could it happen?

413
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,160
What did you say?

414
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,640
My mom went missing?

415
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,200
-How could it be?
-Xiaomeng.

416
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,440
Calm down first.

417
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,680
I don't know what happened.

418
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,920
I was preparing for the next test
and she just went missing.

419
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,120
No way. We must find her immediately.

420
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,760
In my mom's current condition,
she needs somebody by her side.

421
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,240
How about you go downstairs
and I go upstairs?

422
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,760
Let's split up and search for her.
We can find her immediately.

423
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,680
All right.

424
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,800
Right, go to the security room.

425
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,800
Use the security cameras to search.

426
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,320
-Call me as soon as you find her.
-Okay.

427
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,080
What? All right.

428
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,120
Follow me. Come here.

429
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,520
Are Yan and Xiaomeng really upstairs?

430
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,360
They are waiting for you upstairs.
Follow me. Come here.

431
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,840
Come with me. I can take you there.

432
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,520
Come.

433
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,200
Aunt Ye!

434
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,040
Aunt Ye!

435
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,280
Aunt Ye!

436
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,960
Dr. Xiao? It's Dr. Xiao!

437
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,040
-Dr. Xiao, where are you?
-Aunt Ye!

438
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,880
I'm here, Dr. Xiao!

439
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,800
Aunt Ye!

440
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,080
You...

441
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,400
Where you're going?

442
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,240
Where am I?

443
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,160
I'm really scared!

444
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,800
Aunt Ye!

445
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,320
I'm really scared!

446
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,480
Aunt Ye!

447
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,360
I'm really scared!

448
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,000
Aunt Ye,...

449
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,760
are you okay?

450
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,960
Dr. Xiao?

451
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,320
Where are Xiaomeng and Yan?

452
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,640
I'll take you to them.

453
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,480
Mom!

454
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,800
Mom!

455
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,680
Where did you go?

456
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,880
You worried me sick.

457
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,960
Where did you find her?

458
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,600
Aunt Ye is probably
trying to find the toilet.

459
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,840
That's why she got lost.

460
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,800
Mom, please don't do that again. Okay?

461
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,120
Xiaomeng,

462
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,080
who will drive you
and Aunt Ye back this evening?

463
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,000
Both Yan and Guang already went out.

464
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,000
I didn't drive here either.

465
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,440
Today I'm leaving earlier.
Let me drive you home.

466
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,280
It's okay, Dr. Xiao.

467
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,000
I don't want to be a burden to you.

468
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,040
Don't mention it.

469
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,680
Aunt Ye must be very tired
after all the tests.

470
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,920
It's better to go home earlier.

471
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,720
Let's go.

472
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,520
Mom, let's go.

473
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,160
Mom.

474
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,320
Dr. Xiao, thank you...

475
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,000
for driving me and my mom home.

476
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,400
Aunt Ye must be very tired.

477
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,120
You shall take Aunt Ye in for some rest.

478
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,320
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

479
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,880
I wouldn't have thought...

480
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,360
Dr. Xiao would have become another
of Xiaomeng's escort.

481
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,240
Thank you, Dr. Xiao.

482
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,880
Chairman Zhou,
I need to tell you something.

483
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,120
It concerns Ye Sirong.

484
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,760
But I don't want
Xiaomeng to know about it.

485
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,040
What's the matter?

486
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,520
I can't tell you here.

487
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,680
Let's talk about it in the hospital.

488
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,960
Hospital?

489
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,880
This is roughly what happened.

490
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,480
Fortunately we found her in time
before something bad happened.

491
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,720
Are you saying Ye Sirong
didn't get lost by accident today?

492
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,360
It's premeditated?

493
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,560
Luckily the door to the roof
is locked today.

494
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,200
Otherwise, nobody knows what might happen.

495
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,880
What about the CCTV footage?

496
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,400
That perpetrator was really smart.

497
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,120
He manipulated all the blind spots.

498
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,600
We can't see his face.

499
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,560
Someone tries to kill Ye Sirong?

500
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,600
It's what I suspect.

501
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,800
If Aunt Ye actually falls down and dies,

502
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,240
everyone will think
she kills herself out of guilt.

503
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,680
Even if CCTV captures
the perpetrator's face,

504
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,880
it will be impossible to prove
he's involved.

505
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,680
But who would want to kill Aunt Ye?

506
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,040
There's only one possibility.

507
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,640
There's more to my father's death
than what it seems.

508
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,880
Should we call the police?

509
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,320
It's still our guess for now.
We have no proof.

510
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,440
Now Aunt Ye is being targeted.

511
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,680
I'm worried they will target Xiaomeng.

512
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,480
You're right.

513
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,000
I will ask someone to protect them.

514
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,600
Right,

515
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,080
I'm going to the police station later.

516
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,240
Officer Liu told me,

517
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,040
they found something
regarding my father's death.

518
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,400
I can bring up this matter
and discuss it with them.

519
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,960
The police have been
investigating this case.

520
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,680
Xiaomeng is very cooperative
in these investigations.

521
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,240
If she goes,

522
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,440
she will provide evidence
without any conditions.

523
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,720
No matter what,

524
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,760
I really should thank you, Dr. Xiao.

525
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,280
I just want to help Aunt Ye and Xiaomeng.

526
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,160
Then I thank you on behalf of Xiaomeng.

527
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,400
What's your next move then?

528
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,160
I'm not sure.

529
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,040
We may have to wait for Ye Sirong
to recover her memory

530
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,400
to find out what really happened.

531
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,600
Is anyone still using this phone booth?

532
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,040
This phone booth is always needed.

533
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,160
The hospital once suggested its removal,

534
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,000
while your father was still alive.

535
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,040
Because of his relentless objections,
the phone booth stayed.

536
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,720
Everyone needs a place...

537
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,880
to spit out the secrets
that can't be heard by others.

538
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,120
Your father has once said,...

539
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,200
the furthest people
are the ones you can't see,

540
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,280
and the heaviest words
are the ones you can't speak.

541
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,640
You've brought Xiaomeng
here before, right?

542
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,600
We really can't hide anything from you.

543
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,880
I did bring her here before.

544
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,320
She gets emotional every time she's here,

545
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,480
and would cry ceaselessly

546
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,120
She would calm down after that.

547
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,880
Do you want to go in
and make a phone call?

548
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,960
I wish the day the truth finally comes out
can arrive soon.

549
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,720
Father insisted on
keeping that phone booth.

550
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,480
Does everyone have a secret
that can't be revealed to anyone else?

551
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,080
Xiaomeng,...

552
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,000
I'm sorry.

553
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,040
The predicament we're in now

554
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,680
is because of my reluctance
to let go my memory,

555
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,840
and unwillingness to be crushed by hate.

556
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,360
Maybe...

557
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,440
there's no hate between us.

558
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,640
What's the use of hiring you?

559
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,120
I'm sorry, boss.

560
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,320
I didn't expect they would find out
Ye Sirong was missing so quickly.

561
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,880
Please give me another chance.

562
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,440
Zhou Yanzhao is very smart.

563
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,040
You've lost your chance.

564
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,280
What's your plan then?

565
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,000
As long as we take care of Zhou Yanzhao,

566
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,440
we don't need to worry about the others!

567
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,640
(Huimei Yage Boutique)

568
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,960
-Yan.
-What's the matter?

569
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,880
I want to give you this present.

570
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,080
I...

571
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,960
Meeting at nine o'clock.

572
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,040
I know.

573
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,560
Yan.

574
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,600
This shirt

575
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,240
is from the brand you usually wear.

576
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,040
I've ordered it tailored for you.

577
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,440
Thanks. Leave it here.

578
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,360
Why do you suddenly think
of giving me a present today?

579
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,120
Nothing.

580
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,600
You should get to the office.

581
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,360
All right.

582
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,080
That's why expanding employed population,
and receiving high income

583
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,080
has occupied national economy...

584
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,480
(Xiaomeng)

585
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,560
Hello?

586
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,880
Hello, Yan?

587
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,280
Will you come back for dinner tonight?

588
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,520
I'm not free tonight.

589
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,720
How about lunch?

590
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,560
Will you have time for lunch?

591
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,960
What is it?

592
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,840
I want to eat with you today.

593
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,680
I don't have time.

594
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,280
But today is your birthday.

595
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,000
I want to celebrate it with you.

596
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,720
I know

597
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,760
you've never liked celebrating birthday.

598
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,440
Let's just call it a meal together, okay?

599
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,440
Wait for me at home.

600
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,240
All right. I wait for you to come home.

601
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,360
Chairman Zhou,
I need to elaborate on this part.

602
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,120
Sports goods industry,

603
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,920
including the production
of sports equipment and clothing

604
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,160
and its retailing...

605
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,080
Chairman Zhou.

606
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,000
I...

607
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,960
If it's work-related,
you can talk to me in the office.

608
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,840
This is for you.

609
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,760
For me? What it is?

610
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,840
Your birthday present.
I personally pick it out for you.

611
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,840
How do you know it's my birthday today?

612
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,120
If I want to know something,
I would find ways to know it.

613
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,440
Happy birthday.

614
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,960
Thank you.

615
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,240
But I never celebrate my birthday.

616
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,720
I don't think I shall accept this gift.

617
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,280
Please accept it,
since it's your birthday today.

618
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,240
I've already bought it,
and may not be able to return it.

619
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,960
I don't usually give present to a man.

620
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,320
Please accept it.

621
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,520
I wouldn't have guessed
you'd choose this brand.

622
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,400
Yeah, it suits you.

623
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,720
Where you're going?

624
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,480
I was thinking to ask you out for lunch,

625
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,400
so I pushed my get-together with friends
to this evening.

626
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,680
But it looks like
you have a lunch date already.

627
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,760
Is it Xiaomeng?

628
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,720
It's understandable.
Now she's living in your house.

629
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,280
You're pretty much family.

630
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,720
It's very normal
for family to celebrate birthday.

631
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,720
I will excuse myself now.

632
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,920
Come with me.

633
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,560
What?

634
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,560
Thanks for your present.

635
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:03,960
Let's have lunch together.

636
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,040
Thank you, Chairman Zhou.

637
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,920
You're home.

638
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,240
Good day, Xiaomeng.

639
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,200
We've met again.

640
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,640
-Miss Sun, you're here too?
-Yes.

641
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,120
Today's Chairman Zhou's birthday.

642
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,600
He's invited me over to celebrate.

643
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,400
So it is.

644
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,280
We have the same taste.
We even bought the same shirt.

645
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,120
Yes.

646
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,240
We really have the same taste.

647
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,200
But everyone knows about this brand.

648
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,000
Yan only wears tailor-made shirts
from this brand.

649
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,680
Miss Sun just bought the shirt
at the shop,

650
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,720
I'm afraid the size might not fit.

651
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,840
I can exchange it if the size doesn't fit.

652
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,200
What if the one I've bought
fits him nicely?

653
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,920
Then Miss Sun
must have Yan all figured out.

654
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,120
Chairman Zhou,
can you try on this present from me?

655
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,920
-Now?
-Yes.

656
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,120
Now that Xiaomeng has mentioned,
I'm a little worried.

657
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,480
You can try it on to see if it fits.

658
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,040
If not, I can exchange it.

659
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:38,000
I don't want my carefully selected gift
to make you unhappy.

660
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,120
It smells so nice.

661
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,720
Have you prepared all these dishes?

662
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,320
Yes.

663
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,960
Xiaomeng, you're really amazing.

664
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,120
Chairman Zhou has invited me
to his birthday to show off your cooking.

665
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,960
If there's a chance, you should teach me.

666
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,320
Are all these dishes
Chairman Zhou's favorite dishes?

667
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:30,920
Yes.

668
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,640
I'll make these for him sometime.
