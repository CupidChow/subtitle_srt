1
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,880
(Episode 18)

2
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,760
Why haven't you tell me?

3
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,320
I've been just informed
upon returning to the hospital

4
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,320
that I'd be on the medical team
for treating Aunt Ye.

5
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,520
I've also learned that it has imported
the latest equipment and technology.

6
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,840
I thought I'd spare you false hope,

7
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,600
and only tell you
once we've got some progress.

8
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,840
But when will my mom be conscious?

9
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,000
According to treatments done abroad,

10
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,160
when the patient starts responding
to her surroundings,

11
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,920
this indicates certain activity abilities
in the brain.

12
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,720
This means recovery for your mom
is possible.

13
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,120
But right now, I can't tell you exactly
when she will wake up.

14
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,760
That's great news!

15
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,360
Is there anything else I can do?

16
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,360
She's been responding to the sounds
of her surroundings.

17
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,560
This is the reflex of a stimulated brain.

18
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,640
I believe speaking to your mom regularly

19
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,040
will greatly aid her recovery.

20
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,320
I see. Thank you, Doctor.

21
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,440
You're welcome. It's what we ought to do.

22
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,760
-I'll excuse myself now.
-Okay.

23
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,680
Xiaomeng, don't worry.

24
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,080
Aunt Ye should recover anytime soon.

25
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,640
Dr. Xiao, you must help my mom.

26
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,480
As soon as mom wakes up,
everything could be explained.

27
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,400
Yes.

28
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,600
There's nobody I can believe in,

29
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,840
so I'm asking for your help.

30
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,400
Please rest assured.

31
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,800
Although I'm not Aunt Ye's
attending doctor,

32
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,960
I'll do my best in the interaction
with the hospitals abroad,

33
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,440
and participating
in the hospital's discussion.

34
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,920
As long as there is a thread of hope,
I will not give up.

35
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,400
You hang in there, too.

36
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,480
We're all helping you.

37
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,720
Mom,

38
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,040
did you hear that?

39
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,920
Please recover soon.

40
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,560
Chairman Zhou, Jiang Ze
had dealt with the Yunnan incident.

41
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,480
As soon as they heard
we were sending medical help,

42
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,600
most villagers had a change of heart
and were willing to continue cooperating.

43
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,480
But they will only sign the contract
upon receiving the medical help.

44
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,960
The medical team is on their way.

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,240
All right, I'll inform Jiang Ze
immediately.

46
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,400
Proceed as planned
once the contract is signed.

47
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,200
Yes.

48
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,680
Chairman Zhou,

49
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,640
I think you have handled
this incident perfectly.

50
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,000
If you have time for flattery,

51
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,120
I'd rather you spend it taking care
of the shell company.

52
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,720
Yes.

53
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,080
Don't go overboard.
A little lesson will do.

54
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,600
Yes.

55
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,080
Lingxi.

56
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,520
Well...

57
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,720
Haven't I granted you leave
to take some rest?

58
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,240
You've just came back from Yunnan.

59
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,080
You need to be revitalized
before coming back to work.

60
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,920
I heard the new Cantonese restaurant
downstairs is quite good.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,960
I bought you some food on the way up.

62
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,920
You must have been busy the whole day
that you haven't had time to eat.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,080
You must be hungry.

64
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,640
Come have some.

65
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,960
It smells good.

66
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,360
Chairman Zhou, I'll excuse myself
if there's nothing else.

67
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,120
Thank you.

68
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,680
But I don't have an appetite.

69
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,840
Work is important, but you've got
to take care of your tummy, too.

70
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,520
Otherwise, you won't have
the energy to work.

71
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,680
Besides, I've bought so much.
It'll be wasted if you don't eat.

72
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,080
Oh, right.
I've bought their prawn dumplings.

73
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,720
I heard it's a must-try.
It's really good. Try it.

74
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,160
So?

75
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,840
Is it good?

76
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,120
The schedule
for the resort project is tight.

77
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,000
And the Luofeng City Commercial
Integrated Sports Center

78
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,200
cannot be slacked.

79
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,880
I've got it.

80
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,680
Oh, right.

81
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,320
Has Xiaomeng come back with you?

82
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,520
How is she?

83
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,840
I've been so busy
that I've forgotten about it.

84
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,240
Chairman Zhou, aren't you going
to finish the food?

85
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,320
I'll treat you to a feast next time.

86
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,520
He's like this whenever
I mention Xiaomeng.

87
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,360
Mom, a lot has happened lately.

88
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,480
I'm no longer hosting a TV show.

89
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,320
Senior Qiao Zhen has asked me to lie low
until the fuss dies down.

90
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,960
But I know

91
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,960
some things will never be forgotten.

92
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,080
Anyway,

93
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,920
it's good that I've resigned.

94
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,040
I had been exhausted.

95
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,360
I can treat myself to a holiday now
for a good rest.

96
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,080
Mom...

97
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,240
do you remember when I was little?

98
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,560
I remember when I was little,

99
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,360
you'd always caress my face
with your hands.

100
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,520
Your hands were big

101
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,840
and warm.

102
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,440
At that time,

103
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,160
no matter where we went,

104
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,480
I would tightly hold on to your hands,

105
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,880
for fear that I might get lost,

106
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,000
and not be able to see you again.

107
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,920
Please wake up soon.

108
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,600
We'll be together forever.

109
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,520
Please get better.

110
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
Mom,

111
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
have you heard what I said?

112
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,520
Mom.

113
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,640
Mom.

114
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,960
Please wake up if you hear me.

115
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm begging you. Please.

116
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,880
Mommy.

117
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,680
Don't worry about Aunt Ye. She'll be fine.

118
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,600
Here you are.

119
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,680
Did you see my mom's finger move?

120
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,400
I did.

121
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,000
A Yan,

122
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,520
thank you.

123
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,520
For what?

124
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,400
Thank you for purchasing the equipment
for treating my mom.

125
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,200
Your mom is important for us both.

126
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,680
Whether she did something
to hurt Uncle Zhou,

127
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,520
I want to know the truth.

128
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,080
If she actually did...

129
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,800
she will be held accountable by the law.

130
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,400
Tell me about it.

131
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,720
If...

132
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,240
If...

133
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,920
Say what you want to say.
Enough with the ifs.

134
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,200
What if

135
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,480
my mom isn't the murderer?

136
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,760
Have you not thought
about this possibility?

137
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,680
If my mom's not the murderer,

138
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,800
what would you do?

139
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,560
The doctors are waiting for us to discuss
the next step for the treatment.

140
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,760
Chief, check out this area.

141
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,960
It has suffered the most serious injury.

142
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,800
It's the major cause of the coma.

143
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,120
We should proceed with an MRI of the head.

144
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,920
If we are all in agreement,

145
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,920
let's go with that as the next step.

146
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,720
-All right.
-All right.

147
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
Prior treatment
has produced some progress,

148
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,640
but the next step
to fully wake up the patient,

149
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,360
still might take some time.

150
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,440
This is the information I've gathered

151
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,800
from various medical organizations
in the USA and UK.

152
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,480
The latest treatment in the world
is stem cell transplant

153
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,320
to trigger the awakening of the patient.

154
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,520
However, China has not mastered
the technology,

155
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,080
and the risk is even higher.

156
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,040
Currently, stimulation treatment
is more widely used worldwide.

157
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,760
It stimulates hearing and memory.

158
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,160
It's a safer and simpler option
compared to medication and surgery,

159
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,960
however,

160
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,720
the patient's awakening is far
from a guarantee.

161
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,000
Much has to depend on luck.

162
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,360
Chairman Zhou,

163
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,880
Dr. Xiao is a rare medical genius.
He's young and capable.

164
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,120
I think you should go with his suggestion.

165
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,600
What do you think?

166
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,640
Judged by current situation,

167
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,720
the stimulation treatment
suits the patient most.

168
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,400
My opinion is, in addition to treatment,

169
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,280
there should be more communication
with the patient.

170
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,320
This requires the participation
of family members.

171
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,520
There should be frequent interaction
between family members and the patient.

172
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,560
I agree, the communication between

173
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,000
family members and the patient
is important.

174
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,680
I suggest that Xiaomeng should come
to visit Ye Sirong and speak to her daily.

175
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,000
This will better stimulate the brain.

176
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,400
I'll accompany Xiaomeng daily
to help with the process.

177
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Excellent.

178
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,800
I think, this is the best treatment
going forward.

179
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,160
A Yan?

180
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,840
How soon can we see some progress
with this treatment?

181
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,080
This is hard to say.

182
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,680
It depends on the patient's condition
and the stimulation level.

183
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,960
Previous medical cases show that

184
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,040
it could take months or years
or even longer for the patient to wake up.

185
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,720
The patience of the family members
is the key.

186
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,680
You have a month's time.

187
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,240
Chairman Zhou, a month is too short.

188
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,080
-I hope...
-Dr. Xiao.

189
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,600
We'll do as Chairman Zhou says.

190
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,880
Chairman Zhou has his plans.

191
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,200
You have one month.

192
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,240
You can visit your mom at any time
for this month.

193
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,240
(Teresa Teng, Wine and Coffee,
Deep Affection and Misty Rain)

194
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,520
What if my mom isn't the murderer?

195
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,840
Have you not thought
about this possibility?

196
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,280
If my mom's not the murderer,

197
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,320
what would you do?

198
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,200
Mom, I've brought this photo album.

199
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,600
Look.

200
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,560
This photo album has been around
for years.

201
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,400
Each and every photo in it
holds our memories.

202
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,440
Let me tell you about it.

203
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,960
Mom, I have no idea you knew Uncle Zhou
during your younger days.

204
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,160
Why haven't you mentioned it to me?

205
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,920
Xiaomeng, did I hit you with my mop?

206
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,080
Sorry, sister Hua.

207
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,080
I was absent-minded.

208
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,760
You look tired.
Were you in the hospital earlier?

209
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,520
How's your mom?

210
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,480
She's still the same.

211
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,080
She had some response a few days ago.

212
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,920
But she hasn't been responding
in these few days during my visits.

213
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,200
Listen to me. Don't be hasty,
and have some patience.

214
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,160
Thank you, sister Hua.

215
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,800
Xiaomeng, no need for thanks between us.

216
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,280
We've known each other for so long.
We care for each other.

217
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,240
Are you hungry?

218
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,640
Let me fix you something.

219
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,880
I'm fine, sister Hua.

220
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,960
I'd like to ask you something.

221
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,120
About what?

222
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,120
How long have you been working
for the Zhou family?

223
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,280
Let me think.

224
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,400
When I first came here,
A Yan was three or four years old.

225
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,320
Let me tell you, Mr. Zhou was young
and really handsome at that time.

226
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,160
Those male teen idols on TV
would look dull next to him.

227
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,680
It's not even a fair competition.

228
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,160
It breaks my heart
to even talk about Mr. Zhou.

229
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,280
Xiaomeng, why are you suddenly
interested in this?

230
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,800
Nothing.

231
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,240
I was just looking at a photo album
at home the other day.

232
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,000
Then, it reminded me that you'd been
working with the Zhou family for years.

233
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
Oh, yes.

234
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,880
It's been many years
in the blink of an eye.

235
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,280
I'm old now.

236
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,000
Sister Hua,

237
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,680
has Mom and Uncle Zhou
known each other for a long time?

238
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,960
I'm not too sure about that.

239
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,320
Why do you ask?

240
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,040
Is something troubling you?

241
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,000
A Yan.

242
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,720
Sister Hua, I'm hungry.

243
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,280
Hungry? I'll fix you something right away.
It won't be a minute.

244
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,280
A Yan, you should rest.
I'll go about my business.

245
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,440
Eat something before you go.
Otherwise, it'll upset sister Hua.

246
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,560
No thanks, but you enjoy.

247
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,760
We'll leave earlier tomorrow.
Pick me at 7:00.

248
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,840
We'll pick up Sun Lingxi
before heading to the airport.

249
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,840
All right, A Yan.

250
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,560
I'll get going now.

251
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,120
A Yan, are you flying out tomorrow?

252
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,520
Are you sticking your nose in my business?

253
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,800
Is it work-related?

254
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,440
Yes.

255
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,360
Are you going with Miss Sun?

256
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,280
Sun Lingxi is the person-in-charge
for this project.

257
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,840
Of course, she's coming along.

258
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,840
What has it got to do with you?

259
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,840
Well,

260
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,800
I'm going back to my room.

261
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,360
Let me help you.

262
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,280
Has your mom shown any progress?

263
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,520
I've been visiting her
at the hospital every day,

264
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,960
but, unfortunately,
there hasn't been any improvement.

265
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,160
She's still the same.

266
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,000
I don't know when she will wake up.

267
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,080
A Yan,

268
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,160
are you and Miss Sun...

269
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,120
What are you trying to say?

270
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
A Yan,

271
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,720
do you like Miss Sun?

272
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,360
Weren't you rooting for us
to get together?

273
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,920
What? Do you regret it now?

274
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,000
The cat's got your tongue?

275
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,800
You're flying out early in morning.

276
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,600
You should rest now.

277
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,200
♪ I know love is not reliable ♪

278
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,360
♪ But I would still jump in
Without hesitation ♪

279
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,120
This is the first integrated sports center
project for Shenghai Group.

280
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,480
We seek your advice, Mr. Eisenman.

281
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,360
-Wow, your first?
-Yes.

282
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,680
I've inherited the legacy
of Shenghai Group.

283
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,440
I desire to propel it
to a completely different future.

284
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,200
Shenghai Group is taking
a change of direction.

285
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,520
A change of direction?

286
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,560
The profit for traditional real estate
has been decreasing year to year.

287
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,680
High investments are no longer guaranteed
for high returns.

288
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,080
If I simply try to preserve what we have,

289
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,120
Shenghai Group will wither in my rein.

290
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,720
So I'm searching for a new direction.

291
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,480
Mr. Zhou is visionary.

292
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,720
I believe Shenghai Group will live
to see its glorious days.

293
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:46,520
But if I may, have you found
the new direction?

294
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,120
You have to understand.

295
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,360
I used to be a boxer.

296
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,800
I once had a dream.

297
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,320
It has something to do with the project.

298
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,800
You were a boxer?

299
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,680
I'll elaborate more when time allows.

300
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,680
But I'd need your help
to realize this dream with me.

301
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,160
Interesting.

302
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,840
I don't usually decide
which project to work,

303
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,760
but whom I work with.

304
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,680
You're bold to break new grounds
and passionate.

305
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,680
It's enough to convince me

306
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:25,240
to keep a long and prosperous relationship
with Shenghai Group.

307
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,880
Zhen.

308
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,200
Thanks for coming to see me
despite your busy schedule.

309
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,960
Oh, please, off with the formality!

310
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,280
I should've come sooner.

311
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,160
Come.

312
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,160
Look at you,

313
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,000
you've lost so much weight.

314
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,240
Come.

315
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,760
Have this.

316
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,640
Cheese cake?

317
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,080
I haven't been eating much these days.

318
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,520
I'm feeling hungry looking at it.

319
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,920
Dr. Xiao told me

320
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,040
you've been caring for your mom
day and night.

321
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,080
Look at you. You are thin to start with.

322
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,840
But now, you've lost even more weight.

323
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,080
As long as my mom wakes up,

324
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,160
I don't mind how tough
and exhausting it is.

325
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,120
But mom has been lying there as days pass.

326
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,640
Despite my effort to communicate
with her, she's shown no response.

327
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,000
Don't worry, things will get better.

328
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,000
Everything will get better.

329
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,880
Eat up.

330
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,480
Xiaomeng.

331
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,760
Jiang Ze?

332
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,560
Why are you here?

333
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,000
I've come to see you.

334
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,320
Am I not welcomed?

335
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,080
I...

336
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,520
Xiaomeng, I've got to run.
Why don't you chat with Jiang Ze?

337
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,600
Dr. Xiao is waiting for me.

338
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,480
Thank you, Senior. Goodbye.

339
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,480
I heard you were on a business trip.

340
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,120
Yes, upon returning to Nanyue,

341
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,920
you were the first thing I thought of.

342
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,440
Work is more important.

343
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,400
Is this all you're having?

344
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,320
Come, let me feed you with something nice.

345
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,840
Thanks, Jiang Ze.

346
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,720
But I'm staying.

347
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,240
I've got to take care of my mom
in a while.

348
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,680
Come on.

349
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,600
If you don't eat, how will you have
the energy to take care of your mom?

350
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,280
Let's go. Come on.

351
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,720
I'm here.

352
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,400
Look up.

353
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,000
Wow, is it fate that we bumped
into each other?

354
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,160
This is where I work.

355
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,640
I see. This is your territory.

356
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,840
Then,

357
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,440
can you treat me to a sumptuous meal?

358
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,560
What do you feel like having?

359
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,960
Let me think about it.

360
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,560
What about...

361
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,240
the employee meal?

362
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,320
The employee meal?

363
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,320
I've thought girls prefer western cuisine.

364
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,560
I'm saving money for you.

365
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,120
I'm thoughtful, am I not?

366
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,040
Absolutely!

367
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,120
You sound so reluctant
to give me a compliment.

368
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,040
But you'll have to wait till tonight
for my treat.

369
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,000
Didn't you come to see Xiaomeng?

370
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,360
Tell me about it.

371
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,080
Jiang Ze dragged her out for a meal.

372
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,080
In that case, Xiaomeng won't be back soon.

373
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,160
But I can't leave now.

374
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,200
I need to take care of Aunt Ye.

375
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,440
Dr. Xiao,

376
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,200
you're so kind.

377
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,600
Xiaomeng is our friend.

378
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,000
I'm only doing what I can.

379
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,960
I don't think it's that simple.

380
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,280
Deep down, you like Xiaomeng!

381
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,400
That's not true.

382
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,640
Don't make assumptions.

383
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,560
All right, I'll stop pulling your leg.

384
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,440
-Give me the card.
-What card?

385
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,000
Your employee meal card, of course.

386
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,320
I'll pack lunch for you.

387
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,560
Eat whatever you want.

388
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,000
Knock yourself out.

389
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,440
(Contacts list)

390
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,440
The preparation for the preliminary
project is almost complete.

391
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,560
The only thing left
is tendering the offer.

392
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,760
Chairman Zhou,

393
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,000
let's have a toast to our success.

394
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,760
Lingxi,

395
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,640
I should thank you properly.

396
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,560
Thank you for working tirelessly
for this project.

397
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,080
This real estate project
had been decided long ago.

398
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,760
So we need to make it a win.

399
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,760
Without a win,

400
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,560
Shenghai Group will lose the foundation
for transformation.

401
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,160
In the future,

402
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,560
both Shenghai Group and I will need you.

403
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,320
Chairman Zhou, I understand.

404
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,960
But don't drink too much.

405
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,840
I'm fine.

406
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,920
Chairman Zhou,

407
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,440
is something troubling you?

408
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,600
Mind sharing it with me?

409
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,680
Thank you.

410
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,680
But I don't have anything to share.

411
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,360
Can I call you A Yan?

412
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,680
Sure.

413
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,800
You know,

414
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,800
you're like a system
with layers of firewalls.

415
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,840
No matter how many layers are torn down,

416
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,440
there will always be another
impenetrable firewall.

417
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,040
I can never guess what's on your mind.

418
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,040
Lingxi,

419
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,360
there's a forbidden area
in everyone's heart.

420
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,960
It's off limit to anybody
under any circumstances.

421
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,800
Don't you have that?

422
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,760
I do.

423
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,440
Chairman Zhou,

424
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,080
can I ask you another question?

425
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:32,960
I'll make it the last one.

426
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,560
Didn't you just call me A Yan?

427
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,080
You've already called it
the forbidden area.

428
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,600
I think Chairman Zhou
will be more suitable.

429
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,120
You are just too smart.

430
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,680
Is it a compliment or a sarcasm?

431
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,560
It's a compliment.

432
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,560
What's your question?

433
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,200
But my answer might not satisfy you.

434
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,360
Why do you insist on building the stadium?

435
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,880
I don't think the project is just about
innovation and transformation.

436
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,840
What's the real reason
behind your determination?

437
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,960
It's my dream.

438
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,680
I've been keeping it for a long time.

A Yan, why do you keep messing around?

444
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,840
I dare you to do it again.
You're a troublemaker!

445
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,360
I'll ignore you forever!

446
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,920
What great artwork are you drawing?

447
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,040
Is it Sunflower, or Venus?

448
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,240
I'm drawing a stadium,

449
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,080
but I haven't finished it yet.

450
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,080
A stadium?

451
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,040
Yes.

452
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,600
Every time I'm training, I imagine

453
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:11,720
it would be the best feeling to be able
to compete in the world's top stadium.

454
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,600
All equipment will be new.

455
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,800
And the stadium will be seated
with the most passionate audience.

456
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,440
You know, every time I think of it,

457
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,200
I feel particularly energetic
in my training.

458
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,560
Well, you keep drawing.
Let me know when you're done.

459
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,800
I'll build you a perfect stadium
when I can afford it.

460
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,040
You can brag all you want.

461
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,520
Uncle Zhou has told me
if you ever become a businessman,

462
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,400
he'd consider you're making a profit
if you don't lose any money for one day.

463
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,160
I'll make it.

464
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,520
I promise you.

465
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,160
You draw. I'll watch.

I wish for it to come true.

472
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,800
Why did you order so much?

473
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,920
It's so wasteful.

474
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,400
It's more than I can eat.

475
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,880
Xiaomeng, you'll have to finish it anyhow.

476
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,840
Xiaomeng, I'm telling you seriously,
ladies shouldn't be too skinny.

477
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,480
If you don't eat, you'll turn
into the most beautiful hag.

478
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,680
Scaring me is not going to work.

479
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,600
I really can't finish the food.

480
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,400
One eats to release stress.

481
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,240
How can your body be healthy
while you're in a bad mood?

482
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,080
Xiaomeng, you will only be able
to care for your mom,

483
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,840
if you know how to care for yourself.

484
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,360
Xiaomeng,

485
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,520
just share with me anything
that's troubling you.

486
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,880
At least, we're friends, right?

487
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,120
Of course, we're friends.

488
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,160
But you've been unhappy.

489
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,920
I want to help you,

490
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,680
but I don't know how.

491
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,200
Jiang Ze,

492
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,520
I know you're nice to me.

493
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,520
And I am grateful
for all that you've done for me.

494
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,560
I'm not unhappy.

495
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,600
I'm just worried for my mom.

496
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,520
I just want to keep her company.

497
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,960
I'll visit your mom with you
once you're done eating.

498
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,000
Please don't put any more troubles
on my plate.

499
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,680
-I...
-Enough, Jiang Ze.

500
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,840
I really can't eat any more.

501
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,720
I'm heading back to the hospital.

502
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,640
I'll give you a lift.

503
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,400
No, I'm fine. I'll take a taxi.

504
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,360
Xiaomeng,

505
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,480
I won't give up even if you treat me
any colder.

506
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,120
There's no stopping me
from getting what I want.

507
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:58,240
Apparently, he did not understand
a word I said,

508
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,480
so I left flurriedly...

509
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,560
without a sound.

510
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,680
Mom!

511
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,200
You're awake!

512
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,960
Please tell me that it's not a dream!

513
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,360
Mom,

514
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,480
what's wrong?

515
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,000
Mom...

516
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,000
is your body hurting?

517
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,800
Don't worry. Everything's all right.

518
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,880
Hang on,

519
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,680
I'll fetch the doctor.

520
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,920
Wait for me.

521
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,760
Guang, how soon can you get
to the hospital?

522
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,320
At least half an hour.

523
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,160
Drive Miss Sun home first then.

524
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,520
Chairman Zhou, the patient is more
important. Let's head to the hospital.

525
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,640
You're tired. You should go home and rest.

526
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,800
I'll be fine.

527
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,720
All right.

528
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,160
Guang, drive me to the hospital.

529
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,360
All right.

530
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,480
Chairman Zhou.

531
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,720
Chairman Zhou, it must be tiring for you
to rush here.

532
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,600
A Yan.

533
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,680
-My mom...
-Shut up.

534
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,560
It's their family business.
Let's not stick our noses in.

535
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,560
-I think...
-Don't think. Just wait here.

536
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,880
If you can't wait,
you can grab a cab and go home.

537
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,240
Ye Sirong.

538
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,160
Keeping silent, huh?

539
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:44,880
No biggie.

540
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,200
You can speak when the cops are here.

541
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,600
Mom.

542
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,920
Mom.

543
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Chairman Zhou,
the patient has just woken up.

544
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,120
She has difficulty in recognizing people.

545
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,560
The cops were here earlier.
They got nothing and left.

546
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,680
A Yan,

547
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,120
since my mom woke up,
she's been like this,

548
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,560
not answering to anybody's questions.

549
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,320
She just kept calling my name.
