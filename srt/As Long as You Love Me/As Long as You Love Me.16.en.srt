Haixing.

21
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,720
Sister Xiaomeng.

22
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,640
The wind is quite strong here.

23
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,600
Wear thicker clothes,
don't let yourself catch a cold.

24
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,080
Alright, Sister Li.

25
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,760
Did you know...

26
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,520
it's been such a long time...

27
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,360
since I last saw an ocean this beautiful
in the morning?

28
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,840
Stay longer if you like it.

29
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,960
Haixing is quite attached to you.

30
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,640
Sister Xiaomeng,
let's go pick up some shells, okay?

31
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,240
Good idea. Before we do that,

32
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,720
why don't we play in the water?

33
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,600
-Sister Xiaomeng!
-There's the wave!

34
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,560

43

Come in.

44
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,160
Yan, we've found Xiaomeng.

45
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,960
Where is she?

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,600
She's at Ant Island, with my third uncle.

47
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,200
Ant Island?

48
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,880
Xiaomeng is safe. Don't worry.

49
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,120
My uncle said that
he doesn't want you to worry

50
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,320
so he is going to advise her.

51
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,920
But let's not disturb Xiaomeng for now.

52
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,720
She's quite happy at Ant Island.

53
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,000
Let me finish this first.

54
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,920
Xiao Guang, pack up Doctor Ye's stuff.

55
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,840
Alright.

56
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,880
The slide is really fun!

57
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,800
Tiankong, are you drawing something?

58
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,240
Why don't you play with the other kids?

59
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,400
Ms. Lin, I drew a few more drawings.

60
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,680
Last time, Sister Xiaomeng said
my drawing is really nice.

61
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,840
I want to give these drawings to her.

62
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,160
Ms. Lin.

63
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,480
Last time, Sister Xiaomeng told me

64
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,640
about the story of the naughty mice
and the happy cats.

65
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,080
I drew it out.

66
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,480
If I give it to Sister Xiaomeng,

67
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,840
would she like it?

68
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,560
Yes. Tiankong's drawing is really good.

69
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,160
Sister Xiaomeng will like it very much.

70
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,040
But Sister Xiaomeng hasn't come
see me for quite some time already.

71
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,080
She's not on Fairy Tale Street
anymore.

72
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,080
Was it because of me?

73
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,240
Does Sister Xiaomeng not like me
anymore?

74
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,560
That's impossible.

75
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,920
Tiankong did really well.

76
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,160
It's impossible for
Sister Xiaomeng to dislike you.

77
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,680
I think...

78
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,880
is it because Sister Xiaomeng's
too busy with her work?

79
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,920
After she's done with her work,

80
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,760
she will come to see you, okay?

81
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,160
Really? Ms. Lin, you're not lying?

82
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,720
That's great.

83
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,160
I'll draw some more...

84
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,840
and give it to Sister Xiaomeng.

85
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,120
Alright, keep drawing.

86
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,080
Is there any news on Xiaomeng?
Where did Xiaomeng go?

87
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,000
It's really rare to see you here so early.

88
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,440
There hasn't been news on her
in a few days.

89
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,560
Why do you look like
you're not worried at all?

90
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,240
Regardless of how I feel, it's still not
up to you to worry about her.

91
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,200
How can you sit here peacefully

92
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,520
reading those documents?

93
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,160
Do you know how chaotic it is out there?

94
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,600
Where did Xiaomeng go?

95
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,160
Have you really searched for her?

96
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,400
You've no right to ask
about Zhou Xiaomeng!

97
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,480
She can go wherever she like,
she has nothing to do with me!

98
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,960
Okay, since I can't count on you,

99
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,280
I will call the police now.

100
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,680
Stop it!

101
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,760
Have you ever considered...

102
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,160
that Xiaomeng is a public figure?

103
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,000
Everyone is still talking
about those photos.

104
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,880
If the crowd knows that she's disappeared,

105
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,560
do you know how bad
it will affect Shenghai Group?

106
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,720
Is that not serious enough for you?

107
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,000
Do you want to add oil to the flame?

108
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,280
You've said so many things,
but all you care is Shenghai Group.

109
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,040
You don't care about Zhou Xiaomeng at all.

110
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,760
Enough, please leave now.

111
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,960
I have my own plan.

112
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,200
Zhou Yanzhao, listen carefully.

113
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,240
You better pray that
Xiaomeng is safe and sound.

114
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,640
If anything happens to her,

115
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,640
you'll be accountable for that.

116
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,280
You...

117
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,840
I'm sorry, President Jiang.

118
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,400
Chairman Zhou, there is a reporter

119
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,080
who wants to do an interview
about Xiaomeng.

120
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,720
Just say that I am in a meeting.

121
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,320
Going forward,
if there are more reporters,

122
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,720
just help me reject them.

123
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,640
Alright.

124
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,120
Chairman Zhou, is Xiaomeng okay?

125
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,400
She's fine.

126
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,320
Here, your noodle is here.

127
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,520
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

128
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,520
Your noodle is here.

129
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,480
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

130
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,360
-Here's the money.
-Alright, goodbye.

131
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,760
Sister Li.

132
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,520
Where is Haixing?
I've made her a windmill.

133
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,600
Haixing went out to play.
Xiaomeng, have a seat.

134
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,560
There's a lot of customers now.
Sit down first.

135
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,400
Alright.

136
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,920
-Here is your dish.
-Thank you.

137
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,600
-Here's your dish.
-Alright.

138
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,400
Two bowls of fresh shrimp noodle
in fish soup.

139
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,400
Make one of it spicier.

140
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,960
I'm not...

141
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,280
Sit down first.

142
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,520
Please wait.
I will bring it to you in a moment.

143
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,600
Sister Li, two orders
of fresh shrimp noodles.

144
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,840
Make one of it spicier.

145
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,360
Xiaomeng, you're my guest.

146
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,800
How can I make you work?
Sit down first.

147
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,520
Just give it to me, let me do it.
I've nothing to do.

148
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,600
-Give to me.
-I am embarrassed.

149
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,960
It's okay.

150
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,120
-Here is your fresh shrimp noodle.
-Alright.

151
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,880
-Anything else?
-No.

152
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,640
-Alright. Anything else?
-No.

153
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,920
-Sister Li.
-Xiaomeng, put this on.

154
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,200
This is the money from the table two.

155
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,040
Anything else you need help with?

156
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,920
You're out of tea?
I'll add some tea for you.

157
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,920
Hello...

158
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,480
(Nanyue Broadcasting Company)

159
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,440
The number you've dialed...

160
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,960
The night is full of stars.

161
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,720
The village girl, Deanna

162
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,520
prayed again

163
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,200
to the vast and dark blue night sky.

164
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,080
Sister Zhen, Zitong's performance...

165
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,800
is too exaggerated.

166
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,680
It's a bit exaggerated indeed.

167
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,680
I've already mentioned this to her
several times.

168
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,280
To be honest,...

169
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,680
Zitong is beautiful.

170
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,040
But her skills as a host

171
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,080
is still far from Xiaomeng.

172
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,640
Enough, she's approved by the station.
What can we say?

173
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,840
But she's turned herself into a frog.

174
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,800
That's why the two frogs

175
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,480
takes the risk

176
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,360
and went to the bayou
of Mississippi River...

177
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,160
to look for the witch, Mother Odie.

178
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,360
They asked the witch

179
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,080
to break their spells.

180
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,120
Will they be able to break the spell?

181
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,920
Don't forget to watch the next episode
of Fairy Tale Street.

182
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,680
Alright, cut.

183
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,640
Mr. Supervisor.

184
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,760
You've exceeded my expectations.

185
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,960
It's going very well.

186
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,120
Zitong, as a newcomer,

187
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,440
you've done really well.

188
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,280
Really? Thank you.

189
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,120
Actually, I was very nervous,

190
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,360
constantly worried
that I'd make a mistake.

191
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,560
I'm worried my position is wrong,
or reading the wrong line.

192
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,440
Overall is okay.

193
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,320
Just that you lack experience.

194
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,640
You need to practice more.

195
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,360
You'll get better with some practice.

196
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,920
Alright, Sister Zhen. Thank you.

197
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,160
I'll put in more effort.

198
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,440
Have a seat.

199
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,120
How was my performance?

200
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,000
Pretty good.
You're getting better.

201
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,160
-Really?
-Really.

202
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,960
I really was too nervous.

203
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,800
Did you know that I've worked really hard
on my lines?

204
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,680
I've even dreamt of my lines.

205
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,200
Good luck.

206
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,640
Zitong.

207
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,400
Fairy Tale Street is a popular show,
don't mess it up.

208
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,520
When Xiaomeng is not here,
you'll have to take over.

209
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,720
Don't worry, Sister Zhen.
I'll get it done.

210
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,920
Good luck.

211
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,160
Ze.

212
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,760
Did I recall your name correctly?

213
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
Hello, Zitong.

214
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,360
You still remember my name?

215
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,120
You're Xiaomeng's classmate.

216
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,600
Xiaomeng has been suspended.

217
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,360
Now you host this show, right?

218
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,440
No, I'm just taking over temporarily.

219
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,280
You should know that

220
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,680
the station hasn't been able to find
someone who can replace her.

221
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,480
So I'm just here for two weeks.

222
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,800
Zitong, let me ask you.

223
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,280
Have you seen Xiaomeng these few days?

224
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,800
When was the last time you saw her?

225
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,880
The last time?

226
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,520
The last time...

227
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,520
I don't think I've seen her
since the graduation ceremony.

228
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,880
What happened?

229
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,320
Xiaomeng has been missing for a few days.

230
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,960
What? Missing?

231
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,320
There hasn't been news of her
in a few days.

232
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,320
Since she hasn't contacted you,

233
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,480
I'll ask her other friends.

234
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,560
Have you asked the welfare home?

235
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,400
Welfare home?

236
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,320
-Why does she goes to the welfare home?
-Here's the thing.

237
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,000
Xiaomeng is very close
to the kids at the welfare home.

238
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,520
She often visits them.

239
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,960
You can try to ask them.

240
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,760
Do you know where the welfare home is?

241
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,960
Can you tell me the address?

242
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,680
How about this? My work is done.

243
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,400
-I can take you there.
-Alright, let's go now.

244
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,560
Wait a minute, let me change first.

245
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,840
Okay, I'll wait for you at the door.

246
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,920
Xiaomeng.

247
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,040
Xiaomeng, you've been here the entire day

248
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,960
helping Ah Li in her shop.
You must be tired.

249
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,160
I'm fine.

250
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,040
You've never done so much work
since you're a child.

251
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,360
Can you handle it?

252
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,560
It's not a big deal.

253
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,960
I still remember you used to tell me,

254
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,320
human can't live idly.

255
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,800
If a person lives idly,

256
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,680
then life has no meaning.

257
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,000
I still remember.

258
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,000
In fact, it's interesting
to have a busy life.

259
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,800
Although I'm just a waitress...

260
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,520
collecting checks and doing small things,

261
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,520
I'm still satisfied with this busy life.

262
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,880
Once we get busy,

263
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,880
we'll forget things that trouble us.

264
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,880
Alright.

265
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,080
You can stay here for a few more days.

266
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,040
I'll ask Ah Li to pay you.

267
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,880
This is the first time

268
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,800
I've seen you smile today.

269
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,280
Since you've been here,

270
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,600
you look like some things have been
bothering you.

271
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,560
What's going on?

272
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,200
Uncle Fang.

273
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,480
When you were away,

274
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,200
a lot of things happened.

275
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,160
I can't explain it all

276
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,840
in just one or two sentences.

277
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,720
But I think...

278
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,280
maybe sooner or later
I will understand it.

279
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,800
Don't worry about me.

280
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,240
Sorry for coming without prior notice,
Madam Lin.

281
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,000
I am a friend of Xiaomeng.

282
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,680
Nice to meet you. How can I help you?

283
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,880
I heard that Xiaomeng comes here
very often to visit the kids.

284
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,480
Has she come by the last few days?

285
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,160
Let's sit down and talk, okay?

286
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,720
-Please have a seat.
-Alright.

287
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,480
Please sit.

288
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,280
-Have some water.
-Alright.

289
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,560
Drink some water.

290
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,480
She came a few days ago
to drop off something.

291
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,480
Oh, there's a child named Tiankong
in the welfare home.

292
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,520
He's very close to Xiaomeng.

293
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,200
Really? How was her mood back then?

294
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,960
Did she mention
when she'll be back next time?

295
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,560
Mood?

296
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,800
She just dropped off some things,...

297
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,600
and said that she'd be back
and visit Tiankong in a while.

298
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,400
Then...

299
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,960
she just left.

300
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,360
Little beauty.

301
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,760
Can you tell me which one is Tiankong?

302
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,000
There he is.

303
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,480
Okay, thank you.

304
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,920
It's so beautiful.

305
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,560
Are you Tiankong?

306
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,520
How do you know my name?

307
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,440
Because I'm Sister Xiaomeng's friend.

308
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,120
She has always mentioned you.

309
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,800
She said there's a kid in the welfare home
who can draw very well.

310
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,280
It must be you.

311
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,040
Are you a friend of Sister Xiaomeng?

312
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,480
That means you get to see Sister Xiaomeng?

313
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,240
Can you tell Sister Xiaomeng
that I really miss her?

314
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,680
Ask her to come see me.

315
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,360
Well...

316
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,000
Sister Xiaomeng is a bit busy lately.

317
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,680
She will come see you
when she's not so busy.

318
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,480
Liar. Sister Xiaomeng must
have gone to a place very far away.

319
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,240
She's not even
on Fairy Tale Street anymore.

320
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,000
They changed it to Sister Tongtong.

321
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,760
I don't like Sister Tongtong.

322
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,880
I just want Sister Xiaomeng.

323
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,800
Xiaomeng has been missing for a few days.

324
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,440
I can't find her.

325
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,320
Have you reported to the police?

326
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,880
Would she do something stupid?

327
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,560
-Did something happen to her?
-Don't worry.

328
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,760
She won't something stupid.

329
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,000
Maybe she's just a bit depressed,

330
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,440
and decided to hide somewhere.

331
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,000
No wonder.

332
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,160
No wonder she told me awhile ago...

333
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,560
that she won't be able to visit Tiankong
for quite some time.

334
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,480
I should have kept her here.

335
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,000
Madam Lin, this is my business card.

336
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,880
If Xiaomeng contacts you,

337
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,000
please inform me immediately.

338
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,600
Don't worry,
if she comes to me, I'll call you.

339
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,880
Okay, thank you.

340
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,120
Then I won't bother you anymore.

341
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,600
-I'm going to take off now.
-Alright.

342
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,680
-Then I won't see you out.
-Okay, thank you.

343
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,760
Goodbye.

344
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,400
Don't cry...

345
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,880
Please don't cry.

346
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,680
Why do you want to see Sister Xiaomeng?
I can tell her on your behalf.

347
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,560
I want to give my drawing
to Sister Xiaomeng.

348
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,640
You can give it to me,
I'll pass it on to her.

349
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,760
I want to give this to Sister Xiaomeng.

350
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,120
This, and this, too.

351
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,440
Please tell Sister Xiaomeng

352
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,880
to come back soon.

353
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,480
We are waiting to hear her
tell stories in Fairy Tale Street.

354
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,520
Okay, I will tell her.

355
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,600
Great, I will be able
to see Sister Xiaomeng soon.

356
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,200
Ze.

357
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,680
I'm so sorry for asking you
to come here with me.

358
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,320
I need to continue looking for Xiaomeng,
I won't be able to take you home.

359
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,960
It's okay, it's more important
to find Xiaomeng.

360
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,960
You're really something, Zhou Xiaomeng.

361
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,760
Who do you think you are?

362
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,880
Xiaomeng.

363
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,480
Do you know why I practice boxing?

364
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,840
Here's my story.

365
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,840
When I was a kid,

366
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,440
I grew up in a farming village.

367
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,000
There is this big old house
in the village.

368
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,080
Many said it was haunted.

369
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,360
During night time,

370
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,120
all kinds of funny sounds would come out.

371
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,960
Many people have heard it.

372
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,480
We're still very young back then,

373
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,440
we were afraid but also curious.

374
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,320
But nobody dares to go in.

375
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,760
One day, we made a bet.

376
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,440
Whoever dared to go in

377
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,280
would be the king among us.

378
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,520
The whole village should listen to him.

379
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,720
After a long time,

380
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,880
still no one dared to go in.

381
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,440
What happened after that?

382
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,200
I also wanted to win the bet...

383
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,360
but I was afraid.

384
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,160
Those martial arts masters...

385
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,040
in the Wuxia novels that I've read

386
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,800
made me want to practice martial arts.

387
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,200
From then on,
I started practicing how to punch.

388
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,960
I practiced day and night.

389
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,080
I felt that I had mastered it,

390
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,800
I felt a bit braver then.

391
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,960
One day, I kicked down the door

392
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,280
and opened it.

393
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,960
What happened after you opened the door?

394
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,440
There's a female ghost inside.

395
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,200
She is pulling her head,
tongues hanging out.

396
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,240
Do you believe it?

397
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,000
I opened the door and took a look.

398
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,400
It's really a mess.

399
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,080
The floor was full of mice
that ran up and down.

400
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,400
It makes all sorts of noise.

401
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,280
All these tales of haunted house

402
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,360
were all caused by a bunch of rats.

403
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,320
Xiaomeng.

404
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,160
Sometimes, what can't be seen

405
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,320
causes the most fear.

406
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,800
If you face it bravely,

407
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:57,080
you will find that
your heart is the scariest.

408
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,680
Uncle Fang.

409
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,200
I think I understand
what you're trying to say.

410
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,360
But just let me accompany you for a while.

411
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,880
Don't drive me away.

412
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,640
Silly girl, how can I drive you away?

413
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,520
You can stay as long as you want.

414
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,280
But hiding yourself here...

415
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,880
is not a permanent solution.

416
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,400
I believe you can overcome whatever it is.

417
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,560
Uncle Fang, thank you.

418
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,240
I think I will understand soon.

419
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,640
(Zhou Yanzhao)

420
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,320
(Director Lin)

421
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,880
Hello, Madam Lin.

422
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,960
How can I help you?

423
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,040
Yes, the pediatric department

424
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,200
that you set up in our welfare home...

425
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,160
has really shown some good results.

426
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,040
I really want to thank you

427
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,080
because you've helped us
solve a lot of problems.

428
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,880
You're welcome.

429
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,320
Mr. Zhou.

430
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,040
Are you free?

431
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,520
I want to invite you over for a meal.

432
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,280
Is it because of Xiaomeng?

433
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,800
Not entirely.

434
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,320
Alright.

435
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,720
Okay, I'll wait for you.

436
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,080
Okay.

437
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,720
Madam Lin, how are you?

438
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,400
Mr. Zhou.

439
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,960
You can call me Yan.

440
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,800
Yan.

441
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,800
Alright. Don't call me Madam Lin.

442
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,160
You can just call me Aunt Lin.

443
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,120
Alright, Aunt Lin.

444
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,240
Please have a seat.

445
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,720
You must be hungry.

446
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,480
This is a nice restaurant.

447
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,400
How are you?

448
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,480
Let's order something.

449
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,240
I'm not sure what you'd like to eat.

450
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,680
Just order anything you want.

451
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,520
You can go ahead and order.

452
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,160
Please order anything you want.

453
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,160
Aunt Lin, you should do the ordering.

454
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,880
Let's have a look together.

455
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,480
Alright.

456
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,880
-Pineapple rice.
-Pineapple rice.

457
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,920
Aunt Lin.

458
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,000
You know this restaurant better.

459
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,200
It's better if you order.

460
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,440
Alright, I'll order

461
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,960
a few of my favorite dishes

462
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,280
so you can give it a try.

463
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,240
Alright.

464
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,680
Let's have the blanched beef,...

465
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,560
the stir fried kale,...

466
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,000
and white boiled shrimp.

467
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,920
Alright.

468
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,600
What else would you like?

469
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,480
Order some other dishes that you like.

470
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,960
Aunt Lin, all those dishes you've ordered
are what I like the most.

471
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,160
Really? What a coincidence.

472
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,600
Alright, that's it then.

473
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,000
Let me have a glass of fruit juice.

474
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,520
Okay, please wait a moment.

475
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,800
Let me pour some water for you.

476
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,600
It's hot.

477
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,760
Here...

478
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,360
I have a gift for you.

479
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,080
This is for you.

480
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,760
A gift?

481
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,000
It's nothing expensive.

482
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,960
I hope you'll like it.

483
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,440
Thanks.

484
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,440
This is a drawing by a boy
in the welfare home named Tiankong.

485
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,440
I really pity him.

486
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,680
He's completely blind in one eye.

487
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,640
The other eye is affected by amblyopia.

488
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,200
He's very close to Xiaomeng.

489
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,960
Look at the colors in this painting.

490
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,280
Xiaomeng drew it with Tiankong

491
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,600
when she came to
the welfare home last time.

492
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,920
It's really quite beautiful.

493
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,880
Aunt Lin, help me say thanks to Tiankong.

494
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,920
Alright.

495
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,000
Is Xiaomeng doing well now?

496
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,120
There was a young man named Ze.

497
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,960
He came to the welfare home
looking for Xiaomeng.

498
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,560
He said she went missing.

499
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,440
I was scared at first.

500
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,320
Do you know about this?

501
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,120
She left a note,

502
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,920
saying she wants to leave for a while.

503
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,320
Where is she now? Is she safe?

504
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,280
I know where she is.

505
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,000
Someone is taking care of her,
don't worry.

506
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,520
I can rest easy then.

507
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,280
Everyone is looking for her

508
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,600
and really worried about her.

509
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,680
I really hope you're doing fine.

510
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,120
I think you should look for her.

511
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,320
Aunt Lin.

512
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,280
I don't know how to face Xiaomeng.

513
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,080
A lot of things have happened between us.

514
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,000
It's a long story.

515
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,400
Only those who care for each other
can hurt each other.

516
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,080
Just like two hedgehogs.

517
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,400
When you want to move closer,

518
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,800
you must endure the spikes.

519
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,000
Aunt Lin.

520
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,800
You're so amazing.

521
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,400
I have to admit,
I took what you said very seriously.

522
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,280
Xiaomeng is a good kid,

523
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,960
she's really kind.

524
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,960
She's facing big trouble now.

525
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,200
It's enough to destroy
all the hopes in her heart.

526
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,160
I think that as her friend,

527
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,240
you should help her a bit.

528
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,480
Otherwise,

529
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,600
I'm worried that she might lose all hope.

530
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,280
(Xiaomeng)

531
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,880
The number you've dialed is unavailable.

532
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,360
The number you've dialed is unavailable.

533
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,680
Xiaomeng, you've helped me a lot today.

534
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,760
But I have nothing to treat you.

535
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,560
These are the local specialty,

536
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,160
seafood that is really delicious.

537
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,520
Try it. See if you like it.

538
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,680
Sister Li.

539
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,040
You and Uncle Fang treat me really well.

540
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,880
You're Fang's family member,
so you're my family, too.

541
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,600
I should take good care of you anyway,
let's eat.

542
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,040
Let's eat.

543
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,400
-Let's eat.
-Sister Xiaomeng.

544
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,760
Thank you, Haixing.

545
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,880
Come and try this.

546
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,000
Eat some more, try this.

547
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,120
Thank you, Uncle Fang.

548
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,600
Let me pour some liquor for you.

549
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,000
Thank you.

550
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,520
You have some too.

551
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,600
Alright, I'll drink too.

552
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,760
Don't blame me for talking too much later.

553
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,320
It's alright.

554
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,200
You can talk, I'll listen.

555
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,040
Anyway, these days...

556
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,360
you'll listen to anything I say.

557
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,600
Have some more to eat.

558
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,720
The street lamp
facing your door is broken.

559
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,520
I will find a ladder tomorrow
and change the light bulb.

560
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,320
Come on.

561
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,560
Last time, you wanted to climb up the roof

562
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,640
to put up some tarps, and you almost fell.

563
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,880
Have you forgotten all about it?

564
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,040
Wasn't there a rainstorm...

565
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,000
and I was afraid the roof leaks?

566
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,880
I didn't fall down anyway.

567
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,400
Look at him.

568
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,360
He's more enthusiastic
than those young adults.

569
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,160
Uncle Fang is like that.

570
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,480
Uncle Fang, you two are
taking good care of each other.

571
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,840
I really envy both of you.

572
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,920
-Eat some more.
-Xiaomeng.

573
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,120
Do you have a boyfriend?

574
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,760
It's okay, Xiaomeng is so pretty.

575
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,440
No need to worry about it.

576
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,120
-Let's eat.
-Eat some more.

577
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,680
Have a drink.

578
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,760
Uncle Fang, Sister Li,

579
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,800
I'm already full.

580
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,120
I want to take a walk by myself.

581
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,640
You've only eaten so little,
how can you be full?

582
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,920
That's right.

583
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,720
Look at Xiaomeng.

584
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,560
She was once cheerful and naive.

585
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,920
But why does she look so unhappy lately?

586
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,120
You have to talk to her.

587
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,200
It won't work

588
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:39,360
Sometimes she has to find
the way out herself.

589
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,520
But look, it's dark outside.

590
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,000
She's going out on her own,

591
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,680
I hope she will be safe.

592
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,960
Haixing, follow her.

593
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,800
Look after her
and don't let anything happen to her.

594
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,880
Alright.

595
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,600
The number you've dialed is...

596
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,600
The number you've dialed is unavailable.

597
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,640
Please...

598
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,320
Haixing.

599
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,760
Why are you here?

600
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,880
I've come to look after you.

601
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,920
Haixing, let me ask you this.

602
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,840
Do you have someone that you miss a lot?

603
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,280
Yes, I miss my dad.

604
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,720
But mom would not be happy
if she found out,

605
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,080
so I can only miss him in secret.

606
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,240
I'm just like you.

607
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,880
I'm missing someone too.

608
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,240
(Jiang Ze)

609
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,040
Hello?

610
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,320
Hello?

611
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,280
Hello?

612
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,440
Hello, Xiaomeng.

613
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,920
Xiaomeng, is that you?

614
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,240
Where are you?

615
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,640
It's me. You don't have to worry about me.

616
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,720
I'm doing well.

617
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,440
Are you really okay?

618
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,240
Do you know how worried I am?

619
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,080
I just want to be alone.

620
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,880
When I feel better, I'll come back.

621
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,000
Xiaomeng, I'm sorry.

622
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,440
It's all my fault.

623
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,000
Can you tell me where you are?

624
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,960
I am really worried
that you're all by yourself.

625
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,520
Ze, you don't have to worry about me.

626
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,400
I'm well and I'm not alone.

627
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,920
What? You're not alone?

628
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,120
Are you with Zhou Yanzhao?

629
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,000
I'm begging you. Give me a hint.

630
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,320
Can you tell me where you are?

631
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,640
I'm fine here.

632
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,200
I just want to be alone.

633
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,120
I'm going to hang up now.

634
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,960
Xiaomeng?

635
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,200
The number you've dialed is unavailable.

636
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,760
The board meeting tomorrow
is very important.

637
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,640
We need to come up with any comments

638
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,720
that the board members might ask us.

639
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,880
Find solutions to convince them.

640
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,880
I know it's going to be tough tomorrow.

641
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,240
I'll be ready.

642
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,760
There are a lot people in the company.

643
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,600
I don't want any incidents.

644
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,960
We might need to work past midnight.

645
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,080
I'll have Sister Hua
arrange a room for you.

646
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,440
Any questions?

647
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,800
Let's focus on the company.

648
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,600
Young Master Jiang, please have a drink.

649
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,800
Thank you.

650
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,640
Yan, Young Master Jiang
is here to see you.

651
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,760
Yan.

652
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,240
I've just gotten through
to Xiaomeng's phone.

653
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,240
Really?

654
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,960
I said I'm going to pick her up,
but she hung up the phone.

655
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,960
When I listened to the background sound,

656
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,200
it seems to be by the sea.

657
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,840
Also, she is not alone.

658
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,680
Do you have any relatives
who live by the sea?

659
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,120
No need.

660
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,840
I already know where she is.

661
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,080
What? Where is she now?

662
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,240
How do you know?

663
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,160
I can't tell you.

664
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,840
Why are you still being this way
at a time like this?

665
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,800
You're really heartless.

666
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,760
Are you not afraid
if something happens to her?

667
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,440
President Jiang, the company will hold

668
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,680
a board meeting tomorrow
to vote on the Luofeng Project.

669
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,160
At such a critical moment,

670
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,560
Chairman Zhou must be busy.

671
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,680
You think the money you earn

672
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,240
is more important than Xiaomeng?

673
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,000
Zhou Yanzhao, do you really think so?

674
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,520
I'll tell you this.

675
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,040
I am very busy.

676
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,640
In my heart,

677
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,520
Shenghai Group and Luofeng Project
will be my priority.

678
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,640
Zhou Xiaomeng is nothing.

679
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,600
Sister Hua, please see him out.

680
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,440
You're afraid you can't subdue me.

681
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,240
I'm sorry.

682
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,960
Goodbye.

683
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,360
Aren't these the boxing gloves
autographed by the champion?

684
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,120
Why is it here?

685
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,840
Even if the champion has autographed it,

686
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,840
it's just a pair
of ordinary boxing gloves.

687
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,320
What about these two?

688
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,880
You've kept it like a treasure,...

689
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,320
it must have a story behind it.

690
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,240
These two boxing gloves...

691
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,120
are the most common boxing gloves.

692
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,840
It's not autographed by the champion
nor is it limited edition.

693
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,200
You've thrown
the autographed boxing gloves

694
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,760
in the corner.

695
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,120
But you keep the two most common
boxing gloves as treasure.

696
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,400
Why?

697
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,520
Because the one
who gave me these boxing gloves...

698
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,960
is the one I care about the most.

699
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,680
Chairman Zhou.

700
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,800
I suddenly feel that...

701
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,360
you're not your usual self.

702
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,000
Do you really want to hide yourself?

703
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,240
Did I hide myself?

704
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,120
People are like crustaceans.

705
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,000
Under a hard outer shell,...

706
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,800
there are always some soft spots.

707
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,360
It's the same for you.

708
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,400
Maybe.

709
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,200
Like the way you treat Xiaomeng?

710
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,360
This has nothing to do with her.

711
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,600
Women are sensitive.

712
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,320
Others can't see it.

713
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,720
Can't I see it?

714
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,840
I have no special feeling towards her.

715
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,360
Then would you treat me
like the way you treat her?

716
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,640
You're different from her.

717
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,720
Of course we're different.

718
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:57,000
I'll admit that Xiaomeng
is a gentle and pretty girl.

719
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,720
She's very kind.

720
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,280
Am I not as good as her?
