1
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,800
(Episode 21)

2
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,280
Make yourself at home.

3
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,920
Sit down and eat.

4
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,600
All right.

5
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,800
Chairman Zhou,
this outfit looks good on you.

6
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,480
What's the matter?

7
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,680
A Yan, blow out the candles
and make a wish,

8
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,280
we're celebrating your birthday.

9
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,200
Chairman Zhou's shirt fits him perfectly.

10
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,680
It'd be better for him to stay fit.

11
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,400
Cakes contain a lot of calories.

12
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,520
Xiaomeng...

13
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,920
you know that I don't like to celebrate
my birthday.

14
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,160
Blowing out candles and eating cakes
are only for children.

15
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
Let's leave it.

16
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,200
Let's have a drink.

17
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,920
Cheers.

18
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,320
Happy birthday, Chairman Zhou.

19
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,160
I wish you success in getting the bid.

20
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,360
I'm honored to have this dinner with you.

21
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,040
It's just a casual dinner.

22
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Are you happy with my gift?

23
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,240
It's a thoughtful gift. Thank you.

24
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,640
You're welcome.

25
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,760
Coming.

26
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,960
Xiaomeng, you're here.

27
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,280
How are you, Director Lin?

28
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,120
I... I'm fine.

29
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,040
You don't look very well.

30
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,760
Are you feeling under the weather?

31
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,880
I'm fine.

32
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,360
I probably just didn't sleep well
last night. Come in.

33
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,120
It's A Yan's birthday today.

34
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,040
I thought I would celebrate with him.

35
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,200
I didn't expect he and Sun...

36
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,200
He was too busy.

37
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,720
He finished his meal in a hurry
and returned to the office.

38
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,640
There was no time
to eat this birthday cake.

39
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,360
So, I thought I'd give it to Tiankong
and visit him as well.

40
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,000
This is A Yan's birthday cake.

41
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,360
What's the matter, Director Lin?

42
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,520
Nothing.

43
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,080
Xiaomeng, you're here! You're here!

44
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,400
How are you, Tiankong?

45
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,200
He's not doing particularly well recently,

46
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,200
probably because he's lonely.

47
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,680
He's doing worse
than when he was at the welfare center.

48
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,280
I've been thinking
about how to cheer him up a little,

49
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,520
but I couldn't think of anything.

50
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,360
It's good that you're here.

51
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,160
Director Lin, I actually came
to discuss something with you today.

52
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,800
What is it?

53
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,280
I think we might organize
an art exhibition

54
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,160
to display Tiankong's paintings,

55
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,760
and also the paintings by other children
at the welfare center,

56
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,320
as a way to encourage Tiankong's interest
in drawing.

57
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,880
An art exhibition for Tiankong,
that's a good idea.

58
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,160
But it's also not an easy thing to do.

59
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,880
Don't worry. I'll work this out.

60
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,080
I believe the art exhibition
would be a success.

61
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,680
What art exhibition?

62
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,000
Tiankong, do you want to show
your paintings to everyone?

63
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,440
Yes, I want the whole world
to see my drawings.

64
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,760
Good, then I will get it done
and make your dreams come true.

65
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,640
Let's go eat some cake now.

66
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,960
-Here, Director Lin.
-Let's have the cake together!

67
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,280
Let's eat the cake!

68
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,480
Has it been a long time
since you had cake?

69
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,320
-Yes.
-Three, two, one.

70
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,720
-Are you happy?
-Yes.

71
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,680
Let's cut it.

72
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,560
Yes.

73
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,800
Shall we cut it together?

74
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,960
-Here.
-Good.

75
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,160
Cut it.

76
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,120
A Yan...

77
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,200
happy birthday.

78
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,440
-What do you want to eat?
-This.

79
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,440
The strawberry.

80
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,560
Ready.

81
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,760
-Good.
-Attention, all departments.

82
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,120
-Let's go.
-Three, two, one. Start.

83
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,640
Hello, dear children.

84
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,160
I am Sister Tongtong.

85
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,720
Today, Sister Tongtong
is going to tell you a story.

86
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,680
The story is called The Proud Peacock.

87
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,520
A long time ago, in the ancient time,

88
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,760
all birds respected the peacock
and honored it as the king of all birds.

89
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,400
However, such an honor
made the peacock very proud.

90
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,280
It started to look down on other animals.

91
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,000
It even started to despise
its own friends.

92
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,520
The proud peacock
whose feathers were all burnt

93
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,320
has turned black from head to toe.

94
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,440
Everyone started to forget about it.

95
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,040
Later, a black bird came to the forest.

96
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,920
It shouts with a hoarse voice all day,
so everyone calls it a crow.

97
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,960
All right, children.

98
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,680
That's the end of our show today.
See you next time.

99
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,280
Cut. It's done.

100
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,480
Thank you, everyone.

101
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,600
We've been filming
several episodes in a row.

102
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,880
It's finally done.

103
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,800
Let's have dinner together.

104
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,760
Qiao Zhen, I actually came
to ask you a favor today.

105
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,680
What is it?

106
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,240
I want to organize an art exhibition
for the children at the welfare center.

107
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,520
I want to ask for your advice
on organizing an art exhibition.

108
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,240
It's not going to be easy.

109
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,560
Why do you have this idea?

110
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,000
Do you still remember the boy
named Tiankong?

111
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,240
Yes.

112
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,680
He always had problems with his eyes.

113
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,480
But recently, it's been deteriorating.

114
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,360
It would not take long
before he loses the ability

115
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,320
to distinguish basic colors.

116
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,040
The doctor advised that he should
get surgery on his cornea.

117
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,560
But Tiankong is a stubborn child.

118
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,280
He's afraid of going to the hospital
and he rejects any treatments,

119
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,840
so his condition is getting worse.

120
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,600
Tiankong likes drawing,

121
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,000
so I want to organize
a small exhibition for him.

122
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,600
I have an idea for the theme,
"Colors of the Sky".

123
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,000
The art exhibition
will not only encourage Tiankong,

124
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,800
it will also cheer up other children

125
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,720
and raise awareness
about children with vision impairment.

126
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,200
Do you think it will work?

127
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,200
I think it's a great idea.

128
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,560
I'll fully support you.

129
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,200
Wait a minute.

130
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,360
Now I'm going to consult
my supervisors in the channel.

131
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,160
Thank you very much.

132
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,520
You're always so helpful.

133
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,000
There's no need to say that.

134
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,480
-Wait for me.
-Sure.

135
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,000
Xiaomeng.

136
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,680
What are you doing here?

137
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,520
Zitong.

138
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,920
I have something to discuss
with Qiao Zhen.

139
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,760
Right.

140
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,520
I watched you filming just now.

141
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,360
That was great.

142
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,800
I know that you did it
so much better than I do.

143
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,520
Xiaomeng...

144
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,680
I actually told the directors
many times...

145
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,800
that I want you to come back, but...

146
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,120
Thank you, Zitong.

147
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,360
But I no longer want to be
under the spotlight.

148
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,360
You've also done a great job.

149
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,400
Now, I can come back all the time
to visit you guys.

150
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,600
That makes me happy.

151
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,280
-Xiaomeng.
-How about it?

152
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,280
After hearing about the art exhibition,
our supervisors said they'll support you.

153
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,120
They can help you with the organization
and promotion.

154
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,280
But you need to find your own venue.

155
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,320
A venue...

156
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,120
All right, I got it.

157
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,760
I will search for it now.

158
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
Xiaomeng, you're organizing an exhibition?

159
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,920
Yes, come and see it if you have time.

160
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,880
Didn't you just say you don't like
to be under the spotlight?

161
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,000
What if doing this causes rumors?

162
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,880
I...

163
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,240
This is for charity.

164
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,400
It's a good thing.

165
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:16,080
Xiaomeng is not doing it for herself,
so please don't say such things.

166
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,280
Zitong, don't get it wrong.

167
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,680
I just want to do something
for the children.

168
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,160
The art exhibition
has nothing to do with me.

169
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,480
Is that so?

170
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,120
What I heard only reminds me
of what happened in the past.

171
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,080
What if other people also think this way?

172
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,320
Only wicked people will have such ideas.

173
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,280
With a kind heart, Xiaomeng is not afraid.

174
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,240
All right, Qiao Zhen.

175
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,400
Let's start preparing.

176
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,920
The venue is the biggest challenge
when we organize an exhibition.

177
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,120
Are you sure you can handle it?

178
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,720
It's all right.

179
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,880
I'll try my best to sort it out.

180
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,280
Bye, Zitong.

181
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,240
Hello. This is our menu.
Please see what you'd like to order.

182
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,680
Thank you.

183
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,320
You know what, Xiaomeng.

184
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,400
Chairman Zhou gave me a lot of work today.

185
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,440
But I immediately came over
when I got your call...

186
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,040
because this is the first time
you've asked me out.

187
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:46,800
Actually, I want to ask you
for a favor today.

188
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,440
Sure. I will try my best to help you.

189
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,040
We need an exhibition hall.

190
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,920
It doesn't have to be very big.

191
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,520
We want to use it for a few days.

192
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,600
Why would you need an exhibition hall?

193
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,200
Do you know Tiankong,
the boy at the welfare center?

194
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,920
Yeah. He's your little fan.

195
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,720
He's been ill lately and he needs surgery.

196
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,840
However, he has been having
emotional issues

197
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,480
so I want to organize an art exhibition
to encourage him and cheer him up.

198
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,200
Now, we only need a venue.

199
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,040
I can only ask for your help.

200
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,320
Why me?

201
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,040
How about A Yan?

202
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,520
Isn't he much more capable than I am?

203
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,200
This... this is my own business.

204
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,520
I see.

205
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,040
What do I get for helping you?

206
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,680
You're a businessman indeed.

207
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,680
It'd be great if you could help.

208
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,400
If you couldn't,
I'll think of another way.

209
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,320
All right, I'm just kidding.

210
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,360
Our company has a sales hall
which is temporarily unoccupied.

211
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,920
It is under the marketing department.

212
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,560
I knew you could help me.

213
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,160
This is a nice place.

214
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,600
It would be amazing
if we could hold our exhibition here.

215
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,040
But are we allowed to use this place?

216
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,080
It's fine. I can handle it.

217
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,280
Don't worry.

218
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,440
Mr. Jiang.

219
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,800
Director Jiang, what's up?

220
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,160
I want to ask for your help.

221
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,720
Look at you.

222
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,840
What can I do for the great Mr. Jiang?

223
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,960
Just tell me.

224
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,480
You have a nice exhibition hall here.

225
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,720
Can I use it for a few days?

226
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,480
Right.

227
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,960
How long do you want to use it, Xiaomeng?

228
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,960
Three days.

229
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,720
We'll use it for three days.

230
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,560
Manager Chen, we're in a rush here.

231
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,320
Please tidy up this area.

232
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,080
Director Jiang,

233
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,840
you know that I don't have a say
over this.

234
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,440
According to our corporate rules,

235
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,840
we need to apply for approvals
for matters like this.

236
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,440
We're organizing this art exhibition
for the promotion of Shenghai Group.

237
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,400
Don't make such a simple thing
complicated.

238
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,560
Director Jiang,
please don't put me in this situation.

239
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,640
All right. Tell me.
How long is the approval going to take?

240
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,800
The fastest is two weeks.

241
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,160
If it's slow, one month.

242
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,760
Two weeks?

243
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,360
No, we definitely can't make it.

244
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,680
Don't worry, Xiaomeng.

245
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,320
Manager Chen, we're really in a hurry.

246
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,440
Please help us.

247
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,280
That...

248
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,520
Director Jiang, how about this?

249
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,800
If it's so urgent and so important...

250
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,640
with a special approval by Chairman Zhou,

251
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,600
I will immediately
clear out this hall for you.

252
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,640
A special approval by A Yan, I'm afraid...

253
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,840
It's fine.
Like I said, I'll take care of this.

254
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,920
Thank you, Jiang Ze.

255
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,760
I need to talk to you.

256
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,160
Talk to your father.

257
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,200
Uncle Jiang is in power.
He can solve anything by lifting a finger.

258
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,840
Are you teasing me?

259
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,560
I'm teasing myself. What is it?

260
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,720
The photos have great impact on Xiaomeng
and the group.

261
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,960
Because you blamed this on me,

262
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,160
I will give you a chance
to make up for it.

263
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,760
It can rebuild Xiaomeng's image.

264
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,320
What do you want?

265
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,560
Xiaomeng has been taking care
of a boy named Tiankong.

266
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,560
Do you know that?

267
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,280
He's been ill recently.

268
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,240
Xiaomeng wants to organize an exhibition
for Tiankong to cheer him up.

269
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,720
If the exhibition is a success,
it will draw the attention of the media.

270
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,320
This would be a great help
to Xiaomeng's image.

271
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,200
Xiaomeng told you this?

272
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,600
She only asked me to help with the venue.

273
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,000
This is her own business.

274
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,040
Why would she ask you to come to me?
Why didn't she come herself?

275
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,840
This is a business of the company.

276
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,800
Would it be wrong if I came to you?

277
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,080
If you don't agree, just tell me.

278
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,080
I'll find another way.

279
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,680
Wait.

280
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,240
Put up this drawing first.

281
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,640
-Sure.
-Place this one higher.

282
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,240
Watch out.

283
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,680
A little to the left.

284
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,400
No, too much. A little to the right.

285
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,000
Then left.

286
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,960
Only Jiang Ze can tolerate you.

287
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,760
You've been telling him
to go either left or right tonight.

288
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,960
Almost.

289
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,120
That's it.

290
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,680
I think it's nicely hung.

291
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,800
Who ordered for delivery?

292
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,640
Over here.

293
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,480
Here's your order.

294
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,480
Good. Thank you.

295
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,720
Enjoy your meal.

296
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,640
Safe journey.

297
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,200
Let's eat.

298
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,560
You need a full tummy for energy.

299
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,960
Come on. Have a bite.

300
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,280
I'm not hungry. You go ahead.
I'll eat after I've finished this.

301
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,720
Come on, just one bite.

302
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,760
You haven't eaten anything today.

303
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,360
It hurts me to see that.

304
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,240
Come on, another bite.

305
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,880
All right. I can help myself.

306
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,840
Are you tired? Have some water.

307
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,840
Water can supplement your minerals.

308
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,680
Thank you.

309
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,680
Jiang Ze, tell me,

310
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,520
will A Yan disapprove
of this art exhibition?

311
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,680
Don't worry. He won't.

312
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,840
Have I ever screwed up
anything you told me to do?

313
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,600
Let's eat something first.
Then we'll continue.

314
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,960
Next, I will tell you about this painting.

315
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,880
This painting is created by Tiankong.

316
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,400
He's only 6 years old.

317
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,680
Is that Zhou Xiaomeng?

318
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,680
It's her.

319
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,880
Isn't she being boycotted?

320
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,360
I think she's planning for a comeback,
looking for a hype now.

321
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,520
Yes.

322
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,720
It's a meaningful story
about following dreams.

323
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,360
It's a series of paintings.
You may have a look around.

324
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,360
(Tiankong)

325
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,360
Zitong.

326
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,920
Xiaomeng.

327
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,240
I didn't expect you to come.

328
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,320
Of course.

329
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,720
You invited me, of course I have to come.

330
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,880
Besides, I'm now a host
of a children's program.

331
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,400
I should know more about children.
I'm just learning from you.

332
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,640
Have a look around.
You can come to me anytime.

333
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,920
Sure, get busy.

334
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,080
Let's check out those paintings.

335
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,280
This painting is interesting. Look!

336
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,800
These paintings are telling one story.

337
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,120
Isn't that amazing?

338
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,400
Tiankong has done a great job here.

339
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,800
It's hard to believe
that he has a visual problem.

340
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,720
No matter what obstacles there are,
children's imagination cannot be bound.

341
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,520
The exhibition is held

342
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,880
to encourage Tiankong to receive treatment
and pick up the brushes to draw again.

343
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,400
Thanks to you,
Tiankong can fulfill his dream.

344
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,040
Dr. Xiao.

345
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,040
You're a doctor.

346
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,960
You must know how to cure
Tiankong's eyes, right?

347
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,480
Look at these beautiful paintings.

348
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,200
Tiankong will be devastated
if he cannot draw again.

349
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,520
Ms. Qiao, I may be a doctor,
but I'm not an ophthalmologist.

350
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,640
I don't care.

351
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,160
You're so brilliant, you must have a way.

352
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,280
Right?

353
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,680
I'm glad you're not
our hospital director...

354
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,760
otherwise I'd be in trouble.

355
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,640
Children, have a look at this painting.

356
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,360
This is the "Innocence" series
created by Tiankong. Do you like it?

357
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,880
Yes.

358
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,920
Director.

359
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,000
Tiankong, there you are.

360
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,280
Let's go in.

361
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,200
Tiankong, you're here.

362
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,240
Tiankong, can you tell everyone
about the stories of your paintings?

363
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,680
Just like how I always tell
fairy tales to you.

364
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,400
Our Tiankong is a very brave
and brilliant child.

365
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,400
You can do it, Tiankong.

366
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,840
All right. Let's go. Come on.

367
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,160
Hello, everyone. Attention please.

368
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,680
He is Tiankong,
the artist for this exhibition.

369
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,560
Tiankong is going to tell us about himself
and the stories behind his drawings.

370
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,920
Tiankong, it's your turn. Good luck.

371
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,320
This is a planet.

372
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:35,800
On the planet there're flowers,
a proud king, mountains, and rivers.

373
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:43,080
In that painting is set at night,
there's a moon surrounded by many stars.

374
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,440
Lastly, there's a painting
which features SpongeBob.

375
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,800
There are some fish.

376
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,600
SpongeBob and his friend, Patrick Star,

377
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,840
-are helping their neighbor out.
-Jiang Ze, thank you.

378
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,080
The exhibition has been a success.

379
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,000
It's a joy for me
to be able to help people.

380
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,640
It's my pleasure to help you particularly.

381
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,560
Patrick Star is pulling out a spike.

382
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,960
(Disgraced Host Zhou Xiaomeng
Using Charity Show to Make a Come Back)

383
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,360
Media hype about Xiaomeng.

384
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,920
How come there'd be such news?

385
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,880
I think someone wants to hurt Xiaomeng,

386
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,680
trying to stop her
from gaining positive comments.

387
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,080
Hurting her? Who?

388
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,120
Who would do such things?

389
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,880
I'm not sure who it is.

390
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,240
But Xiaomeng's exhibition
is not a public event.

391
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,600
We didn't do much promotion.

392
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,400
And this post appeared
while the exhibition has just started.

393
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,680
It all happened so fast.

394
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,280
The photo is taken
by someone who came to the exhibition.

395
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,000
I think this person
could be Xiaomeng's friend...

396
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,840
or at least knows her quite well.

397
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,320
A friend...

398
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,720
What are they trying to do?

399
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,560
It's hard to know people's mind.

400
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,400
Actually, just think about it.

401
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,640
How could Xiaomeng get media hype

402
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,560
with such a thing?

403
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,200
She only wants to do something
for the children at the welfare center

404
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,440
and cheer Tiankong up.

405
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,960
Did you come to me for something?

406
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,480
It's nothing, Qiao Zhen.

407
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,560
I just feel sorry for Xiaomeng.

408
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,000
When you see Xiaomeng,
please comfort her for me.

409
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,760
I heard that the project
of the sports arena

410
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,120
has been approved by the board.

411
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,440
Yes. The design proposal is also ready.

412
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,840
We will attend the land auction
in a few days.

413
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:05,160
A Yan, is it the first bid
since you've been in charge of Shenghai?

414
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,960
Yes.

415
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,200
I don't have much experience
in this aspect,

416
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,760
so I want to ask for your advice.

417
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,200
Don't be too modest, young man.

418
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,480
I've heard about your performance
in the company.

419
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:25,320
I believe, with your ability,
you will get the land.

420
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,520
Just remember one word...

421
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,440
stability.

422
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,320
Stability?

423
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,800
Of course.

424
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,920
Even if I don't tell you,
you must have realized...

425
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,640
that this is the first project since
you've been in charge of the reformation.

426
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,320
I admire your judgment towards the market.

427
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,240
Reformation is necessary
for new opportunities.

428
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,440
However, Shenghai is like a big ship.

429
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,320
When the ship is too big,
it's not easy to steer.

430
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,800
So, be very careful.

431
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,760
Think twice before making decisions.

432
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,280
Thank you, Uncle Ling.

433
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,640
I see your point.

434
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,440
Don't be haste.
Stand firm with your floor price.

435
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,040
Be watchful of your competitors.

436
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,200
I'll remember that.

437
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,040
Right.

438
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,520
I heard that you've handed over
many of the business to Yuchen.

439
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,320
Uncle Ling, what's your plan?

440
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,240
I'm old.

441
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,840
I should let go when I should.

442
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,040
I have a daughter and a son.

443
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,480
My son is a disappointment.

444
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,080
He can't compare with you.

445
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,600
My daughter is capable.

446
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,840
I used to be lenient with her.

447
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,480
I just hope a girl like her
could have an easy life.

448
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:01,520
Now, it seems that I have no other options
but to pass my business to her one day.

449
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,280
Let her inherit the company...

450
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,680
and take care of my unreliable son.

451
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,680
Uncle Ling, you had it all planned out.

452
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,600
A Yan...

453
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,760
I wish you were my son.

454
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:24,920
But don't worry,
I will fully support Shenghai.

455
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,400
Thank you, Uncle Ling.

456
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,760
You're welcome.

457
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:35,280
I witnessed how your dad
established Shenghai from scratch.

458
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,200
I hope it will flourish in your hand.

459
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,040
Don't worry. I'll try my best.

460
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,200
(Zhou Xiaomeng. It's a shame that my son
likes her show. A manipulative vamp!)

461
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,280
Hello, A Yan?

462
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,400
I want to talk to you.

463
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,800
Do you have time?

464
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,760
Let's meet at the coffee shop.

465
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,800
What's the matter?

466
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,440
Only the CEO of Shenghai Group

467
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,880
has the power to create
such wave of comments and discussions

468
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,760
in such a short period of time.

469
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,760
I was wondering what it was about.

470
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,200
I even rushed back just to meet you.

471
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,360
Why did you do this?

472
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,920
I'm helping you...

473
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,280
rebuild your image.

474
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,000
Don't you think you should thank me?

475
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,440
Do you need to use such filthy tricks...

476
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,120
to rebuild my image?

477
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,320
When are you gonna leave me alone?

478
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,920
Are you happy that I'm being trampled?

479
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,160
My only wish was to help Tiankong.

480
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,360
I never wanted to rebuild my image
with this event.

481
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,480
In fact, I stopped caring
about my image anymore.

482
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,480
I only think it sucks
that you handled it this way.

483
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,800
How can you say
that you don't care about your image?

484
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,840
Do you know
that you're not the only one affected

485
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,360
when your image was ruined?

486
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,760
It also affects Shenghai Group's
reputation and mine.

487
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,200
So...

488
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,520
all the decisions you made...

489
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,520
including helping the welfare center,

490
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,240
were all for the sake of Shenghai Group
and yourself.

491
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,080
Am I right?

492
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,520
Yes.

493
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,600
You're right.

494
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,760
Do you know Tiankong's situation?

495
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:54,160
One of his eye has been blind
since birth...

496
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,400
and the other has very poor eyesight.

497
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,360
He needs to undergo
an eye operation very soon.

498
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,480
Imagine...

499
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,360
a boy who likes to draw...

500
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,000
is going to lose his sight.

501
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,560
Do you know how sad he is?

502
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,680
I only organized this art exhibition
to cheer him up.

503
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,520
Zhou Yanzhao,

504
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,560
if you only want to help me
or destroy me...

505
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,600
please don't use this innocent child.

506
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,600
I'm begging you.

507
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,640
Okay?

508
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,040
Director Lin and I
will take Tiankong to the hospital today.

509
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,280
Director,

510
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,680
Professor Chen, the most experienced
ophthalmologist in our hospital,

511
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,360
also recommends surgery for Tiankong.

512
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,000
Or he might lose his sight permanently.

513
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:31,080
The currently proposed surgery
is the best option we have,

514
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,520
but it still involves a very high risk.

515
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,040
Ms. Lin.

516
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,200
Are you sure
that we must perform the surgery?

517
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,080
Director, Tiankong's condition
is getting worse.

518
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,920
I hope he can have this operation
as soon as possible.

519
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,200
I understand the risks you mentioned.

520
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,360
I just wish the best of luck for the boy.

521
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,320
It's better than going blind.

522
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:06,320
If he suddenly becomes blind one day,
it'd be the saddest thing for the boy.

523
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,080
Doctor Xiao, you know
that not all surgeries are better

524
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,360
the sooner it's done.

525
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,880
Tiankong is suffered
from a congenital eye disease.

526
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,560
From the medical perspective,
it's a more difficult case.

527
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,680
Having the operation in haste,

528
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,680
if it fails,
he would be permanently blind.

529
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,320
No one wants that to happen.

530
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,960
Tiankong is still very young.

531
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,960
Even if he goes blind temporarily,

532
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,480
with the development
of medical facilities and technologies,

533
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,960
there might be a better treatment
for him in the future.

534
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,040
If we insist on a surgery now,

535
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,160
and it fails...

536
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,960
he would never be able
to see the world again.

537
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,480
Professor Chen and I have researched

538
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,880
for similar medical cases overseas
in recent years.

539
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,600
The technology is in place,
and with great advancement.

540
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,360
Success rate could be as high
as 97 percent.

541
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,680
I believe we can perform the surgery
for Tiankong.

542
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,680
I'm aware about the figures
you've mentioned,

543
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,600
but this is not
a specialized ophthalmic hospital.

544
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,200
And our technologies are far less advanced
than the hospitals overseas.

545
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,000
Chairman Zhou talked to me about this.

546
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,040
He told us to pull out all the stops

547
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,720
and use the best medical resources
to cure this child.

548
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,680
I also contacted some hospitals abroad.

549
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,600
However, there are so many
ophthalmic patients in the world.

550
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,960
They may not help us immediately.

551
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,920
I'm sorry. I have to answer this.

552
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,320
Please.

553
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,160
Hello?

554
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,760
Hello, yes.

555
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,560
Do we have no other options?

556
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,760
Don't worry.

557
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,960
With the advanced medical technology,

558
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,200
I believe there must be a cure
for Tiankong's eyes.

559
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,800
But as the day goes by,
Tiankong's eyesight is getting worse.

560
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:25,240
I'm so worried
that he couldn't endure the suffering.

561
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,920
Didn't Doctor Xiao say
that he has a way to cure Tiankong's eyes?

562
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,360
Then he will be able to help him.

563
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,240
I hope so.

564
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,440
Have you realized that Doctor Xiao

565
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,680
takes special care
of everything about you?

566
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,880
He cares about it more
than his own business.

567
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,120
Even I don't have the privilege for this.

568
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,720
Oh, Qiao Zhen, don't make fun of me.

569
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,280
Doctor Xiao is kind to everyone.

570
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:00,880
A fine bachelor like Xiao Sizhi
never had a girlfriend.

571
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,440
Tell me, is he a big freak?

572
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,480
You're also a nice person
with no boyfriend.

573
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,920
That makes you a little freak then?

574
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,280
You're so mean.

575
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,520
Xiaomeng.

576
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,000
Doctor Xiao.

577
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,560
What's up?

578
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,720
I have bad news and good news.
Which one do you want to hear first?

579
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,200
Look at you.

580
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,440
I think it's a good result.

581
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,800
How about the bad news first?

582
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:33,560
The bad news is that our hospital
can't provide sufficient treatment

583
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,200
for Tiankong's congenital eye disease

584
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,760
and there's a big risk for surgery.

585
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,600
What should we do?

586
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,440
Be patient. And the good news?

587
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,520
The good news is,

588
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,440
an international ophthalmic hospital
contacted us

589
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,000
and will come to Nanyue very soon.

590
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,800
They promised to help Tiankong.

591
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,680
In that case,

592
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,400
Tiankong's surgery will have
a much higher chance to succeed.

593
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,800
Really?

594
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,200
That's amazing.

595
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,600
But, Dr. Xiao,

596
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,440
how did the overseas hospital learn
about Tiankong's status?

597
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,320
I'm not sure about that.

598
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,920
Since the art exhibition,

599
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,680
there are indeed a lot of people
who want to help Tiankong.

600
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,560
Perhaps a kind person
found out about Tiankong

601
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,920
and wants to help him,

602
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,560
so he pulled some strings
to get in touch with the hospital abroad

603
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,720
and told them about Tiankong.

604
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,200
They encouraged Tiankong
to keep on drawing.

605
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,000
No matter what,
this kind person is brilliant.

606
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,240
Who could that be?

607
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,520
Could that be Jiang Ze?

608
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,120
He said he would help Tiankong.

609
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,440
I have no idea about that.

610
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,840
Regardless of his identity,

611
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,560
what's important is Tiankong
may see again.

612
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,040
Director Lin
has returned to the welfare center

613
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,680
to handle the relevant procedures.

614
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,160
If everything goes well,

615
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,440
I think Tiankong should be able
to have the surgery immediately.

616
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,560
Tiankong is going to be so happy
when he gets the good news.

617
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,560
Hello? Oh, Head Nurse.

618
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,400
What?

619
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,360
All right, I'm coming over.

620
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,480
What's the matter?

621
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,680
Come with me to the ward.

622
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,440
Tiankong is having an unstable mood.
He's throwing a tantrum now.

623
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,360
Let's go then.

624
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,200
Go.

625
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,360
-Tiankong, be nice.
-I want to go home.

626
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,800
Can you stop it?

627
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,480
Where are you, Xiaomeng?

628
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,480
-Save me!
-Tiankong!

629
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,440
Tiankong!

630
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,120
Tiankong, what happened?

631
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,440
Why are you throwing a tantrum again?

632
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,560
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

633
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:52,160
Xiaomeng, I thought you left me here
and abandoned me.

634
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,040
I don't want to be trapped here.

635
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,160
It's like a cage.

636
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,680
Xiaomeng, can you take me home?
