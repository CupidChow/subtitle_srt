1
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,600
(Episode 32)

2
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,880
But the role
of the board of directors is...

3
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,240
to correct mistakes made

4
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,040
in the course...

5
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,760
of decision making

6
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,520
and to provide the right guidance.

7
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,680
A Yan,...

8
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,680
what I say may upset you,...

9
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,240
but it's for your own good.

10
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,680
You need to accumulate experience.

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,360
Conserve your strength

12
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,960
and you can make a comeback in due time.

13
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,480
I will take care of funding.

14
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,280
This is a lot of money.

15
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,880
How are you going to get it?

16
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,640
No matter what,

17
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,360
I am not going to cancel this project.

18
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,800
Don't worry.

19
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,880
I won't use Shenghai Group's funds again.

20
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,160
It's so beautiful.

21
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,880
Guys, look.

22
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,000
It's so beautiful.

23
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,720
Which of you...

24
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,440
has seen Peter Pan today?

25
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,760
He's over there.

26
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,400
Peter Pan, you're here. Peter Pan.

27
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,680
We discovered

28
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,040
an amazing flower today.

29
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,680
We are studying it.

30
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,160
Really? Let me have a look.

31
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,200
Why are you here?

32
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,000
It's been a while since we saw each other.

33
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,920
I miss you.

34
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,000
So I came to see you.

35
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,240
Shh... They are rehearsing.

36
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,680
Okay, stop.

37
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,920
Let's take a break.

38
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,040
-Okay.
-Okay.

39
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,160
Come over here, guys.

40
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,760
-Okay.
-Okay.

41
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,520
Is he your boyfriend?

42
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,440
No.

43
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,800
Don't say that.

44
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,240
Jiang Ze, stop fooling around.

45
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,880
All the best to both of you.

46
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,840
I...

47
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,040
I saw the news

48
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,400
about you and Zitong being a couple.

49
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,560
If you are really seeing each other,

50
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,840
please treat her well.

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Stop bothering me.

52
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,720
Zhou Xiaomeng,

53
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,040
are you jealous?

54
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,640
Of course not.

55
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,800
Zitong is one of my best friends.

56
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,240
If you are together,

57
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,520
I will be very happy for you.

58
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,680
It's not possible between her and I.

59
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,040
We are not in a relationship.

60
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,000
But I would be happy if you are jealous.

61
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,840
At least I know you care about me.

62
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,360
Please stop cracking jokes like this.

63
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,840
Fine, I'll zip it.

64
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,400
I am here...

65
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,000
to take you out for lunch.

66
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,720
I'm busy.

67
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,400
Where are you going?

68
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,240
I promised Tiankong...

69
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,840
I would take him out today.

70
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,480
Great! I'm free too.

71
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,760
I'll go with you.

72
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,080
Since his eyes got better,...

73
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,480
I haven't seen him yet.

74
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,000
But I...

75
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,120
My fair damsel,

76
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,880
I volunteer to be your chauffeur

77
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,280
and keep you company.

78
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,840
If you don't want me to say anything,

79
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,040
I promise I'll shut up.

80
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,360
I'll be as quiet as a rock.

81
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,040
You can even treat me as if
I am not there.

82
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,240
Okay?

83
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,200
I...

84
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,120
Stop thinking so much. Let's go.

85
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,920
Slow down, Tiankong.

86
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,480
I will get on that ride
and that one, and that one too.

87
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,960
-That one?
-Yes, that one.

88
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,560
And that one, and that one too.

89
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,960
I'll take you there, okay?

90
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,040
Is it fun, Tiankong?

91
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,840
Hello.

92
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,280
Jiang Ze!

93
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,960
Are you having a good time?

94
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,560
Let's go over there.

95
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,640
Let's take a break. Okay?

96
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,440
Okay. I'm tired too.

97
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,080
It's beautiful here.

98
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,800
Tiankong, can you see it?

99
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,160
Yes, it's very beautiful.

100
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,800
Jiang Ze, can you take a picture

101
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,880
of me and Tiankong?

102
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,080
Sure, no problem.

103
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,040
Come on.

104
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,240
-Is it done?
-Well,

105
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,280
I want to take a picture too.

106
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,840
Okay.

107
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,480
Come, Tiankong.

108
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,360
Come on, let's take one together.

109
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,120
Another one.

110
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,240
Okay.

111
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,480
Let me take a look.

112
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,160
Xiaomeng.

113
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,920

Sir, your bouquet.

00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,320
You may keep it.

140
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,520
Are you aware there were many people

141
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,720
watching us just now?

142
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,480
It is rare to see you so happy,...

143
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,960
so I made a spontaneous decision

144
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,120
to confess my love for you.

145
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,720
Have I...

146
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,120
screwed things up?

147
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,720
Jiang Ze, do you know

148
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,640
I am very scared of

149
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,080
public attention like this?

150
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,720
Please, don't ever do this again.

151
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,360
Do you accept my confession?

152
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,960
No. I'm sorry.

153
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,200
Zhou Xiaomeng,

154
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,680
how many times are you going to reject me?

155
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,640
Do you want me to woo you
for the rest of my life...

156
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,080
before saying yes?

157
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,880
Since you know it's not going to work,

158
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,440
don't ever do this again.

159
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,280
Do you believe in my sincerity?

160
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,160
I do. But first of all,...

161
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,680
a sudden confession
might be a surprise sometimes,

162
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,560
but it might also come as a shock.

163
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,880
So please,

164
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,440
don't scare me like this again. Okay?

165
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,120
Second of all, you know

166
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,640
where my heart is.

167
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,840
I have never hid it from you.

168
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,600
There is someone in my heart

169
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,840
and there are things I can't leave behind.

170
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,240
I can't take you as my boyfriend.

171
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,520
The problem doesn't lie with you.

172
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,640
It's me who can't do this.

173
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,320
I get it.

174
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,040
I did this over and over again...

175
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,240
to let you know that...

176
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,560
you always have a backup right behind you.

177
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,240
I just hope you...

178
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,680
would sometimes turn around
and pay me a little attention.

179
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,360
Ice cream, ice cream!

180
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,520
Let's get some ice cream.

181
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,520
Come, Tiankong.

182
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,560
I'll get you some ice cream.

183
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,720
Xiaomeng,

184
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,440
come with us.

185
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,200
Chairman Zhou,...

186
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,720
this is the list of companies...

187
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,320
that you asked for.

188
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,000
Some of them are new companies

189
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,080
that are growing quite well domestically.

190
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,080
Compared to those arrogant
big companies,...

191
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,680
there is more room
for collaboration between us.

192
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,440
You are right. Compared to

193
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,440
big companies with deep pockets,...

194
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,240
these companies present
better opportunities for us.

195
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,720
Find out more information

196
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,040
about these companies,

197
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,000
including their main businesses,

198
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,200
market values and so on.

199
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,120
Yes, Chairman Zhou.

200
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,360
Sun Lingxi did not come to work

201
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,400
for the past two days.

202
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,120
I heard her foot is hurt.

203
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,440
Is she resting at home?

204
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,840
Yes.

205
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,720
How is she? Is it serious?

206
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,960
We are all co-workers.
Why don't you ask her yourself?

207
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,120
It's not my place to do so.

208
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,880
Qingyan,...

209
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,120
you know the rules of the company.

210
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,920
Office romance...

211
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,880
I know.

212
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,560
That's why I didn't tell her...

213
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,080
about my feelings.

214
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,080
Speaking of it, I don't really agree

215
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,240
with this rule either.

216
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,600
It's against human nature.

217
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,040
If it works out for you,...

218
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,280
I will

219
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,400
cancel this rule for you.

220
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,880
Since when did you first fall for her?

221
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,880
How come I never noticed it?

222
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,000
I don't know.

223
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,280
Then again, how many people really know...

224
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,960
when their love for someone started?

225
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,080
You are right.

226
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,760
I just feel like...

227
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,400
she and I have a lot in common.

228
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,160
Both of us...

229
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,240
need to work very hard

230
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,160
to get

231
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,640
what we want.

232
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,120
That's why she caught my eyes.

233
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,000
It's my fault...

234
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,920
that you guys have to work so hard.

235
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,280
No, Chairman Zhou.

236
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,840
I love working with you a lot.

237
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,400
I find my worth...

238
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,360
when I work for you.

239
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,480
Just confess your love for her
with the same attitude.

240
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,760
I never dared to ask what's on her mind.

241
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,960
If there's a good opportunity,...

242
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,400
be brave.

243
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,080
I wish you success.

244
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,800
Thank you, Chairman Zhou.

245
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,280
You may go.

246
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,440
It's been a long time
since I last saw Tiankong

247
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,680
this happy.

248
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,160
He had a great time today.

249
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,080
Kids get happy very easily.

250
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,040
Jiang Ze,...

251
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,160
thank you for all you've done
for us today.

252
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,000
What do you intend to do to thank me?

253
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,040
I...

254
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,160
Give me a peck on the cheek.

255
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,880
Here.

256
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,840
I will take it
that you truly appreciate what I've done.

257
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,720
Jiang Ze!

258
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,520
Fine. I was just kidding.

259
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,120
Sister Xiaomeng...

260
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,600
Sister Xiaomeng...

261
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,200
I better get back there...

262
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,000
to take care of Tiankong.

263
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,240
Although we have a third wheel

264
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,760
at the back,...

265
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,520
I will still consider today
as our first date.

266
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,240
I still want to thank you...

267
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,480
for this opportunity.

268
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:45,000
(Nanyue Children Welfare Center)

269
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,120
We are back.

270
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,080
Welcome back.

271
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,200
He fell asleep
at the back of the car just now.

272
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,440
Really?

273
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,320
Say goodbye to Sister Xiaomeng.

274
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,800
Tiankong, bye-bye.

275
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,800
Bye-bye, Tiankong.

276
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,720
Come, let's go in.

277
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,320
Director.

278
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,600
Xiaomeng,...

279
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,000
can you come to the theater?

280
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,520
What happened?

281
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,640
Just come here.

282
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,360
We'll talk when you get here.

283
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,680
Okay, I'll be right there.

284
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,680
Jiang Ze,...

285
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,480
can you give me a lift to the theater?

286
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,600
Okay, let's go.

287
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,560
Director, has something happened?

288
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,120
Xiaomeng,...

289
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,800
we might not be able to continue

290
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,080
with the play anymore.

291
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,400
Why is that so?

292
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,920
The company that promised to invest in it

293
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,200
thought that the play
had little market value.

294
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,440
They want to invest in an animation

295
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,640
that has more market potential.

296
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,880
That can't be.

297
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,000
It is a done deal.

298
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,240
How can they back off now?

299
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,640
This is how business is done.

300
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,560
They will invest in projects
that are profitable.

301
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,840
We didn't sign a contract anyway.

302
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,360
Whatever we agreed on...

303
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,040
doesn't count.

304
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,880
So are we going to give up just like that?

305
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:47,960
Moreover,...

306
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,440
our two main actors...

307
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,320
have to sit for examination soon.

308
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,960
It's hard for them to find time
for rehearsal.

309
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,440
How are we going to proceed?

310
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,160
Director, don't be disheartened.

311
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,560
We will find a solution.

312
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,320
I had been talking

313
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,280
to this company for a long time.

314
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,960
I finally struck a deal with them.

315
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,160
But as they have withdrawn
the investment,...

316
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,200
we can't even afford

317
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,600
the rental for the theater
for our rehearsal.

318
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,280
What should we do?

319
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,400
I will figure this out.

320
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,040
Director,

321
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,480
please give me some time.

322
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,280
You?

323
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,400
I don't think there's much

324
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,680
you can do.

325
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,440
No, it's not over until it's over.

326
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,000
We can't give up just yet.

327
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,840
Trust me.

328
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,840
Lingxi, I heard that you hurt your foot.

329
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,960
I'm here to see how you are.

330
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,680
Are you feeling better?

331
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,440
Take a seat.

332
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,120
Be careful.

333
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,400
Sit down.

334
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,920
Why are you here?

335
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,360
Is there something wrong at the company?

336
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,960
No.

337
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,840
I just thought that
since you hurt your foot,

338
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,160
it might be inconvenient for you
to get around.

339
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,120
So I brought you some fruit

340
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,880
and other necessities...

341
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,440
you might need.

342
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,200
I am fine.

343
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,280
You shouldn't have made this trip.

344
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,200
You shouldn't trouble yourself.

345
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,000
It's no trouble at all.

346
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,480
I thought since you are living alone

347
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,560
and there's nobody to take care of you,

348
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,800
I can't help but worry.

349
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,280
I bought a lot of fruit.

350
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,160
What would you like to have?
I'll get you some.

351
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,320
Chang Qingyan,...

352
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,760
don't treat me so well.
I'm not worth your effort.

353
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,200
Well,...

354
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,520
we are colleagues.

355
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,600
It's only right that
we help one another out, isn't it?

356
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,360
Right. We are colleagues.

357
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,760
My foot is injured.

358
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,200
Thank you for helping Chairman Zhou

359
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,400
at work.

360
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,440
It's my job.

361
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,600
Don't worry about the company.

362
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,320
Just take care of yourself.

363
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,680
Rest well.

364
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,640
If there's nothing else,

365
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,840
I should go.

366
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,280
Also,...

367
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,400
if you need anything,

368
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,560
call me anytime.

369
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,040
-Let me see you to the door.
-No need.

370
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,280
Sit down...

371
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,880
Right now,

372
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,360
just take care of yourself.

373
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,720
I'm making a move.

374
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,160
Excuse me. We have to move the props.

375
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,400
Sorry.

376
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,520
There's nothing here,

377
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,600
nothing to see anymore.

378
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,720
Go home.

379
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,240
Tomorrow, another play

380
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,560
is going to rehearse here.

381
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,240
Xiaomeng.

382
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,720
The company that was supposed

383
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,080
to invest in us,...

384
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,000
walked back on their promise abruptly.

385
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,360
Our production...

386
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,720
cannot go on.

387
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,800
How did this happen?

388
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,720
Shall I go to Shenghai Group?

389
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,000
No, Jiang Ze,...

390
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,680
absolutely not.

391
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,040
I don't want help from anyone anymore.

392
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,160
I can only rely on myself.

393
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,320
You can't help me.

394
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,680
What are you going to do?

395
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,160
I think other than storytelling,...

396
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,120
I know nothing else.

397
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,320
You remind me of something.

398
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,960
You can go to Penguin FM

399
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,320
to do storytelling.

400
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,200
It can help to increase your popularity.

401
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,560
It's killing two birds with one stone.

402
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,160
Penguin FM?

403
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,120
Yes.

404
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,360
It's a nice app.

405
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,280
Try it.

406
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,840
Okay, I'll try it when I get home.

407
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:21,960
Let's go then.

408
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,360
-How is it?
-It's good.

409
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,920
Don't touch it. Okay?

410
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,880
It's done.

411
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,320
Zitong, are you ready?

412
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,480
Yes.

413
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,960
Okay, three, two, one.

414
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,520
Action.

415
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,760
Hi kids!

416
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,960
I am your good friend,

417
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,200
Sister Tongtong.

418
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,600
Today, I want to

419
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,000
share a story with you.

420
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,440
The name of the story is

421
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,280
The Journey of A Boy to the Stars.

422
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,120
You look very pretty today.

423
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,040
Really?

424
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,840
I was born with the sun.

425
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,800
Really?

426
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,080
I think

427
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,000
it's breakfast time.

428
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,400
Please take care of me.

429
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,600
Okay.

430
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,760
This is for you.

431
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,360
The tiger might come back.

432
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,120
They have sharp claws.

433
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,600
But on my planet,

434
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,280
there is no tiger.

435
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,400
Also, tigers don't eat grass.

436
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,600
Okay, kids.

437
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,800
That's all for today.

438
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,960
I hope you like me.

439
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,640
From now on, I will tell you

440
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,200
more interesting stories.

441
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,720
Okay, cut.

442
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,160
Qiao Zhen,

443
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,360
how was my performance?

444
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,680
Not bad. You made some improvements.

445
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,080
How am I compared with Xiaomeng?

446
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,280
You can't compare like that.

447
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,560
Both of you have different styles.

448
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,240
Anyway,...

449
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,840
I must thank you

450
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,160
for this opportunity.

451
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,240
Don't mention it.

452
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,440
You earn it.

453
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,840
Today, it's your first show

454
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,760
as a formal program host
rather than a substitute one.

455
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,960
Work hard.

456
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,880
I trust you will do well.

457
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,400
Okay.

458
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,840
Qiao Zhen, we have wrapped up.

459
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,800
I will buy you and A Qi dinner.

460
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,760
Excuse me.

461
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,680
Hello.

462
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,040
Xiaomeng.

463
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,280
Okay, see you at the cafe.

464
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,440
Sorry,

465
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,600
I can't go to dinner with you.

466
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,560
Next time.

467
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,280
It's a wrap.

468
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,200
No matter how hard I try,...

469
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,880
I can't replace
Xiaomeng's position in your hearts, can I?

470
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,960
You're being weird.

471
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,240
Aren't you and Xiaomeng friends?

472
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,080
Of course. I was just kidding.

473
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,360
Let's go.

474
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,240
You're weird.

475
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,840
What happened, Xiaomeng?

476
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,560
You look upset.

477
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,960
What happened?

478
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,960
There's a problem with funding

479
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,200
for the play.

480
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,400
Rehearsal is suspended now.

481
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,640
We can't afford the rental anymore.

482
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,040
The actors

483
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,360
have been terminated too.

484
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,840
What about the director...

485
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,400
and the management of the production?

486
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,680
The director is trying hard
to save the play.

487
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,280
But the investor

488
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,880
wants to cancel the funding.

489
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,720
What kind of investor is that?

490
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,960
It's preposterous.

491
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,200
The investor

492
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,080
wants to give the funding to an animation.

493
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,120
They want to make more profit.

494
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,280
It's people like this

495
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,080
who only care about money nowadays.

496
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,680
These investors who have

497
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,640
little regard for culture

498
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,160
are making the cultural industry
extremely polarized.

499
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,520
They do make a lot of money.

500
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,680
But they don't care about

501
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,920
how meaningful their projects are,

502
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,120
and if the projects
are benefiting the viewers.

503
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,640
As a result,...

504
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,880
the truly meaningful plays

505
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,520
are struggling.

506
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,640
That's right.

507
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,240
But that's how the market is now.

508
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,160
Very few people...

509
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,480
can stay patient

510
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,160
to produce quality work.

511
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,600
I wonder if

512
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,320
other companies...

513
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,600
would be interested in

514
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,960
our play.

515
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,080
There will be someone
who appreciates your work.

516
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,880
Be patient.

517
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,840
I don't have time.

518
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,200
I really want to help them.

519
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,600
You know, it's very hard...

520
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,800
for a group of youngsters

521
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,880
to produce a meaningful

522
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,480
play for children.

523
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,680
Yes.

524
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,200
People with dreams are very noble.

525
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,440
We will figure this out.

526
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,880
Are you still thinking about it?

527
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,440
Yes.

528
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,120
After all,

529
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,960
we made a lot of prep work before this.

530
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,800
But now, our passion

531
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,000
is wasting away gradually.

532
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,800
There's nothing we can do.

533
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,920
Absolutely nothing.

534
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,960
Don't be too hard on yourself.

535
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,960
Right, there's a new

536
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,280
comedy movie recently.

537
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,640
I heard the box office is doing well.

538
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,200
It's been a while
since we watched a movie together.

539
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,280
Let's watch this one.

540
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,360
I am too upset.

541
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,680
The more upset you are,...

542
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,160
the more you should let loose.

543
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,040
Come, my treat. Let's go.

544
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,880
Please, donate to this child.

545
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,840
Thank you, everyone.

546
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,520
Qiao Zhen, look.

547
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,280
What are they doing over there?

548
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,440
There are a lot of people.

549
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,480
Maybe there are people
who are having trouble

550
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,880
asking for donation.

551
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,760
It's quite common.

552
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,000
Thank you.

553
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,440
Thank you. This is from me.

554
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,440
Qiao Zhen,...

555
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,200
let's start a donation drive.

556
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,800
Are you serious?

557
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,400
Carrying a wooden box,...

558
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,320
asking for donation on the streets?

559
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,520
Won't you be embarrassed?

560
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,800
It's nothing.

561
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,440
Back then, to find a job,...

562
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,800
I even distributed flyers on the streets.

563
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,360
I'm going to print out some flyers.

564
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,000
On one hand, it's publicity for the play.

565
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,280
On the other hand, I can ask for donation.

566
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,760
I'll take whatever I can get.

567
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,680
I must do something...

568
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,960
for the play.

569
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,000
Xiaomeng,...

570
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,240
I wasn't very confident...

571
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,280
when I introduced you
to the production team.

572
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,040
I didn't expect you to be so committed.

573
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,120
You have no idea. This director...

574
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,160
not only gave me a job,

575
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,280
he also gave me

576
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,600
something very important.

577
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,600
What is it?

578
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,280
Confidence.

579
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,440
Thank you.

580
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,640
The tea tastes good.

581
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,760
It seems

582
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,640
you have run into some trouble,
haven't you?

583
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,520
Nothing escapes you,

584
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,920
Uncle Ling.

585
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,840
The troubles lately...

586
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,520
are stressing me out.

587
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,240
Do you have any plans?

588
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,000
The incidents lately...

589
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,840
have prohibited me

590
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,480
from using Shenghai Group's funding

591
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,800
for the sports center.

592
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,080
I'm going to look for...

593
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,280
suitable investors, domestic or overseas.

594
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,760
If I can get funding,...

595
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,600
the board of directors...

596
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,840
probably won't object to it
so vigorously anymore.

597
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,000
The board of directors...

598
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,800
are all scrutinizing you

599
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,880
closely.

600
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,160
They are hoping you'd make a mistake...

601
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,600
and they can make use of it

602
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,080
to attack you,...

603
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,520
especially Jiang Qingcheng.

604
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,240
He might not object to it openly,...

605
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,240
but his intention is clear.

606
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,440
He's very determined.

607
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,720
It's obvious that he and the rest...

608
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,720
are in it together.

609
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,920
This cunning fox is cornering you...

610
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,800
to be where you are now.

611
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,880
Exactly.

612
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,720
That's why I really don't know
what to do next.

613
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,640
A Yan,...

614
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,120
I remember that you used to box.

615
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,160
Yes, I still box occasionally.

616
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,560
Then you should understand that...

617
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,560
as a boxer,...

618
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,280
the most important thing in a match

619
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,560
is the fighting spirit.

620
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,160
It will make you strive harder.

621
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,000
It's the same in the business arena.

622
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,200
As long as you are...

623
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,720
courageous and calm,

624
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,960
you will not be defeated.

625
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,160
Don't be afraid to make new attempts...

626
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,760
or make mistakes.

627
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,320
Sometimes,

628
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,800
your courage will bring you victory.

629
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,360
You are right.

630
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,320
Why didn't I think of it?

631
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,840
It seems my effort spent on boxing

632
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,960
had gone to waste.

633
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,760
When you're the player,
you might not have the clarity.

634
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,680
You cared too much about what
you have to lose.

635
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,160
Sometimes,...

636
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,200
that will hinder you
from achieving victory.

637
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,880
You are right.

638
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,840
I was too eager to produce results.

639
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,040
But I can't make a mistake
in the next step.

640
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,800
This is

641
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,760
the latest tea for the year, isn't it?

642
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,320
Yes, newly harvested...

643
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,880
and not fermented yet.

644
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,800
Testing new tea leaves with new fire.

645
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,240
What is the next line?

646
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,880
Composing poems and drinking
while one's young.

647
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,680
Composing poems and drinking
while one's young.

648
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,160
I hope...

649
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,480
no matter what comes

650
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,560
next,...

651
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,320
don't let go of your initial ambition.

652
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,440
Don't be blinded

653
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,240
by winning or losing.

654
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,120
You are still young and have
lots of opportunities ahead of you.

655
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,680
It's not necessary

656
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,760
to force yourself to a corner.

657
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,800
Thank you, Uncle Ling.

658
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,320
I shall always remember your advice...

659
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,040
and guidance.

660
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,960
As for funding,...

661
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,200
I'll go back and discuss
with my shareholders

662
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,920
before I give you a reply.

663
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,400
This is not

664
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,680
a simple task.

665
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,320
I understand.

666
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,920
With your assurance,...

667
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,240
I feel much better.

668
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,080
Of course,...

669
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,240
the current market is not optimistic.

670
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,200
Many companies are holding back

671
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,800
on big projects.

672
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,920
Even if my Lingtian Group...

673
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,800
can provide funding,...

674
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,640
it would be limited.

675
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,520
You must be prepared.

676
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,680
I know.

677
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,240
I'm getting in touch
with other companies as well.

678
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,480
Good.

679
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,160
Xu, I've said this before.

680
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,120
You have a good eye.

681
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,880
Okay then.

682
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,840
Father.

683
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,480
Sure. I'll see you tonight.

684
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,680
My son, tonight,...

685
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,440
come with me to see a few friends.

686
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,160
But you have to promise me

687
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,040
you won't do things
that hurt the innocent anymore.

688
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,720
Or else, going forward,
I'm not going to help you again.

689
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,720
My son, can you

690
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,880
stop being so stubborn?

691
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,200
I suppose using Dikai Commercial City

692
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,320
to sabotage Zhou Yanzhao

693
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,680
wasn't your intention, was it?

694
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,840
Your intention is making money.

695
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,680
You never thought about

696
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,080
the innocent workers.

697
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,280
Father, if we work together,

698
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,320
we could have overpowered Zhou Yanzhao.

699
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,880
But why did you have to use

700
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,400
such despicable tactics?

701
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,920
Fine, fine.

702
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:01,880
Darn kid.

703
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,480
I promise you.

704
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,440
Tonight,

705
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,440
it's a legitimate business gathering.

706
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,280
Is it about Dikai Commercial City again?

707
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,520
Yes.

708
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,000
Son,...

709
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,160
for our business, we have to

710
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,320
make use of some old connections.

711
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,960
Father, regarding
Dikai Commercial City incident,

712
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,880
Zhou Yanzhao has become suspicious.

713
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,720
Tonight, we are going to see

714
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,880
the directors of Shenghai Group.

715
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,960
We cannot back off now.

716
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,800
I understand.

717
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,280
Tonight, we have to push them

718
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,440
to make a choice as soon as possible.

719
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,280
Make them choose between supporting us

720
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,160
or Zhou Yanzhao.

721
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,520
We can't let Zhou Yanzhao...

722
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,880
proceed with

723
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,160
the sports center anymore.

724
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,320
The directors of Shenghai Group
may appear

725
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,800
they are on our side now,...

726
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,120
it's hard to say

727
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,600
how they will be in the future.

728
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,960
Father, I understand.

729
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,560
The business arena
is as brutal as the battlefield.

730
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,720
Once we lose the upper hand,...

731
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,320
somebody is going to jump ship.

732
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,800
That's my boy indeed.

733
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,960
Be at your best tonight.

734
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,480
I know. Don't worry.

735
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,000
Xiaoyu.

736
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,120
Sister Hua.

737
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,200
What are you doing?

738
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,120
I'm cleaning the room.

739
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,280
On your first day,

740
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,520
I told you...

741
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,400
you don't have to clean this room.

742
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,360
Oh, I forgot.

743
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,720
You're young.

744
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,920
How can you not remember that?

745
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,120
I'm sorry, Sister Hua.

746
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,120
Anyway, Aunt Ye is

747
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,120
resting now.

748
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,880
I have nothing much to do.

749
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,800
So I thought I'd help you out.

750
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,760
It's not necessary.

751
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,400
Going forward, you don't have to

752
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,360
clean this room.

753
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,760
How about this?

754
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,200
Help me get something from the market.

755
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,560
I'll give you a grocery list.

756
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,920
Okay, Sister Hua.

757
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,800
(Proposal for donation)

758
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,560
(Donation Box)

759
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,760
Please donate to us.

760
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,520
Our play for children needs donation.

761
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,240
Hello, please donate to

762
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,480
our play for children.

763
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,880
Hello, this is

764
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,240
the donation booklet
of our stage production.

765
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,840
Can you take a look? Thank you.

766
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,200
Hello, this is

767
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,320
the donation booklet
of our stage production.

768
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,840
Can you take a look? Thank you.

769
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,480
Hello.

770
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,840
Hello.

771
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,280
All of you

772
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,400
play important roles at Shenghai Group.

773
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,080
Whatever you plan or do

774
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,280
is definitely

775
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,880
for the benefit of the company, isn't it?

776
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,760
For Shenghai Group,...

777
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,400
we must

778
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,440
be firm in our objection.

779
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,720
President Jiang, don't worry.

780
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,040
When Zhou Yanzhao decided on the project,

781
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,360
I objected,...

782
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,040
because I thought

783
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,600
projects like building sport centers

784
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,840
are not for Shenghai Group.

785
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,160
Yes, he's young

786
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,640
and way out of his league.

787
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,160
Isn't he?

788
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,680
Uncles, you are all very farsighted.

789
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:15,920
Thank you for your advice.

790
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,160
Like father like son.

791
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,160
That's right. He's outstanding.

792
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,920
Uncles,...

793
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,600
I have a question.

794
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,680
At the board of directors' meeting,...

795
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,680
you were all for the project.

796
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,200
Back then, I thought

797
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,960
Zhou Yanzhao's project

798
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,240
would only affect a small
part of Shenghai Group.

799
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,520
So I let him be.

800
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,520
I didn't want to be bothered with him.

801
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,000
But I didn't expect
his appetite to be this big.

802
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,120
When it comes to funding,...

803
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,520
we had to put in more and more money.

804
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,160
If this goes on,

805
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,680
there would be serious consequences.

806
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,040
That's right.

807
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,200
A Ze, haven't you heard

808
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,520
a saying before?

809
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,400
The business arena is ever changing.

810
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,480
The trend today...

811
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,040
may change just like that the next day.

812
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,320
Regardless it's our partners

813
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,560
or competitors,

814
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,360
the relationship is ever changing.

815
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,440
Understand?

816
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,920
Yes, Father.

817
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,360
I think

818
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,560
the uncles' and your
great minds think alike.

819
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,200
They won't change their minds easily.

820
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,480
Uncles,...

821
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,520
don't you agree?

822
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,080
Of course.

823
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,960
That's right.

824
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,640
A Ze, we are doing our best

825
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,640
for the benefit of the company.

826
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,120
For Shenghai Group,

827
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,120
your uncles here have the best intention.

828
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,960
Father, I understand that.

829
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,240
I wonder how Zhou Yanzhao...

830
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,960
view uncles though.

831
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,720
I heard that Zhou Yanzhao...

832
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,520
is working hard to get funding.

833
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,880
This is the circumstances

834
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,000
Shenghai Group is in now.

835
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,360
A while back,

836
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,840
because of the Commercial City incident,

837
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,080
our share price fell.

838
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,160
Right now, it's impossible

839
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,240
that other venture companies

840
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,720
would invest in us.

841
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,440
That's why going forward,

842
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,240
we must depend on you...

843
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,520
to completely

844
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,400
cut off his funding...

845
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,600
and defeat Zhou Yanzhao,

846
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,800
so we can take back the power.

847
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,520
Don't worry, Vice President Jiang.

848
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,760
We are right behind you.

849
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,800
No matter what decision you make,

850
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,240
we will support you.

851
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,760
That's right.

852
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,440
Since we've reached an agreement,

853
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,680
we should take care of the rest

854
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,840
as soon as possible.

855
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,480
Vice President Jiang,

856
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,880
I have to go.

857
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,400
We have to go too.

858
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,600
Take care.

859
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,600
Goodbye, Uncles.

860
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,560
A Ze,...

861
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,000
you can't be

862
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,120
that blunt when you talk.

863
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,240
I'm ready, Father.

864
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,480
It's about carrot and stick.

865
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,560
I understand that.

866
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,000
Xiaomeng, you're back.

867
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,280
Xiaoyu, where is my mother?

868
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,200
Aunt Ye is in her bedroom.

869
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,840
After having breakfast,

870
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,840
she went for a walk

871
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,840
at the garden.

872
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,120
She is

873
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,160
in a good mood.

874
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,960
I see.

875
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,280
Thank you, Xiaoyu.

876
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,360
You are welcome.
