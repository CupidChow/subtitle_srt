1
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,800
(Episode 31)

2
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,120
I think this is simple.

3
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,280
The whole point of me
working so hard all this time

4
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,520
is so that I can be with...

5
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,760
the things I like.

6
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,320
A Yan.

7
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,520
After I start working at the theater,

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,440
I might not have much time
to take care of my mom.

9
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,760
But her condition is still serious.

10
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,200
I'm worried that she might wander off

11
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,720
and get lost like last time.

12
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,840
I'll hire an experienced young person
to take care of her.

13
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,640
Thank you, A Yan.

14
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,800
You don't have to thank me.

15
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,560
Like you said before,

16
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,920
don't complicate things
that are actually simple.

17
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,520
Just do them.

18
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,240
But it's not that simple to me.

19
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,400
I just wanted to say thank you.

20
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,160
Don't sleep here anymore.

21
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,960
You'll catch a cold.

22
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,360
Hello?

23
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,560
This time,
I hope you won't disappoint me again.

24
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,520
Don't forget that

25
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,440
your brother-in-law is still in prison.

26
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,640
Yes.

27
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,960
One more thing.

28
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,280
I need you to keep tabs on another person.

29
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,120
Who?

30
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,360
Jiang Ze.

31
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,360
Jiang Ze?

32
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,800
-Isn't he--
-I don't need you to tell me.

33
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,360
Just do what I've told you.

34
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,640
All right. I understand.

35
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,160
Even a vicious tiger
wouldn't eat its own cubs.

36
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,640
What's he up to?

37
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,200
Psycho.

38
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,240
Hello?

39
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,280
What's up?

40
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,600
What's so urgent?

41
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,160
Yes. I'm your dad's pawn.

42
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,920
You...

43
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,360
Under your dad's instructions,

44
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,680
no, commands,

45
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,600
I've done many things.

46
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,000
Many bad things.

47
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,440
I wanted to tell you that

48
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,240
if he goes on like this,

49
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,400
he'll do irreparable damage.

50
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,480
What nonsense are you talking about?

51
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,280
Do you know that your dad
has asked me to keep tabs on you?

52
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,920
What?

53
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,280
You heard me right.

54
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,320
Okay, I got it.

55
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,800
I thought Jiang Qingcheng said that
everything's settled with the families?

56
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,560
The family of an injured worker
is still very emotional

57
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and has filed a lawsuit against Shenghai.

58
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,400
Chairman Zhou,

59
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,360
I think it's not necessarily a bad thing
if we went through the legal proceeding.

60
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,760
I agree with Lingxi.

61
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,880
We'll let the court decide our liability.

62
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,400
No. I don't want the case to go to court.

63
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,760
Not only will it worsen our relationships.

64
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,360
We'll get more unwanted media attention.

65
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,720
Anything can have a negative impact
on Shenghai Group now.

66
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,560
What should we do, then, Chairman Zhou?

67
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,640
Let me meet them first.

68
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,000
I'll go with you.

69
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,400
Lingxi...

70
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,720
What's the matter?

71
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,880
I think an occasion like that
isn't for a woman.

72
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,280
Chairman Zhou, why don't I go with you?

73
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,160
Qingyan,

74
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,240
contact our legal department
and see what we should do next.

75
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,640
Come with me, Lingxi.

76
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,000
The gentleness of a woman can help

77
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,160
break the ice in that situation.

78
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,040
Okay.

79
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,400
Xiaomeng,

80
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,200
your suggestion is great.

81
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,600
Let Peter Pan embark
on different adventures.

82
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,760
Let the kids experience
different wonderful journeys.

83
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,840
Good. Very good.

84
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,480
Well, they're just my own personal ideas.

85
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,360
There's still room for improvement
in many aspects.

86
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,840
After all,
I'm still an amateur in this field.

87
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,200
You're too humble.

88
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,440
You're indeed a professional
in the field of kids' shows.

89
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,960
You know precisely what kids like.

90
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,280
The kids will surely love this story
after the revision.

91
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,360
Xiaomeng...

92
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,480
everyone is young here

93
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,720
at this theater company.

94
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,920
And young people are easy to talk to.

95
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,320
I have a favor to ask.

96
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,320
Sure.

97
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,920
Could you rewrite the script?

98
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,120
Director,

99
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,200
I've never done that kind of work before.

100
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,320
In the past, I did write

101
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,800
some fairy-tale stories
for kids sometimes,

102
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,920
but they're very different from a script.

103
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,720
I'm not confident I can do that.

104
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,880
Even if you study scriptwriting,

105
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,240
a college graduate needs a chance
to put theories into practice.

106
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,640
Look at this as practice.

107
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,240
The area where you're better
than a professional

108
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,320
is in knowing precisely what kids like.

109
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,480
Try it once.

110
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,440
But this is my first time
taking part in a play.

111
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,560
There are many things I still don't know.

112
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,080
Don't give yourself too much pressure.

113
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,080
It's very simple.

114
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,520
Just change the dialogue

115
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,120
in a way that kids can identify with.

116
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,920
But I--

117
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,960
No more buts.

118
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,040
Xiaomeng...

119
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,880
we've discussed a number of times.

120
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,640
You've made good suggestions.

121
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,440
I believe you'll be able
to handle this task well.

122
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,080
What you're lacking isn't experience
but confidence.

123
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,760
Director, thanks for believing in me.

124
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,880
Here's what I'll do.

125
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,920
When I get home,
I'll study the script in detail.

126
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,440
Then I'll make some changes.

127
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,800
Once you've had a chance to review it,

128
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,400
please feel free to criticize

129
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,320
if there's anything that's
not up to standard or inappropriate.

130
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,640
Exactly.

131
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,200
Criticism is too harsh.
Mistakes are okay. You still have me.

132
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,000
Okay. I'll give it a try.

133
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,040
You can do it.

134
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,520
All right.

135
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,600
All right, no more chitchat.

136
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,680
Let's continue our rehearsal.

137
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,000
Let's do it based on
the changes we talked about.

138
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,400
-Okay.
-Okay.

139
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,120
Make sure you're all tucked in.

140
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,760
-I'm fine.
-Have an apple.

141
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,360
Make sure you stay warm at night.

142
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,560
Thanks, Mom.

143
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,360
Feeling better?

144
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,640
How dare you come here!

145
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,160
There's nothing to say.

146
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,400
See you in court.

147
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,600
That's right.

148
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,760
You dare use substandard materials.

149
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,880
It's all said and done.

150
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,960
Are you scared to see the judge in court?

151
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,800
Before we take this to court,
I have something to say.

152
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:27,960
May I?

153
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,400
Who wants your petty favors?

154
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,400
Do you think

155
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,920
we'll let you off the hook
because of these?

156
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,160
Never!

157
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,880
About what happened, we're really sorry.

158
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,880
Sorry?

159
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,280
Can your sorry help my husband recover?

160
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,840
Do you have any idea

161
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,480
how bad his injury is?

162
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Please calm down.

163
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,840
This isn't something
we want to see happening either.

164
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,760
Hold on.

165
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,160
Listen to me.

166
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,520
Our entire family

167
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,520
depends on him.

168
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,880
It's clear that you all decided
to use substandard building materials

169
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,040
to maximize your profits!

170
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,320
Regarding that, please be assured that

171
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,560
Shenghai Group will investigate thoroughly
and assume liability.

172
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,520
Investigate?

173
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,320
Do you think we're stupid?

174
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,560
If there wasn't someone in the company

175
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,400
to cover for him, would he dare do that?

176
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,560
You're all in cahoots!

177
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,520
Regarding that,

178
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,240
we'll cooperate with all relevant agencies
on the investigation.

179
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,560
We'll find the culprit
and give you an explanation.

180
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,760
Explanation?

181
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,840
Since the incident,

182
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,280
do you know what we've gone through?

183
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,560
Do you know how this incident affects us?

184
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,480
Please calm down.

185
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,400
Chairman Zhou came here in person.

186
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,920
We'll take full responsibility for this.

187
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,560
Would you please trust us?

188
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,800
Please take this first.

189
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,920
We'll definitely do
everything we can to help you.

190
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,200
You're buying lives with money.

191
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,400
No.

192
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,800
This is just something to show you
how sorry I am personally.

193
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,840
If you insist on settling this in court,

194
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,440
I'll respect your decision.

195
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,960
Regardless of
whether any legal action is taken,

196
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,120
the compensation from me
will remain the same.

197
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,240
I want to help you get through this

198
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,640
both mentally and financially.

199
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,400
Please believe me.

200
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,960
I feel sorry for these injured workers.

201
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,600
Their livelihoods aren't protected.

202
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,440
Personal rights could be easily infringed.

203
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,240
If they happen to have a coldhearted boss,

204
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
forget about treatment.

205
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,640
They probably won't even get their wages
when something like this happens.

206
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,240
Well, whatever will be will be.

207
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,760
If they actually file a lawsuit,

208
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,440
I'll respect their decision.

209
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,520
It makes me sad seeing these families.

210
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,880
I hope they recover soon.

211
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,600
Shenghai will do its best
to take care of its employees,

212
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,200
including people in the same industry.

213
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,480
Are you okay?

214
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,400
I think I've sprained my ankle.

215
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,080
Don't move and wait here.

216
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,040
I'll be back.

217
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,760
Here?

218
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,840
It hurts!

219
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,720
Here?

220
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,720
It hurts too.

221
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,040
Here?

222
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,080
It hurts.

223
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,320
Doctor, how is she?

224
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,520
I'd suggest that she get an X-ray done

225
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,760
to see if any bones were damaged.

226
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,560
Chairman Zhou, you've got a lot to do.

227
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,240
I'll just find a caretaker.

228
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,960
Mom, please answer the doctor's questions
when you see him later.

229
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,080
He asks so many questions every time.

230
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,680
He's annoying.

231
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,760
Listen to me. I've recovered.

232
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,080
I can count from one to 50.

233
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,160
If you don't believe me, I'll show you.

234
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,200
I believe you.

235
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,360
That's why we should
let the doctor confirm it.

236
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,840
All right.

237
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,400
Let's go.

238
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,280
What a coincidence, Xiaomeng.

239
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,080
Is Aunt Ye here for a checkup?

240
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,920
Yes. A routine checkup.

241
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,240
What's wrong, Lingxi?

242
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,680
Are you all right?

243
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,400
I sprained my ankle earlier

244
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,760
when I was with Chairman Zhou.

245
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,600
I'm sorry for causing
Chairman Zhou so much trouble.

246
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,160
Is it serious?

247
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,640
Do you need my help?

248
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,760
I'm fine. I've just had an X-ray done.

249
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,960
I'm waiting for the result.

250
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,480
I've told Chairman Zhou
that he doesn't need to stay for me.

251
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,800
He didn't listen and insisted
on keeping me company.

252
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,880
That's right.

253
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,760
A Yan has always been good
to his employees.

254
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,680
Yes. He said...

255
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,680
I got hurt because of him.

256
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,720
So he'll never leave me.

257
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,480
Aunt Ye, you look much better now.

258
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,880
I'll visit you when my ankle heals.

259
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,800
All right. Take care of yourself.

260
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,680
Let's go.

261
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,320
The result should be out.

262
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,560
Go home as soon as you're done here.

263
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,360
I'll have Guang take you home.

264
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,880
Xiaomeng, A Yan said we can go home.

265
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,040
All right, Mom.

266
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,960
We'll go home after seeing the doctor.

267
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,720
All right.

268
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,520
During this time,

269
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,160
stay home and rest.

270
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,480
You don't need to go to the office.

271
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,280
Now is a crucial time for Shenghai Group.

272
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,320
I can't be away.

273
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,240
The injury is minor.

274
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,600
Two days' rest will do.

275
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,000
Rest well and don't worry about work.

276
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,240
I'll be going now.

277
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,480
Let me see you out.

278
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,440
It's okay.

279
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,480
Lingxi.

280
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,680
Stop talking. Give me one minute.

281
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,560
Just hold me like this.

282
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,000
I just need one minute.

283
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,680
It really hurts.

284
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:10,960
Feeling better now?

285
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,840
No, it's even worse.

286
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,600
How can I help you?

287
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,280
Love me.

288
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,560
I'm sorry.

289
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,920
We've talked about this.

290
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,760
Why?

291
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,680
Why can't you give me a chance?

292
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,240
Why can't we give each other a chance?

293
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,960
You can't be with
the person you want to protect.

294
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,000
Do you want to be like this
for the rest of your life?

295
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,280
I have one question for you.

296
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,080
Haven't you ever had feelings for me?

297
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,200
The way I see you

298
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,000
is nothing more than a normal man
admiring a fine woman.

299
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,680
That's it.

300
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,760
If I've ever misled you in any way,
I am truly sorry.

301
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,600
Then why are you so good to me?

302
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,200
You were injured because of me.

303
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,400
As a boss or a friend,

304
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,240
I should look after you.

305
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,120
Don't overthink this.

306
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,120
Do I really...

307
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,640
not have the slightest chance?

308
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,680
You should take a break
and deal with your emotions.

309
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,200
I know that you want me
to leave Shenghai Group

310
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,720
so you won't have to see me again.

311
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Do you really have to be so cruel
to someone who's in love with you?

312
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,080
If you want to get a different job,

313
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,800
I can make some recommendations for you.

314
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,920
Of course, that is up to you.

315
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,800
Let's wait until you've recovered.

316
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,120
Ms. Sun and A Yan...

317
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,600
aren't a good match.

318
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,920
What are you talking about, Mom?

319
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,440
You said she was pretty a few days ago.

320
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,480
You said she's A Yan's girlfriend.

321
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,480
Why have you had
a sudden change of heart today?

322
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,600
Xiaomeng...

323
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,680
can't stay here.

324
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,080
Mom, it's time to take your medicine.

325
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,160
Go to bed after taking them.

326
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,120
Here, let me tuck you in.

327
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,560
A Yan.

328
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,400
A Yan.

329
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,600
What's the matter?

330
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,160
You're home so late.

331
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,440
Did you take Lingxi home?

332
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
How is she?

333
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,040
She's fine.

334
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,120
Is she badly injured?

335
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,920
It's not serious.

336
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,840
She'll be fine after some rest.

337
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,520
You're so good to her.

338
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,720
She must be so touched.

339
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,720
Since she's injured,

340
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,760
it's only reasonable
that you pay more attention to her.

341
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,240
How is Aunt Ye doing?

342
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,960
Did the doctor say anything?

343
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,640
What?

344
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,840
Are you talking about my mom?

345
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,800
You just called her "Aunt."

346
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,360
After all, she was my dad's doctor,

347
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
and she's your mom.

348
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,680
The doctor said the injury to her brain
has already healed.

349
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,600
Her memory
can now be pieced back together.

350
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,600
It's only a matter of time now.

351
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,200
That's good.

352
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,120
A Yan.

353
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,400
Anything else?

354
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,760
I feel like... you've changed a lot.

355
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,000
In what way?

356
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,680
You're more like your old self.

Sister Hua,

364
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,240
I have to take this call. Excuse me.

365
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,480
Okay. I got it.

366
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,680
I'll do as you instructed.

367
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,000
Sister Hua.

368
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,920
Have you finished?

369
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,720
Yes. It was from home.

370
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,560
From now on,

371
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,160
put your phone on silent or vibrate

372
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,480
when you're at the Zhous'.

373
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,160
Don't be so noisy. You hear me?

374
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,800
Got it, sister Hua.

375
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,760
Jiang Ze, come on in.

376
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,360
Have a seat.

377
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,880
This morning, I was informed
that the families have agreed

378
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,080
to drop the lawsuit
and accept the settlement.

379
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,000
That's good.

380
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,560
I heard that you discussed
this matter with them in person.

381
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,600
I just wanted to tell them
where I stand on this issue.

382
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,000
I'm fine with it
if they want to take legal action.

383
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,080
It's even better
that they're willing to settle.

384
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,840
I think the families
are all reasonable people.

385
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,120
They decided what to do
after seeing where we stand on the issue.

386
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,400
Have you considered...

387
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,560
the possibility that someone
within the company was responsible?

388
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,120
It wouldn't be surprising
if that's the case.

389
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,520
Chairman Zhou,
we got the investigation report.

390
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,680
The person in charge of
the construction company, Ronghui,

391
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,760
decided to use substandard materials
to increase profits.

392
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,240
He's confessed to everything.

393
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,520
Any accomplices?

394
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,640
He admitted to everything.

395
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,000
I'll arrange for the compensation

396
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,280
to the families of the injured workers.

397
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,200
Treat them fairly.

398
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,640
And attend the press conference
with Chang Qingyan.

399
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,200
Welcome, Xiaoyu.

400
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,440
I'll leave my mom to you from now on.

401
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,960
Don't worry, Xiaomeng.

402
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,880
I can do everything,
and I'll do a good job.

403
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,960
Your main responsibility
is to take care of my mom.

404
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,280
Just help sister Hua when you have time.

405
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,360
Your most important job
is to take good care of Doctor Ye.

406
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,680
Okay. I'll show her around.

407
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,880
Sure, go ahead.

408
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,000
-Follow me.
-Yes.

409
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,480
-Xiaoyu.
-Yes.

410
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,440
The living room is over there.

411
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,200
That's the kitchen.

412
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,200
-Yes.
-Come with me.

413
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,480
This is the storage.

414
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,640
-Okay.
-Let's go upstairs now.

415
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,960
Huh? Why are you still holding the bag?

416
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,240
Go put it down.

417
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,280
Okay.

418
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,120
Xiaoyu.

419
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,160
What's the matter, sister Hua?

420
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,280
Listen.

421
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,120
This used to be Mr. Zhou's study.

422
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,360
I'm the one who cleans it.
You stay out of it.

423
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,600
Okay. I got it.

424
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,560
Follow me.

425
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,800
Look.

426
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,440
This is A Yan's room.

427
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,440
The bathroom is there.

428
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,720
Okay.

429
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,640
This is Xiaomeng's room.

430
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,440
That's the bathroom.

431
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,200
-Okay, got it.
-Let's go.

432
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,400
Xiaomeng.

433
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,280
-Xiaomeng.
-How's the tour of the house going?

434
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,920
-Good.
-Good.

435
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,560
I'm taking her to your mom's room now.

436
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,960
Xiaoyu, let me take you to see my mom.

437
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,920
Okay.

438
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:17,880
She's asleep.

439
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,240
This is my mom's room.

440
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,880
I'll leave my mom to your capable hands
from now on.

441
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,720
Oh, right, before you got here,

442
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,880
did sister Hua tell you
about my mom's condition?

443
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,960
Yes, she did.

444
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,320
I know a little bit about it as well.

445
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,200
That's good.

446
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,120
In the beginning, it may be hard for you.

447
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,520
But you'll adjust.

448
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,280
My mom's memory is muddled.

449
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,320
She gets confused easily.

450
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,120
That's why you'll need to pay
more attention when you care for her.

451
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,040
I'll do my best, Xiaomeng.

452
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,720
Mom, did we wake you up?

453
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,840
Xiaomeng...

454
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,200
is she your classmate?

455
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,040
Aunt Ye,

456
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,880
I'm the new caregiver. My name is Xiaoyu.

457
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,240
Mom.

458
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,840
Think about it.

459
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,520
Sister Hua's getting old.

460
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,280
She also needs rest.

461
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,280
Let Xiaoyu care for you from now on.

462
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,280
All right?

463
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,200
No.

464
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,600
Mom, listen to me.

465
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,120
Xiaoyu is good at taking care of people.

466
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,200
You have nothing to worry about.

467
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,520
I want some water.

468
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,360
Sure.

469
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,360
Aunt Ye, your water.

470
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,720
I've checked the temperature.

471
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,320
It's just right.

472
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,920
My mom's condition is unstable.

473
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,720
Please pay more attention.

474
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,040
Of course, Xiaomeng.

475
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,160
I will take good care of Aunt Ye.

476
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,280
I'm going to be late.

477
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,400
Mom, I'm going to the theater to rehearse.

478
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,000
Stay home today
and let Xiaoyu look after you.

479
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,240
Go ahead.

480
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,560
Listen to your teachers, okay?

481
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,840
I'll be heading out.

482
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,760
Aunt Ye, what food do you like?

483
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,240
I can cook anything.

484
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,280
Why don't I make you something delicious?

485
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,120
Here.

486
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,960
Come on.

487
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,400
The person in charge of Ronghui Group
has confessed

488
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,600
and will take full responsibility.

489
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,680
He will likely be fined and sentenced to

490
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,920
at least 5 to 10 years' prison time for
using substandard construction materials.

491
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,240
Don't cry.

492
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,760
There's no use crying now.

493
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,560
If Brother-in-Law shows good behavior,

494
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,680
I'll help him get a commutation.

495
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,240
Even if he gets one,

496
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,520
he still has to serve five to six years.

497
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,200
How will he get through this?

498
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,200
I've told him
not to lay his hands on dirty money.

499
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,640
He wouldn't listen to me!

500
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,640
All right... there's no point
in saying that now.

501
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,880
Don't cry.

502
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,080
Sister,

503
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,200
you two took care of me in the past.

504
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,240
It's my turn to take care of you now.

505
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,640
I'll find a way to help him.

506
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:09,960
Please don't cry.

507
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,840
Oh, Lingxi.

508
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,160
Your brother-in-law told me
to give you this before he was arrested.

509
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,400
It's important.

510
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,880
This information
can get someone to save him.

511
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,880
Xiaomeng.

512
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,320
Director.

513
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,800
Your revision of the script is very good.

514
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,880
It's captivating.

515
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,680
Thanks for your compliment, Director.

516
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,640
This is my first time.

517
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,920
There are still a lot of things
I don't quite understand yet.

518
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:25,400
I plan to make some more detailed changes
during the rehearsal.

519
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,040
You see? I'm right about you.

520
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,400
You're quite capable.

521
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,160
There are a few more scenes
that need to be revised.

522
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,440
I'll give the task to you.

523
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,200
Are you sure, Director?

524
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,280
Of course. Have more confidence.

525
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,360
Okay. I'll work even harder

526
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,800
because of your trust.

527
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,040
Use your imagination
and conquer this stage.

528
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,280
I will.

529
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,600
Okay, next scene.

530
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,760
Aunt Ye.

531
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,200
Sister Hua said this is the study.

532
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,000
Shall we go inside, sit down,
and read some books?

533
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,480
What's the matter, Aunt Ye?

534
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,880
I... I don't want to go near there.

535
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,200
Are you afraid?

536
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,760
Let's... Let's go back.

537
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,360
Aunt Ye, sister Hua said
it used to be Mr. Zhou's study.

538
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,080
Weren't you his doctor?
Why are you afraid?

539
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,640
-Let's go. I want to go back to my room.
-Aunt Ye.

540
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,840
-Back to my room.
-Aunt Ye.

541
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,960
-Let me go back.
-What's going on?

542
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,080
-Please!
-Aunt Ye!

543
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,320
-What's going on?
-Sister Hua.

544
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,880
Aunt Ye became emotionally unstable
when she walked by here.

545
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,160
Look at her.

546
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,720
I want to go back to my room.

547
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,040
It's okay. Don't be scared.

548
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,160
It's all right.

549
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,320
Don't let her get close to this room
from now on.

550
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,760
-Okay.
-It's fine.

551
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,560
Xiaomeng said I shouldn't go inside.

552
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,400
But...

553
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,440
why does Aunt Ye look...

554
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,280
so afraid?

555
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,360
That's none of your business.

556
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,560
Don't ever ask again.

557
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,800
And don't ever mention this incident
in this house.

558
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,000
Yes, sister Hua.

559
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,480
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

560
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,400
You're fine.

561
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,720
Let's go.

562
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,000
-Let's go.
-Let's go now.

563
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,840
-Okay.
-Let's go now.

564
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,800
It's all right. Don't be afraid.

565
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,680
What are you doing?

566
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,240
Hurry, give it to me.

567
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,520
Xiaomeng and A Yan will be back soon.

568
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,560
I'm cooking for them.

569
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,880
Okay, but be careful.

570
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,880
Don't hurt yourself.

571
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,120
Don't worry.

572
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,760
I'll be fine.

573
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,520
If I'd known you can cook,
I'd have asked you to cook with me.

574
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,240
You haven't said anything about cooking
since you got here.

575
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,120
I thought all of you intellectuals
can't cook.

576
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,760
I'm the one who cooked for Xiaomeng
in the past.

577
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:08,600
Xiaomeng loves my cooking.

578
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,480
Later, when we came here,

579
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,040
it was for work.

580
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,520
It's not appropriate
to talk about things like that.

581
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,360
President Jiang, this is your share.

582
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,240
It's only half of what we've agreed on.

583
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,360
The project is under way.

584
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,160
There have been a lot of expenses.

585
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,320
Don't worry. I'll give you what remains

586
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,240
as soon as I can.

587
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,440
Be quick.

588
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,480
Also, here's a reminder for you.

589
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,040
Think carefully about
where you'll use these materials.

590
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,800
Don't make a mistake.

591
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,440
None of us can bear this responsibility.

592
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,120
Don't worry. I've got a plan.

593
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,360
We'll be fine.

594
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,440
Here's the soup.

595
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,920
Chinese yam with pork ribs soup.
Aunt Ye made it.

596
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,920
Xiaomeng, Aunt Ye said

597
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,000
it was your favorite soup.

598
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,000
A Yan, I forgot to introduce her to you.

599
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,520
She's the new caregiver.

600
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,600
Her name is Xiaoyu.

601
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,080
She's honest and hardworking.

602
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,080
She's trustworthy.

603
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,040
Xiaoyu...

604
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,840
this is Mr. Zhou.

605
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,640
He's the master of this house.

606
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,040
Mr. Zhou.

607
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,400
Just focus on your work.

608
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,760
You can go now.

609
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,640
-Yes.
-Come and help me clean up.

610
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,640
Here, try it.

611
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,680
See if you like my soup.

612
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,080
Mom, I haven't had your soup
in a long time.

613
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,000
A Yan, here you go.

614
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,520
Mom will ladle some soup for you.

615
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,320
More pork ribs.

616
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,880
Try it.

617
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,400
It's so salty.

618
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,640
A Yan, my mom...

619
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,960
must have forgotten
that she'd added salt to the soup

620
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,440
and then added some again.

621
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,200
The soup is too salty.

622
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,520
Don't drink it.

623
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,880
It's okay. I can drink it.

624
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,040
A Yan, you like it?

625
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,120
That's great...

626
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,880
I'll make you soup every day.

627
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,600
Aunt Ye... thank you.

628
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,160
Have some more. Have more if you like it.

629
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,480
A Yan seems to be his old self again.

630
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,200
I've called this meeting

631
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,720
to talk about the plan
for phase two of the Sports Center.

632
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,040
Chairman Zhou,

633
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,560
we think that based on
our current situation,

634
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,720
we should put the Sports Center project
on hold.

635
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,240
Yes, I agree.

636
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,400
This is my fault.

637
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,600
The Dikai Commercial City incident

638
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,800
has caused our company great loss.

639
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,680
The company's reputation
has also been affected negatively.

640
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,440
These are all my fault.

641
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,200
However, the company
isn't doing well financially.

642
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,240
We need to put in a lot of money

643
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,760
for phase two
of the Sports Center project.

644
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,680
So I think the project
should be postponed.

645
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,080
But all of you should know...

646
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,800
that the Sports Center project
is different from other projects.

647
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,800
The plan for the project
is complete and integrated.

648
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,760
Phase one only covers the infrastructure.

649
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,200
The fairy-tale theme in phase two
is the key feature of my design.

650
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,480
It's an entity that can't be taken apart.

651
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,360
Chairman Zhou, business is business.

652
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,040
We all know that

653
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,240
the investment costs for this project
are too large,

654
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,760
and the profit cycle takes too long.

655
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,400
It isn't the best option
for Shenghai Group at the moment.

656
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,920
Right. I'd suggest that...

657
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,600
we sell this project to a local company

658
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,480
in order to minimize our losses.

659
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,360
It's like ripping off the Band-Aid.

660
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,560
If we don't stop now,

661
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,440
we may suffer even greater losses.

662
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,000
Although this project
can't guarantee a short-term return,

663
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,920
its potential market value is huge.

664
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,240
It'll bring Shenghai
a sizeable financial profit in the future.

665
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,120
It'll also contribute to a good reputation
for the company.

666
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,640
This is a virtuous cycle.

667
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,280
The hidden benefit
it can bring to Shenghai

668
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,760
is beyond comparison
to previous real estate projects.

669
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,120
A Yan,

670
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,560
you should know that a rupture
in the capital chain is very dangerous.

671
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,000
It'll drag down the whole company.

672
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,600
If the company is gone,

673
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,080
what's the use of market value
and hidden profits?

674
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,760
Young people are inexperienced and proud.

675
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,200
They can be far too ambitious.

676
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,960
We can all understand.

677
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,320
The board of directors is here

678
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,480
to give instructions and prevent

679
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,960
directional errors during decision-making.
