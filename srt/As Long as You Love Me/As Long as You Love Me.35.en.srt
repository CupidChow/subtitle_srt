1
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,720
(Episode 35)

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,080
This girl is not bad.

3
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,360
Innocent look and poised composure.

4
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,840
She has great presence before the camera.

5
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,160
She has potential.

6
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,920
You can trust my taste.

7
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,120
Good. very good.

8
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,600
Your girlfriend wants to
be the spokesperson too.

9
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,920
Between them,...

10
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,920
who do you think

11
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,880
is more suitable?

12
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,080
Who's my girlfriend?

13
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,880
Miss Zitong.

14
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,280
Her?

15
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,360
She definitely wants to be

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,960
the spokesperson for Shenghai Group.

17
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,680
Mr. Jiang, you mean...

18
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,440
You're the director.

19
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,520
It all depends on your discerning eyes.

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,200
Deep down you know

21
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,080
who's more suitable for the job.

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We're done. Thanks.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,200
You can go change. Thanks.

24
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,240
Okay. Thanks.

25
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,080
Good job, Xiaomeng.

26
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,160
(Nongfu Spring)

27
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,720
Xiaomeng,...

28
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,600
you must be tired, have some water.

29
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,960
The lights are too dim.

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,480
-Thank you.
-Ask the staff to adjust it later.

31
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,320
Okay.

32
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,680
You've been watching. How is it?

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,320
I haven't taken pictures for a while.

34
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,960
I was so nervous earlier.

35
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,280
You did very well.

36
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,000
The director was just praising you.

37
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,320
Really?

38
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,360
Yes.

39
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,560
The director must have known

40
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,720
that I was very nervous.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,840
Go take a rest.

42
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,000
We have more shooting later.

43
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,520
Director Ning,

44
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,360
what do you mean
by those photos you just sent?

45
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm sure you know

46
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,360
the person in the photo.

47
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,320
Her supporter's background

48
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,560
seems to be stronger than yours.

49
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,640
Director Ning, don't be misled.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,840
Although she knows chairman of Shenghai,

51
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,240
there are grievances
and resentment between them.

52
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,040
Her mother has been involved
in the murder of Chairman Zhou's father.

53
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,200
Chairman Zhou and her
are at daggers drawn now.

54
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,120
Miss Zitong,

55
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,560
relax.

56
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,000
I told you I'd help you.

57
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,320
I won't go back on my words.

58
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,960
But it looks like

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,760
it'll be difficult for us
to push for this now.

60
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,800
Director Ning, how about this?

61
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,160
If you can settle this for me,

62
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,760
I'll give you all my endorsement fee.

63
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,400
Zitong,

64
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,040
to be honest,

65
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,800
I was just sitting
next to your boyfriend, Mr. Jiang.

66
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,400
We had a long chat.

67
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,920
If we can pull this off,

68
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,400
we'll have more opportunities
to work together in the future.

69
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,360
Director Ning,

70
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,160
do you mean...

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,440
I can replace Xiaomeng?

72
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,360
No...

73
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,760
The protagonist has been decided.

74
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,920
It's Xiaomeng.

75
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,200
This...

76
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,200
Although the protagonist's decided,

77
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,760
nobody's stopping me
from using two actresses.

78
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,680
You know what I mean?

79
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,920
Director Ning, you're so smart.

80
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,360
These are the publicity photos
for our promotional video.

81
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,840
Our main concept
for this promotional video

82
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,800
is based on an adult perspective

83
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,120
of recalling the carefree
and happy times of childhood,

84
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,200
and the positive attitude
brought about by sports.

85
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,600
All these are closely linked
to our sports center.

86
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,400
This is our current idea.

87
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,600
Director Ning,

88
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,560
do you have anything to add?

89
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,320
Director Jiang has put it nicely.

90
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,320
Childhood and dreams

91
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,040
are the themes of our video.

92
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,200
Our protagonist

93
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,000
will be played by Zhou Xiaomeng.

94
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,680
We've cast an excellent actress.

95
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,680
But I have noted a very serious issue.

96
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,280
The plot at this stage

97
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,960
is kind of weak.

98
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,920
Xiaomeng is

99
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,400
the only protagonist in the video.

100
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,920
It seems too simple.

101
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,040
The key is that her inner world

102
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,920
resonates with the outside world

103
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,360
through interaction.

104
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,760
Hence I suggest

105
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,440
adding a supporting character for her.

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,960
It can be her classmate,

107
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,200
friend or best friend.

108
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,400
Wouldn't it be better?

109
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,920
This is a good suggestion.

110
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,960
But our shooting will start soon.

111
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,200
We may not have the time to find

112
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,240
a suitable candidate.

113
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,280
Director Jiang,

114
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,240
I have prepared a suitable candidate.

115
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,760
Hello.

116
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,080
You can come in now.

117
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,840
(Shenghai Group)

118
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,440
Zitong?

119
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,200
Let me introduce her.

120
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,520
She's the most suitable candidate.

121
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,560
Director, please sit.

122
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,360
Hello, I'm Zitong.

123
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,560
I look forward to working with you.

124
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,560
Considering the overall effect
of the promotional video,

125
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,200
I recommend to cast Miss Zitong

126
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,480
as the second character in the video.

127
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,880
The overall interaction
of the plot will be better.

128
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,680
I also believe Miss Zitong

129
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,240
will bring more energy

130
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,720
to our promotional video.

131
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,520
Xiaomeng,

132
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,560
what do you think of this proposal?

133
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,360
Well...

134
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,600
I think...

135
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,880
it's not bad.

136
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,840
Director Jiang,...

137
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,880
it's settled then.

138
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,360
Okay.

139
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,120
Submit this proposal to Chairman Zhou.

140
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,600
If he approves,

141
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,440
we'll proceed with this proposal.

142
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
Zitong,

143
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,720
can you tell me what's going on?

144
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,760
You're leaving tomorrow.

145
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,920
Why aren't you resting yet?

146
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,320
I can't sleep.

147
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,040
Why? You're stressed?

148
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,520
A second female protagonist

149
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,720
has been added to the promotional video.

150
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,080
I know.

151
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,720
Does it affect you?

152
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,440
It's like this world.

153
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,040
An intimate person can become a stranger,

154
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,800
while a stranger

155
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,400
can wear a smiling mask

156
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,880
and talk to you intimately.

157
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,880
Do you agree?

158
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,680
I never waste my time
guessing the minds of others.

159
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,240
My experiences in life tell me

160
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,440
that I should believe my own eyes

161
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,200
and heart.

162
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,720
If possible,...

163
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,200
I want to visit your heart to take a look.

164
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,320
You're leaving for Luofeng tomorrow.

165
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,840
You should rest.

166
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,640
Supervisor Yu, I'm here. Where are you?

167
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,880
Lulu, he's here.

168
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,520
-Yu Fei.
-Over here.

169
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,600
You're finally here.

170
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,880
Here, please have a seat.

171
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,640
She is...

172
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,760
Let me introduce her.

173
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,920
She's Chen Lulu,

174
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,080
HR manager at Haihui.

175
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,800
He's a hotshot in Shenghai.

176
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,080
He's our chairman's secretary.

177
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,400
There's no one above him but the chairman.

178
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,520
Yu Fei, stop teasing me.

179
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,000
Hello, Secretary Chang.

180
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,720
Hello, Miss Chen.

181
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,600
Lulu hasn't been to Nanyue long.

182
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,760
She's the younger sister
of my college classmate.

183
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,720
I asked her to join us.

184
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,400
It's good to know more friends.

185
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,840
Lulu,

186
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,320
do learn from Secretary Chang.

187
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,880
Secretary Chang, please guide me along.

188
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,200
Don't say that.

189
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,360
We'd help each other.

190
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,240
Excuse me.

191
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,960
Hello.

192
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,800
Yes, dear.

193
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,720
What?

194
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,320
Okay, I'll come home right away.

195
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,000
Something came up at home.

196
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,920
I've to go back.

197
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,520
Why don't you ask your wife to join us?

198
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,240
I would have if I could.

199
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,560
My mother-in-law has come.

200
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,320
Enjoy your meal.

201
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,480
Don't wait for me. I shall go.

202
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,520
Secretary Chang, have some tea.

203
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,360
Okay.

204
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,800
Secretary Chang, I've heard from Yu Fei

205
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,360
you're the pillar of Shenghai Group.

206
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,760
From board members to the receptionists,

207
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,160
everyone likes you.

208
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,320
I'm just doing my job.

209
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,080
I can't control

210
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,520
what others say.

211
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,080
My thinking's the same as yours.

212
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,200
Can I call you Brother Qingyan

213
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,960
instead of Secretary Chang?

214
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,000
You can call me whatever you like.

215
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,600
Hello, these are your dishes.

216
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,960
-Thanks.
-Yu Fei ordered these.

217
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,880
He said they're your favorites.

218
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,520
Coincidentally, I like these dishes too.

219
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,600
This is a lot.

220
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,040
Here, Brother Qingyan.

221
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,160
Dig in.

222
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,360
Okay. Thank you.

223
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,800
-Try this as well.
-Thanks.

224
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,960
This is enough.

225
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,360
Brother Qingyan,

226
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,680
what else do you do other than work?

227
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,920
I usually watch movies

228
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,360
and read books.

229
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,480
Sometimes, I jog too.

230
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,520
What a coincidence. I am a movie buff.

231
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,160
Let's go for a movie some time.

232
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,120
Sure.

233
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,920
Let's eat.

234
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,200
Okay.

235
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,560
It's delicious.

236
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,920
Brother Qingyan,

237
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,560
I have a good time.

238
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,120
If Yu Fei's around,

239
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,520
the atmosphere may be better.

240
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,400
Let's meet again.

241
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,280
Sure.

242
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,240
I'll get going now.

243
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,760
Bye, Brother Qingyan.

244
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,640
Bye.

245
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,840
Hello.

246
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,920
Do you have a good time?

247
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,800
What are you playing at?

248
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,680
Instead of thanking me,

249
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,920
you're questioning me?

250
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,840
You're indeed the chairman's secretary.

251
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,200
It feels awkward.

252
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,040
You simply left me here.

253
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,040
I have to.

254
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,960
I don't want to be the third wheel.

255
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,640
Honestly,

256
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,200
she's quite interested in you.

257
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,200
What about you?

258
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,680
What do you mean?

259
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,920
Drop the act.

260
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,880
She's a good girl.

261
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,600
Don't let your chance slip away.

262
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,800
Anyway, I've got to run.

263
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,120
-Go shopping with me later.
-Sure.

264
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,000
I want to buy some clothes.

265
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,960
Okay. Let's go.

266
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,360
Xiao Chen, Pass these to everybody.

267
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,200
Okay.

268
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,040
Thank you.

269
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,160
Thank you.

270
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,760
-Let me take a look.
-Sure.

271
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,840
Okay.

272
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,720
It's been a long day for everyone.

273
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,960
Go to your room and rest early.

274
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,240
We'll start shooting tomorrow.

275
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,560
The director wants me to inform you

276
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,640
there are some minor changes
to the script.

277
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,400
Go to your rooms to put down your luggage

278
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
and take a short break.

279
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,200
We'll have a meeting in two hours.

280
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,680
Look at the time. Everyone's tired.

281
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,760
It's too late for a meeting.
Where's the director?

282
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,840
He went to the toilet.

283
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,760
This is very common for shooting a video.

284
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,400
Don't worry. We're not tired.

285
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,240
That's right. We're not tired.

286
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,760
Okay, go back to your room to rest now.

287
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,600
We'll meet later.

288
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,040
-Xiaomeng.
-Let's go.

289
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,920
What's your room number?

290
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,120
We're sharing the room. Let's go together.

291
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,040
I feel even more tired after the shower.

292
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,080
I don't feel like going down.

293
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,560
To go for a meeting right after a flight

294
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,920
is a real torture.

295
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,880
Constant revisions and repeated rehearsals

296
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,920
are expected during shooting.

297
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,200
Xiaomeng,...

298
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,920
I joined the team so suddenly.

299
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,520
You must be surprised.

300
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,280
I was.

301
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,760
After all,

302
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,040
you've never mentioned it to me.

303
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,280
Actually, I'm a friend of Director Ning's.

304
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,160
I worked with him a few times before.

305
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,480
The other day
he called me out of the blue,

306
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,040
telling me he was
about to start shooting a video,

307
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,000
and was in need of an actress,

308
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,320
and asked me for help.

309
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,600
When I found out
the video was for Shenghai,

310
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,280
I felt duty-bound to accept the role.

311
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,080
I see.

312
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,800
Hello.

313
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,480
Okay.

314
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,760
We're coming down right away.

315
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,840
The director's hurrying us?

316
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,520
Give me a minute.

317
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,600
-I'll get changed.
-Sure.

318
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,760
In the third segment,

319
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,720
Xiaomeng shall come out
from this door at this time.

320
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,640
Director, take a look at this scene.

321
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,920
I think in this scene,

322
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,640
for Xiaomeng to stand alone at the door

323
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,960
appears too simple and unrefined.

324
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,160
Do you think

325
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,360
we can add some interactions
between the two of us

326
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,200
to portray the element of friendship?

327
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,520
Wouldn't this fit the theme
of our promotional video more?

328
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,120
This is a good suggestion.

329
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,120
Everything we do now

330
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,680
is to create a perfect promotional video
for Shenghai Group.

331
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,280
We must ensure it looks grand and elegant.

332
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,120
Xiaomeng, do you have any suggestions?

333
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,960
Tell us.

334
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,520
Not really. I'll go with your decision.

335
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,760
Director,

336
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,080
for this segment,

337
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,680
do you think

338
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,000
we can add some interactions here too?

339
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,720
See, over here.

340
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,920
Not bad.

341
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,040
And here too.

342
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,360
We can add some scenes to show
our interactions here too.

343
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,520
It'll be better.

344
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,240
Good point.

345
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,320
Xiaomeng, the director
has given all the good scenes to you.

346
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,760
Director, how can you play favoritism?

347
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,720
I want to complain.

348
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,480
Naughty girl.

349
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,200
Okay, that's all for today.

350
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,000
Dismissed.

351
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,120
Let's go.

352
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,320
Let's go.

353
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,800
Has the meeting ended?

354
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,800
It's just ended.

355
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,800
Xiaomeng, don't be stressed.

356
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,240
I'll monitor the shooting tomorrow.

357
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,760
You can ask for time out anytime.

358
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,120
Jiang Ze,

359
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,600
Xiaomeng is simply not used to this.

360
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,760
She'll feel better tomorrow.

361
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,080
Don't worry.

362
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,080
Go back to your room to rest.

363
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,040
I'll walk you to your room.

364
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,960
No, it's okay.

365
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,280
I want to look through the script here.

366
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,520
Okay, I'll keep you company then.

367
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,720
It's really not necessary.

368
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,920
You two can go back first.

369
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,160
I wish to be alone here.

370
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,600
Right, Jiang Ze.

371
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,200
Let her have some time to herself.

372
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,600
Xiaomeng, don't stay up too late.

373
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,760
Do come back earlier.

374
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,880
Let's go.

375
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,600
Message me when you're back in your room.

376
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,760
Okay.

377
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:40,880
I'm going then.

378
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,480
I've got things to do.

379
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,360
See you tomorrow.

380
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,920
Jiang Ze!

381
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,520
Zhou Xiaomeng,...

382
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,440
why did you always get things easily...

383
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,400
that I fought so hard for?

384
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,240
I've been working so hard...

385
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,320
but I'm always living under your shadow.

386
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,040
This time, I must be the star.

387
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,400
Zhou Xiaomeng,...

388
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,280
I'll get whatever I want...

389
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,560
from you

390
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,880
one by one.

391
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,840
(A Yan)

392
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,560
(A Yan)

393
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,680
Zitong, what's wrong?

394
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,360
I'm having stomachache.

395
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,360
Why are you having
stomachache all of a sudden?

396
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,000
I don't know.

397
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,720
Shall I take you to the hospital?

398
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,280
I've always had stomachache.

399
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,680
I haven't been eating well
since we came here for the shooting.

400
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,760
I've forgot to bring medication for it.

401
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,640
In that case,

402
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,160
I'll go buy medicine for you now.

403
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,040
Thanks, Xiaomeng.

404
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,480
For now, drink some warm water.

405
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,960
Xiaomeng,

406
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,360
can you get me a glass of warm milk?

407
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,000
-Sure.
-Thank you.

408
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,760
Zhou Xiaomeng,...

409
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,960
you're still so stupid.

410
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,040
-Hello.
-Hello.

411
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,840
How can I help you?

412
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,720
What would you recommend for stomachache?

413
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,880
For stomachache,

414
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,520
you can buy this, it's 10 yuan.

415
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,280
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

416
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,720
Zitong.

417
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,600
Zitong, are you in there?

418
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,840
Zitong.

419
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,760
Zitong.

420
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,920
Oh no,

421
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,880
I've left my cell phone in the room.

422
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,880
-Hello.
-Hello.

423
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,960
My room number is 2101.

424
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,840
I've forgot my keys.

425
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,760
Can I have another one?

426
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,760
Just a moment, please.

427
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,640
Miss, I can get you another room key,

428
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,400
but once you get back to your room,

429
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,040
and find your original key,

430
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,880
please return this one.

431
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,000
Sure, no problem.

432
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,360
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

433
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,720
Why?

434
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,440
Why did you do this?

435
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,520
Zitong,...

436
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,400
I've always regarded you
as my best friend.

437
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,800
When I knew
you'd also be shooting this video,...

438
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,360
I didn't say a single word.

439
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,000
When I saw you in pain,...

440
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,600
I rushed out to get you the medicine.

441
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,280
But yet you did this to bully me,...

442
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,280
and harm me.

443
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,760
Is our friendship so fragile?

444
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:34,880
Xiaomeng,

445
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,720
why are you out here?

446
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,080
Why don't you enter the room?

447
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,600
I'm locked out of the door.

448
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,120
Why don't you call then?

449
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,000
I've left my cell phone in the room.

450
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,240
You should go get another key then.

451
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,000
I...

452
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,840
Stand up.

453
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,720
Follow me.

454
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,600
Give me another room.

455
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,080
Sure, just a minute.

456
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,920
Here.

457
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,360
Thank you. Let's go.

458
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,400
You should rest.

459
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,920
You've got some shooting tomorrow.

460
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,640
Xiaomeng,

461
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,560
if sleeping by yourself,

462
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,960
you'll be afraid of the dark,
the loneliness

463
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,360
and the coldness,...

464
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,080
I can keep you company.

465
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,880
I'm not afraid of anything now.

466
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,000
The only thing that scares me

467
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,400
is you, the big bad wolf.

468
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,760
Look at yourself.

469
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,360
Your angry face now

470
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,080
is so much more adorable
than the sad face earlier.

471
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,760
Stop it, Jiang Ze. Thank you

472
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,280
You should go back and rest early too.

473
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,840
-Good night.
-Sleep tight.

474
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,840
Bye bye.

475
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,560
Jiang Ze.

476
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,440
You're early.

477
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,560
Xiaomeng,...

478
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,840
did you sleep here last night?

479
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,240
Last night,

480
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,880
after I got you the medicine and milk,

481
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,280
I knocked at the door
but you didn't open it.

482
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,480
I left my cell phone in the room

483
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,640
so I couldn't call you.

484
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,120
Jiang Ze saw me on his way back,

485
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,760
and got me another room.

486
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,480
Xiaomeng, I'm terribly sorry.

487
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,200
I fell asleep after you left.

488
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,480
I didn't hear you knocking at the door.

489
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,120
I'm sorry.

490
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,200
It's all my fault.

491
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,280
Disasters arise from careless talk.

492
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,360
You have to be responsible
for every word you say.

493
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,120
I was sick.

494
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,800
Don't be angry with me.

495
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,880
I know it's my fault.

496
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,080
Xiaomeng, I'm sorry.

497
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,360
You won't blame me, right?

498
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,080
It's fine. I won't blame you.

499
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,480
What's going on?

500
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,360
Why is everybody standing here
in the morning?

501
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,080
Xiaomeng, why haven't you got dressed yet?

502
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,080
I'm sorry, Director.

503
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,440
I'll get changed right away.

504
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,480
Hurry up. We're leaving soon.

505
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,920
The youngsters nowadays are so clueless.

506
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,280
Everyone has worked hard.
Let's call it a day.

507
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,760
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

508
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,840
Xiaomeng,...

509
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,360
you did well today.

510
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,000
Thanks, Director.

511
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm impressed.

512
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,200
Xiaomeng did very well.

513
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,720
I'm inexperienced,
and still need your guidance.

514
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,680
Keep up the good work.

515
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,200
Sure, I will. Don't worry.

516
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,480
Good.

517
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,240
Xiaomeng,...

518
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,160
you did so well today.

519
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,480
I have much to learn from you.

520
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,400
Thank you.

521
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,000
Xiaomeng, do you feel cold?

522
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,880
Be careful not to catch a cold.

523
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,760
Go get dressed.

524
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,120
I'm fine.

525
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,000
I've been doing exercise in the water,

526
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,000
I don't feel cold now.

527
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,960
Don't be stubborn.

528
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,800
Come, I'll take you out for dinner.

529
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,160
What nice food are you guys eating?

530
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,080
I want to join too.

531
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,480
Why don't you go with Zitong?

532
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,440
I'm staying put.

533
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,520
I've been working the whole day,

534
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,200
and haven't got the time
for some sightseeing.

535
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,960
I feel like taking a walk myself.

536
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,760
Xiaomeng, I'll keep you company then.

537
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,080
No, it's Okay.

538
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,240
You guys go get some food.

539
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,640
Xiaomeng, I walk around with you here.

540
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,720
When you feel hungry,
we can go for dinner then.

541
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,600
Jiang Ze, it's not necessary.

542
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,880
I want to be alone for a while.

543
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,880
All right then. Take care of yourself.

544
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,280
I'm going then. See you.

545
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,320
Bye bye.

546
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,920
(Shenghai Group, Luofeng Sports Center)

547
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,160
Jiang Ze, I'm hungry.

548
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,640
Take me out for a nice dinner.

549
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,800
I've suddenly lost my appetite.

550
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,960
Go ahead yourself.

551
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,480
What else do you want to tell me?

552
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,400
Jiang Ze,...

553
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,760
what you're doing for Xiaomeng

554
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,280
is waste of time,...

555
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,160
because the person she loves is not you.

556
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,720
It is none of your business.

557
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,480
Keep your opinion to yourself.

558
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,960
Brother Qingyan, you're here.

559
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,680
Let's go get the tickets.

560
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,000
I've already bought the tickets.

561
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,200
We can go in now.

562
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,280
How can I let you pay for the tickets?

563
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,360
We've agreed it's my treat.

564
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,760
I've arranged this movie date
to thank you.

565
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,640
I'm glad that you would come.

566
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,440
I've sent you many messages
but you haven't replied.

567
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,320
I've thought you dislike me.

568
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,840
I've been tied up with work recently

569
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,240
and couldn't find time to check messages.

570
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,840
Lingxi.

571
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,280
Why are you here?

572
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,320
Secretary Chang, are you having a date
with your girlfriend?

573
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,160
Congratulations.

574
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,880
No, Lingxi. You've misunderstood.

575
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,680
Brother Qingyan, you guys chat.

576
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,000
I'll go buy popcorn and wait for you.

577
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,000
It's fine.

578
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,880
I have nothing to talk to him.

579
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,720
I'm leaving. Bye.

580
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,640
Lingxi.

581
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,200
Brother Qingyan, let's go in.

582
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,240
Lulu,...

583
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,040
I don't want to lie to you.

584
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,320
I can't.

585
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,480
We can only be friends...

586
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:03,880
because...

587
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,960
I'm already in love with someone else.

588
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,200
The person I like is her.

589
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,280
We've not even started yet

590
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,400
and you're already ending it.

591
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,160
Can't we at least
watch the movie together?

592
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,040
I'm sorry.

593
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,440
You'll meet someone better.

594
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,280
Lingxi!

595
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,080
I think I need to explain myself.

596
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,040
She's my friend's sister.

597
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,480
She has just came to Nanyue,

598
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,040
so I've helped her a couple of times.

599
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,520
We've come for a movie

600
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,880
because she wants to thank me.

601
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,440
It's not what you imagine.

602
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,520
Actually,

603
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,080
you don't have to explain yourself to me.

604
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,640
I...

605
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,360
I'm worried you've misunderstood.

606
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,280
She and I are just friends.

607
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,480
I've not misunderstood.

608
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,720
And you're free to make friends.

609
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,720
The girl's young and pretty.

610
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,560
She's quite compatible with you.
You should cherish her.

611
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,320
Lingxi, I...

612
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,040
Okay, I've got to run.

613
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,280
Bye.

614
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,280
Look, there's a handsome guy there.

615
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,160
Let's go.

616
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,520
Are you looking for troubles?

617
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,840
You're not answering us?

618
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,120
We'll beat you up!

619
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,800
-We're talking to you.
-Stay there!

620
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,440
The police is here.

621
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,280
Run...

622
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,640
Jiang Ze.

623
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,920
Jiang Ze, we're in Luofeng now.

624
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,240
You're unfamiliar with the people
and the place.

625
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,440
Don't you know it's dangerous?

626
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,000
Mind your own business.

627
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,880
Don't assume no one knows
those little tricks of yours.

628
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,680
Xiaomeng is just too kind

629
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,480
but I know what you're up to.

630
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,040
Jiang Ze.

631
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,680
Stop bothering me!

632
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,240
It's impossible between us.

633
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,720
The person I love is Xiaomeng, not you.

634
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,840
I told you

635
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,920
Xiaomeng can do it.

636
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,840
Look at her.

637
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,040
She's getting more confident now.

638
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,320
Xiaomeng,

639
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,880
make your swing wider.

640
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,440
Yes, Director. I've got it.

641
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,560
Good.

642
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,800
Zitong is doing well too.

643
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Keep smiling.

644
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,400
Smile brighter. Brighter.

645
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,640
That's it.

646
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,400
We're done!

647
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,000
Okay, we're done.

648
00:36:59,080 --> 00:36:59,920
We're done.

649
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,920
Thanks, Director.

650
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,560
Good job, everyone. Thanks.

651
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,480
Good job.

652
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,760
Good job...

653
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,680
Good job...

654
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,160
Well done.

655
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,280
You are amazing.

656
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,440
Amazing.

657
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,360
You're back. How's everything?

658
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,440
You can always count on me.

659
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,280
You'll be impressed
with the promotional video.

660
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,600
You must be tired.

661
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,520
Not at all.

662
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,320
I get to spend some days
alone with Xiaomeng

663
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,640
and we've become much closer.

664
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,200
I don't mind this kind of job

665
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,800
no matter how tired I am.

666
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,960
Chairman Zhou, a media
has suddenly published an article

667
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,360
about the investigation of the accident
at Shenghai's newly sports center.

668
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,440
The article accuses

669
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,440
our Phase Two construction

670
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,880
of having serious quality issues.

671
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,160
The authorities have been alerted.

672
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,560
Our project may be temporarily suspended.

673
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,240
How did the accident happen?

674
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,800
Who arranged for the investigation?

675
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,040
I've checked with
the Quality Management Department

676
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,160
but they said they had no idea.

677
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,000
You're in charge of this project.

678
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,320
Without your authorization,

679
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,240
they wouldn't conduct the investigation
on their own.

680
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,040
Are the staff from all departments here?

681
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,520
Yes, they're waiting for you
in the conference room.

682
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,360
(Nanyue Construction Daily)

683
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,800
Qingyan,

684
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,240
-show me the article.
-Yes.

685
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,120
First of all, I want to know one thing.

686
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,360
Based on your understanding

687
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,640
of the Luofeng City Commercial
Integrated Sports Center Project,

688
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,960
are the safety hazards and risks
mentioned in this report...

689
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,520
true or not?

690
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,840
Chairman Zhou, I've read the article.

691
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,480
The safety hazards and risks
referred to in the article

692
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,960
are general problems that may happen
in Phase Two construction,

693
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,920
such as related procedures,

694
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,200
and operational issues.

695
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,600
To keep up with the schedule,

696
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,840
this has always been the case
with all our projects.

697
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,200
It's impossible for all our constructions

698
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,440
to be problem-free.

699
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,160
But to resolve all these problems

700
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,440
takes time.

701
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,480
That's right.

702
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,680
We've been working on these issues.

703
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,920
But if we wait for the relevant approvals
to go through proper channels,

704
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,120
our project will get delayed.

705
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,640
Hence, we usually proceed concurrently.

706
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,920
This is the norm
in the construction industry.

707
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,360
However,

708
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,960
this article specifically accuses Shenghai

709
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,880
of cutting corners

710
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,320
to push through a project
with potential safety hazards.

711
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,120
They are exaggerating.

712
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,320
How long does it take to solve

713
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,800
the risks they mentioned?

714
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,680
Well...

715
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,560
Ten days to half a month at least.

716
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,640
If we stop the construction now,

717
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,560
subsequent cost will escalate.

718
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,160
We've already
invested a lot into this project.

719
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,400
If we continue like this,

720
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,640
we'll exceed our budget by a huge margin.

721
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,600
Let's now talk about
how this article came about.

722
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,360
You have been dealing with the media.

723
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,040
Why is there suddenly

724
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,000
an unfavorable report of Shenghai?

725
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,320
Is it the work of our competitors?

726
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,640
We were shocked
when we read the article too.

727
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,720
Our relationship with this newspapers

728
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,880
has been cordial,

729
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,240
but now we can't even get in touch

730
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,200
with the person-in-charge.

731
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,920
We've contacted all the other media,

732
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,920
and they've agreed to remove this article.

733
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,560
But the social impact
of this issue is great.

734
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,160
If we don't rectify
those so-called safety hazards,

735
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,160
Shenghai will still be
negatively affected.

736
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,600
It's not just the social impact.

737
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,400
This will also affect
our business partners' impression of us.

738
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,200
First and foremost,
the Engineering Department

739
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,320
has to come up with a proposal
as soon as possible

740
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,640
of how to rectify the safety hazards
and risks mentioned in the article.

741
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,400
Lingxi, give Lingtian Group a call

742
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,880
to explain our situation

743
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,480
and find out what they think.

744
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,600
Okay.

745
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,440
Jiang Ze,

746
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,360
you and the Quality Management Department

747
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,360
find a professional
engineering evaluation company.

748
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,840
Once the on-site problem's solved,

749
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,920
find the best expert

750
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,320
to prepare a risk assessment report

751
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,520
and pass it to
the Public Relations Department.

752
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,880
The Public Relations Department
will update all the media

753
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,320
of our project status.

754
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,320
Tell them

755
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,640
Shenghai Group

756
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,440
will never push a risky project

757
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,000
to the market.

758
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,920
And keep calling this newspaper.

759
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,760
I want them to give me
a reasonable explanation.

760
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,800
-Okay.
-Does everyone understand?

761
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,000
Yes...

762
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,600
I made you work overtime again.

763
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,880
Honestly,

764
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,640
I'm actually starting to feel bad.

765
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,360
Strike where the enemy is unprepared.

766
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,760
I understand where you're coming from.

767
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,400
But before you strike again,

768
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,120
please give me a heads-up in advance.

769
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,040
You don't have to know so much.

770
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,240
If you know too much,

771
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,200
you won't be able to act natural.

772
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,160
Tell me. How's thing with Zhou Yanzhao?

773
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,800
Construction at the sports center
is temporarily suspended.

774
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,360
But knowing Zhou Yanzhao,

775
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,760
he must have lined up
a series of quick solutions.

776
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,320
You may have won this round

777
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,520
but it's nothing fatal.

778
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:51,880
At most,

779
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,400
you have annoyed him.

780
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,120
That's enough for now.

781
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,320
Anyway, I wasn't expecting him to give up

782
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,120
the sports center project so easily.

783
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,560
I just wanted to give him a reminder.

784
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,320
What other plans do you have in mind?

785
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,160
This is a chess game.

786
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,280
I've made my first move

787
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,200
and he has defended well.

788
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,720
Going forward,

789
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,400
he'll be facing even more problems.

790
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,760
I doubt

791
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,160
he can take any breather soon.

792
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,280
What do I need to do?

793
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,320
Nothing for the time being.

794
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,640
As I've said,

795
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,280
if you know too much,
you won't be able to act natural.

796
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,800
Got it.
