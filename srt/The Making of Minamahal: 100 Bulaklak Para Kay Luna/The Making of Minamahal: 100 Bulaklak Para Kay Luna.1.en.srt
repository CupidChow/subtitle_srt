11
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,789
So before I joined Viva,

12
00:01:00,814 --> 00:01:02,729
I was already a talent

13
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,565
and we used to travel
from Quezon Province to Manila

14
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,192
Just for auditions.

15
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:11,780
Then in 2016, after I joined
Born to be a Star,

16
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:15,408
that’s when Viva got us for training.

17
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,578
That’s when I started
joining girl groups,

18
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,538
and while I was in a girl group,

19
00:01:20,563 --> 00:01:25,876
we were given small
support roles in acting.

20
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:29,798
Then after that, in 2022,

21
00:01:29,906 --> 00:01:33,384
that’s when my acting
career really began.

22
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:35,695
That’s when we started getting

23
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,015
real opportunities to
show our acting skills.

24
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,350
In "Marita"...

25
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,268
Help Me!

26
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,231
Then, "Sunny"...

27
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,982
Shh! Enough of that!

28
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:49,092
You talk too much.

29
00:01:49,117 --> 00:01:50,168
Let’s get this over with!

30
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,445
And then came
"Ang Mutya ng Section E."

31
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,971
Excuse me!

32
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,458
Is this Section E?

33
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,461
Not here. Go back
to the main building.

34
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:09,587
It’s just that someone said—

35
00:02:09,612 --> 00:02:11,573
Are you deaf? Leave!

36
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:12,808
It was all so worth it,

37
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,635
because my personality
is really far from

38
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,637
what a celebrity
is supposed to be.

39
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,281
As I was super shy,

40
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:24,352
and with all the
experiences I went through,

41
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,604
it really helped to
hone my character

42
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,939
and build my confidence.

43
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,608
I used to struggle so
much just to speak,

44
00:02:30,633 --> 00:02:33,545
and performing in front of a crowd
was so hard for me.

45
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,698
If I hadn’t gone through all of that—

46
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,146
from literally starting at zero

47
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:41,555
I don’t think I’d be
where I am now.

48
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,306
That’s why I’m super thankful.

49
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,541
Let’s all bow our heads and pray.

50
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,836
Our heavenly Father,
thank You so much for today.

51
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:53,808
Thank You for the
work that we truly enjoy.

52
00:02:53,915 --> 00:02:55,150
We can see the whole hallway.

53
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,695
we need to clear out.

54
00:02:58,088 --> 00:02:59,112
Day nine.

55
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,346
It’s getting close!

56
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:02,348
The experiences I’m going through now,

57
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,316
they remind me to stay humble

58
00:03:05,341 --> 00:03:06,853
and to never change.

59
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,939
Because I don’t want to
forget where I came from—

60
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:13,418
because we never really know
what could happen after all this.

61
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,830
We don’t know. You know,
this could all be gone,

62
00:03:15,855 --> 00:03:18,376
or I might take a different career path.

63
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,783
And when I look back
at those experiences,

64
00:03:20,808 --> 00:03:22,476
whenever I remember it,

65
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:23,928
I’m reminded that,

66
00:03:24,179 --> 00:03:25,555
this is who I was before.

67
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,473
and I’m here because of the Lord.

68
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,626
So whatever the Lord can give me,

69
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:30,693
He can also take away.

70
00:03:30,801 --> 00:03:39,088
[crowd cheering]

71
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:39,886
[Director] Rolling.

72
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:40,539
[Director] Out ID.

73
00:03:40,564 --> 00:03:42,191
[Director] And five, four,
three, two...

74
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,016
[Director] Raffy’s in a hurry and...

75
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,058
action!

76
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,504
It all started really in a sitcom.

77
00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,822
It started in Da Pers Family.

78
00:03:59,847 --> 00:04:01,808
That was my first real
experience in acting.

79
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,092
Or if you would even consider

80
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,970
like endorsement
shoots in the past

81
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,121
with my family and all.

82
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:09,774
But it really started with Da Pers Family.

83
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:11,077
Let’s make him a leading man.

84
00:04:11,102 --> 00:04:11,976
And that’s her!

85
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,641
The leading lady that fits right for you!

86
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:14,395
This one’s perfect.

87
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,900
And him... he’s the
parent of these kids.

88
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:18,967
They might laugh at me?

89
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:22,820
Being a good actor runs in our blood!

90
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,222
The biggest Jump that,

91
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,307
I’d say the biggest jump
was going from Sitcom

92
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,518
all the way to a series

93
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,852
which is Ang Mutya ng Section E.

94
00:04:29,885 --> 00:04:31,846
And I had to learn a lot of things,

95
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,288
really,

96
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,439
I had to pick up things quickly

97
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,441
and doing Ang Mutya ng Section E

98
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:38,987
was my first time really
acting as a character.

99
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,196
And... you know,

100
00:04:40,221 --> 00:04:43,395
I learned a lot of things
in the months that went by.

101
00:04:43,493 --> 00:04:45,287
Have a seat, welcome to Section E.

102
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:49,571
Mister President, any questions
for our transferee?

103
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,000
Are you still a Virgin?

104
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,585
You? When are you leaving this world?

105
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,586
Why don’t you go first?

106
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,671
Because I’m the one who’s gonna make you

107
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,182
disappear from this world.

108
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:02,844
Prior to that, even the process
of getting to where I was...

109
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,538
There was a lot of workshops,

110
00:05:04,563 --> 00:05:07,315
and a lot of other work
days that came along

111
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,970
which all helped me build

112
00:05:08,995 --> 00:05:11,205
who I became or
where I’m at today.

113
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:15,856
[Director] Okay. Cut!

114
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,236
Okay, one more.

115
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,789
Looking back, well, firstly a year ago when

116
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:36,127
We did the interview in the green room
for Ang Mutya ng Section E.

117
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,781
It was my first time experiencing

118
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,456
using the green room and being there.

119
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:43,443
And I’ll admit, during that time,

120
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:44,819
I was super nervous,

121
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,431
because we were supposed to
be in character, and everything

122
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,807
and I didn’t know what to say.

123
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:50,807
And then...

124
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,618
coming up to where I am now…

125
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,979
I feel like I’ve grown
more as a person,

126
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,637
I’ve gotten a lot more confident

127
00:05:56,662 --> 00:05:57,913
and...

128
00:05:58,302 --> 00:05:59,901
yeah, it's kind of crazy to think

129
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,402
that, you know, who
would have thought

130
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,946
that in year from now,
we were gonna do a film

131
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,740
you know, and not only that,

132
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,617
like doing a film with Ash again

133
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,910
which is really great,

134
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,163
I would have really never
expected, a year ago.

135
00:06:12,188 --> 00:06:13,388
Are you getting paid for that?

136
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,086
And does it count as an
extra-curricular activity?

137
00:06:35,502 --> 00:06:37,105
Before, even now,

138
00:06:37,205 --> 00:06:39,290
it still feels unreal to me—

139
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:42,276
just like I’ve shared before,

140
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,626
when we used to do
mall shows as front acts,

141
00:06:47,026 --> 00:06:51,511
people weren’t really there for us.

142
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,721
And now, when we do mall shows,

143
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,248
we’re the ones they come for.

144
00:06:55,273 --> 00:06:57,166
We’re the reason they’re there.

145
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,290
It really warms my heart—like,

146
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:03,005
wow, I used to be
just like this before.

147
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,549
I used to get shy before—like,

148
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,008
for example, when
we’d arrive at a mall show

149
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,240
and the guards would
block people off for us.

150
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,471
I’d say, “Sir, it’s okay,
no need to do that,

151
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,889
no one’s gonna go
crazy over us anyway.”

152
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:12,473
It felt kind of embarrassing.

153
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:16,018
But now, with all the
support they’re giving,

154
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,770
I can really feel their love.

155
00:07:17,795 --> 00:07:19,873
It truly warms my heart.

156
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,816
Do you live here, Sir?

157
00:07:21,966 --> 00:07:23,641
- Mm-hmm.
- Here also.

158
00:07:24,015 --> 00:07:25,015
Oh sure.

159
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,908
Thank you. Get rest as well, Sir.

160
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:33,437
Get some rest. It’s getting late.

161
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,747
The fact that Ang Mutya
ng Section E blew up,

162
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,866
we really didn’t expect that.

163
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,644
And now, that we’re having a movie

164
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,185
and it’s the two of us—
me and Andres again.

165
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,278
I’m so happy!

166
00:07:45,303 --> 00:07:48,886
It’s all so unexpected
because everything we have now,

167
00:07:48,911 --> 00:07:51,971
it all came from the love
and support people gave us

168
00:07:51,996 --> 00:07:53,789
through Ang Mutya ng Section E.

169
00:07:54,544 --> 00:07:58,298
It’s fine. You can go ahead. I got this.

170
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,894
Wow, Luna. No wonder
you were elected

171
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,591
as president of the artists club.

172
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,661
[Director] Cut.

173
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,542
When I first learned
that Ashtine and Andres

174
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,295
were the approved cast for this project,

175
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,339
of course, I was ecstatic

176
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:31,552
because aside from being a sensation
in Mutya ng Section E,

177
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:34,931
I’ve genuinely admired
Ashtine as an actress.

178
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,391
And at the same time, with Andres

179
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,722
even though he’s technically
still new as an actor

180
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:41,370
I don’t know,

181
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,731
the first time I saw him
in person at an event,

182
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:48,805
I just had this gut feel that
he’s gonna be a future superstar.

183
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:49,729
So right...

184
00:08:49,754 --> 00:08:51,130
A passion project

185
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:55,136
partnered with good actors and actresses
you truly believe in

186
00:08:55,227 --> 00:08:56,645
that’s the perfect formula.

187
00:08:57,127 --> 00:08:58,545
[Director] Quiet. Rolling.

188
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,572
[Director] Nobody move, and....

189
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,885
[Director] Five, four,
three, two...

190
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,709
[Director] Action.

191
00:09:15,863 --> 00:09:16,889
Oh my God!

192
00:09:16,914 --> 00:09:18,265
Are we in a commercial?!

193
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:19,570
Shhh! Direk’s giving instructions!

194
00:09:19,595 --> 00:09:21,367
Sorry! Okay...
Keep safe, good bye!

195
00:09:21,392 --> 00:09:22,412
Bye!

196
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:25,056
The first time I received
the script of Minamahal,

197
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:27,625
at first of course,
I was a bit nervous

198
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,986
because this is a movie already.

199
00:09:30,011 --> 00:09:32,769
This is not just a series,
or TV show,

200
00:09:32,794 --> 00:09:37,370
and I also understand that
the weight of acting in a movie

201
00:09:37,395 --> 00:09:40,204
is a lot different from
acting in a series.

202
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,789
So of course I was a bit nervous.

203
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,125
But, from the moment
I read the script,

204
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,459
I fell in love with the project.

205
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,838
Like I knew that it had to be this,
I had to do it.

206
00:09:48,863 --> 00:09:50,631
When I picked it up for the first time,

207
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,691
I couldn’t put it down.

208
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,134
And you know what I did,

209
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,927
usually when I receive scripts,

210
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,196
the way I like to deal with it is

211
00:09:57,221 --> 00:10:00,600
I’ll open the script somewhere
in the middle of the story

212
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,643
and I’ll read three
to four sequences

213
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:06,008
And if I like it already
then I’ll start from the top.

214
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:08,065
When I read it, you know,
in the middle of the story.

215
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,485
First three sequences,
I already loved it.

216
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,564
So I had to start it
right from the very start.

217
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:15,144
I couldn’t put it down.

218
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,159
And when I was
reading the lines as well,

219
00:10:18,565 --> 00:10:20,609
I saw myself saying these lines

220
00:10:20,634 --> 00:10:24,763
and I started to feel the emotions
of what Raffy was saying

221
00:10:24,788 --> 00:10:26,920
or what Luna was saying to Raffy.

222
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,396
And I honestly just
really enjoyed the story.

223
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,585
And you know,

224
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,092
credits to Direk JPL because
he wrote the story as well,

225
00:10:35,117 --> 00:10:36,281
and it’s really beautiful.

226
00:10:36,306 --> 00:10:39,767
And another thing that
Direk JPL informed me before

227
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:45,357
was he actually wrote
the character around me

228
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,278
years prior to me entering showbiz

229
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:52,339
I guess it’s a full circle
moment, you know?

230
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:57,615
Not knowing, that Direk JPL was
gonna be my director for my first film.

231
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:02,425
And he also wanted to work with
me prior to me being in the industry

232
00:11:02,498 --> 00:11:04,538
So all the more I believe

233
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:07,408
that this is really the
right project for me.

234
00:11:07,738 --> 00:11:08,989
Are we heavy?

235
00:11:19,224 --> 00:11:20,267
Sam can do it.

236
00:11:20,292 --> 00:11:22,628
Go! Sam will lead the prayer.

237
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,729
Let’s all bow our heads and
feel the presence of our Lord.

238
00:11:28,783 --> 00:11:30,831
I was really happy with the concept

239
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:34,193
because the story is so relatable.

240
00:11:34,247 --> 00:11:37,196
I told Direk, right
after they pitched it,

241
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,215
I texted him saying it was so good

242
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,993
because it’s really about
real-life relationship situations.

243
00:11:43,018 --> 00:11:45,246
And stories like that?

244
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,455
A lot of people will relate,

245
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,748
because I feel like almost everyone

246
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,543
has experienced loving each other,

247
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,045
but still wondering
why it’s not working

248
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,905
even if you love each other.

249
00:12:28,126 --> 00:12:29,126
Luna?

250
00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:31,892
Raffy.

251
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,837
Minamahal: 100 Bulaklak para kay Luna

252
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,382
is about two high school students

253
00:12:38,684 --> 00:12:41,916
who both have personal issues.

254
00:12:42,153 --> 00:12:45,030
And unexpectedly, they
end up in a relationship.

255
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:49,435
So the movie is more of like
watching their journey—

256
00:12:49,507 --> 00:12:52,350
from meeting each other,

257
00:12:52,663 --> 00:12:54,290
falling in love with each other,

258
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,401
and what could possibly
happen to them in the future.

259
00:12:57,575 --> 00:13:00,029
If you’re familiar
with my past films,

260
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,740
I’m really fond of telling love stories

261
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,618
from the point of view of
what we call “yearners.”

262
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,871
People who find love

263
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:16,274
and what they’re willing to do
to win the person they love.

264
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:18,647
So from 100 Tula Para kay Stella,

265
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,232
The Day After Valentine’s,

266
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:24,379
and now Minamahal:
100 Bulaklak para kay Luna,

267
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:28,867
It's another variant
of those kinds of love stories.

268
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,222
[Director] Rolling, and
five, four, three, two...

269
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:51,454
[Director] And cut.

270
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,769
Luna is kind of like a lone wolf.

271
00:13:54,794 --> 00:13:58,170
Like what the youth
today would call a “sigma.”

272
00:13:58,195 --> 00:13:59,296
A sigma artist.

273
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:02,971
Sigma means you’re very independent,

274
00:14:03,018 --> 00:14:05,678
you don’t rely on anyone,
you can handle things on your own.

275
00:14:05,703 --> 00:14:09,874
So for her, it’s actually
hard to show love

276
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:12,144
because of that independence.

277
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:16,670
And that’s where Raffy comes in—

278
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:24,282
how Raffy’s role in her life
will change this girl’s fear of love.

279
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:40,379
[Director] And five, four,
three, two...

280
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,681
[Director] Action!

281
00:14:46,434 --> 00:14:49,708
Luna—she’s independent.

282
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,850
She’s responsible.

283
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,254
She knows her worth.

284
00:14:54,295 --> 00:14:55,772
But even with all that,

285
00:14:55,797 --> 00:14:58,355
there’s still a fear in her
when it comes to accepting love

286
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,418
the kind she thought
she didn’t need.

287
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:03,485
Not until Raffy made her feel

288
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:06,405
what it’s like to be cared for,

289
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,098
to be loved.

290
00:15:08,222 --> 00:15:10,112
And that’s when
everything starts to change.

291
00:15:21,973 --> 00:15:25,142
Raffy is an introverted
high school student

292
00:15:25,173 --> 00:15:29,887
who’s so introverted
that he actually spends more time

293
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:33,874
with flowers and plants in the
school garden than with other people.

294
00:15:33,906 --> 00:15:38,854
And now that he’s
found someone he likes,

295
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:42,207
what better way to show his love

296
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:47,154
than by sharing the very things
he takes care of and helps grow,

297
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:47,947
his flowers.

298
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,532
So his love language
is giving flowers

299
00:15:50,557 --> 00:15:52,059
to the people he cares about,

300
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:54,003
during the key moments of his life.

301
00:15:54,326 --> 00:15:56,221
I just want to make you
feel that you’re special.

302
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:59,257
By giving you flowers
that I grow myself.

303
00:16:00,276 --> 00:16:04,772
Main thing about Raffy is he doesn’t want
to be a burden to anyone.

304
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,210
Or he doesn’t want to caught
any problems with anyone.

305
00:16:07,235 --> 00:16:09,885
He’s afraid of confrontations
with other people.

306
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,846
He’s afraid of feeling emotions.

307
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,281
If I could share, I guess

308
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,518
Raffy only has one friend
right from the start of the film.

309
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:21,730
But as the story progress you can see
how Raffy’s character changes,

310
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:22,957
how it blooms.

311
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,228
Or how he... you know, faces struggles.

312
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:28,904
There’s a bunch of Ups and Downs.

313
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,198
But that’s Raffy, that's life,

314
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,366
there’s a lot of Ups and Downs.

315
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,740
And just like everyone,

316
00:16:33,765 --> 00:16:36,655
we experience these
things, and yeah.

317
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,020
Look at this—

318
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:48,524
she even managed to take ten selfies

319
00:16:48,563 --> 00:16:50,660
while crying over her boyfriend.

320
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,844
Unbelievable!

321
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:55,393
I don’t get why she had to take
pictures while crying.

322
00:16:55,418 --> 00:16:56,418
Right?

323
00:16:57,346 --> 00:16:58,678
Just look at her face.

324
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,724
Sad react.

325
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,790
- Luna?
- Hmm?

326
00:17:12,996 --> 00:17:14,609
Have you ever had a boyfriend before?

327
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,750
Are you going to court me?

328
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:32,715
Can I?

329
00:17:39,782 --> 00:17:41,942
Courting and all that? Cringe.

330
00:17:42,086 --> 00:17:43,162
Let’s just be together already.

331
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:50,358
When Luna loves, she gives her all.

332
00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:53,762
But she never forgets
to leave some for herself.

333
00:17:54,196 --> 00:17:57,445
Raffy loves by… He’s very thoughtful.

334
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,049
I can also say he’s very…

335
00:17:59,074 --> 00:18:01,830
Acts of service, cause
he likes to give flowers.

336
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,540
I mean the whole
premise of the film.

337
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:05,142
100 Bulaklak Para Kay Luna is

338
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,588
because Raffy,

339
00:18:06,613 --> 00:18:10,408
through the ups and the downs,
he always give flowers to Luna.

340
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,440
Okay, cut.

341
00:18:33,623 --> 00:18:34,671
Good morning.

342
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,282
You’ll really see all
the stages of love here—

343
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:41,286
from the meet-cute,
to the awkward moments together,

344
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,454
to falling in love,

345
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:45,749
and how it blossoms into
a more mature kind of love.

346
00:18:45,851 --> 00:18:47,486
So it’s really for everyone,

347
00:18:47,511 --> 00:18:50,003
no matter your age,

348
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:51,851
as long as you’ve experienced love before.

349
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,925
You’ll definitely see the
different stages of love in this.

350
00:18:55,115 --> 00:18:59,388
It’s the kind of love where
you give your 100 percent,

351
00:18:59,413 --> 00:19:03,750
but still make sure you leave
something for yourself.

352
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:08,438
The love between Raffy
and Luna is unselfish love

353
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:11,834
especially coming
from Raffy’s end.

354
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:12,859
You know.

355
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,908
As you see, as the story progresses,

356
00:19:19,933 --> 00:19:21,601
you see how much he cares for Luna.

357
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,021
And even as time goes by,

358
00:19:32,107 --> 00:19:35,491
the love they had for each other,
it doesn’t fade.

359
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,392
[Director] Rolling and...
five, four, three, two.

360
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,394
- And action.
- Action!

361
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,607
The general tone of the film—

362
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:07,039
since Ashtine and Andres came from
Ang Mutya ng Section E,

363
00:20:07,064 --> 00:20:11,210
which is a Wattpad adaptation
and kind of larger-than-life,

364
00:20:11,235 --> 00:20:15,198
like a fantasy for
high schoolers—

365
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,586
this time in Minamahal:
100 Bulaklak para kay Luna,

366
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:22,403
our approach is more
realistic, more mature.

367
00:20:22,476 --> 00:20:25,140
When I pitched the project to Viva,

368
00:20:25,165 --> 00:20:30,732
I said it’s a high school romance
from the point of view of a mature person.

369
00:20:30,757 --> 00:20:32,481
That’s why our cinematography,

370
00:20:32,506 --> 00:20:33,665
our color grading—

371
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,880
it reflects that mature point of view.

372
00:20:35,905 --> 00:20:39,400
It’s not overly
vibrant—it’s very nostalgic.

373
00:20:39,425 --> 00:20:43,721
The tones are subtle so
the audience can really

374
00:20:43,746 --> 00:20:46,875
feel the realism of
what’s happening.

375
00:20:47,275 --> 00:20:48,833
Are you getting paid for this?

376
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,918
And does this count as an
extra-curricular activity?

377
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:57,996
I’m really into plants.
Especially flowers.

378
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,761
Here.

379
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,470
Flowers.

380
00:21:05,537 --> 00:21:06,538
It’s for you.

381
00:21:10,627 --> 00:21:15,433
This is our first movie together,
our first lead role film.

382
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,401
We were super nervous.

383
00:21:17,426 --> 00:21:19,962
And when the first teaser came out,

384
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:25,325
I really felt how high
people’s expectations were.

385
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,494
Reading those reactions,

386
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:30,480
that’s when I started
to feel the pressure

387
00:21:30,514 --> 00:21:33,350
but I tried to
shake it off quickly.

388
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,952
Because when I work under pressure,

389
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,589
it doesn’t really work for me.

390
00:21:39,614 --> 00:21:41,300
I find it harder to function.

391
00:21:41,447 --> 00:21:45,095
I prefer working while having fun

392
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,706
not thinking too much
about what people expect.

393
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:51,184
And it helped that we
were given a workshop.

394
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,994
Once we started shooting,

395
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:56,729
I was reminded to just feel whatever
the character is feeling

396
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,359
to be in the moment.

397
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:03,347
Instead of calculating
my next cues and actions.

398
00:22:03,431 --> 00:22:06,184
When I try to prove too much,
I end up doing less.

399
00:22:06,209 --> 00:22:08,336
So in the workshop,
I was reminded—

400
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:10,446
I just need to feel every scene.

401
00:22:10,555 --> 00:22:11,805
From the very beginning,

402
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,290
we honestly couldn’t believe it

403
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:17,269
that we actually have a film now.

404
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,171
And for me, it’s always
been a dream of mine

405
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,049
to eventually be on
the silver screen, really.

406
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,810
and you know, this is it.

407
00:22:23,835 --> 00:22:26,945
I’m just also glad
that my partner is Ash.

408
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,681
We’ve already had the
chance to work together,

409
00:22:29,706 --> 00:22:31,879
and we’re really close now,

410
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,160
and the bond we have,

411
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,729
the way we work together—
it really flows really well.

412
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:38,957
which I think is the beauty of
Ang Mutya ng Section E as well.

413
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:42,444
We are able to develop our connection
or our chemistry

414
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,739
and now we get to show
that on the silver screen.

415
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,199
I’m very thankful that Ashtine and Andres

416
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,160
were the ones
cast in this project,

417
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,723
because they’re very easy to work with.

418
00:22:52,748 --> 00:22:56,683
They’re thinking actors,
they take direction well,

419
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,126
They understand what’s needed.

420
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,372
They’re not the kind of artists
who are just here for a quick gig.

421
00:23:01,459 --> 00:23:04,337
They really put their
hearts into this project—

422
00:23:04,362 --> 00:23:06,031
they even did their own workshops.

423
00:23:06,056 --> 00:23:12,107
On set, they help each other
bring the characters to life.

424
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:17,491
Because of that, shooting the scenes
went really smoothly.

425
00:23:17,516 --> 00:23:22,850
Even the ones I thought would be tough
because they were heavy

426
00:23:22,883 --> 00:23:23,902
once we got there,

427
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,613
I’m surprised. They already
had their lines memorized,

428
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:28,423
they knew the approach

429
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:31,618
I’m very thankful that they were
the ones who ended up in this project.

430
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:53,557
Working with Direk JPL is super relaxed.

431
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,058
And um...

432
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:59,563
What I like about him is that
he lets us show first

433
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:02,549
how we understand the scene, the script.

434
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,861
If he’s not satisfied,
that’s when he steps in,

435
00:24:05,886 --> 00:24:09,756
he gives input like,
“You should approach it this way,”

436
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,284
or “Tone that down a bit.”

437
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,785
That’s what I really appreciate,

438
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:17,372
he lets us be co-creators
with him in the film.

439
00:24:17,538 --> 00:24:20,280
It’s been a great experience
working with Direk JPL

440
00:24:21,287 --> 00:24:22,892
And I’m sure even Direk would agree

441
00:24:22,917 --> 00:24:25,470
I really enjoy our conversations,

442
00:24:25,745 --> 00:24:28,567
even behind the monitor and everything.

443
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:34,005
And I always ask, can ask Direk JPL
about the scene

444
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:37,200
how to attack it, how I should feel—

445
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:41,021
and he always guides
me in all those ideas,

446
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,380
In all those thoughts and ---

447
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,374
Even times when I’m unsure,

448
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,669
“Direk, what do you want me
to express more in this scene?”

449
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:49,345
What more I can give.

450
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,714
He really guides me through,

451
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,199
and explains it thoroughly.

452
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,742
He helps me understand.

453
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:57,789
Not only that, I’m also
super grateful to Direk,

454
00:24:57,814 --> 00:25:00,358
he also wrote such a
beautiful story. Really. And...

455
00:25:00,588 --> 00:25:03,115
Even the way he wrote the story,

456
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:06,164
we were just talking about it
the other day in the shoot like,

457
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:11,660
He’s so good. And I’m really
glad that it’s already here.

458
00:25:11,685 --> 00:25:14,575
Direk JPL thank you so much! I love you!

459
00:25:57,745 --> 00:26:01,639
I would say that Minamahal:
100 Bulaklak para kay Luna

460
00:26:01,849 --> 00:26:06,134
is really for everyone
who has experienced love—

461
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:10,950
or for those who are
just about to go through it.

462
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:18,615
In a way, you can see it as a manual
on how today’s youth views love.

463
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,388
Because nowadays,

464
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,499
it’s no longer common for young people
to love in a way

465
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,351
that sacrifices themselves.

466
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,337
For Gen Alpha and Gen Z,

467
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,928
their perception of love is

468
00:26:31,953 --> 00:26:34,915
“How do you love someone
without losing yourself?”

469
00:26:35,603 --> 00:26:39,502
If you’re curious about how the
younger generation thinks about love,

470
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:42,068
then this film is for you.

471
00:26:42,342 --> 00:26:45,412
I believe that this movie
is for everyone really

472
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:49,309
because all of us here today
we all experience love in some way,

473
00:26:49,334 --> 00:26:51,109
or some form.

474
00:26:51,134 --> 00:26:54,721
Everyone will be able to relate
even if its young love,

475
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:58,067
old love, or blind love.

476
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,212
You know, that’s why I think everyone
can relate to this movie.

477
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:03,555
This movie is for everyone

478
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:08,251
because the lesson here is to love
as much as you can

479
00:27:08,276 --> 00:27:11,112
but don’t forget to
leave some for yourself.

480
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,682
Know your worth, and
know what you deserve.

481
00:27:27,265 --> 00:27:28,599
This is me and Luna.

482
00:27:29,013 --> 00:27:31,349
Just friends, hanging out.

483
00:27:31,907 --> 00:27:34,827
You're not gonna believe
how we ended up in a relationship.

484
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:38,944
If you can even call it that.

485
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:45,425
I see him bonding more often
with plants than with people.

486
00:27:45,633 --> 00:27:47,869
He's cute, but kind of weird.

487
00:27:47,962 --> 00:27:50,852
Don’t you have someone like
a girlfriend to give flowers to...

488
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,619
Or maybe someone you're courting.

489
00:27:52,644 --> 00:27:54,104
I’m not ready for that yet.

490
00:27:56,601 --> 00:27:59,732
If you guys need to go home already,
I can handle this, you can head home.

491
00:27:59,757 --> 00:28:01,596
That’s why, even if
you’re only in grade eleven,

492
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,916
you were already chosen
as president of the Artist's Guild.

493
00:28:03,941 --> 00:28:06,191
Isn’t Raffy your classmate?

494
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:08,168
Mmhm, since first year.

495
00:28:08,193 --> 00:28:11,446
Why don't you go with Luna?

496
00:28:11,471 --> 00:28:13,686
Oh, I got it Mang Dan, don't worry.

497
00:28:13,876 --> 00:28:16,379
Did you see Cathy and Arnold’s viral video?

498
00:28:16,582 --> 00:28:18,022
Does stuff like that make you giddy?

499
00:28:18,051 --> 00:28:19,948
Cringe!

500
00:28:19,973 --> 00:28:23,139
Huh, no way.
Like you said, it's gross.

501
00:28:23,472 --> 00:28:26,246
Luna, have you had a boyfriend before?

502
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:30,001
Are you going to court me?

503
00:28:30,379 --> 00:28:31,422
Is that okay?

504
00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:34,432
Why go through courting? Cringe.

505
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,831
Let’s just be together already.

506
00:28:38,904 --> 00:28:40,405
If there’s something you want to do

507
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:44,017
to make Luna feel special to you,

508
00:28:44,512 --> 00:28:45,930
just do it.

509
00:28:45,955 --> 00:28:48,166
Well, that’s the problem, Mang Dan.

510
00:28:48,386 --> 00:28:52,226
She doesn’t like that.
It’s like she has a wall around her.

511
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,842
She’s just not used to it.

512
00:28:53,867 --> 00:28:56,729
Over time, that wall
will crumble down.

513
00:28:56,992 --> 00:28:59,119
You don’t need to give me flowers.

514
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:02,157
To be honest, it's kind of cringe.

515
00:29:02,182 --> 00:29:03,392
What’s cringe about that?

516
00:29:03,421 --> 00:29:04,964
We agreed to just keep it chill.

517
00:29:04,989 --> 00:29:05,823
So, why?

518
00:29:05,848 --> 00:29:06,974
Because I love you.

519
00:29:09,387 --> 00:29:11,722
It’s okay with me if you only
see me as a distraction.

520
00:29:12,575 --> 00:29:14,910
At least, I serve a purpose in your life.

521
00:29:15,673 --> 00:29:16,673
Loser!

522
00:29:17,574 --> 00:29:20,052
You’re making an effort for me but
it’s okay that you get nothing back?

523
00:29:20,077 --> 00:29:21,370
You’re content with that?

524
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,372
Why don't you demand, Raffy!
Ask for more!

525
00:29:24,516 --> 00:29:27,294
Luna, I don’t care if you
can’t reciprocate my efforts.

526
00:29:27,367 --> 00:29:28,850
I’m consenting to this.

527
00:29:39,867 --> 00:29:41,994
You know what,
let’s just break up.

528
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:43,740
- Fine!
- Asshole!

529
00:29:43,979 --> 00:29:46,399
Go, make all your dreams
come true without me!

530
00:29:46,424 --> 00:29:49,632
After all, ever since you’ve felt
like a strong independent woman!

531
00:29:49,657 --> 00:29:53,291
I hope you find a woman who won’t need
anything else in her life except you.

532
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:56,302
After all, you don’t feel validated
unless someone needs you.

533
00:29:58,816 --> 00:30:00,610
You deserve love, Luna,

534
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,468
remember that.

535
00:30:03,645 --> 00:30:06,565
I hope that someday
I can say that to myself.

536
00:30:13,141 --> 00:30:15,830
Hi, guys! I’m inviting everyone to watch

537
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:18,817
Minamahal: 100 Bulaklak para kay Luna.

538
00:30:18,842 --> 00:30:20,718
This September 24.
