00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
(Kayoko) Ah! I'm tired of today's watch too.

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let's go home early and take a good rest.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I've already rested. Huh?

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I've just slept so it's enough. What are you talking about?

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
As the number of teachers has increased, it's not too much of a stretch!

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm not doing it too much. It's easiest to be here.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Haa...

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
⚟ (Daikoku) That's exactly what the head teacher said.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Anno Take a break today. I mean, take a break!

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Daikoku Sensei, what happened all of a sudden? (Daikoku) It was the director's order.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,333
Director? I've been working on a doctor since last year.

13
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:12,000
Work style reforms have been implemented. ➡

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Until now, I've missed it because there aren't enough staff.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,333
That won't happen from now on. I'm not interested.

16
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:21,666
No, your interests don't matter! If I found out, I'd get scolded.

17
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:24,000
It's okay, I'll just keep quiet. Huh?

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
No, that's the problem...

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Hey... What?

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
(Kichijoji) It comes with a stretcher. (Bonten) Yes.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
(Kichijoji) I complain of pain in my lower abdomen. ➡

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Blood pressure of 123 is 71. Saturation is 96%.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
(Bonten) Yes. ➡

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Can I move? (Male) Yes.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
(Bonten) So shall we move? Ah, it's fine to slow down. yes .

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
(Bonten) Yes, yes. (Kichijoji) Please.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
(Bonten) Umm, first of all... ➡

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Please check your temperature and monitor it. (Sanae and Ayumu) ​​Yes.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
(Sanae) Excuse me. (Ayumu) ​​Excuse me.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
(Sanae) What will you do next? (Ayumu) ​​Please give me instructions.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
(Care) Umm, first take a line and get an infusion and ummy...

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
(Sanae) After all, I can't get well without Asura.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
(Ayumu) ​​Yes.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Before you put in the fluid, first draw blood.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Professor Anno, are you still there? Bowes Echo Hurry.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm back at Bowes. Understood .

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
(Ayumu) ​​Do I have to go home?

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
(Sanae) Director Tamon will scold you.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
(Male) There...! If you keep quiet, you won't be found out.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
(Tamon) That's not the case.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Why is the director here?

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
If your working hours continue like this, you'll be out of business.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Go home and take a break. Even though there is a patient ➡

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
There's no way I can go home.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Professor Yakushiji. Is that patient appendicitis?

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Ah... Yes. My appendix is ​​enlarged to about 13mm.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Can I do the operation? If it's appendicitis, I can do it too.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It seems there's no more curtain on Anno.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
(Ayumu) ​​It seemed like Anno-sensei would not have agreed.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
(Sanae) She's a person who works without taking a break as long as there are patients.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,666
I'm worried that it won't ruin your body.

52
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:31,000
Well, I can understand Anno's feelings too.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
When we were young, we all felt that way. ➡

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He is called to me day and night, and sleeps at the hospital every day.

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I even almost fell asleep while I was operating.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Is it during operation? (Daikoku) What does it mean to work to save lives?

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,666
I thought that was the case.

58
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,666
But... (Sanae) I'm about to go back to work.

59
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,333
Huh? (Ayumu) ​​I have also had the test done.

60
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm going to the ICU for a round.

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The best part is now.

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm happy to finally be able to work. In the end I haven't gone home...

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Is Anno-sensei a home?

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
(Kayoko) What?

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Ah sorry! Of course there is.

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
come . (Kayoko) What?

67
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
yes . (Intercom) (Kichijoji) Male in his 60s. ➡

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It fell from the third floor of the apartment building. Please accept it.

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Falling... Bring it straight away.

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:54,000
♬～

72
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It comes in a stretcher. (Kichijoji) It's turning. ➡

73
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Let's go with 3. (Everyone) 123.

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Call me an X-ray. Hurry to secure the line.

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll take the line. (Ayumu) ​​Cutting clothes.

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Please give me an echo. (Ayumu) ​​Yes.

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
(Hashimoto) Haa haa haa...

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,666
His wife talks about her husband on the balcony.

79
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:27,000
He said he might have slipped his foot.

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Is it a balcony? (Kichijoji) Yes.

81
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
However, it seems that he hasn't actually seen it falling.

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I was a little curious about his wife's condition.

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Ah... I understand. First, treatment will be prioritized.

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
please .

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
(Daikoku) What is the situation? Severe lung contusion in the right chest.

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound)

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,666
(Kayoko) Saturation is 83 with a 15-liter reservoir of oxygen.

88
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,333
Intubate. Bouz prepare sedatives.

89
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:00,000
yes! (Hashimoto) Ugh... ➡

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
ah! What...

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yes... good... Haa haa...

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's fine now...

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Ah... haa... please do nothing...

94
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Professor Anno!

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound) (Ayumu) ​​This is VF!

96
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
DC Charge Quick! (Kayoko) Yes! ➡

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I was able to charge it.

98
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Get away. (Ayumu) ​​Yes.

99
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
(Defibrillator sound)

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound) (Kayoko) It won't return.

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
One more time. Charge 200. (Kayoko) Yes.

102
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
(Yayoi) Please stop!

103
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Do what your master says.

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
My husband has terminal cancer. ➡

105
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Even if I save myself here, I won't be able to live that long. ➡

106
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Just make it easier.

107
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
(Daikoku) Anno. Patients and families ➡

108
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I don't want any more treatment!

109
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Stop it...!

110
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Lifesaving is a place to save people.

111
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That's why I will never give up on my life.

112
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound)

113
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
(Electrocardiograph sound)

114
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Heartbeat resumes. Prepare to intubate. (Kayoko) Yes.

115
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
(Crying)

116
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
This person's body still says he doesn't want to die.

117
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:34,000
♬～

118
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
(Naomi) What? Ashura-sensei did that?

119
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
In the end, he just saved his life.

120
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But since I was taken to the emergency department,

121
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Basically, you have to save your life.

122
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I agree . Even though it's terminal cancer ➡

123
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The cancer has worsened and it has not been transported.

124
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,666
Because there isn't.

125
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:58,000
But it's a bit stumped.

126
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I wonder if an adult would fall off the balcony so easily.

127
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
(Hashimoto) "It's fine now... Please don't do anything..."

128
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
《Please make it easier》

129
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Professor Anno It seems that Hashimoto has woken up.

130
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Understood.

131
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'll go too. Anno Wait.

132
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
There's no need to go. I'll go for my place.

133
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What does that mean? For Hashimoto now

134
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Anno's presence is nothing but stressful.

135
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
From now on, I'll be removed from the in charge. ➡

136
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That's not just for Hashimoto-san.

137
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That would be better for Anno too.

138
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That patient is mine.

139
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Teacher, wait!

140
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Haa...

141
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Sorry, I'm causing trouble again.

142
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Don't apologize. Because I'm fine.

143
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I really wish I could have died like that...

144
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Don't say that.

145
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's not that the cancer will be cured ➡

146
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
There's no more meaning to live.

147
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Vitals don't seem to be a problem. I'll be examined.

148
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,666
(Hashimoto) Why did you treat me?

149
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:41,000
I told you not to do anything.

150
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Haa... Haa... my wife ➡

151
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
He must have asked me not to treat him!

152
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
(Hashimoto's Cough)

153
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I just extended my life ➡

154
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
If you think you saved someone, you're a big mistake!

155
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Hashimoto-san! Please calm down. shut up!

156
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You'd probably saved me

157
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I've been taken away from my last hope!

158
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
(Hashimoto's Cough) (Yayoi) Ah...it's fine.

159
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Hashimoto-san, let's take a deep breath. Hashimoto-san.

160
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Is there anything to say? ➡

161
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Can't you say anything on the pictograph?

162
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You trampled on the patient's will, and one day you'll be in hell!

163
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I don't want to see my face anymore.

164
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Go out quickly!

165
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:19,000
♬～

166
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Professor Anno.

167
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Why did you come to see Hashimoto?

168
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I know why I'm being rejected

169
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Are you trying to get involved?

170
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It has nothing to do with Bowes.

171
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Haa...

172
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Leave that patient to another doctor.

173
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I have a responsibility to treat him to the end.

174
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You can't let go of a patient you've helped once.

175
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I know how I feel, but that sense of responsibility ➡

176
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
One day I'll be strangled.

177
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
There was a doctor in the past who looked very similar to Anno.

178
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
He was just as responsible and skilled as you did.

179
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
No matter how difficult it is,

180
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
He was a doctor who was absolutely trying to save his patients.

181
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Of course, if you're a life-saving doctor.

182
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I always say that and work while I'm sleeping ➡

183
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
He was shaking his own body and devoted himself to his patients.

184
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:05,000
But, at some point, my mind and body exceeded my limits.

185
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I was burned out and quit my doctor.

186
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I don't want you to do that.

187
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I won't be like that.

188
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That arrogance is fatal.

189
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Learn to take a step back instead of getting into the patient.

190
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
If things continue like this, I will never be able to continue being a doctor.

191
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Don't get involved with that patient any more.

192
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What's beyond that is hell for Anno.

193
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Haa...

194
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I wonder if Anno-sensei, is it okay?

195
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I agree . (The sound of the door opening)

196
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
(The sound of the door closing)

197
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
(Intercom)

198
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
yes . This is the emergency department at Taishaku General Hospital.

199
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,333
(Intercom) (Kichijoji) Woman in her 20s. Apparently he took excessive oral sleeping pills. ➡

200
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,333
Please accept it. (Kayoko) What do you do?

201
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,000
Accept it. (Kayoko) I understand.

202
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Bowes I'll prepare. yes .

203
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm going.

204
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Huh?

205
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You, Ashura-sensei, you should take a little rest.

206
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,666
That's not necessary.

207
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,000
(Naomi) But if it were you as usual ➡

208
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You're waiting for the hotline even before it rings, right? ➡

209
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
In that situation, you won't be able to properly examine them.

210
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
(Kichijoji) Komatsu Chika, 20 years old. ➡

211
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It appears that I took the medicine about 30 minutes ago. ➡

212
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It comes in a stretcher.

213
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
(Kichijoji) I'll make a comeback.

214
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
(Kichijoji) Let's start at 3. (Everyone) 123.

215
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
(Daikoku) Komatsu-san! Komatsu-san! ➡

216
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
My level of consciousness is getting worse.

217
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
(Naomi) It would be better to have a stomach lavage. (Daikoku) Let's do that. ➡

218
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Please prepare an 18 French margen tube. (Ayumu) ​​I understand.

219
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Komatsu-san: You woke up.

220
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,666
Why did you help? (Daikoku) What?

221
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,333
If you leave it alone ➡

222
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,000
I might have died this time!

223
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Komatsu-san, please calm down. (Chika) I didn't ask for it ➡

224
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You guys did it on your own!

225
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
As soon as we have patients brought in,

226
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I have to save my life. Because that's our job.

227
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I didn't want you to help me.

228
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I thought it would finally be over, but it's the worst!

229
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I don't want to talk anymore! Get out! Get out!

230
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,333
Komatsu-san, I understand... (Chika) It's noisy!

231
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm telling you to leave! (Daikoku) Let's go for now.

232
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Ah, teacher.

233
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
My husband said something terrible yesterday ➡

234
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm sorry.

235
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And I was also at that time ➡

236
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Tell me to stop the treatment ➡

237
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Sorry. sorry .

238
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Actually, my husband is also a doctor.

239
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Is that so?

240
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
As a palliative care doctor➡

241
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I've seen many patients. ➡

242
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:54,000
That's why I wanted to let my husband reach the end he wanted.

243
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
(Yayoi) But I guess so ➡

244
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm so happy that you were alive.

245
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Teacher: Thank you so much for helping my husband.

246
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's not helped yet. Huh?

247
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That person really wants to live.

248
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I'm a patient, so I'll never abandon him until the end.

249
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
(Daikoku) Thank you for your hard work. (Naomi) Thank you for your hard work.

250
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Huh, you haven't returned yet?

251
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I thought I'd come to Komatsu's face before heading home.

252
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,666
Huh?

253
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,000
I was kicked out earlier though ➡

254
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It may have calmed down a bit.

255
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
But what will you do if you get kicked out like before?

256
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,666
Huh?

257
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:18,000
I think it's also for her to just keep quiet for her.

258
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It may certainly be that you should watch over it.

259
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:32,000
But actually, there was a similar patient before.

260
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Without knowing how to get involved

261
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I was relieved and I was discharged from the hospital.

262
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:48,000
The day I was discharged from the hospital, the patient was brought back to me again.

263
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
This time I couldn't help.

264
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
My regrets still continue to disappear.

265
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
If I had listened carefully to that time,

266
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It may not have ended that way.

267
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,666
(Daikoku) That's why it's even more

268
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:17,000
I can't leave Komatsu-san alone.

269
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Daikoku-sensei is great.

270
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm like a teacher ➡

271
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I've never been involved with a patient.

272
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
But if you want to save patients ➡

273
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It's not the time to say you can't do it.

274
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
(Daikoku) Yes.

275
00:22:50,000 --> 00:23:09,000
♬～

276
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
(Tamon) "Don't get involved with that patient any more."

277
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
{What's beyond that is hell for Anno.

278
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
⚟ (Chika) I told you not to come!

279
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
⚟ (Daikoku) It was a persistent, persistent Daikoku.

280
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
But tomorrow will come again.

281
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Haa...

282
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
(Saki) Um...

283
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
(Naomi) Yes.

284
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Is Komatsu Chika's hospital room here?

285
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
That's right, but are you a friend?

286
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I'm not a friend, or a colleague at work. I was asked to bring my change of clothes.

287
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Does that mean you can't ask your family?

288
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I think so.

289
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
If you like, can I tell you a little bit?

290
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Sorry, suddenly. (Saki) I'm going to work from night anyway.

291
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Have you been with Komatsu for a long time? (Saki) Not at all.

292
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I'll even talk when I meet at my part-time job. (Naomi) That's right.

293
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Chika: Was it okay? (Naomi) Yes.

294
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
My body is fine now.

295
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
good . Because I called an ambulance.

296
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
you?

297
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Chika called me and he seemed to be taking medicine and it looked dangerous.

298
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
That's right. Thanks to this, it wasn't important.

299
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
But Komatsu-san said this earlier.

300
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
He didn't want him to help.

301
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I've been a doctor for a long time now.

302
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
This is the first time I've been told that...

303
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I couldn't say anything.

304
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm not serious about not wanting to help you.

305
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
To be honest, I'm just scared to be rejected.

306
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Other people will betray you anyway.

307
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
So I'm getting even more numb ➡

308
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
There are more difficult things than good ones.

309
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,666
If that's the case, there's no need to force yourself to live.

310
00:26:36,666 --> 00:26:39,000
That's what I think.

311
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,000
But I really want someone to help me.

312
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Well, it's just me.

313
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I'm going soon. (Naomi) Thank you for talking.

314
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:23,000
♬～

315
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
(Yayoi) I'm glad I moved to the general ward.

316
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Hey, I might be able to be discharged from the hospital soon.

317
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
That's right.

318
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Well then, tomorrow.

319
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Sorry for causing trouble.

320
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
You said you didn't apologize. (Hashimoto) Then...

321
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,666
good night . (Yayoi) Yes, good night.

322
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:58,000
Yayoi. (Yayoi) Yes?

323
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Has my patient contacted me?

324
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
It's not in there. Don't worry.

325
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
He's already taken over by another teacher.

326
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
That's right. (Yayoi) I'll go home then.

327
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
(Hashimoto) Good night. (Yayoi) Good night.

328
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Be careful. (Yayoi) Yes.

329
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
If I save my life ➡

330
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I thought it would save the patients.

331
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
(Kayoko) Yes. If you stay at a lifesaving site for a long time ➡

332
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
It's been made to be reminded that it's not that simple ➡

333
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Yes... It happened many times.

334
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
We helped Hashimoto and Komatsu-san ➡

335
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Maybe it was a mistake.

336
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
(Intercom)

337
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Professor Anno couldn't take the hotline again.

338
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
yes . (Intercom) (A paramedic) Female in her 60s. ➡

339
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I'm in a severe shock due to traffic injuries. Please accept it.

340
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Professor Anno, what do you do? Accept now.

341
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000

She was desperately trying to live. I just helped with that.

I've been struggling with Yayoi up until now.

414

So I didn't want to cause any more trouble.

415
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
That's why they refused treatment.
