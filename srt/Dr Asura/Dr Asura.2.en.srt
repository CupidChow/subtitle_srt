1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,000
(Ju Luo) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
1 2 3 4 5... (Kichijoji) 11 year old boy ➡

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Falling into the river and drowning. I'm currently in cardiac arrest.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
(Hayato's father) Hayato! Hayato! 1 2 3! It's here.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
(Together) 1 2 3!

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
teacher! please! ➡

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Please help Hayato! (Kayoko) Dad! ➡

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'll be treating it now. With Ambeau.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
(Hand) Yes! (Kichijoji) Please.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
cold… .

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm getting hypothermia. How long were you underwater?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
(Kichijoji) It is believed that it had sunk for nearly an hour.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,666
An hour! ? What about the deep body temperature?

14
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:39,333
(Sanae) It is 17.4℃. Heat it more.

15
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,000
Bring me an electric blanket. (Sanae) Yes.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Ventilation. yes .

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound)

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
No good! It's Asis. ⚟ (Ayumu) ​​Teacher!

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
(Ayumu) ​​PCPS is not available. What...

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Warm directly from within the body. Insert the thoracic drain left and right ➡

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
From there, saline at 40°C is injected into the chest cavity and perfused.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Prepare for drainage. (Ayumu) ​​I understand!

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound)

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Haa haa haa...

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
(Sanae) Dr. It's been 60 minutes since the start of perfusion.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What about the deep body temperature? (Sanae) It's 30.4°C.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Continue to administer raw food. Add some warming.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
(Sanae) Yes.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:52,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound)

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Reopen.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound)

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
(Ayumu) ​​Yakushiji Dr. What are you doing, please resume soon.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
(High breathing)

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Go ahead! (Electrocardiograph warning sound)

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Because... I've been going on for over an hour. ➡

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
My heartbeat won't go back...

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
teacher! It's not possible anymore! Let's give up....

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I still have to live. keep it up!

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound)

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
keep it up! (Electrocardiograph warning sound)

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
(Sanae) Two minutes have passed.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
(Electrocardiograph sound)

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay, there's still a possibility. DC, prepare!

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
(Ayumu) ​​Yes!

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
(Electrocardiograph sound)

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
(Fudo) Is it possible that Chairman Dr. Anno will be assigned to the surgery department?

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What on earth is it? (Kongou) That trouble maker ➡

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's unbelievable to have them join our surgical team!

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Relax a little. (Kongou) Sorry.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's not officially decided yet.

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What does it mean? (Tamon) If the emergency department is closed ➡

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
To give a doctor as skilled as Anno to another hospital, Misumisu?

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's not a waste. (Kongou) That's true.

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
If you transfer to surgery and have them undergo surgery, you will become a great earnings player. ➡

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's Tamon-sensei's nice ideas.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
(Kungo) I mentioned earlier that "If the emergency department is closed"

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
As you said, does that mean that the closure has not yet been decided?

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I believe that the only way to make the new hospital come true is to close it.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Well, the existence of emergency departments for us.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's just a hindrance.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But I can't believe that Professor Tamon... it's not.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm surprised Dr. Tamon cuts off the emergency department.

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I went abroad and it was a lot of change of mind, and it was different.

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It looks like he's had a change of heart.

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
There are other hospitals in the area that accept emergency patients.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If there is cooperation between hospitals

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The patient's lives will continue to be saved as ever.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
(Ayumu) ​​Was Hayato's father okay?

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
(Kayoko) It seems she's calmed down. (Ayumu) ​​That's good.

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I was worried because I was quite upset.

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Actually, I was a long time ago

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
My son was taken to the emergency room in a traffic accident.

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
My legs swelled and I couldn't move.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Even though he's a nurse.

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That's what happens if your child is hurt right in front of you.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
No matter how many medical workers they are, they are parents.

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
(Ayumu) ​​But Hayato's heartbeat will resume➡

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I didn't think so. (Sanae) As expected, Ashura-sensei is amazing.

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
⚟ (Automatic door opening sound)

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Professor Anno. what?

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Sorry!

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I stopped my heart massage without my permission...

83
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The river water at this time of year is still cold.

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Even if it is submerged in cold water for more than an hour ➡

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Sometimes it can survive.

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So I didn't give up and continued to revive it.

87
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I didn't know...

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
If only Bouz was there in that situation ➡

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That girl was dead by now.

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
A hellish situation can be fatal.

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He's probably a resident, though.

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Take responsibility for the life of the patient in front of you.

93
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
yes .

94
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:31,000
♬～

95
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Please please!

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
When Professor Anno breaks the rules next, Professor Daikoku will be demoted due to lack of leadership.

97
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That's what you said, didn't you? (Daikoku) That's not it...

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
(Fudo) Today, Dr. Daikoku will be appointed as the head of the emergency department.

99
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You will be asked to get off. (Daikoku) Please.

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Once more... Give me another chance!

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
please!

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
If you're saying that much, that's fine.

103
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
(Daikoku) Thank you! (Unmoving) However ➡

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
There's definitely no second time.

105
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
This is your last chance.

106
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Haa... What's wrong?

107
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
(Kayoko) The director said that overtime pay for emergency department is too high ➡

108
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I got scolded. (Ayumu) ​​If you have any complaints ➡

109
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Let's increase our staff. (Kayoko) We're in the deficit all year round ➡

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You can't listen to it at all. But there's a lot every day ➡

111
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Patients are busy, right? Why is it in the red?

112
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,666
Intubation per session costs 5,000 yen. Huh?

113
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:48,000
Heart massage 30 minutes 2,500 thoracic drainage 2,750 yen ➡

114
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Counter shock: 35,000 yen.

115
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Do you think it's expensive? What... what do you think?

116
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
By the way, cardiac surgery valve replacement costs 1 million yen.

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's expensive! (Kayoko) What is the reward for entering the hospital?

118
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's incredibly cheap, but we've got staff at night and on holidays.

119
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
The more they have to be allocated, the higher labor costs.

120
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Of course it's going to be in the red, right? (Ayumu) ​​Emergency department patients ➡

121
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's coming regardless of time. (Kayoko) For the hospital ➡

122
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Surgery costs more money than emergency care.

123
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
(Tamon) "An emergency department that won't make a profit"

124
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It will close soon

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
(Kayoko) What about Dr. Yakushiji? Are you planning to become a life-saving doctor in the future?

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
No no no, I definitely don't want it!

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm a trainee, and when I'm done, I'll take over my parents' dermatology department.

128
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
(The sound of the automatic door opening) I'm a person with ICU pneumonia ➡

129
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Call it if your blood pressure is below 90. Understood .

130
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
(Tamon) "I'm going to kill my life."

131
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
(Kayoko) "Maybe Ashura-sensei is relieved too" ➡

132
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
{I've been working hard on my own while Professor Tamon is away}

133
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
(Daikoku) Haa...

134
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
(Mobile phone) (Vibrator sound)

135
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Ah... Haa...

136
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
(Mobile phone) (Kaori) Yes. (Daikoku) Divorce case➡

137
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I want you to think about it again. (Mobile phone) You said that.

138
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm at my limit now. (Daikoku) But ➡

139
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I might be one more step further and become the head of the medical department.

140
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And then there's family time too... (Mobile phone) It's fine. ➡

141
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You don't know anything. (Mobile phone) (Currency sounds)

142
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
No, ah... (Mobile phone) (No sound)

143
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Haa...

144
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
(Kongou) Is it a last chance for Daikoku-sensei?

145
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Since he couldn't fire Anno-sensei, he needs a guardian for her.

146
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
surely! As expected of the director!

147
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Great insight & great something.

148
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
No, I'm impressed.

149
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
If the emergency department disappears, he will also be headed.

150
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
surely . I'm impressed.

151
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Chairman! Which one are you in?

152
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
(Ago) Ah... I'm coming to see Professor Nakazono of the Democratic Party of Japan.

153
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
With Secretary-General Nakazono! ? I'll accompany you too.

154
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That's pretty good. Today, Professor Tamon set it up.

155
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
(Unmoving) What... (Ago) So, Director Fudo➡

156
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Also, please.

157
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
(Among) What are the cases where you are considering closing the emergency department?

158
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Did you tell Anno? (Tamon) Yes.

159
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What was she saying? (Tamon) What is Anno's opinion?

160
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It doesn't matter. (Amuro) That might be true.

161
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But Dr. Tamon: The emergency department is closed ➡

162
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Is it really your true feelings?

163
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I think that's the best option.

164
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
(Kongo) Tamon has been taking on the role of the chairman of the board of directors a little while ago.

165
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
If things continue like this, they could be taken away from being the director of the new hospital.

166
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I have to do something as soon as possible.

167
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Director. I have one idea.

168
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Leave it all to this Kongo Matayoshi!

169
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
As expected from Kongo-sensei, I'm looking forward to it.

170
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I... I threw it...

171
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:46,333
(Laughter)

172
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
(Laughter)

173
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
(Daikoku) Yes, it's over. ➡

174
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Please take care when you go home. (Female) Thank you.

175
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
(Daikoku) Take good care of me.

176
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Kyuyo-san! (Sanae) Yes.

177
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
If Anno tried to get a critically ill patient tonight ➡

178
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Please stop it for sure. (Sanae) What?

179
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That's not possible for me. Please tell Professor Anno directly.

180
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Ah... Then the phone. Please contact me.

181
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Huh. (Daikoku) I ordered it.

182
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Please do your best! (Sanae) What...

183
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
(Kaori) Can you write this down?

184
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Please wait a moment. Let's talk properly.

185
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
(Kaori) Shota also understood. ➡

186
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I can't do anything more with you.

187
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
What! ? Daikoku-sensei, did you ask me to go home?

188
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But it's impossible, there's Mr. Ashura.

189
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
⚟ (The sound of the door opening)

190
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
come . (Intercom)

191
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
(Siren)

192
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Hurry up! ah… .

193
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'll touch the clothes. (Ayumu) ​​We've arrived.

194
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
do you understand? (Ayumu) ​​Can you hear it?

195
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Can you say your name?

196
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What about the vitals? Blood pressure 100 rate 130 ➡

197
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Saturation 98 Two digits of consciousness level.

198
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Prepare for your blood count to live. Take two lines.

199
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
(Ayumi and Yasu) Yes. There is a large amount of left retroperitoneal hematoma.

200
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Does that mean you're bleeding from the back?

201
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
If you don't stop bleeding quickly, you will get bleeding shock.

202
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
What! ? (Ayumu) ​​X-rays have arrived!

203
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Hurry your chest and pelvis.

204
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Hemothorax in the left lung. Do you also have bleeding from your lungs?

205
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
If things continue like this, respiratory failure in the lungs will occur.

206
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
(Ayumu) ​​Teacher! The bleeding in my head won't stop!

207
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Continue to stop the compression. Get ready for operation now.

208
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's not possible on our own. Let's invite the surgeon to support us!

209
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
(Sanae) Dr. ICU patient has difficulty breathing after removing the patient himself.

210
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's impossible to go there right now. (Sanae) What are you talking about? ➡

211
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The patient is dying. This patient too ➡

212
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,666
It's about to die! (Sanae) So then➡

213
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,000
What should I do?

214
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
(Sanae) Professor Anno please give me your instructions.

215
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What about the vitals? (Ayumu) ​​Blood pressure 125 Pulse 109 ➡

216
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's saturation 99.

217
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It lasts for three minutes. Huh?

218
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'll take care of it as soon as I get back. Call me for surgery.

219
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Please wait!

220
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
(Ayumu) ​​Teacher, let's invite support! Ah, that's right...

221
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
(mobile phone)

222
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
(Kongou) Yes. (Mobile phone) Sorry, it's an emergency department!

223
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
(Kongou) What's wrong? (Mobile phone) I would like to ask for help ➡

224
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I am a patient with multiple trauma in my 70s. (Kongou) Ah, that's difficult. ➡

225
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'll go and help you out right away. (Mobile phone) Is it true? ➡

226
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
thank you . (Kongou) But I'm busy right now ➡

227
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I can't let go of my hands.

228
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Please take a CT scan before I go.

229
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I wonder if he'll come right now...

230
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
(Mobile phone) (Cancel call) (Mobile phone) (Not able to connect)

231
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Macaron Canelé A bo from Macarons...

232
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Shortcake pretending to be.

233
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
That's good, that's good, that's good.

234
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It's tasty. (Laughter)

235
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
(Ayumu) ​​Teacher, what do you do?

236
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
CT! I have to check with Professor Anno.

237
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound)

238
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
(Sanae) Saturation is 70. Reintubate the laryngoscope.

239
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
(Sanae) Yes. (mobile phone)

240
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound) (Mobile phone)

241
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It won't come out! 《A hellish situation and confusion can be fatal》

242
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
"He's probably a resident, though.

243
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Take responsibility for the life of the patient in front of you.

244
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's tachycardia, but the saturation is stable.

245
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
We'll take it to the CT room now.

246
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
(Ayumu) ​​Do I have to check with Professor Anno?

247
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
The data is also required by the teacher. Hurry!

248
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
(Sanae) What's wrong? Laryngeal edema.

249
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It is narrowed and cannot be reintubated. Preparation for a cricothyroid incision.

250
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
(Sanae) Yes.

251
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound)

252
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Please stop!

253
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
(Cell phone) Take it.

254
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
(Sanae) Yes. (mobile phone)

255
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
(Mobile phone) (Operating sound) What?

256
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
(Mobile phone) The teacher was in a state of shock!

257
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
This is the CT room! Come right away!

258
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Impossible . Surgical airways are being secured.

259
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Why are you taking CT scans?

260
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Because Kongo-sensei should take a picture...

261
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I checked with the emergency staff earlier and found that the patient was an elderly person with no relatives.

262
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
There's no need to worry about being sued even if you die.

263
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The patient doesn't even look at the test... I see.

264
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I guess he didn't intend to see it in the first place.

265
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
If this means that the emergency department has killed a patient ➡

266
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Imposing all responsibility on the medical director Tamon ➡

267
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You can kick him out.

268
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Director. Leave it all to this Kongo Matayoshi!

269
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It's not a great hellish scene.

270
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Make sure you keep it until I go!

271
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
What! ? But what should I do...? (Electrocardiograph warning sound)

272
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Blood accumulates in the chest cavity and causes respiratory circulation failure.

273
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Intubate now. I can't intubate!

274
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Teacher, please help!

275
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You are the only one who can help a patient.

276
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Get your heart occupy!

277
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
(Mobile phone) (Currency sound) Teacher?

278
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
teacher! (Electrocardiograph warning sound)

279
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
(Ayumu) ​​Saturation is steadily dropping!

280
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound) Please... go up.

281
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:07,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound)

282
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I'll intubate!

283
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
(Ayumu) ​​Yasu: Have you done anything?

284
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
When I was a student! With a doll...

285
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
But I have no choice.

286
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Please give me a laryngoscope!

287
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:45,000
♬～

288
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It won't fit...

289
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Why isn't it coming in...?

290
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
If I don't do it early, I'll die...

291
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound)

292
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
(Ayumu) ​​Teacher Saturation 70! I know!

293
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Get in! Put it in and put it in...

294
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Come in! (Ayumu) ​​Saturation 60!

295
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Get in! Please come in...

296
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
(Ayumu) ​​What's wrong?

297
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's not possible... (Ayumu) ​​What?

298
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It's impossible for me after all...

299
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
(Ayumu) ​​It's impossible... There's no other way here!

300
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
But it's not possible!

301
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Professor Anno... Please help me...

302
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Also please. (Sanae) Yes.

303
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Damn it!

Haa haa haa...

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Well, I think I'll go soon.

308
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'll see Asura's face distorted by pain.

309
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Here's a poem.

310
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Maybe Ashura is distorted by pain in a hellish scene.

311
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
how are you!

312
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Asuraba is a hellish scene and shrubs.

00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Oops, it's bad to laugh.

315

Go!

316
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Well, sorry I'm late. The patient's condition...

317
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
What! ?

318
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Tamon! ? Uh... that's a lie... ➡

319
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Is it possible that you're operating here?

320
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
(Tamon) There is a blood clot on the dorsal side of the hilar. Find the source of bleeding.

321
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
(Ayumu) ​​Dr. I'm bleeding...

322
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Stop the bleeding. Nagashiko and Nagakoper. (Ayumu) ​​Yes!

(Tamon) I'll go back and try again with satin skiing.

327
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
yes .

328
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Stop it. (Tamon) Now.

329
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000

Ah! I... Tamon...

(Tamon) For now, my respiratory hemodynamics have stabilized.

That was good. (Tamon) I'll ask for the rest ➡

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Professor Kongo. ( Kongo ) Of course ➡

338
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Leave it to this Kongo Matayoshi...

339
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Why did you help?

340
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
He said he was going to shut down the emergency department.

341
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
(Tamon) I'll be taken to the emergency department ➡

342
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It's not that I want to abandon the patient's lives.

343
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
So why did it close...?

344
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
What about the promise?

345
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Have you forgotten your promise yet?

346
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
(Tamon) "When I get back, we'll be together ➡

347
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Let's change the way Japan saves life

348
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Ugh....

349
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Haa...

350
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
(Tamon) "I'm going to kill my life."

351
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Ah... um!

352
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,000
what? Did something happen with Professor Tamon?

353
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
There's nothing though.

354
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Maybe something was said again...

355
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Also? What does it mean?

356
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Ah! During this time ➡

357
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I heard they were told that the emergency department was closing...

358
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
OK?

359
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It's not something that Bowes is worried about.

360
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
But... Professor Tamon ➡

361
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
That means you betrayed the emergency department, right?

362
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
While Professor Tamon is away ➡

363
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Mr. Anno has to be the one who worked hard on his own...!

364
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Bouzu is unable to satisfy treatment alone ➡

365
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
It's 100 years earlier that I'm worried!

366
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Make sure you can intubate by tomorrow.

367
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Haa... ➡

368
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,666
Wow. (Sanae) Professor Daikoku.

369
00:27:09,666 --> 00:27:12,000
(Okoku) Patients! ? (Sanae) Professor Kongo came to visit ➡

370
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I was recently admitted to the surgery.

371
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
(Kongou) We are very sorry that we were unable to meet your expectations!

372
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I can't believe Tamon comes to help... damn!

373
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Damn it! Asura still seems to do whatever she wants.

374
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
He would have been able to get her to his neck by now.

375
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I'm going to do it! Let's do it!

376
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
It's difficult... I'm sorry!

377
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
What's going on at all! ➡

378
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Do something about that woman!

379
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
We apologize for the inconvenience. (Fudo) Daikoku Sensei ➡

380
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I was disappointed with you.

381
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I'll be very careful about Anno.

382
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
So just relegation...

383
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
please!

384
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
(Undo) As I have said many times, we have a serious patient ➡

385
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
It's a policy that I won't accept.

386
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
The rules of the organization are absolute. You know, right?

387
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:23,000
♬～

388
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Anno! What did you do?

389
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I'm not doing anything that's said to me.

390
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I was forced to call the emergency department from the surgery ➡

391
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
There was a complaint that the work was hindered.

392
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Forced? That's a lie! Rather, it didn't come at all ➡

393
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
The patient was about to die. (Daikoku) First of all, seriously ill patients are ➡

394
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I'm sure you're telling me not to accept it! (Sanae) But that patient ➡

395
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Four of them had been denied transport. If I refuse to do so ➡

396
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
He definitely passed away. (Daikoku) That's what it is➡

397
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It doesn't matter!

398
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
(Daikoku) I can't believe you guys are influenced by Anno ➡

399
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I guess I'm not accepting it. This is a hospital. It's an organization!

400
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Orders from above are absolute.

401
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
(Ayumu) ​​Please take care!

402
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Why did the patient survive?

403
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Can't you honestly be happy?

404
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Teacher, wait.

405
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
(Typing sound)

406
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I'm going to the Bowes ICU.

407
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
come .

408
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Haa... Haa... Haa.... ➡

409
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Ahh!

410
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
(Intercom) Ah...

411
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
(Intercom) (Kichijoji) Due to a traffic accident caused by a car out of control➡

412
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Please accept one child. Currently, blood pressure cannot be measured.

413
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I have a level of consciousness of three digits. Bring me with you.

414
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
(Daikoku) Stop it. I'm not a patient who can be seen at home.

415
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
You wouldn't see any patient.

416
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And you're a child, right? Accept it easily ➡

417
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
What will I do if something happens? It could lead to a lawsuit!

418
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Please refuse quickly. Hmm. (Intercom) (Operating sound)

419
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
How many times do you say it to me?

420
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Our policy is not to accept critically ill patients!

421
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
The rules of hospitals are absolute.

422
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
(Intercom) (Kaori) Help me... Shota!

423
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
(Intercom) (Kichijoji) Mom, please stay calm!

424
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
(Intercom) (Operating sound) (Okuraku) Is it Kaori?

425
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
(Intercom) (Kaori) You... no one will accept you. ➡

426
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Shota is going to die! (Daikoku) Shota! ?

427
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
(Intercom) Hey, please. help me!

428
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
(Intercom) (Kichijoji) Is it possible to accept it! ?

429
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I don't have a doctor to treat pediatric trauma.

430
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
To the Tooh University Lifesaving Center ➡

431
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Can you carry it? (Intercom) Tooh University is full of beds ➡

432
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I was refused. (Daikoku) What...

433
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
(Intercom) All nearby hospitals are not accepted. ➡

434
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
No destination found! (Daikoku) That's not it...

435
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
We'll accept it. Bring it straight away.

436
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Stop it, I can't help here...

437
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
It's your son.

438
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I will definitely save you from the hellish situation.

439
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:19,000
♬～

440
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Prepare it immediately. (Hotachi) Yes!

441
00:32:37,752 --> 00:32:39,252
(Kichijoji) Let's start at 3. (Everyone) 123.

442
00:32:39,252 --> 00:32:41,252
Take two lines. Dosed fully infusion.

443
00:32:41,252 --> 00:32:42,918
yes! (Ayumu) ​​Cut off her clothes.

444
00:32:42,918 --> 00:32:45,252
What about the vitals? Blood pressure 70 Pulse 150 Saturation is ➡

445
00:32:45,252 --> 00:32:49,252
4 liters of mask is 88%. His face is pale, tachycardia, and his blood pressure is low.

446
00:32:49,252 --> 00:32:53,252
Shocked. What causes the shock...

447
00:32:55,252 --> 00:32:57,252
blunt damage.

448
00:32:57,252 --> 00:33:00,252
Does that mean your internal organs are being damaged? ?

449
00:33:06,252 --> 00:33:09,252
(Electrocardiograph warning sound)

450
00:33:09,252 --> 00:33:11,252
(Ayumu) ​​Dr. My blood pressure has dropped to 60.

451
00:33:11,252 --> 00:33:13,252
Operate now. Call me an anesthesiologist as soon as possible.

452
00:33:13,252 --> 00:33:14,918
(Ayumu) ​​Yes. Preparation for blood transfusion.

Retractor. (Sanae) Yes.

457
00:33:36,252 --> 00:33:38,252
Aspirate it. yes!

458
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:46,252
Deeper! Understood!

459
00:33:46,252 --> 00:33:48,252
The spleen is damaged. What! ?

460
00:33:48,252 --> 00:33:51,252
Suture. 3-0 biker. (Sanae) Yes.

461
00:34:00,252 --> 00:34:04,252
strange . The bleeding won't stop.

462
00:34:04,252 --> 00:34:06,252
Chouji and gauze. Besides the spleen ➡

463
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:09,252
Does that mean there is a bleeding point?

464
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:16,252
(Daikoku) Haa haa haa...

465
00:34:25,252 --> 00:34:27,252
Suck here. yes!

466
00:34:27,252 --> 00:34:29,252
No, here! What...

467
00:34:29,252 --> 00:34:33,252
quickly! Ah.

468
00:34:33,252 --> 00:34:37,252
Sorry! I'm getting changed!

469
00:34:42,252 --> 00:34:44,252
where? (Electrocardiograph warning sound)

470
00:34:44,252 --> 00:34:47,252
(Ayumu) ​​The doctor's blood pressure is falling steadily!

471
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:52,252
Where is it... where! ? I can't see it because of bleeding!

472
00:34:52,252 --> 00:34:54,252
Where is it! ?

473
00:34:54,252 --> 00:34:58,252
(Electrocardiograph warning sound)

474
00:34:58,252 --> 00:35:02,252
where… . (Electrocardiograph warning sound)

475
00:35:18,252 --> 00:35:21,252
Daikoku Sensei...

476
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:24,252
(Daikoku) Please let me help too.

477
00:35:26,252 --> 00:35:29,252
Can I operate my child?

478
00:35:37,252 --> 00:35:42,252
(Okoku) I'm a doctor. I want to help my son.

479
00:35:44,252 --> 00:35:47,252
The field of surgery will be expanded. Find the bleeding point. (Daikoku) Understood.

480
00:35:47,252 --> 00:35:49,252
Gauze. (Sanae) Yes.

481
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:56,252
(Daikoku) The liver is fine. The back of my stomach...

482
00:35:56,252 --> 00:35:58,252
Kelly. (Sanae) Yes.

483
00:36:12,252 --> 00:36:15,252
What's wrong?

484
00:36:15,252 --> 00:36:21,252
(Daikoku) The pancreas is completely torn on the portal vein.

485
00:36:21,252 --> 00:36:24,252
What! ? (Daikoku) He has already suffered a considerable amount of bleeding. ➡

486
00:36:24,252 --> 00:36:29,252
I can't spend any more time. To stop the bleeding ➡

487
00:36:29,252 --> 00:36:35,252
All we have to do is remove the entire tail of the pancreas.

488
00:36:35,252 --> 00:36:40,252
Resection... is it okay?

489
00:36:40,252 --> 00:36:43,252
I'm only 12 years old! (Daikoku) There's nothing I can do! ➡

490
00:36:43,252 --> 00:36:45,252
You will need to insulin injections for the rest of your life.

491
00:36:45,252 --> 00:36:48,252
It cannot be replaced by life! What are you talking about?

492
00:36:48,252 --> 00:36:52,252
No resection. Huh?

493
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:57,252
(Daikoku) But in this situation there is no other way to help but remove it!

494
00:36:59,252 --> 00:37:01,252
Letton-Wilson surgery.

495
00:37:04,252 --> 00:37:08,252
Close the cephalic stump of the pancreas and debris the crushed area ➡

496
00:37:08,252 --> 00:37:11,252
If you anastomize the tear part of the pancreatic body and the jejunum ➡

497
00:37:11,252 --> 00:37:13,252
It retains all the functions of the pancreas. (Daikoku) It's not possible! ➡

498
00:37:13,252 --> 00:37:16,252
We don't have a doctor who can do such difficult operations.

499
00:37:16,252 --> 00:37:18,252
I can do it. (Daikoku) No, but...!

500
00:37:18,252 --> 00:37:20,252
A hellish situation can be fatal.

501
00:37:20,252 --> 00:37:23,252
I don't have time to hesitate. Help me!

502
00:37:30,252 --> 00:37:32,252
(Daikoku) Understood.

503

Three-snake horns and pediatric kelly. (Sanae) Yes.

508
00:38:47,252 --> 00:38:52,252
thank you . Thank you for helping Shota.

509
00:38:55,252 --> 00:38:58,252
It's not.

510
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:04,252
In fact, I was confused about accepting Shota.

511
00:39:04,252 --> 00:39:08,252
I'm not sure if I can help Shota.

512
00:39:11,252 --> 00:39:17,252
(Okoku) I'm disqualified as both a doctor and a father.

513
00:39:20,252 --> 00:39:24,252
(Kaori) But he saved Shota's life.

514
00:39:27,252 --> 00:39:30,252
(Kaori) Did you realize it? ➡

515
00:39:30,252 --> 00:39:33,252
You've been like this until now➡

516
00:39:33,252 --> 00:39:37,252
He saved the lives of many people.

517
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:43,252
The other day Shota said this.

518
00:39:43,252 --> 00:39:47,252
In the future, he will become a life-saving doctor like his father.

519
00:39:47,252 --> 00:39:49,252
What...?

520
00:39:52,252 --> 00:39:57,252
Shota was looking at your back.

522
00:40:09,252 --> 00:40:14,252
From now on, it's for Shota ➡

523
00:40:14,252 --> 00:40:17,252
Not ashamed...➡

524
00:40:17,252 --> 00:40:21,252
I have to become a doctor who is not ashamed of.

525
00:40:24,252 --> 00:40:26,252
Yeah .

526
00:40:35,252 --> 00:40:38,252
I'm glad Shota's operation went well.

527
00:40:38,252 --> 00:40:41,252
(Kayoko) I never thought she would have had Letton-Wilson surgery to save her life.

528
00:40:41,252 --> 00:40:43,252
(Sanae) That's definitely the only one who does that is Professor Anno.

529
00:40:43,252 --> 00:40:47,252
I thought life-saving doctors were amazing.

530
00:40:47,252 --> 00:40:52,252
Because you can save the lives of your own family.

531
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:59,252
(Kayoko) Huh? Did Dr. Yakushiji also intend to become a life-saving doctor?

532
00:40:59,252 --> 00:41:02,252
No, that's absolutely impossible!

533
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:07,252
After all, I couldn't do anything again, and I couldn't save my life.

534
00:41:07,252 --> 00:41:11,252
Why did Professor Anno choose to save his life?

535
00:41:13,252 --> 00:41:19,252
I just want to save the patients.

536
00:41:21,252 --> 00:41:25,252
Professor Anno is amazing after all.

537
00:41:25,252 --> 00:41:28,252
He's cool!

538
00:41:48,252 --> 00:41:53,252
(Girl) Dad... Mom...

539
00:42:06,252 --> 00:42:10,252
father… .

540
00:42:10,252 --> 00:42:13,252
(Crying)

541
00:42:13,252 --> 00:42:17,252
mother… .

542
00:42:17,252 --> 00:42:21,252
(Crying)

543
00:42:32,252 --> 00:42:35,252
⚟ (Knock) (Amuro) Please.

544
00:42:37,252 --> 00:42:39,252
(The sound of the door closing)

545
00:42:42,252 --> 00:42:43,918
What's up?

546
00:42:43,918 --> 00:42:48,252
I have one proposal regarding the International Taishaku Hospital.

547
00:42:48,252 --> 00:42:50,252
(Ago) Did you come up with a good idea?

548
00:42:50,252 --> 00:42:55,252
Yeah . (Ago) Please let me know.

549
00:42:55,252 --> 00:42:59,252
(Fudo) I can't believe I can borrow the help of the teacher. ➡

550
00:42:59,252 --> 00:43:02,252
It's very encouraging.

551
00:43:04,252 --> 00:43:06,252
Since I was at Tooh University ➡

552
00:43:06,252 --> 00:43:10,252
I've heard the teacher's achievements.

553
00:43:10,252 --> 00:43:12,252
If you have the cooperation of the teacher ➡

554
00:43:12,252 --> 00:43:15,252
Everything will go as we want it to.

555
00:43:15,252 --> 00:43:21,252
Of course. My success rate is...➡

556
00:43:21,252 --> 00:43:24,252
That's 99%.
