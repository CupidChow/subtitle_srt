1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:07,900
(Daikoku) Okay, it's a bigger job than I thought.

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,400
It seems that all of the medical records here will be scanned and converted to digitized.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,400
I wonder how many decades of worth?

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,400
Haa... ➡

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,400
Huh? This is the chairman, right?

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,400
Was the chairman a doctor?

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,400
(Daikoku) Come to think of it, I've heard of rumors about wind. ➡

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,400
When I came to the hospital, I was already the chairman.

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,400
⚟ (Shura) What are you doing?

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,400
(Daikoku) Oh, will you see Anno too? When I was young.

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,400
come .

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,400
(Intercom)

13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,400
yes . (Intercom) (Kichijoji) I was hit by a car ➡

14
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,400
Can one pedestrian be accepted?

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,400
Bring it straight away.

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,400
(Bonten) I can't see anything because I was bleeding from Dr. Anno.

17
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,400
Aspirate it. Clamp the abdominal aorta.

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,400
Satin skiing. (Ayumu) ​​Yes.

19
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,400
(Bonten) The bleeding has stopped.

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,400
Start searching. Kelly. (Ayumu) ​​Yes.

21
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,400
Cooper. (Ayumu) ​​Yes.

22
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,400
The bleeding is over.

23
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,400
(Bonten) That's strange. I stopped bleeding but my blood pressure didn't rise.

24
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,400
Digestive fluid is leaking from the back. (Bonten) What?

25
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,400
It may be that the duodenum is damaged.

26
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,400
Remove and examine the dorsal duodenum.

27
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,400
Long Cooper. (Ayumu) ​​Yes.

28
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,400
(Ayumu) ​​My blood pressure is stable.

29
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,400
Check the progress and decide whether a second surgery is necessary.

30
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
(Ayumu) ​​Yes.

31
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
(Bonten) Do you not know your identity?

32
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,400
I own only a wallet, a license and insurance card.

33
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,400
I didn't have it. (Bonten) Oh...

34
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,400
(Kongou) Excuse me. Apparently the police had come to the ICU. ➡

35
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,400
What on earth did you do?

36
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,400
Kongo-sensei: That's not the case... ( Kongo ) So what is it?

37
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,400
Have you finally got caught?

38
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,400
No, an unknown patient has been hospitalized.

39
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,400
Unidentified patient. Another troublesome condition...

40
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
Please don't cause unnecessary trouble.

41
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,400
As the medical department manager, I am the one who is being held responsible for something.

42
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,400
Yes, be careful. (Bonten) But by the police ➡

43
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,400
Can you tell me your identity?

44
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,400
Why are you asking me?

45
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,400
What... (Kongou) Please check it out yourself.

46
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,400
Ah, sorry. (Kongou) That's how normal hand is!

47
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
Ah... (Kongou) In the police database ➡

48
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,400
If it is registered, it can be seen through fingerprint verification.

49
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,400
What, you mean a former criminal record?

50
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,400
So why ask me?

51
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,400
Ah. (Kongou) 100% of people asking!

52
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,400
That's probably the case though.

53
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,400
Details cannot be provided through personal information.

54
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
(Kayoko) Are you a former conviction from the hospital? What ➡

55
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,400
I can't listen and there's no way I could tell it myself.

56
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,400
Certainly, it's exactly what you said.

57
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,400
Once I drink tea... No, no, no.

58
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,400
That's right... not!

59
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,400
In any case, unidentified patients ➡

60
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Even if it's a hassle, it's not enough to get woken up!

61
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,400
Please keep a close eye on it!

62
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,400
Haa...

63
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,400
Sorry!

64
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,400
what? Ah... sorry.

66
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,400
(Sanae) Yes, it's an emergency department. ➡

67
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,400
I received a call from the police officer of Anno.

68
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
police? (Sanae) Regarding the patient's case➡

69
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
He says he wants to talk.

71
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400

73
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,400
The patient's identity was found. (Naomi) Who was it?

74
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
Kanbara Takashi.

75
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,400

Is it really? (Kayoko) Yes.

79
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,400
So what is Kanbara's condition? (Kayoko) Depending on the future progress ➡

80
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,400
You may need to do another operation.

81
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,400
(Kichijoji) A left knee was bruised in a collision accident between a bicycle and a car.

82
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
(Together) 1 2 3.

83
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,400
Unpackaged. (Daikoku) I'll take the line.

84
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,400
Can you say your name? (Naomi) He suffers from frequent bleeding in his left leg. ➡

85
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Prepare a suture set. (Ayumu) ​​Yes.

86
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,400
(Daikoku) It's a little cold. I'll take an ultrasound.

87
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,400
(Kana) Help me... Hmm?

88
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,400
Dad and Mom...

Chief of the department... in place of the ultrasound.

92
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,400
(Daikoku) What?

93
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,400
(Daikoku) Understood.

please .

97
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,400
(Okoku) This was the first time I saw Anno leave in the middle of treatment.

98
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,400
Is it somewhere unwell?

99
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,400
(Sanae) But that wasn't the only thing I could see.

100
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,400
What about Ashura-sensei?

101
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,400
I'm going to Kanbara-san's rounds.

102
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,400

109
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,400
For something?

110
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:47,400
The Wangan Station Interchange Incident occurred 28 years ago.

111
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,400
A 17-year-old boy attacks a pedestrian.

112
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:56,400
Three people died and more than 10 people suffered severe and minor injuries.

113
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Due to the juvenile law at the time and abuse of parents. ➡

114
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,400
As a result of leniency, he was sentenced to life imprisonment ➡

115
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:12,400
He was granted a parole application six months ago and is now released from prison.

(Naomi) I was curious about the teacher and looked it up and found it all. ➡

119
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:39,400
The three who died were a female college student and a young couple.

120
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:46,400
The young couple's last name was Anno, the same as the teacher.

121
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,400
Isn't it the teacher's parents?

122
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,400
yes .

123
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:14,400

It's impossible to go there right now!

140

(Doctor) No, I can't make it in time. All I have to do is get rid of.

00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,400
(Ago) How's your mood?

175
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,400
What about your dad and mother?

176
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:17,400
(Among) Her parents were taken to a different hospital...➡

177
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:22,400
Unfortunately, both of them died.

178
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,400
I don't like it...

179
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,400
I don't like it...

180
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:59,400
(Crying)

181
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,400
father… .

182
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:08,400
(Crying)

183
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,400
mother… .

184
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,400
No way...

185
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:25,400
Haa... Haa haa haa...

186
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:31,400
Haa... Haa... Haa....

187
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:44,400
(High breathing)

188
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,400
Did the teacher help me?

189
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,400
Why did you help?

190
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,400
I'm not worth living though.

191
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,400
(Bonten) Although it is Kanbara-san, there has been no improvement in the duodenal repair area.

192
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,400
A fundamental reconstruction surgery is needed.

193
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,400
It's going to be a pretty difficult operation.

194
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,400
So let's do the operation tomorrow morning.

195
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
The surgeon is...

196
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,400
I will.

197
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,400
I am the attending doctor.

198
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,400
I can't leave this operation to someone else.

199
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,400
(Daikoku) Understood. (Ayumu) ​​We will contact the operating room.

200
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,400
(Daikoku) Well done, then. (Ayumi and the others) Yes.

201
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,400
(Hayashi) Excuse me. I'm on probation.

202
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
(Daikoku) Is it a probation office? (Hayashi) Yes.

203
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,400
We visited the incident regarding Kanbara Takashi, who is currently undergoing parole.

204
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,400
(The sound of the curtains opening) (Hayashi) Kanbara-san. ➡

205
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,400
This is Hayashi, a probation officer. It was difficult, isn't it?

206
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,400
(Daikoku) Anno Did his parents get killed?

207
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,400
I can't help but think that the person who killed his parents appeared in front of me as a patient...

208
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,400
There's no way I can be normal.

209
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,400
I don't think she can do it.

210
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,400
"I've almost died once."

211
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,400
That's why I said that.

212
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,400
I don't think I'm worth living.

213
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:17,400
Did you hear it? What did I do in the past?

214
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,400

215
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,400

Anno.

218
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,400
This time, I'll have you missed Kanbara's operation.

219
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,400
Why… . If the operation fails ➡

220
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,400
If that becomes clear to the public, it is for revenge ➡

221
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,400
There could be a fuss about a deliberate medical error. ➡

222
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,400
I can't put that risk on you.

⚟Thank you very much.

231
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,400
The patient's condition suddenly changes. The doctors are in chaos ➡

232
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,400
When everyone was in such a difficult situation, they were trying to give up➡

233
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,400
This Kongo Matayoshi appears quickly and uses a superhuman female stylist ➡

234
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,400
He made the operation a success and turned the desperate situation around.

235
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,400
It was truly a historic achievement.

236
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,400
It is called the miracle of Taishaku.

237
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,400
Oh, as expected from the head of Kongo Medical Care Department!

238
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,400

This Kongo Matayoshi ➡

246
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,400
I have had four experiences called miracles.

250
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,400
28 years ago...➡

251
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,400
I saw Anno's medical record.

252
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
yes .

253
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,400
Two months of training in the emergency department ➡

254
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:05,400
I learned a lot from Professor Anno.

255
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,400
No matter what kind of patient he is ➡

256
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,400
I will do my best to save the life in front of me.

257
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,400
I was told that this is the job of a life surgical doctor.

258
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,400
I'm just a resident.

259
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,400
But I'm prepared.

260
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,400

I had decided to work at this hospital. Huh?

266
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,400
I will definitely become a life-saving doctor.

267
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,400
At that incident ➡

268
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:16,400
I was about to give up everything because I was being brought about by a number of places.

269
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,400
What helped me was ➡

270
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,400
I was taken to this hospital by chance➡

271
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,400
Luckily you were here.

272
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:39,400
I will become a life-saving doctor like you.

273
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,400
Like you and your parents ➡

274
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,400
Whether or not life will be saved?

275
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,400
It's not worth being influenced by luck or coincidence.

276
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:05,400
No matter where a patient is taken, any doctor can see him.

277
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:10,400
We need to create such life-saving medical care.

278
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:21,400
There's a doctor in our emergency department who is trying hard to say that.

279
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,400
Head of the Talons.

280

Right acute subdural hematoma? My brain pressure is already rising.

If things continue like this, I will not be able to breathe due to a herniated brain.

I was called to an emergency operation by the surgery.

296

Multiple other hospitals have already refused and cannot find a place to accept the service. ➡

(Daikoku) Duodenal reconstruction completed. ➡

349
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,400
Moves to washing and closing. yes .

350
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,400
(Electrocardiograph warning sound)

351
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,400
(Kayoko) Dr. Daikoku's blood pressure has risen sharply➡

352
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,400
My heartbeat is slowing. Why?

353
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,400
It was stable up until now.

354
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,400
(Daikoku) There was no bleeding from anywhere. What's going on?

355
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:16,400
(Electrocardiograph warning sound)

356
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,400
Professor Anno...

357
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,400
The right pupil is inconsistent and the opposing light reflection is lost.

358
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,400
There is suspected of rupture and blockage of the right internal carotid artery.

359
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,400
Dissociative cerebral infarction. (Daikoku) What?

360
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,400
The carotid artery was damaged due to the impact of the accident.

361
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,400
As soon as the aneurysm ruptures, it is blocked and causing a cerebral infarction.

362
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,400
(Okoku) It won't help unless you have endovascular treatment right now!

363
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,400
⚟Category room is currently not available! Repair the carotid artery now here.

364
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,400
Prepare the operation. (Everyone) Yes!

365
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,400
(Daikoku) Let's hurry up. yes .

366
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,400
(Kanbara) Why did you save him again?

367
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,400
I'm glad I died.

368
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,400
I have seen many deaths here.

369
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,400
Those who couldn't live tomorrow.

370
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,400
People are worth it just because they are alive.

371
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,400
That's true for you too.

372
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,400
I want to believe that.

Please be careful.

379
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,400
yes .

380
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,400
What about that female teacher?

381
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,400
Anno is currently operating.

382
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:58,400
So I have a request.

383
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,400

(Kanbara) Wow...

388
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:45,400
I heard from a TV station that you were on Taishaku.

389
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,400
It's my daughter's enemy!

390
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,400
(Kanbara) Ah...! Ah...

391
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,400
(Kanbara) Ah... ah...

392
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:16,400
You don't have any value in life!

Haa haa haa...

396
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,400
(Daikoku) He had already had cardiopulmonary arrest at the scene. ➡

397
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,400
It didn't respond to resuscitation at all.

398
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,400
He was confirmed dead.

399
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,400
Human lives are insane.

400
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:59,400
Kanbara-san: I left a message to you before I was discharged from the hospital.

401
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:06,400
He treated me as a person ➡

402
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,400
You were the first time.

403
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,400
yes .

404
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,400
(Among) And ➡

405
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:24,400
I want to apologise for what happened before.

406
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,400
Huh? He's you ➡

407
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:33,400
Apparently she had realised that she was the girl from that time.

Because you saved your life➡

410
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:03,400
I think he was able to face his sins.

411
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:09,400
But if I don't help him ➡

412
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,400
This didn't happen.

413
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,400
Haa... That's right.

414
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,400
(Among) Still ➡

415
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,400
If there is life before you, you want to live

416
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,400
Save without hesitation.

417
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,400
You'll continue to do that, right?

418
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,400
That's all I can do for me.
