00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
(Misuzu) Haa haa...

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,300
(Misuzu) Haa haa haa...

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,300
(Daikoku) Anno! (Shura) What?

4
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,300
(Daikoku) Did you clean up the tent on the roof?

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,300
I'm going to do it tomorrow.

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,300
(Daikoku) The other day he said he'd do it tomorrow too.

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,300
Do it now! Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes....

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,300
Yes, yes.... Huh? Huh?

9
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,300
Head of the department bring your wheelchair. Huh? Ah, I understand.

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,300
what happened?

11
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,300
(Kayoko) His blood pressure is 129 and 62.

12
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,300
(Daikoku) The vitals are calm and may be a temporary lightheadedness.

13
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,300
I came for a checkup, but I wandered away.

14
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,300
(Daikoku) Pregnant women tend to have a fluctuating blood pressure.

15
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,300
Sorry, I apologize for any inconvenience caused to all emergency departments.

16
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,300
(Daikoku) No, I'm glad that it came out.

17
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,300
Daikoku Chief. (Daikoku) What?

18
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,300
Chief Sanpo. (Kayoko) What?

19
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,300
Professor Anno too. ➡

20
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,300
Thank you very much for always.

21
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:25,300
(Kayoko) What? What... Why do you know our name?

22
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:31,300
(Misuzu) Ah, sorry. I was inadvertently late to say hello.

23
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,300
My husband always takes care of me.

24
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,300
(Daikoku) What? master?

25
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,300
The ICU round is over...

26
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,300
(Bonten) Misuzu! ?

27
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:53,300
(Kayoko) What! ? Momomo... Maybe his master is Bonten-sensei! ?

28
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,300
yes .

29
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,300
(Daikoku) That means...

30
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,300
My wife.

31
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:07,300
(The sound of typing the keyboard)

32
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,300
(Senju) Ah, Daikoku Sensei, sorry➡

33
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,300
I just had a baby and it was late.

34
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,300
(Daikoku) Thank you for your hard work. It's over there.

35
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,300
(Misuzu) Ah, sorry for Sensei.

36
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,300
(Senju) No. How is it?

37
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,300
It's getting much better. (Senju) That's good.

38
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,300
(Bonten) Sensei Sensei Please be your wife.

39
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,300
(Senju) Leave it to us. ➡

40
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,300
Let's go. (Misuzu) Yes.

41
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:54,300
Bonten-sensei, will you have a child? (Bonten) Yes.

42
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,300
I hope you will be a friend of my dad.

43
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,300
Ah yes.

44
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,300
When are you planning to be born?

45
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:07,300
Now is 35 weeks and next month is due. (Daikoku) Isn't it soon?

46
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,300
(Kayoko) Are you a boy? girl? (Bonten) A girl.

47
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,300
(Kayoko) Oh, a girl! I'm looking forward to it.

48
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,300
My husband and I both are old.

49
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,300
I have a lot of worries, but...

50
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,300
There are a lot of things that my first child doesn't understand.

51
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,300
(Naomi) It's true that giving birth at an older age means you'll be cautious in many ways.

52
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,300
(Bonten) Yes.

53
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,300
I hope you're born healthy.

54
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,300
thank you .

55
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,300
(Sanae) Hey, hey, how did Bonten-sensei and his wife get along?➡

56
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,300
Do you know? (Ayumu) What? I don't know.

57
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,300
My wife was standing outside. ➡

58
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,300
Professor Bonten happened to pass by and saved him.

59
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,300
Wow, it's so lovely!

60
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:59,300
It's a fateful encounter. (Sanae) Hey! Super exciting!

61
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,300
I'm jealous.

62
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,300
Haa... I want to get married too.

63
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,300
Are you not planning? Preserve!

64
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,300
If it had, I would have been married quite a while ago.

65
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:23,300
Does Yakushiji-sensei have a girlfriend? I'm not there though.

66
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:28,300
While I'm in the emergency department, I don't have time to fall in love.

67
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,300
Sleep is prioritized over dates.

68
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:38,300
Have you ever had a girlfriend? Huh? oh dear… .

69
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,300
Oh, what are you talking about on the youth team? It's about marriage.

70
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,300
I want to get married soon and be happy.

71
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,300
That's sweet. ➡

72
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,300
Marriage doesn't mean you can automatically be happy.

73
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,300
Marriage is especially important for men. ➡

74
00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:00,300
If you take out the garbage, you'll get 1 extra. Added 2 points when picking up and picking up children.

75
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,300
If you forget your wedding anniversary, you'll get a minus 50 points... Ah...

76
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,300
Even if the two of them started out with destiny at first➡

77
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,300
It takes effort to continue the relationship.

78
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,300
Hmm?

79
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,966
Yes, I'm used to this kind of thing.

80
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:22,633
Ah!

81
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,300
(Misuzu) Sorry for the meal.

82
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,300
That's amazing.

83
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,300
Thank you very much for now.

84
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,300
Um...

85
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,300
what?

86
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,300
Is your husband really useful to you?

87
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,300
I'm sure you know it ➡

88
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,300
That person is really tiny and anxious.

89
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,300
So you're sorry for the inconvenience to everyone?

90
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,300
I've been wondering about it for a long time.

91
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,300
I don't think I'll cause any trouble though. good .

92
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,300
That person when I was in a cardiac surgery ➡

93
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,300
I was always cornered by something and didn't seem to have time.

94
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,300
But now I'm alive and alive every day.

95
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:28,300
I think it was because of my interactions with you guys that I made him do that.

96
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:34,300
Professor Anno: I look forward to your continued support of my husband.

97
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,300
(Car driving sound)

98
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,300

99
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,300

103

105

108
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,966
(Daikoku) What! ?

109
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:59,300
(Sound)

110
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,300
Hey, what are you doing?

111
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,300
I told you to clean up... No, don't be overwhelmed!

112
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,300
come .

113
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:20,300

114
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,300
Call me an X-ray. (Ayumu) Yes.

115
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,300
I'll touch it. (Kichijoji) I entered the sidewalk ➡

116
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,300
He collided with a car and was injured. I'm aware, but ➡

117
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,300
There is little response to the appeal. (Bonten) What does that mean?

118
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,300
(Kichijoji) There is no answer to this question.

119
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,300
Do you understand?

120
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,300
Can you say the name?

121
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,300
(Bonten) Are you in shock and confused and unable to make a sound?

122
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,300
(Daikoku) That may be true.

123
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,300
You may not hear it. (Daikoku) What?

124
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,300
Prepare a written discussion. (Ayumu) Yes.

125
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,300
Liquid retention is observed in the chest. I'll put the drain in and go for the CT.

126
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,300
(Bonten) I'm Brahma.

127
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:26,300
This is Mr. Anno, who will be in charge of the same.

128
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,300
Asuka!

129
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,300
(Thua) Teacher: Is your daughter okay?

130
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:41,300
(Bonten) He will need to be hospitalized for a while, but there are no life-threatening conditions.

131
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,300
good… . ➡

132
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,300
thank you .

133
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,300
Understood.

134
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,300
Sorry. I'm going home today.

135
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,300

137
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,300
Thank you for the washing dishes. (Bonten) You're welcome.

138
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,300
(Misuzu) Ah, that's right.

139
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,300
I had this taken during my checkup today.

140
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,300
Ah, ah...

141
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,300
(Misuzu) Thank you.

142
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:10,300
You can see her face better than before. (Misuzu) Yes, the process is going well.

143
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:15,300
I'll be able to meet this girl soon. (Misuzu) Yes.

144
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,300
(Misuzu) Taro-san. (Bonten) Hmm?

145
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,300
(Misuzu) I've never been able to get pregnant ➡

146
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:29,300
I thought she was someone who shouldn't be a mother.

147
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:36,300
But this kid came to us.

148
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,300
It was really good that I didn't give up.

149
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,300
Yes, that's right.

150
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:47,300
But I'm still worried now. ➡

151
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,300
Whether this child will be born safely?

152
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:58,300
Today's thing, and about giving birth at an elderly person➡

153
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,300
There were only a few risks flickering.

154
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,300
Sorry, you said something strange. (Bonten) No.

155
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,300
(Misuzu) I hope you're born healthy.

156
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,300
(Bonten) Yes.

157
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,300
Ah, a bit of a photo... No, let's take a photo.

158

I'm sure your wife is already dead, right?

That's what it looks like.

172

Hey, what do you think Yui? ➡

180
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,300
It means cherishing connections with others.

181
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,300
Are you okay? Something happened?

182
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:17,300
Ah, no, nothing.

183
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:22,300
Ah, Yui. Yes, that's a good name.

184
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,966
Right?

185
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:27,300
The name is something that this child will carry on for the rest of his life.

186
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,300
(Bonten) Yes. (Misuzu) So ➡

187
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,300
I feel a sense of what kind of life I want to live.

188
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,300
When I think about it that way, I can't narrow it down even more.

189
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,300
Ah, it moved. (Bonten) What?

190
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,300
See you're full of energy.

191
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,300
Ah, it's true.

192
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:50,300

200
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:34,300
Even though he's a father, he ends up shying up seeing his daughter.

201
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,300
It's embarrassing.

202
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,300
Is Asuka okay?

203
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:50,300
it's okay . Don't worry.

204
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,300
That's good.

205
00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:01,300
Um... it may not be something I'm hearing about...

206
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:06,300
What were you talking about with your daughter yesterday?

207
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,300
《Don't say that! 》

208
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,300
My wife died of giving birth...

209
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:38,300
I've told her many times that it wasn't Asuka's fault.

210
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:42,300
but… .

211
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:49,300
Somewhere in my heart I'm dragging my wife over me ➡

212
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:54,300
Maybe that girl was feeling it.

213
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:59,300
(Facial filial piety) Even if you are deaf or have no mother ➡

214
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,300
To make that child live a positive life ➡

215
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:08,300
I think I've tried my best in my own way.

216
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,300
(Facial filial piety) It made me think of something like that. ➡

217
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,300
I don't have a face to match my wife.

219
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,300
Haa...

220
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,300
(Ayumi) Thank you for your hard work. Thank you for your hard work.

221
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:44,300
Oh, studying obstetrics? That's great. I thought I had to study.

222
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,300
But honestly, I don't know anything about pregnant women at all.

223
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,300
Birth is not a specialist for life-saving doctors.

224
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,300
I'm also refreshing.

225
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,300
The head teacher is qualified as a midwife.

226
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,300
(Kayoko) Yes, well, just in case.

227
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,300
But I've been to save my life forever, so I'm not at all.

228
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,300
Midwives also take up red chicks, right?

229
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,300
Yes, normal childbirth.

230
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,300
But if your mother or baby needs medical treatment ➡

231
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,300
Obstetrician and pediatric doctors will also be coming.

232
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:17,300
Ah... It's an unknown world for me.

233
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,300
It's hard to create a new life.

234
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:46,300
That girl is waiting.

What are those two talking about?

251
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,300
I didn't know but ➡

252
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,300
I don't think you need to worry anymore.

Bring me now.

270
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,300
It could be an emergency operation. Contact the Obstetrics and Pediatrics Operations Office.

271
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,300
(Kayoko) I understand.

272
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,300

I'll touch your stomach.

277
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:49,300
It's hard. Plate-like hard.

278
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:58,300
The fetal heartbeat is slowing down. The baby has not received oxygen.

279
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,966
What is the mother's vital?

280
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:04,300
(Kayoko) Blood pressure is 80, with a 52 pulse rate of 120. It's a shock vital.

281
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:09,300
Bleeding, fetal heartbeat abnormality, and sudden abdominal pain...

282
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,300
Placental dissection.

283
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,300

(Electrocardiograph warning sound) (Bonten) Misuzu!

289
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,300
The peeled placenta will not return to its original state.

290
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,300
The baby is already in danger due to lack of oxygen.

291
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,300
If things continue like this, they will die in their womb.

292
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,966
That's...

293
00:31:02,966 --> 00:31:07,300
The only way to help is to have a Caesarean section right now.

294
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,300
(Kayoko) Teacher! Sensei Sensei ➡

295
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,300
I couldn't come right away due to another pregnant woman's emergency response.

296
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:20,300
(Naomi) It's a vital that could have stopped cardiac arrest at any time. ➡

297
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,300
You should find a hospital that will respond immediately and forward it.

298
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,300
That won't make it in time. (Naomi) So what are you going to do? ➡

299
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,300
It's a different translation from a normal Caesarean section. ➡

300
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:33,300
You may experience heavy bleeding the moment it opens. ➡

301
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,300
We can't handle it.

310
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,300
There is no forwarding.

311
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,300
I'll have a Caesarean section now.

312
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,300

337
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,300
Compression and stop bleeding. Additional blood transfusions were given oxytocin.
