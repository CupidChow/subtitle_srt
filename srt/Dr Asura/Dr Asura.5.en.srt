1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,000
(Okoku) After Fink's operation, the director will be arrested. ➡

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Our hospital has also become famous.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's no wonder that such things become famous.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Even so, it's quiet without Ashura. ➡

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Was it a conference? (Daikoku) Apparently so.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Is it okay to be alone, Daikoku-sensei?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's okay. From today, there will also be Professor Bonten. ➡

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Ah! Ah, ah... (Kayoko) It doesn't seem like it's okay.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
yes . ⚟It hurts!

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It hurts It hurts! It hurts! It hurts, it hurts...

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
ear! ear! (Daikoku) What's wrong?

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
(Bonten) It appears he fell on his bicycle and injured his ear.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
(Daikoku) Ears? (Bonten) Completely ➡

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's been removed. This is it...

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
(Daikoku) It's my ears...

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
(Patient) Ears! ear! (Daikoku) This is no good! ➡

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Store at room temperature and the tissue will become unusable!

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
(Bonten) What! ? (Daikoku) Let it cool right away!

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
(Sanae) Yes. (Daikoku) Either way, it's lifesaving ➡

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I can't handle it. Call a plastic surgery surgeon.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
(Bonten) It seems that it will take until the night while operating.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
(Daikoku) What! ? (Bonten) of the cut tissue.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Apparently, the prime time is about 8 hours.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I have to resume blood flow by then ➡

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It seems that it will no longer be able to reattach.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
(Daikoku) It won't be in time! (Bonten) He will accept it ➡

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I couldn't find any other hospitals either... (Patient) Quickly my ears!

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
(Kayoko) If things continue like this, that patient➡

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You will lose your ears. (Daikoku) At times like this ➡

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If Anno were there...

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
(Naomi) Looks like you're in trouble.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The patient's ears will be connected.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
(Ago) Dr. Tamon I want to leave the director to you. ➡

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The current situation is not surprising when Taishaku collapses at any time.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You are the only one who can be left to you.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
please .

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I've got it . (Among) Thank you. ➡

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm grateful for taking it on.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
By the way, the chairman.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What are you planning to do with the emergency department in this situation?

41
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:14,000
Fink's donation has been withdrawn ➡

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Now that funds for establishing a new hospital have not been provided anymore ➡

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I can't save a life.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
(Tamon) "Let's change the life-saving of Japan together"

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The emergency department will be closed.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
There's no objection, right?

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
(Shura) "Abandoning the life in front of you for your own purposes"

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
"You're not the same either."

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
yes .

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Oh, and one more thing. ➡

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
He decided to put Naomi in his lifesaving.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
(Bonten) Sutures that are uniformly spaced and unevenly distorted, just like measured with a ruler... ➡

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
This is the first time I've seen something like this. (Daikoku) It might be better than Anno.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
(Naomi) Yes. Now it's fine. ➡

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Protect it with gauze. (Ayumu) ​​Yes.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
(Daikoku) Thank you so much.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm glad that it was helpful.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
(Daikoku) By the way, which one would you like?

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Starting today, I'm a plastic surgeon who works here.

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
(Tamon) Why save your life? (Ago) Before the emergency department is gone ➡

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I also thought it would be interesting to have him work with Ashura.

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
(Daikoku) Even so, it seems like two doctors suddenly increase ➡

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
This will make it look like the emergency department will be working well.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What's wrong? (Bonten) Naomi Sensei is ready to use, but ➡

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Besides the fact that I didn't cool my ears down ➡

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm just keeping everyone's legs...

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The doctor has just come to the emergency department, so there's no need to rush.

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Haa...

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
(Automatic door opening sound) (Okoku) Ah, good morning.

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
good morning . (Harve) Who?

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
A plastic surgeon who has come to the emergency department since yesterday.

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
(Daikoku) Professor Naomi is an American ➡

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I worked at Crestwood Memorial Hospital.

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's the nation's top plastic surgery hospital! ?

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Why the Taisha? Introducing Yuri.

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Chairman. He's my aunt. Aunt! ?

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Were you a relative of the chairman? (Naomi) Yes.

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Also, I wanted to work with Professor Ashura.

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Huh? Do you two know each other?

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Well, that's right. ➡

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yuri said this a lot. ➡

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
If you're going to save your life, don't do anything.

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Even someone like Asura.

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But I'll do it my way.

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
If you like.

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:31,000
♬～

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
♬～

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
(Patient) My teeth have been hurting since this morning. (Bonten) Is it a tooth? ➡

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Isn't it cavities? (Patient) That may be true.

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
(Bonten) It might be better to visit the clinic once.

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Normally, do you come to the hospital just because your teeth hurt?

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
(Bonten) What's wrong? ➡

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'll prescribe painkillers so please go to a dentist soon.

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
(Patient) Yes, I understand. thank you .

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
(Bonten) Take good care of me. hang on .

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Immediately do an electrocardiogram and echocardiography. Blood collection is also available.

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Have a troponin test.

98
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
(Bonten) Myocardial infarction! ?

99
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Patients with myocardial infarction may experience pain in the teeth rather than in the chest.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
(Bonten) However, the pain of myocardial infarction is

101
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's so intense that I can't stand it. ➡

102
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I can't imagine that I could come to the doctor normally.

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
His medical record has a history of visiting diabetes.

104
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
(Bonten) Diabetes... What does that have to do with it?

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
A neuropathy caused by diabetes causes pain so much that it would not be possible to move.

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It was being held back. If things continue like this, cardiac arrest will occur.

107
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Teacher, please help! Get your PCI ready now.

108
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Contact the catering room. yes!

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
⚟ (Kongou) Oh!

110
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
God Hand. (Bonten) Thank you for your hard work.

111
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
(Kongou) Thank you for your hard work.

112
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
No, I can't believe Dr. Bonten went to the emergency department.

113
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
(Bonten) We apologize for the inconvenience caused by this sudden transfer.

114
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm incredibly grateful.

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Thanks to rumors that there is a god hand in Taishaku ➡

116
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
VIP patients are rushing into the surgery.

117
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Wow! Hehehe....

118
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
♬ "An excellent Bonten Sensei."

119
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
♬ "I guess the success rate for emergency departments is 99%."

120
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Come to think of it, Fink was discharged from the hospital this morning.

121
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What?

122
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I believed you to be a lifesaver until the end. ➡

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Well, isn't it? Within him ➡

124
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You'll be a god hand forever. No, not!

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
♬ "Even though it's a normal hand."

126
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Frog Heh heh.

127
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
(Kayoko) The PCI worked well. It's safe now.

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
(Patient) Thank you very much.

129
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
(Kayoko) Teacher?

130
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
come .

131
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
(Everyone) 123. Started with 4 liters of oxygen.

132
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Echoes and X-rays. I'll call you an X-ray technician!

133
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
(Naomi) Why haven't you secured the line in the ambulance? ➡

134
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What were you doing in the car? (Kichijoji) Emergency medical personnel are

135
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
In principle, only patients with cardiac arrest are allowed to secure a line.

136
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
(Naomi) That's right. It's different from America.

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
(Bonten) Ah! Mitral valve regurgitation disorder?

138
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
(Bonten) He is suffering from heart failure and suffering from pulmonary congestion. ➡

139
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Surgery is necessary as soon as possible. For now, improve pulmonary congestion.

140
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I administer diuretics and vasodilators. (Bonten) Yes. ➡

141
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Satake-san will be giving me an IV drip.

142
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
(Riho) Stop it!

143
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
(Bonten) It's fine. It'll be over soon.

144
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You're saying you don't need that. ➡

145
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Haa... I'm going home.

146
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
(Bonten) What... Ah, wait. ➡

147
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Ah... (Riho) Haa... haa... ➡

148
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I was just resting on the bench for a while ➡

149
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's annoying to be called by an ambulance without my permission.

150
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Haa... Haa... Haa....

151
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
What are you doing? Let go.

152
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The cooling sensation in my hands and the cyanosis of my fingertips.

153
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It puts a lot of strain on the heart.

154
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's not surprising that they suddenly change and die at any time.

155
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You said you wouldn't treat it.

156
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Satake-san?

157
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
(Naomi) There's no need to chase after him. ➡

158
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
He left despite explaining the medical situation. ➡

159
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
This is something she decided of her own volition.

160
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
If I don't treat it like this, I'll die?

161
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
(Naomi) Do doctors have no right to force patients to treat them?

162
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
right? (Naomi) It was against the patient's wishes➡

163
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
If you treat it, you could be sued. ➡

164
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
If the hospital is sued, it's the doctor's fault ➡

165
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's causing us trouble too.

166
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
That girl is in a hellish situation right now.

167
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I can't abandon the life in front of me!

168
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Professor Anno! (Naomi) Stop it. ➡

169
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Her method is wrong. ➡

170
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You don't need to get caught up in you.

171
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
(Bonten) I'll see what happens.

172
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Haa haa haa...

173
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That's why I said that. You need treatment...

174
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
(Riho) Stop it!

175
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Is there any reason why you don't want to get treatment?

176
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Haa haa haa...

177
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Is there something?

178
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
There will be a violin competition in 10 days.

179
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Satake will need to be hospitalized for at least two weeks.

180
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
If it's a competition, I'll get better and get on the next opportunity...

181
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
There's no next time! ➡

182
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
If I don't win this competition, I'll no longer be a scholarship student. ➡

183
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I can't continue college! ➡

184
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Even if you die, you have no choice but to leave!

185
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I understand the argument.

186
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'll fix it in a week. Huh?

187
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
The suffering will never go away without treatment.

188
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Can you demonstrate your ability in that situation?

189
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I will definitely make you into the competition.

190
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
(Ago) It's amazing Dr. Ashura, who brings back a patient who escaped.

191
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I hope you don't imitate something like adding unnecessary work.

192
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I guess it's Ashura-sensei's self-satisfaction ➡

193
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The patients are also a good nuisance. ➡

194
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm going to go to the surgery after all. ➡

195
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I can't find any more meaning to be alive.

196
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
wait a minute .

197
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Maybe I should just take a little more check on it, right?

198
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
(Bonten) Is it really okay for Anno-sensei?

199
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
After all, it's impossible to compete... I'll definitely make it in time.

200
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But how...? I'll read this by tomorrow.

201
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
(Brahma) MICS! ?

202
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Are you planning to do this surgery?

203
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
A normal midsternal incision causes a large wound and the hospitalization will also be extended.

204
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
With MICS, the wounds will be smaller, so the discharge will be faster.

205
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
However, MICS is done by inserting the instrument from the small incision ➡

206
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The field of vision is narrower than in normal operation and the difficulty is much different.

207
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Even Professor Anno can't do it!

208
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,000
There is no other way to fulfill her wishes.

209
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
(Tamon) What kind of purpose is this?

210
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's not a big deal though...

211
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Don't you care to help Ashura and Naomi do well?

212
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
(Tamon) With Anno? Has something happened?

213
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
There are times when excellent doctors can clash with each other.

214
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Understood .

215
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
From this, mitral valve plasification using MICS is performed.

216
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
(Bonten) Teacher: I don't think we can do MICS after all. ➡

217
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Switch to a midline incision. The person himself too ➡

218
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I think you'll understand. I made an appointment with this child.

219
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Let's start female. (Ayumu) ​​Yes.

220
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Electric female. (Ayumu) ​​Yes.

221
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Ah, Director! What happened?

222
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
(Tamon) Well, I happened to pass by nearby.

223
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
(Tamon) It's rare that Anno is not there.

224
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Ah, Professor Anno is currently operating.

225
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I've never heard of a life doctor about MICS.

226
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
MICS? Is Anno? (Daikoku) Yes. Inevitably ➡

227
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
There are patients who have to be discharged from the hospital early.

228
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Professor Anno is wrong. ➡

229
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
No matter how much the patient wishes, they will take extra risks.

230
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
There's no need to do any difficult operations.

231
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's also the doctor's job to calmly make those decisions.

232
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
In fact, my son was saved by Anno last month.

233
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
(Daikoku) At that time, Anno was also in the interest of his son's future ➡

234
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
He chose the difficult method.

235
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
That's the kind of doctor he is.

236
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Expose your left atrium so spread it out more.

237
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
(Bonten) Yes.

238
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I can't see. Give me more!

239
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
(Bonten) With this narrowness, I can't show my vision. ➡

240
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
If you force it to go and accidentally damage your blood vessels ➡

241
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It causes major bleeding! ➡

242
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Doctor: As expected, I turned back and made a midline incision...

243
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Switch to transatrial septomy.

244
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Long Metzen. (Ayumu) ​​Yes.

245
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Are you okay .

246
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Definitely make it a success.

247
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Grasp forceps. (Ayumu) ​​Yes.

248
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Needle holder. (Ayumu) ​​Yes.

249
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
(Ayumu) ​​Please.

250
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:23,000
♬～

251
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
(The sound of the equipment passing through)

252
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
(Bonten) passed. I passed!

253
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Reaching the mitral valve. Needle holder. (Ayumu) ​​Yes.

254
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Excessive leaflets are removed and looped techniques are used.

255
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Mitral valve plasia is performed. (Bonten) Yes!

256
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
(Naomi) She has good skills though ➡

257
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I don't think I'll be able to get along with them after all.

258
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
(The sound of the door closing)

259
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
The surgery was successful. I think I'll be discharged in just a week.

260
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
(Riho's mother) Thank you!

261
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Um... maybe Bonten-sensei ➡

262
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Is that teacher famous for his God Hand?

263
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Ha... Yes.

264
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
(Riho's mother) As expected! No, I can't believe it to that Bonten Sensei ➡

265
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
My daughter was really lucky to have surgery!

266
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
(Bonten) Why did the teacher choose the MICS technique?

267
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
If you fail, you will not only lose the trust of the patient➡

268
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
There was a possibility that he would be sued.

269
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Are you not afraid of failing?

270
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's definitely scary.

271
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
So why...?

272
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Life isn't the only thing I want to help.

273
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Because it's everything about that patient.

274
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
teacher! (Kayoko) Ah, Satake-san. ➡

275
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Did you come? (Riho) Before leaving the hospital ➡

276
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I want to thank the teachers.

277
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Professor Anno.

278
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Thank you so much for letting me go out of the hospital in just a week.

279
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I just did my job.

280
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
But I'm really grateful. ➡

281
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'd like to stop playing the violin.

282
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I thought it wasn't worth living. ➡

283
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
If they don't make it to the competition, there's no point in treating them. ➡

284
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,000
But the doctor had a difficult surgery for me. ➡

285
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Thanks to my teacher, I felt like I should live again.

286
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
He chased after me then ➡

287
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
He had the surgery ➡

288
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Thank you so much.

289
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:51,000
♬～

290
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Competition... Good luck.

291
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yeah . I'll definitely win.

292
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
(Riho's mother) So it's about time. (Riho) Thank you very much.

293
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
(Riho's mother) Thank you very much.

294
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
(Kayoko) Good luck. (Riho) Thank you.

295
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
(Daikoku) Ah, I'm tired.

296
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Ah! Ah...

297
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Hmm?

298
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:56,000
♬～

299
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Wow!

300
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
What are you doing, clean up now!

301
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
(Ago) Loans are strict everywhere.

302
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Other than closing the emergency department ➡

303
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
There is no way to make a new hospital come true.

304
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Even if the emergency department is gone from Taishaku ➡

305
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
There are also other hospitals in the area to help save lives.

306
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
There should be little impact on patients.

307
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Haa, it's morning! (Sanae) Professor Anno Come to think of it ➡

308
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It's finally today. What's the story?

309
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
(Sanae) It's Satake's competition day.

310
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
yes .

311
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Ah, it's noon!

312
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
(Naomi) Are you still there? Go home early, it's time for the watch.

313
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Japanese doctors continue to work even after they are on duty.

314
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Is there no working hours regulation like in the US?

315
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Apparently, doctors have also begun work style reforms since last year. ➡

316
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Even if the labor hours are reduced by working hours even though the number of staff does not increase ➡

317
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Well, I can't set up a shift so it's impossible.

318
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Is Anno-sensei not back yet?

319
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Go to the ICU. Starting now! ?

320
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
The patient's inflammation does not go down and the CV will be replaced.

321
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Then I'll help too. Dr. Yakushiji should go home.

322
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Heh? (Naomi) You, your boss, are you?➡

323
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I can't take a break from the intern because I work forever.

324
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Otherwise, patients' treatment will continue to slow down.

325
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Even life that is saved will no longer be saved. It's not our fault.

326
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It's the responsibility of the management team not to have a fair number of staff.

327
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Such an excuse cannot be applied in front of the patient's life.

328
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
So you're going to continue sacrifice in this way?

329
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Does Yakushiji think Anno is right?

330
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Heh?

331
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Bowes Go home today.

332
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
But the work is... I'll do the rest.

333
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
So I'm going back to work too.

334
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
This person is getting acidosis.

335
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Added Mayron. Understood .

336
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Dr. Ashura, are you still working?

337
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
(Ayumi) Because the teacher always does that.

338
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
come . (Intercom)

339
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
yes . (Intercom) (Kichijoji) From Chuo Memorial Hospital ➡

340
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It's a forwarding request. Woman with right arm amputation in a traffic accident. ➡

341
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
It is said that it is in a state that it is out of control, so we ask for acceptance.

342
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
accept . Bring it straight away.

343
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Preparation for the operation. Understood .

344
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
(Kongou) Let's quickly crush the emergency department and make it happen as quickly as possible. ➡

345
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Director Tamon is... Different Director Tamon is different ➡

346
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
After becoming the director of International Teishaku Hospital,

347
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
This hospital is Kongo Matayoshi... (mobile phone)

348
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Phone: Are you okay? (Kongou) Phone? Ah, the phone...

349
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Excuse me. yes .

350
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
a? Plastic surgery? Yes, yes.

351
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Leave it to this Kongo Matayoshi. I'm ready to go...

352
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Cutting? There's no way it's free. We'll be operating until night again today.

353
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Please contact me anytime that doesn't matter to me!

354
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
(Cancel sound)

355
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
It's also an emergency department. Apparently there is a patient with amputation of his right arm.

356
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Is it cutting? ( Kongo) Yes, that's the same thing.

357
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
It appears that the plastic surgeon who has returned from the United States has returned home on time.

358
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
But without a plastic surgeon, wouldn't it be difficult to reattach?

359
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I agree . That Ashura thing again anyway➡

360
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
He must have forced himself to accept it. Poor patient who loses his arm.

361
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Huh?

362
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Naomi-sensei, what's wrong?

363
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
What's up with you is sure to go home?

364
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
A patient with amputation of the right arm comes from another hospital ➡

365
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
They were brought to you because you couldn't handle it, right?

366
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It's going to be an emergency operation so come right away.

367
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Because my working hours are over.

368
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
To save lives, only the doctors can do reattaching operations, right?

369
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It's not my fault that there is no doctor.

370
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Professor Ashura is here too, so his life will be saved.

371
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Well then.

372
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
It was Satake who was brought!

373
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Still, do you think it's fine to save your life?

374
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
It doesn't matter who the patient is.

375
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Doctors should be equal to any patient.

376
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Certainly... that might be true.

377
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
But I don't want Satake to lose his arm.

378
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I would like to continue playing the violin.

379
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Even without Naomi Sensei ➡

380
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I'll do something with Mr. Anno and I!

381
00:27:58,616 --> 00:28:00,616
(Naomi) "There's no need to chase after you."

382
00:28:00,616 --> 00:28:04,616
"There's no need to take extra risks and do difficult operations."

383
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:07,616
(Riho) "He chased after me then ➡

384
00:28:07,616 --> 00:28:09,616
He had the surgery ➡

385
00:28:09,616 --> 00:28:12,616
Thank you so much

386
00:28:26,616 --> 00:28:29,616
Formation of stumps. Bouz helps.

387
00:28:29,616 --> 00:28:35,616
Establishing a stump means blocking the wound, right?

388
00:28:35,616 --> 00:28:37,616
Why?

389
00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:39,616
With Anno-sensei, you can even connect your arms, right?

390
00:28:39,616 --> 00:28:43,616
(Ayumu) ​​My arm hasn't arrived yet.

391
00:28:43,616 --> 00:28:45,616
Huh? (Ayumu) ​​He was blown away by the shock of an accident ➡

392
00:28:45,616 --> 00:28:48,616
Apparently it took a while to search. ➡

393
00:28:48,616 --> 00:28:51,616
I'm heading by ambulance right now...

394
00:28:51,616 --> 00:28:54,616
I don't have time. I give up on my arm.

395
00:28:54,616 --> 00:29:09,616
♬～

396
00:29:09,616 --> 00:29:11,616
⚟ (Naomi) Wait.

397
00:29:13,616 --> 00:29:17,616
I'll do my reattaching once my arm is received.

398
00:29:19,616 --> 00:29:23,616
I won't allow you to lose your arms.

399
00:29:23,616 --> 00:29:27,616
Life is more than arms.

400
00:29:27,616 --> 00:29:29,616
She's a violinist.

401
00:29:29,616 --> 00:29:33,616
So the doctor also had MICS surgery on this child.

402
00:29:33,616 --> 00:29:36,616
I said that, I can't wait any longer. You can wait. ➡

403
00:29:36,616 --> 00:29:39,616
He can control both the bleeding and vitals.

404
00:29:39,616 --> 00:29:43,616
This instant judgment will change the child's life dramatically.

405
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:49,616
So that's what I decided! If you choose your arm, she won't be able to save you.

406
00:29:49,616 --> 00:29:52,616
Huh? I can't believe it...

407
00:29:54,616 --> 00:29:57,616
Naomi-sensei! Please take a look.

408
00:29:59,616 --> 00:30:03,616
(Naomi) Pseudoaneurysm...it's traumatic.

409
00:30:03,616 --> 00:30:06,616
This could burst at any time.

410
00:30:06,616 --> 00:30:09,616
⚟ (Automatic door opening sound) ⚟ (Kichijoji) Right arm has arrived!

411
00:30:09,616 --> 00:30:12,616
(Kichijoji) Please. (Ayumu) ​​Yes.

412
00:30:12,616 --> 00:30:15,282
If you run right now, you can tie your arms together...

413
00:30:15,282 --> 00:30:17,282
(Riho's mother) Teacher! (Kayoko) Mom! ➡

414
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:19,616
Please wait outside! (Riho's mother) Please, sensei?

415
00:30:19,616 --> 00:30:24,616
please . Please tie your arms together for your daughter.

416
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:26,616
For my daughter, the violin is

417
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:30,616
It's just as important as life!

418
00:30:32,616 --> 00:30:35,616
My arms can't be connected.

419
00:30:38,616 --> 00:30:41,616
If the aneurysm ruptures while you are holding your arms together➡

420
00:30:41,616 --> 00:30:44,616
Hemorrhagic shock leads to death.

421
00:30:44,616 --> 00:30:47,616
So, you should just do some aneurysm operation first...

422
00:30:47,616 --> 00:30:49,616
This child's aneurysm is already quite large.

423
00:30:49,616 --> 00:30:51,616
No matter how hurry it is, it will take seven hours.

424
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:55,616
It's been four hours since my arm was amputated.

425
00:30:55,616 --> 00:31:00,616
After an aneurysm operation, the eight hours of prime time will not be in time.

426
00:31:00,616 --> 00:31:04,616
That's... For life ➡

427
00:31:04,616 --> 00:31:07,616
I have no choice but to give up on my arm.

428
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:11,616
Teacher... Can't you do anything?

429
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:14,616
please . please!

430
00:31:14,616 --> 00:31:18,616
While I'm doing this now, my aneurysm might rupture!

431
00:31:22,616 --> 00:31:25,616
Save your life is the most important thing.

432
00:31:29,616 --> 00:31:31,616
Go out.

433
00:31:31,616 --> 00:31:33,616
Ugh....

434
00:31:33,616 --> 00:31:38,616
(Riho's mother's cry) (Kayoko) Mother.

435
00:31:38,616 --> 00:31:58,616
(Riho's mother's cry)

436
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:02,616
(Riho's mother's cry)

437
00:32:02,616 --> 00:32:04,616
⚟ (Tamon) Is that really okay?

438
00:32:16,616 --> 00:32:22,616
Anno: There's no other life-emergist with the skill of you.

439
00:32:24,616 --> 00:32:27,616
And Rokudo Sensei ➡

440
00:32:27,616 --> 00:32:32,616
There is no other plastic surgeon with the arms that are as good as you.

441
00:32:34,616 --> 00:32:40,616
I can't believe that these two have the same choice as you can make ➡

442
00:32:40,616 --> 00:32:43,616
It's very unfortunate.

443
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,616
Haa...

444
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:15,616
Prepare in 3 minutes.

445
00:33:15,616 --> 00:33:19,616
It's enough in 2 minutes.

446
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,616
I'm going to the operation room. yes!

447
00:33:23,616 --> 00:33:26,616
A test thoracic open surgery is performed for thoracic pseudoaortic aneurysms.

448
00:33:26,616 --> 00:33:30,616
(Naomi) Reattachment is performed on the right forearm amputation.

449

teacher! It's bigger than when I saw it on CT.

460
00:34:26,616 --> 00:34:29,616
It's not surprising that it bursts at any time. I have to do something soon...

461
00:34:29,616 --> 00:34:31,616
Clamp the root of the aneurysm to stop the rupture.

462
00:34:31,616 --> 00:34:33,282
yes! Satin skiing.

463
00:34:33,282 --> 00:34:34,949

466
00:34:57,616 --> 00:35:03,616
Okay, I managed to cut it off. This will make the bleeding okay.

It's not finished yet.

468
00:35:05,616 --> 00:35:07,616
The aneurysm has spread to the abdomen. Huh?

469
00:35:07,616 --> 00:35:10,616

Sorry! what?

495
00:38:54,616 --> 00:39:00,616
I was saying something cheeky to the teacher.

496
00:39:00,616 --> 00:39:06,616
(Naomi) Please give up now. I came home yesterday but ➡

497

That won't happen from now on.

But that's why Professor Ashura did it ➡

502
00:39:37,616 --> 00:39:39,616
I didn't admit it.

503

Hehe. Well then.

(Ago) I can't believe Ashura and Naomi are double-operated.

506
00:40:03,616 --> 00:40:06,616
I was transferred to another hospital without any control.

507
00:40:06,616 --> 00:40:09,616
Apparently he was a patient. (Amuro) That's right.

508
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:12,616
Patients that other hospitals were unable to handle

509
00:40:12,616 --> 00:40:15,616
He was able to save the game with Taishaku's lifesaving.

510
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:21,616
The chairman has gathered excellent doctors up until now.

511
00:40:21,616 --> 00:40:25,616
This is the result of wanting to save as many lives as possible.

512
00:40:25,616 --> 00:40:28,616
(Ago) Thanks to the efforts of the field.

513
00:40:32,616 --> 00:40:35,616
Chairman.

514
00:40:35,616 --> 00:40:39,616
You really wanted to save a life?

515
00:40:41,616 --> 00:40:46,616
(Tamon) I wonder if Dr. Rokudo joined the emergency department for that reason?

516
00:40:46,616 --> 00:40:49,616
I wonder what it is.

517
00:40:49,616 --> 00:40:51,616
Chairman.

518
00:40:53,616 --> 00:40:57,616
(Tamon) Could you please withdraw the closure of the emergency department?

519
00:40:59,616 --> 00:41:02,616
I thought my thoughts were wrong ➡

520
00:41:02,616 --> 00:41:08,616
I was reminded of it when I saw Anno and the other doctors.

521
00:41:08,616 --> 00:41:13,616
Taishaku requires an emergency department.

522
00:41:13,616 --> 00:41:17,616
Let me think of ways to save lives.

523
00:41:17,616 --> 00:41:30,616
♬～

524
00:41:30,616 --> 00:41:32,616
I understand.

525
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:38,616
Let's somehow find a way to leave the emergency department behind.

526
00:41:38,616 --> 00:41:40,616
thank you . (Among) However ➡

527
00:41:40,616 --> 00:41:43,616
It's not that easy.

528
00:41:45,616 --> 00:41:48,616
It looks like it's going to be a tough road.

529
00:41:50,616 --> 00:41:55,616
☎

530
00:42:10,616 --> 00:42:12,616
What's it for this time?

531
00:42:12,616 --> 00:42:16,616
I haven't yet allowed the emergency department to close.

532
00:42:16,616 --> 00:42:20,616
There are things I need to tell you about.

533
00:42:22,616 --> 00:42:25,616
I got a call from Fink earlier.

534
00:42:25,616 --> 00:42:30,616
He was able to receive donations on the condition that he would leave the emergency department behind.

535
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:34,616
What does that mean?

536
00:42:34,616 --> 00:42:37,616
(Tamon) Bonten did Fink's operation ➡

537
00:42:37,616 --> 00:42:40,616
Apparently he went to tell him it was Anno.

538
00:42:40,616 --> 00:42:44,616
Fink wanted to leave behind the emergency department that saved her life.

539
00:42:47,616 --> 00:42:49,616
yes .

540
00:42:53,616 --> 00:42:59,616
(Tamon) Thanks to Anno, he was able to stop the lifesavings.

541
00:42:59,616 --> 00:43:03,616
I just wanted to save the life in front of me.

542
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:07,616
And...

543
00:43:10,616 --> 00:43:13,616
I just wanted to keep my promise.

544

545
00:43:25,616 --> 00:43:28,616
(Tamon) I was wrong.

546
00:43:30,616 --> 00:43:36,616
I am planning to rebuild my life as the director. ➡

547
00:43:36,616 --> 00:43:42,616
They connect the lives they saved and work together to save patients.

548
00:43:46,616 --> 00:43:52,616
Anno Please lend me your help.

549
00:43:59,616 --> 00:44:01,616
yes .
