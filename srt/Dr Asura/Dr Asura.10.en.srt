1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:16,000
(Players' chants)

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes, Professor Ashura.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Oh, the usual ice cream. Thank you.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But my stomach hurts a little since last night.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Ah, it hurts, it hurts. Did you eat something strange?

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Probably bread. It was a bit moldy though.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Open your mouth. Huh?

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
ah .

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It hurts! What are you doing? The Tsurugour is out.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What crane? Even if you pinch your skin it won't come back straight away.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
My mouth is also dry and I'm dehydrated.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,666
I'll go to the hospital soon. No, that's such a big deal.

13
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,000
It's fine, I'll go. Just give me some medicine ➡

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Isn't it okay? Hey, what?

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Teacher... you're exaggerating, really, always.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I brought the patient.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Tatsu-san. (Konishi) Oh.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Everyone looks fine. (Daikoku) Tatsu-san It's been a while.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Has Daikoku-sensei overcome the crisis of divorce?

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Ah... well, somehow.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
(Konishi) Ah, that's right. Hahaha.... (Ayumu) What happened today?

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Today... it's about food.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'll take my vitals for now. (Sanae) Tatsu-san, please come here.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Vital?

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
(Ayumi) Please sit down. (Konishi) Are you going to sit?

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
(Hand) I'll get some clothes. (Konishi) Oh.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Take care of it.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
(Sanae) Dr. Anno's blood pressure of 98, 60 pulse rate in the 80 range➡

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Saturation is fine. Vitals are calm ➡

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Wash it for now. Then add fluid refill.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
(Sanae) I understand. (Ayumu) Then Tatsu-san ➡

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Let's go to the shower. (Konishi) What a bath?

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
(Ayumu) Yes. (Konishi) Can you wash me?

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
(Ayumi) Wash it yourself. (Konishi) What is it?

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Konishi-san, you're so refreshing. He's a different person from before.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
If you look closely, you're handsome, right?

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
(Ayumu) Dr. Anno's blood collection results have been released.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
BUN and creatinine are rising.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Teacher, am I okay? Hospitalized and monitored.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
hospitalization ! ? Haa, are you serious...

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
This is the first time I've seen a homeless patient.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Tatsu-san, I live in a nearby park and don't come here often.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The other day, I was hospitalized with the flu in the winter.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
He's a regular at my house. He seems like a good person ➡

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
No matter how you look at it, you probably won't be able to pay the medical fees.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Well. But if treatment is needed, we can't abandon it.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Certainly you shouldn't turn down treatment because of money.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's also decided by the Medical Practitioners Act.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Ou . Professor Anno ➡

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He seemed to be good friends with Tatsu.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
come .

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
(A paramedic) Sato Kenta, 28 years old, is lying at home ➡

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
My fiance was discovered and requested emergency services.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
(Together) 1 2 3.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Sato-san, can you hear it?

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
do you understand? His level of consciousness is quite dull.

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
(Kayoko) Saturation is 93%. (Daikoku) The electrocardiogram is fine. ➡

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Other causes of loss of consciousness... is it the brain?

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
There is also the possibility of an infectious disease.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
There is yellow eye staining. jaundice?

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So is it the liver? Take your blood right now ➡

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Check liver function. (Kayoko) Yes.

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Ah... The futon is definitely the best.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
(Sanae) Please rest and get good healing.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This is always good.

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Ah, Kuyo-san, please. (Sanae) Ah, yes.

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Excuse me.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
(Okoku and the others) Yes 1 2 3.

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
(Daikoku) Sato-san. Sato Kenta. do you understand?

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
yes… . What's going on with me?

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The liver was impaired and it caused loss of consciousness.

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm currently investigating the cause, so I'll let you know if there's an outcome.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Understood .

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
thank you .

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Chihiro. Sorry for worrying.

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yes, just rest now.

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
(Daikoku) Sato Kenta, 28 years old, from Room 301.

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
He was hospitalized due to a loss of consciousness due to a decline in liver function.

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Both AST and ALT are in four digits. Ammonia is also high and it's quite severe.

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I've been recovering with liver protection drugs for now. ➡

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Be careful. Understood .

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
(Daikoku) Please. (Naomi) Yes.

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Haa...

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
⚟ (Konishi) Hey, is that okay?

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
here you are .

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's Konishi, the bed next to me.

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
This is Sato, so please.

88
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's tough to be hospitalized even when you're young.

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm really surprised. It wasn't anything until recently.

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Feel free to say anything I can.

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
No, I'm sorry. Even Konishi is currently in the hospital.

92
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
No, I'm fine so I don't have to worry about it.

93
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's probably because we became neighbors like this.

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
thank you . (Konishi) Do your best.

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Apparently, spending time with laughter will boost your immunity.

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
yes . (Konishi) Yes. What.

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
This is shochu. (Kenta) Hehe.

98
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Is that all you?

99
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
yes . It seems like the protein is not good.

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
That alone won't be enough. I haven't spoken yet.

101
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What, but what is Konishi's worth? (Konishi) Ah, it's fine, it's fine.

102
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I always eat good things.

103
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
thank you . (Konishi) Oh. Good luck.

104
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Good morning! Sorry during breakfast.

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Bouzu: He's been feeling great in the morning.

106
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Tatsu is getting better too. Well.

107
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Sato-san, what about your appetite? (Kenta) Not many...

108
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
The liver's function is degraded so there's no need to overdo it.

109
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
yes .

110
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
If you don't eat it, it won't go away. Eat this too.

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Sato-san doesn't have any yogurt either.

112
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I can't eat either way.

113
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm not good at yogurt.

114
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You too? (Kenta) What?

115
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
No, I hate this acidity too, so I can't help but feel bad.

116
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Tatsu-san, did you try to give it to me because you didn't want to eat it?

117
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Did you find out? already… .

118
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
(Kenta) I was watching that match on site.

119
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
what ! ? Is it true, you? Wow, really?

120
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
In the 9th inning, the bases loaded with two outs. The moment I hit it I got goosebumps.

121
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Of course that's true. I listened to the radio ➡

122
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I couldn't help but cry. (Kenta) I understand.

123
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Tatsu-san really loves baseball.

124
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Well, that's the only thing I can look forward to.

125
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I've always loved it. So in the future ➡

126
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
My dream is to play catch with my kids.

127
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Oh, that's fine. (Kenta) I admire it.

128
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I had no father so I never did it.

129
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I see.

130
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
To do this, I will do my best to cure the illness.

131
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
That's right. (Kenta) Yes. Ah um ➡

132
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Does Tatsu have no family?

133
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm not yes, I'm a single aristocrat.

134
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Eh, aren't you lonely? (Konishi) I feel so lonely.

135
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Freedom is the best.

136
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Tatsu-san is a nice person and looks like he's popular.

137
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What are you talking about?

138
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Hehe... what is this?

139
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
No, I imagine it having bangs...

140
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
(2 people) Hahaha... ⚟ (Chihiro) Hello.

141
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Looks like fun. (Kenta) We were talking about baseball.

142
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
(Konishi) Maybe she? (Kenta) Yes, he's engaged.

143
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Ah, that's right. I see!

144
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Then I'll have to get better sooner.

145
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
yes . (Konishi) Yes.

146
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
(Konishi) Ah, the beautiful teacher is here. ➡

147
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

148
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Sato-san, I wonder if there's a little talk?

149
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Diagnosis results: What is Sato's illness?

150
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Acute liver failure.

151
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Is it a curable disease?

152
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
The cause of this disease is often unclear.

153
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
At this stage, we plan to continue treatment with medications that protect the liver.

154
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It can be cured with medicine.

155
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
There is a possibility that it will recover.

156
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Just if the situation seems to deteriorate ➡

157
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
A liver transplant may be required.

158
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Transplant….

159
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm not going to do that now ➡

160
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Let's treat it thoroughly with medication.

161
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Even when you transplant, Sato-san doesn't have a family, right?

162
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
My parents divorced over 20 years ago.

163
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
He apparently never contacted his father.

164
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
My mother also died of illness.

165
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
He doesn't have any siblings and doesn't seem to date any relatives.

166
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So it seems impossible to transplant a living liver from a close relative.

167
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Even if the transplant is made, it will be provided by the deceased person.

168
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You'll want to have it transplanted.

169
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The other day, you had a liver transplant at a surgeon, right?

170
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Taishaku is a certified liver facility, so liver transplantation is possible.

171
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
(Kenta) I wonder if my illness is that bad...

172
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Maybe it will improve with the current treatment ➡

173
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Let's do our best.

174
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That's right...

175
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:58,000
♬～

176
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Let's go for a walk to change our mood.

177
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah . (Chihiro) Right.

178
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
(Chihiro) It's okay! ?

179
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I was able to walk normally until yesterday...

180
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Don't overdo it.

181
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'll borrow a wheelchair. Right.

182
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Wow.

183
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Ah, no, this is that...

184
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
After all, hospital food isn't enough.

185
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Cold foods put a strain on the stomach.

186
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's not good for people who have ended their food poisoning. no… .

187
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
This is proof that I'm feeling well, here's...

188
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Oh, what is it? Don't you miss it?

189
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Well, I'll be discharged from the hospital tomorrow.

190
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Hmm.

191
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Ah, so I'm in the same room as that young man ➡

192
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Maybe today is the last one.

193
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Sato-san? oh .

194
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Is that guy pretty bad?

195
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I can't tell anyone about my medical condition.

196
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Right, yes.

197
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Hey, teacher.

198
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I have a bit of a story though.

199
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm glad I was able to breathe the air outside. (Kenta) Yes.

200
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
(Doctor) Come to think of it, the emergency department is hospitalising homeless people.

201
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
(Doctor) Isn't he the person in Room 301? That's a nuisance.

202
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
(Doctor) Homeless people can't pay medical expenses and are a source of trouble.

203
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Theft or any other trouble.

204
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Tatsu-san. (Konishi) Hmm?

205
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
What's wrong? (Konishi) There's nothing.

206
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
is that so .

207
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Huh? What is it, riding in a wheelchair?

208
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Is it that bad? Is the treatment going well?

209
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I can't say anything yet...

210
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I see. Well, don't worry. ➡

211
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
If you eat well and sleep properly, you're probably sick ➡

212
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm going somewhere. (Kenta) Sorry.

213
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm a little tired so can I take a break?

214
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Right, yes. (Kenta) Chihiro Sorry.

215
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Will you close the curtains? (Chihiro) Ah, yes.

216
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You're tired, aren't you? Will you lie down? (Kenta) Yes.

217
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'll call you a nurse. (Kenta) Thank you.

218
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
(Ayumu) Sato-san had hardly ever had dinner.

219
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
(Bonten) I'm sure he was shocked to be in a wheelchair today.

220
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Acute liver failure really progresses rapidly.

221
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
This is a disease in which the liver functions suddenly loses its function. ➡

222
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
A person who was healthy up until yesterday quickly becomes seriously ill.

223
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Huh?

224
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
(Daikoku) Sato-san's rounds. It'll open.

225
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What happened? (Kenta) Ah, my wallet is gone.

226
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Huh?

227
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
What's that all of a sudden? (Kenta) Tatsu-san.

228
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You've been doing something on this side a while ago.

229
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm not doing anything. (Kenta) Is it true?

230
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
(Konishi) Hey... hey!

231
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
(Kenta) There was.

232
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Can you explain what it means?

233
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It was just a devil that was hit by it. ➡

234
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I thought it was really bad and tried to give it back later.

235
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Don't take the money! ?

236
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I guess so.

237
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Other teachers said that.

238
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Is Tatsu a homeless person?

239
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Please change the room.

240
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's impossible to be with this person.

241
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
(Ayumi) Why did Tatsu get your wallet?

242
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I'm not the type of person who does that.

243
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You didn't touch the contents of your wallet, right?

244
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
yes . In the end I didn't take anything.

245
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Does it hurt? a bit .

246
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Did you sleep at night? No, not that much...

247
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Yesterday was a bit difficult.

248
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
yes . Um...

249
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
What is Tatsu-san doing?

250
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I was discharged from the hospital just now.

251
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
is that so .

252
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:37,000
♬～

253
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Ou . ➡

254
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Ou! (Mori) That's... Who?

255
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's me, idiot. (Mori) Ah, Tatsu-san! ? ➡

256
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Have you been discharged from the hospital? (Konishi) That's right.

257
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm back alive, Idiot. (Yukiko) Haha, it looks beautiful.

258
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I didn't know who it was. (Konishi) If you rent a bath ➡

259
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
He's been swayed to his beard and has become such a good guy.

260
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
No, I'm glad that it's safe. I was worried.

261
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
( Yukiko ) Ah! I have to celebrate my discharge from the hospital.

262
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Ah, that's right. (Konishi) Oh, that's good.

263
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'll do it quickly after a long time! Hey! Yes, yes...

264
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
(Naomi) I've been treating medication up until now.

265
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
In situations where there is no chance of a proper recovery ➡

266
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Liver transplantation is also required.

267
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But I don't have a family that will give me the liver.

268
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Register with the Organ Transplant Network and wait for a chance to transplant.

269
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Huh? But during that time...

270
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
To compensate for the function of the liver ➡

271
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
This plasma exchange

272
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It is treated as continuous hemofiltration dialysis.

273
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:16,000

274
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
♬～

275
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I looked into it ➡

276
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Those waiting for a transplant from the deceased

277
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
There are about 16,000 people in the world.

278
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Can surgery be done ➡

279
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It seems there are only 600 people a year.

280
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm already...

281
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It won't help...

282
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,000
But maybe he'll be chosen. Let's believe it.

283
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
(Kenta) Damn...

284
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Ugh.... (Chihiro) Kenta? Kenta: What's wrong?

285
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Ah...! (Chihiro) Kenta, are you okay? Kenta!

286
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
(Yukiko) It's ready to eat. (Konishi) Vegetables are expensive right now.

287
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
( Yukiko ) Huh? Tatsu-san, do you like alcohol?

288
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Yeah . I've stopped drinking already. ( Yukiko ) Eh.

289
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
For the body. (Mori) At this year ➡

290
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Health is your number one priority. (Konishi) That's what it is.

291
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
So shall we stop? ⚟ (Man) Hey.

292
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
(Man) What are you doing? It looks fun.

293
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
(Men) What? It's a hot pot. I'm doing hot pot.

294
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Ah... Shall we eat a pot? (Men) Huh? Hahaha....

295
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
There's no way I'll eat it, barka!

296
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
(Man) This is something important... (Konishi) Don't touch it!

297
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Huh? (Konishi) No...

298
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Please forgive me.

299
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
(Male) Oh! (Man) Hey!

300
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
That's fine, even if I touched it...

301
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
(Konishi) Don't be fools, you guys!

302
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
(Man) Let go.

303
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
(Konishi) Gaaaa!

304
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
This damn homeless person!

305
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Ah! ! (Man) Oh?

306
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Oh, isn't he dead?

307
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Let's run away.

308
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Ah! Ta... Tatsu-san!

309
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Tatsu-san! Tatsu-san!

310
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Do it well! (Yukiko) Someone... Call someone an ambulance!

311
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
(Forest) Be sure to do it properly! (Yukiko) Please! Ah, Tatsu!

312
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
What is your blood pressure? (Kayoko) It's 83-50.

313
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
(Naomi) My gallbladder is enlarged.

314
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
(Daikoku) I'm in shock due to gallbladder bleeding.

315
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,666
An endoscope can't stop it. I'll open my laparotomy and stop the bleeding.

316
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:34,000
(Kayoko) We will contact you from the operation room. (Naomi) Yes.

317
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,000
(Siren)

318
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
(Naomi) He had so much bleeding that he couldn't see his vision. ➡

319
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
My blood pressure is also dropping. No bleeding point found.

320
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Continue sucking. (Naomi) Yes.

321
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Kelly. (Nurse) Yes.

322
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
⚟ (Automatic door opening sound) (Kayoko) Excuse me for the operation. ➡

323
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Konishi was taken to the hospital due to a head injury. ➡

324
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Professor Daikoku is taking care of it, but it is in very poor condition.

325
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
The bleeding hasn't stopped here yet. I'll continue.

327
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Haa haa haa...

328
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
(Daikoku) He was hit in the head and was taken to be cardiac arrested. ➡

329
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
There was no pupil reaction when transported ➡

330
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
CT scan showed extensive brain edema up to the brain stem. ➡

331
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,000
My heartbeat somehow resumed but I couldn't regain consciousness.

332
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000

336
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
However, liver function is quite unstable.

337
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000

This... Tatsu-san ➡

341
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
He holds it incredibly important...

342
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I feel like it would be better to give it to someone at the hospital.

343
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
(Okoku) Anno?

344
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
There is a way to help Sato-san. Huh?

345
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,000
That's Tatsu's last wish.

346
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
(Konishi) "Hey, Teacher"

347
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
{I have a bit of a story though}

348
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
《That guy next to me...》

349
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
"It's my son"

350
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
《What does that mean? 》 《I realized the moment I saw my face》

351
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,000
"No way, he's the son I abandoned 24 years ago."

352
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
"I used to be a guarantor for an acquaintance's debt" ➡

353
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
{And before I knew it, I was forced to carry the entire amount ➡

354
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Eventually, debt collectors began to come to my house.

355
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
"If things continue like this, my wife and children are in danger."

356
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
"So I left the house" ➡

357
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
"In the end, it was almost like throwing it away." ➡

358
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
{It's not acceptable to come forward now}

359
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,000
"Hey, teacher, your illness is bad, isn't it? 》

360
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
"Is there any way to do something? 》

361
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
"That child's liver is barely functional."

362
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
"If Tatsu is her father, she can donate the liver."

363
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
"I'll do anything for him."

364
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
"Please promise me instead."

365
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
"I'll definitely help him. Hey, Mr. Ashura

366
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
{I asked! 》

367
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
(Daikoku) Was Tatsu-san Sato-san the father?

368
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,000
He was trying to raise his own liver with a living liver transplant.

369
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
(Daikoku) An organ donation intention card... ➡

370
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
"Families are given priority"

371
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
There is also a copy of the family register that shows the parent-child relationship.

372
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
It's essentially necessary to have family consent.

373
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Now that Sato, his only family member, is in a coma ➡

374
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
There is a possibility that it can be transplanted.

375
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Contact your organ transplant coordinator now.

376
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
