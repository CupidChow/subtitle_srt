1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:07,000
(House) "Surgeons need to make calm decisions and promptly stop bleeding."

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
"By the way, the first time I experienced it was ➡

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Spring of my second year internship."

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
"This was later called the miracle of Taishaku..."

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That doesn't get to the main topic at all!

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
⚟ (Daikoku) Good morning. Ah, good morning.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
(Bonten) Good morning. (Daikoku) Do you study in the morning? That's great.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm going to train in surgery tomorrow➡

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Kongo-sensei had me read it and bought it.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
(Bonten) The emergency department training is over now.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
yes . (Daikoku) Oh.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
(House and Bonten) Good morning. (Okoku) Anno ➡

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,666
It's goodbye to Yakushiji. (Shura) Hmm.

14
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:45,000
He's not lonely at all.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
(Okoku) Ah, Anno, the pudding I bought at the supermarket!

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Give it back!

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
By myself...

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What is it? Huh.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What! ?

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
come .

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
(Kichijoji) Let's start at 3. (Everyone) 1 2 3!

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Where is it? ? ➡

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Who are you guys?! ?

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's a state of unrest!

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
(Daikoku) Please stay calm! This is a hospital!

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
(Oki) Don't touch it! (Sanae) I'll take an IV drip.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
(Oki) Let me go home! (Sanae's scream)

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
(The loud tree screams)

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
(Sanae) Are you okay?

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
(The loud tree scream) (Sanae's scream)

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
(Daikoku) Anno! (Sanae) Professor Anno, are you okay?

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Take a line early and administer a sedative.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The doctor, but the blood...

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,666
This person's treatment is the first thing to do now. Hurry. yes!

35
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:53,000
(Daikoku) Yakushiji Line Preparation. yes!

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
(Daikoku) I'll take a sedative. (Bonten) Yes.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Well, there is swelling caused by the bruise, but there are no other noticeable findings.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So you said it wasn't a big deal.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
However, just rest.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
If you're not enough people, but you're resting with an injury like this ➡

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The site is not running. surely . It's helpful.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Or rather, please at least eat it.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
(Ayumu) Today, the emergency department's on-call is over.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yes, I heard that Asura would live in the emergency department ➡

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I never thought he was such a dangerous person.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,666
Professor Anno!

47
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,333
come .

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll start. Female. (Ayumu) Yes.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:11,000
♬～

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Professor Anno!

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The position is off.

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What's wrong?

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I just got a little upset.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:38,000
♬～

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Retractor. (Ayumu) Yes.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The bleeding is incredibly strong. It's arterial bleeding.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Aspirate it. yes .

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Towel. (Ayumu) Yes.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
No bleeding point found.

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Find bleeding points along the artery run.

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
there were . Ligation and hemostasis with Z suture.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
3 - 0 Black Silk. (Ayumu) Yes.

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:32,000
♬～

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Thank you very much for your continued support for three months.

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
(Kayoko) I'm waiting for her to return to the emergency department.

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But I have to become a dermatologist and take over my parents' successors.

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
(Ayumu) It's tough! The ICU patients have suddenly changed.

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound)

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
(Sanae) Suddenly my blood pressure dropped to the 70s.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm bleeding a lot from the drain. (Daikoku) There is a high possibility of postoperative rebleeding.

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
(Okoku) Anno I'll do it soon.

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
(Daikoku) Anno: What's wrong?

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I can't operate. (Daikoku) What?

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
My eyes... I can't see well.

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound) (Sanae) My blood pressure is in the 50s.

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
(Daikoku) I don't have time. I'll run the sword. Please prepare immediately.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
(Hotachi) Yes.

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Where did you bleed?

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
From the point where Anno ligated and sutured it last night➡

80
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
He was bleeding.

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Postoperative bleeding is not an issue even if there is no problem with the operation during the surgery.

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It could be a complication.

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It cannot be said that this was Anno's fault.

84
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But this hasn't happened to me up until now.

85
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
very sorry .

86
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What about the eyes?

87
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
There was no problem with my consultation yesterday.

88
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Anyway, let's check it again.

89
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
(Daikoku) Also in the orbital floor and optic neural tube in the right eye➡

90
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I think there's a fracture. ➡

91
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Because of this, double vision appears when you look down.

92
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
His eyesight is also decreasing due to pressure on the optic nerve.

93
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
On the first CT, the swelling was hidden.

94
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The fracture line was not clear.

95
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
(Okoku) I think this symptom is in the field of plastic surgery ➡

96
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What do you think of Rokudo-sensei?

97
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
If the optic nerve continues to swell and the pressure continues to progress ➡

98
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The decline in vision is constantly progressing.

99
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The only way to cure is to open the optic nerve tube.

100
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But this surgery is ➡

101
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Do not do it within a few days as soon as possible.

102
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Even after surgery, the chances of recovery are significantly lower.

103
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
(Bonten) Dr. Naomi: Get ready for surgery as soon as possible.

104
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
This operation is very difficult and has few cases.

105
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I don't know the details of the technique either...

106
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I can't handle it. (Bonten) What...

107
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
(Naomi) There are only a few doctors who can administer the surgery.

108
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Honestly, I don't know if I'll find it soon.

109
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:17,000
♬～

110
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
(Kongou) Are you still not like Professor Ashura?

111
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's been a while. Asura ignores her, GO!

112
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
No, I can't believe Dr. Ashura will be hospitalized as a patient at our house.

113
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I was surprised.

114
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The chairman and director Tamon are now ➡

115
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm looking for a doctor who will take on the surgery.

116
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I have become the head of the medical department ➡

117
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I will also be working as the head of the surgery department. ➡

118
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Leave the treatment to Kongo Matayoshi in the meantime.

119
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
(Kongou) Then, Professor Ashura's responsibility is ➡

120
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I decided to ask Dr. Yakushiji.

121
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Thank you very much, Professor Yakushiji.

122
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
thank you .

123
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So first I'll take my blood.

124
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
(Kongou) The emergency department where Asura is not available ➡

125
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's a surprise to see what will happen.

126
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's why, if you make a mistake ➡

127
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
As the head of the medical department, it becomes my responsibility.

128
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That's not a huge hit! It's not accumulating!

129
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
If you don't pay attention...

130
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Did I talk to myself now?

131
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm tired.

132
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
(Ago) Today I shared my questions with Director Tamon and looked for it ➡

133
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I couldn't find a doctor to do the surgery.

134
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
There's still time. I'll look for it no matter what.

135
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Are you okay . I'll definitely make it in time.

136
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Without me, the site wouldn't be able to run.

137
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The life that should have been saved may spill over.

138
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You don't have to carry that much on your own.

139
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
There are other excellent teachers in the emergency department.

140
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's okay to take a little rest.

141
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
(Intercom)

142
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
(Intercom) (Kichijoji) Male in his 20s suffered abdominal injuries due to traffic injuries.

143
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It is acceptable. Please transport it.

144
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,666
It looks like it's going to be an emergency operation. Is the operation room available?

145
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:38,000
No, thanks to surgery today, the operating room is in full operation. ➡

146
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,666
There are no spaces available.

147
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:43,000
After all, it is our surgery that supports Taishaku.

148
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Dr. Yakushiji would also come to the surgery if you like...

149
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You can't enter.

150
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Dr. Yakushiji will take over his family's dermatology clinic.

151
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I can't believe you say you want to go to the emergency department, right?

152
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
A life-eliminator is not worth aiming for.

153
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
come .

154
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
☎ I've really come! Wow!

155
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
☎ Yes, what's wrong?

156
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
(Naomi) Female. (Ayumu) Yes.

157
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
(Naomi) He is bleeding severely. Aspirate it. (Bonten) Yes.

158
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
(Naomi) This is a large gauze. (Ayumu) Yes.

159
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
(Naomi) It's compressing the bleeding area.

160
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
(Bonten) That's strange. The blackness is mixed in.

161
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
(Naomi) That's bad. This isn't bleeding.

162
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,666
(Bonten) What! ?

163
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,000
(Naomi) The intestinal tract is ruptured and the contents are leaking.

164
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
(Bonten) Is it an intestinal perforation?

165
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound)

166
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
(Ayumu) My blood pressure is in the 50s. (Naomi) She is experiencing septic shock.

167
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
(Bonten) The crush is so severe that I can't suture.

168
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
(Naomi) If things continue like this, I'll be in cardiac arrest.

169
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
(Bonten) We can't handle it. ➡

170
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Leave it to the surgery. (Sanae) The surgeon is currently operating.

171
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I can't come anytime soon.

172
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:18,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound)

173
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
⚟ (Kongou) Everyone.

174
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Ask your subordinate that they have been contacted by the emergency department ➡

175
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I had a bad feeling, so when I came to see it, as expected...

176
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's totally ridiculous.

177
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The nurse there! To this Kongo Matayoshi➡

178
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Bring your gloves and gown!

179
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
(Sanae) Yes.

180
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Thanks to the doctor, I was able to help patients.

181
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
thank you . It was helpful.

182
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
no way . It was an easy win. I knew it was a little but ➡

183
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
After all, the emergency department is no good without Asura.

184
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Well, it was originally just a collection of things. ➡

185
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,666
At least not to hold back the surgical leg ➡

186
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,666
Please.

187
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Bonten-sensei, how old are you, children?

188
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
(Bonten) What? I'm only 0 years old.

189
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Ah, I'm only 0 years old...

190
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
(Tamon) Was that what happened in the emergency department? ➡

191
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
But anyway, it was good that the patients weren't important.

192
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
(Daikoku) Yes.

193
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
But the next one doesn't necessarily mean they'll be able to help you in the same way.

194
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
(Daikoku) So, I actually have a request.

195
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What's wrong?

196
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Until Anno returns ➡

197
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The emergency department has decided to temporarily suspend acceptance of critically ill patients.

198
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Why… . This is the result of discussions with Director Daikoku.

199
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
But then ➡

200
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You will no longer be able to save your life, which is supposed to be saved.

201
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
However, in the current emergency department ➡

202
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Even if they accept it, they cannot respond properly.

203
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Sorry.

204
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
If I hadn't happened this way...

205
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
(Mobile phone) (Ring tone)

206
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Ah, what if?

207
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
(Sanae) Naomi-sensei is on holiday today.

208
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
(Kayoko) Apparently there was an urgent matter.

209
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Even though Professor Anno is not there either... Nothing should happen though.

210
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I can only pray for peace.

211
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,666
yes .

212
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:07,000
Teacher asked me to bring this from the rest room.

213
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Thank you, Yakushiji-sensei.

214
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Give it to someone who works with my My Number card.

215
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Understood .

216
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Also, please take this.

217
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I took it with the idea of it as a substitute for amulet.

218
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So, if there's anything else, please let me know.

219
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
⚟ (Kongou) Professor Yakushiji.

220
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Would you like to bring this document to Gunma Medical Center?

221
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
yes . It's not possible if it's mailed.

222
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Ah yes, I understand.

223
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Please use a hospital car. yes .

224
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Come on, hurry.

225
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Oh, Professor Yakushiji.

226
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You never need sweet souvenirs.

227
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Ah, yes....

228
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Yaki Manju! Ah, it's not.

229
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Please come.

230
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
come!

231
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
(Intercom) (Okoku) Yes.

232
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
(Intercom) (Emergency personnel) Six people were injured in multiple accidents on the highway. ➡

233
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Two are red and three are green and one is currently rescued.

234
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
6 people….

235
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
sorry .

236
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
We are unable to accept critically ill patients right now.

237
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
(Intercom) (A paramedics) The other patients were able to be transported ➡

238
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
These six people just couldn't find a place to accept them➡

239
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Can you please?

240
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'll help too.

241
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Accept it.

242
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
(Daikoku) I understand. Please transport all six of us.

243
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
(Intercom) (Kichijoji) This is Daikoku Sensei Kichijoji. ➡

244
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
One of the patients is Dr. Yakushiji.

245
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
(Daikoku) I understand. please .

246
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
(Daikoku) Please prepare to accept it.

247
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
(Everyone) Yes!

248
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
There's no need to push yourself too hard.

249
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Do what you can. Understood.

250
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
(Daikoku) Please have the bed in the middle. (Emergency crew) I'll go with 3.

251
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
(Everyone) 1 2 3! (Bonten) Unpackaged.

252
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
⚟Can you hear it? (Everyone) 1 2 3!

253
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'll touch my feet. (Daikoku) Unpackaged.

254
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I'll come back later . (Daikoku) Do you understand?

255
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
(Daikoku) Anno! Please accept Yakushiji Temple.

256
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
learn.

257
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Yakushiji Sensei, are you okay? I'm sorry, Mr. Anno...

258
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
(Kichijoji) The consciousness is clear. A broken right leg is suspected.

259
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Understood. (Emergency personnel) Strings will be entered.

260
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Unpackaged. (Kichijoji) Yes.

261
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
⚟Please.

262
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'll touch it.

263
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,666
(Patient) Ugh...!

264
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:03,000
(Bonten) Intestinal rupture is suspected. You need to open your exam right now.

265
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
(Daikoku) This one is also bleeding intraperitoneally. I have to open my abdomen and stop the bleeding immediately.

266
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
(Sanae) I have reserved two rooms for the teacher's operation room.

267
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
(Daikoku) But it's impossible for two people to do an emergency operation at the same time with this number.

268
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
(Daikoku) I have to wait either of them.

269
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
(Bonten) However, both of them are in a situation where they are fighting for a moment.

270
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
(Kayoko) If things continue like this, it will be too late for one person.

271
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
(Daikoku) Director Tamon. (Tamon) What is the situation?

272
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
(Daikoku) There are two patients who need emergency operations. ➡

273
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I don't have enough hands.

274
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound)

275
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'll do this patient alone.

276
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
(Daikoku) It's impossible to operate alone. (Tamon) I'll do something about it.

277
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'll take it to the operating room now. (Everyone) Yes!

278
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
(Daikoku) Anno stays here with the Chief and continue the treatment.

279
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Understood.

280
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:25,000
♬～

281
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
(Patient) Ugh...! Quickly!

282
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
(Kayoko) I'll take action soon, so please wait a little longer.

283
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
(Patient) It hurts...!

284
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
(Patient moans)

285
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
(Patient moans)

286
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
(Patient) It hurts...

287
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'll help too. (Kayoko) Yakushiji Dr.

288
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
What are you talking about? Wait a minute to treat!

289
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
it's okay .

290
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I'll put in painkillers right away.

291
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
(Ayumu) His blood pressure is 74 and 40. It's steadily dropping.

292
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
(Ayumu) Dr. Tamon's bleeding won't stop!

293
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
(Tamon) There it was. It's bleeding from the hepatic arterial system. ➡

294
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Stop the bleeding. Blocking forceps. (Ayumu) Yes.

295
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
(Silent sound)

296
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
(Ayumu) The bleeding has stopped.

297
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound)

298
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
(Ayumu) The doctor is bleeding from another place. ➡

299
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
My blood pressure is in the 40s. (Tamon) My spleen ruptured. ➡

300
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
The stopping of the hepatic artery increased the pressure on the spleen.

301
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
(Ayumu) Not only the liver, but the spleen too... ➡

302
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I'll call the surgeon to support me. (Tamon) That's not necessary.

303
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
(Ayumu) What?

304
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
(Tamon) Operate in two places at the same time.

305
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
(Okoku) The intestines are crushed and if things continue like this, they won't be able to be sutured. ➡

306
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
The necrotic area must be excised and anastomized.

307
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
(Daikoku) Bonten-sensei?

308
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
(Bonten) He is in the exact same condition as the previous patient.

309
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
(Bonten) {The crush is so bad that I can't stitch it}

310
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
(Bonten) "We can't handle it" ➡

311
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Leave it to the surgery

312
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound) (Sanae) His blood pressure is 60, and he is 32.

313
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
(Daikoku) It has become a septic shock. ➡

314
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
If things continue like this, cardiac arrest will occur. ➡

315
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Professor Bonten: We can't do this operation now. ➡

316
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
For now, just cleanse and temporarily close the stomach.

317
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
(Daikoku) Bonten-sensei!

318
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound)

319
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
All of the patients were handed over to the surgeon.

320
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
That's good.

321
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It's really thanks to the teacher. home… .

322
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Next, we will treat Dr. Yakushiji. yes… .

323
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
(The sound of falling)

324
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
(Kayoko) Teacher? Dr. Yakushiji!

325
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Turn it to the slug. (Kayoko) Yes.

326
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Do you understand? Measure vitals. yes .

327
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
hear? Dr. Yakushiji!

328
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Yakushiji Professor Yakushiji Professor!

329
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
(Kongo) A limited edition pudding that can only be purchased in Ginza Nice to meet you.

330
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
We finally met.

331
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
We had a line up for an hour and a half.

332
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I'm touching. I'll enjoy having this .

333
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
☎ Twitch.

334
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
☎

335
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
yes . Gunma Medical Center?

336
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Ah, thank you for your continued support.

337
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Yeah .

338
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Yakushiji hasn't arrived yet?

339
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Huh? It was already around the time I had arrived.

340
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I am very sorry . We will check it out soon.

341
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Excuse me.

342
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
(The sound of placing the receiver)

343
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Where on earth is Yakushiji-sensei?

344
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I can't believe it...

345
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Are you buying a sweet souvenir?

346
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Let's have some pudding for now.

347
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
(Substitute) Director of Kongo Medical Care Department! ( Kongo) What's this time?! ?

348
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
What are you doing?

349
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Dr. Daikoku and normal hand ➡

350
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
There's no way an emergency operation can be done!

351
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
(Kongou) Damn it!

352
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
(Kunago) Please don't do anything you like. ➡

353
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
If both of you make a mistake ➡

354
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
It is the one who takes responsibility for the medical department's manager...

355
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
(Electronic sound) (Kongou) What! ?

356
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
(Bonten) Resection of the necrotic part has been completed.

357
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
(Daikoku) The anastomosis is ready.

358
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,666
(Bonten) A sin. (Sanae) Yes.

359
00:27:28,666 --> 00:27:31,000
(Bonten) 3-0 Black Silk. (Sanae) Yes.

360
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
( Kongo) Why did Bonten do this operation?

361
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
(Daikoku) After this previous operation, Rokudo-sensei and two others ➡

362
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Apparently they've repeated simulations.

363
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
( Kongo ) What...

364
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
(Kongou) Amazing. God Hand.

365
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
(Bonten) Kongo Sensei's ending GIA green is prepared.

366
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
( Kongo) Yes, I understand!

367
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
(Kongou) It's always fine.

368
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
There is a lot of bleeding in the abdominal cavity.

369
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
The injured area gradually began to hemorrhagic shock.

370
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
If you don't open your laparotomy and stop bleeding right now, your life will be in danger.

371
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
(Kayoko) But the teachers still can't come back!

372
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I'll do it.

373
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
(Kayoko) But...

374
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
If you open the laparotomy and clamp the blood vessels, it will last for 30 minutes.

375
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
In the meantime, if other teachers return, they can help.

376
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Hurry up and prepare.

377
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000

396

(Tamon) It was bleeding from the surface of the liver. ➡

397
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Needle holder. (Ayumu) Yes.

398
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
(Ayumu) Sorry. I'll prepare a new one soon.

399
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
(Tamon) Thread needle. (Ayumu) What? Is it a thread needle?

400
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
(Ayumu) Do you sew it by hand? ?

401
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
(Tamon) On the surface, hand-sewn is faster.

402
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
(Tamon) Cooper. (Ayumu) Yes.

403
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
(Tamon) Okay, let's go back to the spleen. (Ayumu) Yes.

404
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
(Ayumu) 《Amazing》➡

405
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
"Only one person will have the spleen and liver at the same time..."

406
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Do your best, Yakushiji-sensei.

407

Don't die!

408
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000

I'll leave your operation to Naomi.

(Amuro) He has extensive experience in optic nerve tube release ➡

453
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I was able to contact Dr. Sasao from Nagoya University of Medical Sciences.

454
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I can't do the operation because I have plans to do the operation ➡

455
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,000
He taught Naomi the details of the surgery.

456
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:50,000
(Naomi) There is no proof that it will be successful... ➡

457

(Okoku and the others) Yes!

464
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
(Naomi) Scratches tend to be noticeable when surgically administered brain surgery.

465
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
So this time I used a nasal endoscope...

466
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
(Daikoku) The other cranial nerves are also close so you won't get hurt...

467
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
(Bonten) Professor Anno's sphenoid sinus is wide...

468
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
(Naomi) The vision cannot be removed due to bleeding, so the cleaning solution...

469
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
(Bonten) Why is this the nasal route rather than the orbital route?

470
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
(Naomi) This method is minimally invasive. Through the sphenoid sinus...

471
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
(Okoku) I will be in charge of the endoscope.

472
