00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:12,000
(Preservation) Hold the laryngoscope as far as possible at the roots.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's like it's going to go along with your tongue...

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Please give me a tube. (Ayumu) ​​Yes.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Just like passing the glottis and placing the tube...

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I wish this person could do well!

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If it's a real patient, you can't get nervous.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yasu: Will you become a life-saving doctor after all? There's no way. Why?

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hmm, I'm practicing all of a sudden. There's nothing in the life-emergency doctors though ➡

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I want to be a little helpful while I'm here.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hmm.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Well, I've never done it before, but I wonder if there's a trick.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Why not ask Professor Ashura? The quickest way is to ask a good person.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
surely .

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
(Shura) "Have you forgotten your promise already? 》

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Huh? Where are you going?

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You can't go outside the hospital while you're working.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Well, me too.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
ramen? (The sound of the stomach squeal)

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Well, that's right. Please buy me.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
teacher! That's a coincidence.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Can I join you? If you do as you please.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Does this restaurant have no menu?

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We can only leave it to you. Huh?

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Is it okay to just leave it to you?

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
《It looks like a normal ramen, but...》

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's so delicious!

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Delicious.

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
(Daikoku) "The God Hand of Japan saved the lives of the world's financial kings!"

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
In the world, only Bonten-sensei did the operation.

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Huh! ? But Professor Ashura did it.

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Anno's name is nowhere to be found.

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But is it okay to write an article like this?

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
(Daikoku) Hmm? (Sanae) Dr. Bonten was involved in surgery.

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
There are rumors that he was knocked out while operating.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I guess it's probably a needle right now.

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
(Doctor) Hey, the God Hand is walking.

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,333
(Doctor) There is a 99% chance of being scared!

38
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:27,000
(The voices of doctors)

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
(Ago) Ah, there's apparently a story from Fink.

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
(Fink's English)

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
(Interpreter) Please continue to visit this hospital.

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I want to save many people. ➡

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So I have a suggestion.

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What! ?

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
(Fink's English)

46
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:25,000
Is it in the red? (Unmoving) Yes.

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Fink seemed concerned about our hospital's deficit.

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
(Kongou) Even though I donated it ➡

49
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It would be pointless if they were used to compensate for the deficit.

50
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
(Fudo) The cause of the deficit is the emergency department. ➡

51
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It would be a problem if we could accept more critically ill patients and increase the deficit.

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
As long as Ashura is there, it's not possible. No way... No way no way!

53
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
He really accepts patients without question.

54
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You need to put a nail on it again.

55
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Don't worry about the voices of those around you.

56
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Brahma is also one of the doctors who saved Fink's life.

57
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
No... I'm a fake God Hand.

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
In fact, everything should be made public to the public.

59
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
When I think about my family, I can't.

60
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Of course this will happen. It's my own fault.

61
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
(Tamon) It's true that there may have been some lie, but ➡

62
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Bonten's knowledge and experience as a heart surgeon should not be a lie.

63
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Ah, the director. What happened?

64
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
(Fudo) I would like to give you some advice.

65
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
(Kayoko) Advice?

66
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm sure everyone already knows it ➡

67
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We will never accept critically ill patients. That's the rules of our clinic.

68
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I would like you to once again follow the rules.

69
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But by following those rules,

70
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The lives that were supposed to be saved will no longer be saved.

71
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
If you force yourself to accept a patient and make a mistake.

72
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Hospital management will get worse. If that happens ➡

73
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
There's no way to save your life. ➡

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The lives saved by emergency departments are certainly precious.

75
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But as the director, I am

76
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
This hospital has an obligation to protect the many lives that can be saved!

77
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
(Fudo) By the way, I can't see Professor Anno.

78
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This is the first time I've had such a delicious ramen.

79
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Oh, by the way, there's something I want to ask...

80
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Please tell me some tips for intubation.

81
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Hmm?

82
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
strange .

83
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,666
Ah, sorry. I've never had a success yet.

84
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,000
The aftertaste is different from usual. Huh? Ah, talking about ramen?

85
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Call an ambulance.

86
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What! ?

87
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
(Shop owner) Ugh...

88
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I guess he had symptoms after all. Since when?

89
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Shut up! It will subside soon...

90
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'll turn it to the slut.

91
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's difficult! I received a call from Yakushiji-sensei ➡

92
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Dr. Anno asks patients with acute myocardial infarction ➡

93
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Apparently it's going to be carried.

94
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
(Shop owner) Ah...

95
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Immediately do PCI. Contact the catheter room.

96
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
(Sanae) I understand.

97
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
(Fudo) Take the patient to another hospital!

98
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
What are you talking about? Go ahead! (Daikoku) I have to treat him right away...

99
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We will not accept critically ill patients! That's our rule.

100
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
No exceptions are accepted. but… .

101
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The patients are suffering so much!

102
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So we have to hurry up and find the next hospital.

103
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Are you still a doctor? If I do that, it won't help.

104
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
That must have been the bad luck of this patient.

105
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's too bad. It's a waste of time talking to you.

106
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm going to Bows. yes!

107
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
(Stay) Wait! The director's order!

108
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Drop it! (Unmoving) Ah!

109
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Damn it! A life-saving idiot.

110
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
(Bonten) Sorry for keeping you waiting. (Kongou) Thank you.

111
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Next, I'll clean up the documents there. (Bonten) I understand.

112
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
No, Bonten-sensei, that's amazing.

113
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It seems that operations are being sent from all over the world.

114
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,333
As expected of a god hand... not that.

115
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:42,000
Not that, not that. Ah! ➡

116
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Poor patients.

117
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I can't believe that God Hand, the leash of trust, is

118
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I can't believe it's a fake. Hehehe....

119
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
(Mobile phone) (Kongou) Director: What did you do?

120
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
(Mobile phone) (Fudo) Stop Anno-sensei right now! ➡

121
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's the catheter room.

122
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
(Kongou) Ashura! What are you doing?

123
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Unstable angina pectoris has progressed to acute myocardial infarction.

124
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Revascularization with PCI now. What! ?

125
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Let's hurry. yes .

126
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
(Kongou) Wait, PCI has been cancelled. Huh?

127
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
This person was a patient who was under observation at the surgery.

128
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,666
The other day, a coronary angiography revealed that two blood vessels were narrowed.

129
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,333
(Daikoku) Is it true? (Kongou) That's true.

130
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,000
Does that mean you can't use PCI?

131
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
PCIs at risk of restenosis. I'll do bypassing at home.

132
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I don't use bypass techniques. I'll go with PCI.

133
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
They just don't want to give the patient to us.

134
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Teacher: I guess it's better to make it an operation after all...

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,666
(Daikoku) That's right. It's better to leave it to your doctor's judgment.

136
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,666
(Shop owner) Ah... (Kongou) Is it okay?

137
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,000
Don't worry, I'll treat you soon.

138
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
(Shop owner) Ah... Ah...

139
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:58,000

《If even a little bit of your hands go wrong, it's going to be a big problem》

172
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
amazing… .

173
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Connect it. yes .

174
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Inflate. yes .

175
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
once again . yes!

176
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:55,000
♬～

177
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
(Daikoku) Blood flow has recovered.

178
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
(Kongou) It's a divine thing. Bravo!

179
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
(Kongou) No, not. My patient is arbitrary... ➡

180
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
No joke! (Bonten) Here it is Kongo Sensei.

181
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'll treat other blood vessels too. yes .

182
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
If the emergency department is officially closed,

183
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It looks like we can start to move forward in earnest towards the establishment of a new hospital.

184
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
(Mobile phone) (Professor) That was good.

185
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I will definitely make a successful new hospital and return to Tooh University.

186
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
That's what I mean, and there's one good news.

187
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Apparently, Professor Takahashi of Respiratory Surgery is getting sick and will be resigning.

188
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,666
What! ?

189
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,000
(Mobile phone) I suddenly had to hold a professorial election.

190
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,666
Please let me run. (Mobile phone) But...

191
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:50,000
Many of the selection committee members this time were professors from different factions than me.

192
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You need to be prepared to win their votes.

193
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
(Unmoved) I understand.

194
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
(Unmoving) Are you prepared for it?

195
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Thank you for your hard work.

196
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
All that's left is to move to the ward and see the progress.

197
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
(Shop owner) When will I be able to be discharged from the hospital?

198
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You can go home in 2-3 days. (Shop owner) Is it that early? ➡

199
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I was told that surgery would take three weeks.

200
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
PCI causes smaller wounds than surgery.

201
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
He's also discharged from the hospital early.

202
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
(Shop owner) Ah... that was good. yes .

203
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Well, take care of me.

204
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm glad the treatment went well, but I'm sure Dr. Kongo is mad.

205
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
(Kongou) Damn it! Damn it!

206
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Despite the fact that I'm in the hospital, I'm getting carried away!

207
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Damn it!

208
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Would you like to go and apologize?

209
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Positioning is essential for intubation. Heh?

210
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
To ensure that the height of the external ear canal and sternum is the same.

211
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's easier to get in if you adjust your position.

212
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
What now! ?

213
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
(Naomi) Are you the rumored Ashura Sensei?

214
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
who?

215
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's nice to meet you, so of course I can't remember.

216
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I was shown your PCI. As rumored, he's amazing.

217
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Thank you .

218
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
However, it is impossible for a life-saving doctor to have a mental categorization.

219
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Maybe leaving it to your doctor would have saved the patient?

220
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
The patient's life is.

221
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
But why did that patient nominate Dr. Anno?

222
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
That person was taken to our emergency department once.

223
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Ah, was that so?

224
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I was transported with unstable angina pectoris➡

225
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Dr. Anno responded and handed over to the surgery. ➡

226
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Sugu was discharged from the hospital. Without treatment?

227
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
"Can I take a break when the customers come?!"

228
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Professor Ashura It seems that he's been going to that shop a lot since he heard that.

229
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
That's why they were particular about PCI, which had a short hospital stay.

230
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It seems like I'm only thinking about saving lives. ➡

231
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You're thinking about the patients properly.

232
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
What's the story?

233
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Actually, it's near ➡

234
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
A professorial election will be held at Tokyo University.

235
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Of course I am also planning to run.

236
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
As you know ➡

237
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Choosing a professor at Tokyo University is not easy.

238
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So I would like to ask Professor Bonten to help out a little.

239
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
What...

240
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
(Fudo) A cardiac surgery professor who might be able to vote for me ➡

241
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Could you please introduce me to me?

242
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Of course, I wouldn't say it's free.

243
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Imitation that lends you a helping hand in fraud... (Fudo) Is it okay?

244
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm currently heading you ➡

245
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You can even make the truth public.

246
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Your face and name are now known all over the world.

247
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
He could not do any kind of job, let alone a doctor.

248
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Your family will be lost on the streets. (Bonten) That's...

249
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
(Fudo) Until now, I've been using dirty hands to lift up. ➡

250
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
What do you need to hesitate now?

251
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
(Unmoving) If you follow my instructions ➡

252
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I won't do it as bad.

253
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
See.

254
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
What, Tamon-sensei. Vice Director.

255
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Anno: Are you there? Is it Anno-sensei?

256
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What's it for? Is it a little better?

257
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
To get Fink to donate to establish a new hospital ➡

258
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
We had to quickly resolve our deficit.

259
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Do you mean something about the life saving deficit?

260
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
No matter what I say, I will never turn down a patient.

261
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
We cannot abandon patients because of a new hospital.

262
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's definitely a life-saving closure... (Tamon) It's too late.

263
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
The emergency department will close in two months. The chairman has decided that.

264
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Oh, it's rare. what happened?

265
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Don't be fooled!

266
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
What does it mean to shut down a lifesaving?

267
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's depressing here.

268
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Let's change the location.

269
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
(Among) When you were a resident, ➡

270
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm glad you came here and listened to your complaints.

271
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Are you serious about shutting down your lifesaving?

272
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
That's right. If life is gone from Taishaku ➡

273
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
The lives that have been saved up until now will no longer be saved.

274
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Of course I know that. So why?

275
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I have a more important mission than that.

276
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
At the new hospital ➡

277
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
We will generously introduce the latest equipment and the best talent.

278
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Patients that could not be saved by the previous Taishaku ➡

279
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You will be able to save.

280
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
If possible, I would have wanted to save my life.

281
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
That's probably the same for Mr. Tamon.

282
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
different . That person also chose a new hospital over lifesaving.

283
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
He also has a mission to do.

284
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
mission?

285
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
What kind of experiences has Tamon had overseas?

286
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Have you heard of it? Huh?

287
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Save people in conflict zones.

288
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's easy to say it verbally though ➡

289
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:06,000
In fact, he couldn't save most of his lives with his arm.

290
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Why?

291
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
In a situation where there is a shortage of medication, blood transfusions, and medical devices.

292
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
There are only a few doctors can do.

293
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
(Amuro) Still, he didn't give up and tried to continue his activities.

294
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
But the organization I belong to is

295
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
They were in danger of canceling their activities due to a lack of funds.

296
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So he returned to Japan and became my right arm.

297
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It is a promise to use a portion of the profits of the new hospital to support medical care overseas.

298
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Even so, I...

299
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
We will never let them cut off lifesaving.

300
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:24,000
♬～

301
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:37,000
♬～

302
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
(Fudo) Ah Professor How about another professor?

303
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Oh, then I might have it.

304
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
(Professor) Professor Bonten's achievements have been a hot topic at Tooh University.

305
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Tokona regretted giving him a crushing person.

306
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
The other day's operation for Steve Fink was also very impressive.

307
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I really wanted to see it with my own eyes. Hahaha...!

308
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Come to think of it ➡

309
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
We'll prepare some small gifts.

310
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
A gift? (Unmoving) Yes. ➡

311
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
If it suits your taste, please come and choose the next professor's selection ➡

312
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Thank you for your support.

313
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
(Among) What do you mean by canceling your donation?

314
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I couldn't tell you the exact reason.

315
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
What was our response wrong?

316
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Ah... Maybe the deficit was the problem after all.

317
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
No, I also told them that the emergency department was being closed.

318
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
That doesn't seem to be the reason. (Fudo) So, what exactly is it?

319
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
It's no use being confused.

320
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I'll think of a way to persuade Fink.

321
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
(Nurser) Mr. Brahma.

322
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Fink is calling.

323
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
(Interpreter) Please.

324
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
(Fink's English)

325
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Donations have been withdrawn! ? Why is it all... not that.

326
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
(Kongou) Why on earth? (Unmoving) I don't know at this point.

327
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,666
That's a shame.

328
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,000
He was just one step away from becoming the director of the new hospital.

329
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It doesn't matter now.

330
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
⚟ (Knock) (Tamon) Please.

331
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
(Tamon) Oh, that's rare. I can't believe Brahma is coming to visit.

332
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It's about a donation from Fink...

333
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Has something happened?

334
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
What caused Fink to withdraw his donation?

335
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
(Fink's English)

336
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
(Fink's English)

337
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
(Bonten) The director had been giving away money to select a professor. ➡

338
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:50,000
At the director's request, I introduced me to a professor of cardiac surgery.

339
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I can't believe it was money he earned from embezzlement...

340
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I'm so sorry .

341
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Haa...

342
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
No, you don't need to apologise.

343
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
However, I was able to refuse. It was me who didn't do that.

344
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm quitting my doctor already. I'm going to post a resignation letter from now on.

345
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Please wait a minute. Do that...

346
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Let me take responsibility. Even though something like that happened ➡

347
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I was still trying to continue working as a doctor.

348
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It was a mistake in the first place.

349
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Did you get out of work again? It's fine because today is a holiday.

350
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
What's the day off in that outfit? He's working on his own today too.

351
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It's no use staying at home, and the hospital is more relaxed.

352
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
He's a real worker. You too.

353
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
how was it?

354
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
It's the usual taste.

355
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
It's thanks to you for your treatment.

356
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Thank you for the meal.

357
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Thank you.

358
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
He must have come to care about my health.

359
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I was just hungry.

360
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:46,690
Thank you for your hard work today as well.

361
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:49,690
If I could return to Tooh University, I would have no hard work.

362
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:53,690
It's a bit dirty, but I have no choice but to use it.

363
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:56,690
Are you a dirty hand? (Unmoving) Oh.

364
00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:01,690
However, even if it was discovered, I would not be caught.

365
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:05,690
As expected of the director. That means everything is within expectations.

366
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:09,690
When I returned to Tooh University, I became the director.

367
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,690
The highest authority in the Japanese medical world.

368
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:16,690
The value of a doctor can only be measured by authority.

369
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:20,023
Hahaha...!

370
00:28:20,023 --> 00:28:24,690
Wow! (Unmoving) Wow!

371
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,690

378
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:18,690
Yes! ? (Fudo) Get treatment soon!

379
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,690
(Daikoku) They both immediately went to the treatment room. (Everyone) Yes!

380
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,690
Mr. Duowen?

381
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:30,690
Please send it to another hospital right now. What! ?

382
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:35,690
We will not accept critically ill patients. That's our rule.

383
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,690
It's not always possible to find the destination immediately!

384
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:44,690
It was the director himself who told him to turn down such patients.

385
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:49,690
No, but if you don't treat it right away, you'll die.

386
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:52,690
Daikoku Sensei Let's carry it inside! (Daikoku) Ah, let's go.

387
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,690
(Everyone) Yes.

388
00:29:56,690 --> 00:30:02,690
Daikoku Sensei Don't you think so too?

389
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:08,690
(Unmoving) Ugh...!

390
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:11,690
Daikoku-sensei?

391
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:15,690
"We won't accept critically ill patients! That's our rule.

392
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:23,690
Daikoku Sensei! Let's carry it quickly!

393
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:31,690

ask! Help me...!

396
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:48,690
For those who use hospitals for self-interest

397
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:51,690
It's not worth helping.

398
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:56,690
(Unmoving) Uuuu... Uuuuuu!

399
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,690
What should I do?

That fight I buy it.

404
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,690
Did you come after all?

405
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:30,690
I don't care about the value. I'll help.

406
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:35,690
This person is because he wants to return to Tooh University ➡

407
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:39,690
He was a man who had embezzled hospital money.

408
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,690
so what?

409
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:51,690
This caused the establishment of a new hospital to be distant.

410
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:55,690
Abandon the life in front of you for your own purposes.

411
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:57,690
You're not the same either.

(Daikoku) Do you understand?

425
00:32:50,732 --> 00:32:52,732
What should you do? If you have an artery damaged ➡

426
00:32:52,732 --> 00:32:54,732
If you pull out the pipe, you'll get serious bleeding.

427
00:32:54,732 --> 00:32:56,732
Open the abdominal cavity and stop the bleeding before removing it.

450
00:34:37,732 --> 00:34:40,732
(Sanae) It seems that everyone in the cardiac surgery department is operating and they have no hands free.

451
00:34:40,732 --> 00:34:44,732
(Daikoku) It's a dangerous situation if you don't operate right now. What should I do...?

00:40:04,195 --> 00:40:07,195
Eh! ?

513
00:40:07,195 --> 00:40:11,195
So Kongo-sensei, let me know when you wake up.

514
00:40:11,195 --> 00:40:13,195
(Kongou) Please wait a minute.

515
00:40:13,195 --> 00:40:15,195
The shock may cause my heart to stop again.

516
00:40:15,195 --> 00:40:19,195
Then, ask Ashura to save you again.

517
00:40:19,195 --> 00:40:20,861
surely… .

518
00:40:20,861 --> 00:40:25,195
No, it's not it! Not that isn't it!

519
00:40:25,195 --> 00:40:28,195
Thank you for your hard work.

520
00:40:28,195 --> 00:40:35,195
(Bonten) Everyone, I was very sorry the other day.

521
00:40:35,195 --> 00:40:39,195
I'm in the emergency department.

522
00:40:39,195 --> 00:40:43,195
I've done something irreparable.

523
00:40:43,195 --> 00:40:47,195
I'm really sorry.

524
00:40:52,195 --> 00:40:59,195
Take responsibility and I'm already...

525
00:40:59,195 --> 00:41:03,195
I'm thinking of quitting my doctor. (Everyone) What! ?

526
00:41:03,195 --> 00:41:10,195
(Bonten) Thanks to everyone, I was able to do something that is typical of a doctor at the end.

527
00:41:10,195 --> 00:41:13,195
thank you . Please wait!

528
00:41:13,195 --> 00:41:16,195
Why are you quitting? That's right.

529
00:41:16,195 --> 00:41:19,195
Today's operation was so amazing.

530
00:41:19,195 --> 00:41:22,195
For me, it's already ➡

531
00:41:22,195 --> 00:41:25,195
I'm not qualified to continue working as a doctor.

532
00:41:33,195 --> 00:41:35,195
Certainly the teacher ➡

533
00:41:35,195 --> 00:41:39,195
You may have made a mistake.

534
00:41:39,195 --> 00:41:42,195
But if the teacher didn't come ➡

535
00:41:42,195 --> 00:41:45,195
The driver had passed away. ➡

536
00:41:45,195 --> 00:41:50,195
Dr. Bonten's surgery saved the patient's lives.

537
00:41:52,195 --> 00:41:58,195
With the doctor's skill, we can save more patients.

538
00:41:58,195 --> 00:42:05,195
Isn't that what a teacher can do to atone for sins?

539
00:42:05,195 --> 00:42:09,195
Oh, if there's no place in the surgery ➡

540
00:42:09,195 --> 00:42:14,195
Would you like to come to save your life? (Bonten) What?

541
00:42:14,195 --> 00:42:18,195
Let's help patients together to save lives.

542
00:42:21,195 --> 00:42:24,195
I would like to work with my teacher too.

543
00:42:24,195 --> 00:42:28,195
It would be great if we had a teacher too.

544
00:42:30,195 --> 00:42:34,195
Anno: What do you think? Huh?

545
00:42:39,195 --> 00:42:44,195
We have fewer people, so it's better to have more doctors.

546
00:42:46,195 --> 00:42:51,195
In other words, it's welcome.

547
00:42:51,195 --> 00:42:53,195
(Daikoku) It's hard to understand. Hahaha...!

548
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:55,195
Is it really okay?

549
00:42:55,195 --> 00:43:00,195
We are always welcome as long as the teacher is fine.

550
00:43:00,195 --> 00:43:02,195
thank you .

551
00:43:02,195 --> 00:43:07,195
Ah, but saving lives is a chaotic situation every day.

552
00:43:07,195 --> 00:43:09,195
OK? Huh?

553
00:43:09,195 --> 00:43:13,195
(Ayumu) ​​Yasushi Don't say unnecessary things. Because it's true.

554
00:43:13,195 --> 00:43:15,528
Say life is a lot of fun.

555
00:43:15,528 --> 00:43:18,861
I can't say it even if my mouth is slit. (Kayoko) Why? ? ➡

556
00:43:18,861 --> 00:43:23,195
He's always having fun. I haven't done it.

557
00:43:23,195 --> 00:43:27,195
⚟You love me, you're probably going to save your life. I don't love it.

558
00:43:27,195 --> 00:43:32,195
I finally felt like he would come over the course of the day.

559
00:43:32,195 --> 00:43:36,195
I was thinking of making it to Tooh University, but if Yuri-san said that much, then that's it.

560
00:43:36,195 --> 00:43:38,195
I'm looking forward to it.

561
00:43:38,195 --> 00:43:40,195
But why am I in the emergency department?

562
00:43:40,195 --> 00:43:44,195
Taishaku also has plastic surgery, right? (Ago) That's fine.

563
00:43:44,195 --> 00:43:47,195
You're interested in Ashura too, right?

564
00:43:47,195 --> 00:43:49,195
It's just a bit interesting.

565
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:58,195
Perhaps Ashura is better than you.

566
00:44:01,195 --> 00:44:03,195
I wonder.

567
00:44:06,195 --> 00:44:09,195
I'll check it out.

568
00:44:09,195 --> 00:44:14,195
(Ago) Hehehehe...
