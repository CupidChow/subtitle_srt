00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,000
(Doctor) Dr. Bonten looks forward to seeing you today.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
(Everyone) Thank you very much!

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
(Bonten) Shall we start? (Doctor) Yes.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
(Doctor) You, that. (Nurse) Yes.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
(CD) (♬ "Majestic")

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
(Bonten) So, let's take the time to deal with unstable angina pectoris➡

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Start coronary artery bypass surgery. ➡

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Female. (Nurse) Yes.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
(Bonten) Electric female. (Nurse) Yes.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
♬～

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
(Bonten) A chest expander. (Nurse) Yes.

12

♬～

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
(Bonten) Mayo. (Nurse) Yes.

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
♬～

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
(Bonten) Started cardiopulmonary machinery. ⚟Yes.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
♬～

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
(Bonten) Remove it. ⚟Yes.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
(Kongo) This song is apparently the theme song for Bonten Sensei.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
(Fudo) The operation is also truly majestic.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's certainly impressive to see the director.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
However, I never thought I had to undergo surgery on the former Prime Minister.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I never thought I would be looking at it with my own eyes.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Now that I have the power of one of Japan's leading cardiac surgeons➡

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The establishment of a new hospital will finally become a reality.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
(Sanae) "BEST OF GOD HAND"?

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
He is the number one cardiac surgeon in Japan. Wow.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Why did such a person come to our house from Tooh University?

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
here we go? Apparently he's the chairman's scout.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Scout! ? (Kayoko) Heading towards the new hospital ➡

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Apparently they're attracting excellent doctors from all over the country.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
(Sanae) After all, new hospitals can really be done.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
(Tamon) "I'm in order to make the new hospital come true ➡

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm back. For that reason ➡

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The emergency department that will never make a profit will close soon.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
"Dr. Tamon betrayed the emergency department, right? 》

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
{While Professor Tamon is away ➡

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Professor Anno has been working hard on his own forever...! 》

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
《Bows cannot satisfy treatment alone➡

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's 100 years earlier that I'm worried! 》

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
(Ago) Former Prime Minister Tagawa's coronary artery bypass surgeries ➡

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I was able to succeed just now.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
(Applause)

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
(Reporter) Dr. Bonten, please let me know what you think after the surgery.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
If you say there was no pressure at all ➡

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's a lie, but I was confident that I could make it work.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Because my operation is...

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The success rate is 99%.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
(Shutter sound) (Reporter) It came out.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
(Reporter) Bonten Sensei: Why did you transfer from Tooh University to Taishaku?

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Of course I sympathized with the chairman's philosophy. ➡

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The main reason is ➡

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I heard that Dr. Tamon has returned as vice-president.

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I didn't know that they were university classmates.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Professor Tamon in college has always been number one.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I never got along.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I've now completely overtaken.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I was able to work with my best friend, so it was the connection that the chairman connected me to.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I am truly grateful.

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
To help the doctor become active in the new hospital ➡

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The inspection next day must be a success.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Are you an inspection?

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yeah . (The sound of typing the keyboard)

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Steve Fink, CEO of Gold Wealth ➡

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm going to invite you. (Bonten) What! ? Is that Fink?

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
This is what Professor Tamon was doing during his overseas days.

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
(Bonten) I can't believe the CEO of one of the world's leading financial companies will be here...

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
This is a valuable opportunity to ask for loans to establish a new hospital.

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Please, Tamon-sensei. (Tamon) Leave it to us.

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Ah! That's from Professor Daikoku.

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's in the fridge so it belongs to everyone.

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Dr. Tamon: Will the emergency department really be closed?

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Ah! It's not about me thrust my neck ➡

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I know, but I'm worried after all.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
There's no need to worry about it. We're not going to let them close.

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
but… .

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
come . Huh?

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Namino Mitsuko, 70 years old.

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Apparently he lost consciousness on the street and collapsed.

79
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The emergency team apparently had regained consciousness when they arrived.

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Cardiac arrest for more than 3 seconds... Is it sinus dysfunction syndrome?

81
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm sure it's a condition in which your heart rate is slowing due to a sinus node disorder.

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
If you don't maintain your heart rate with a pacemaker, you'll be life-threatening if you experience another seizure.

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I have to hire a cardiology or cardiac surgeon.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
(Ayumu) ​​I contacted her, but she refused because she was busy.

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What... So I'll put it in the temporary one.

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What! Can you do it?

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Prepare the catheter room. Amazing...

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Today's surgery was really impressive.

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
To be honest, I'm not very good at being prominent...

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What do you say? The doctor will eventually visit this hospital.

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You will have to carry it on your back.

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'll be able to succeed my director ➡

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
There are no one other than Bonten-sensei.

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
thank you .

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
To do this, first take the position of vice director.

96
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Throw Tamon down.

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yeah . Of course, that's what I'm planning to do.

98
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:32,000
♬～

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:47,000
♬～

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
(Unmoved) Despite all the advice I gave ➡

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It looks like they've broken the rules again. ➡

102
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The doctor will be asked to get off from the emergency department head today.

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You've done something a waste.

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's a shame.... ➡

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But I have no regrets because my son's life was saved.

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Huh? (Daikoku) I'll do my best as a niira.

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Excuse me.

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Ah, I said that...

109
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Eat sweets and try hard.

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
( Kongo) I'll pass by a bit, so leave it empty.

111
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Bonten-sensei, please! (Everyone) Thank you very much!

112
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Everyone should stop doing this.

113
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Are you a colleague working with us? From now on, together ➡

114
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Let's aim for the world. (Kongou) Yes! ➡

115
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Okay, everyone, let's go! (Bonten) It's inefficient, so ➡

116
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Let's stop this kind of daimyo procession. (Kongo) Again, Professor Bonten.

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Who was the temporary patient yesterday?

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Oh, if it were Nano-san, the cardiac surgery department took me with me a little while ago.

119
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It seems they'll also be able to include permanent pacemakers.

120
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What kind of blowing? Because Bonten-sensei has been assigned to the office ➡

121
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
They want to get full and look good.

122
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So it looks like they'll take over soon from now on.

123
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
(Daikoku) I can't help but be examined by God Hand ➡

124
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm lucky. I'm bored and I'll take a look.

125
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm sure Anno-sensei is also really interested in Bonten-sensei.

126
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'll go too. Huh? Why?

127
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It would be a pain if it was violent in surgery.

128
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
(Daikoku) It's already taken over, so don't do anything unnecessary.

129
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
(Daikoku) Haa. ➡

130
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
See, I'm sleeping, but I'm not waking you up, so let's go home.

131
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,660
different . Huh?

132
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,660
Wake up. Wake up!

133
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,000
(Daikoku) Could it be that your level of consciousness is declining? Hey, wake up. Wake up.

134
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
(Daikoku) The temporary one is off. Wake up!

135
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
(Kungou) Next is a patient with sinus dysfunction syndrome. ➡

136
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
A life-emergist is planning to put in a temporary position today with a pacemaker.

137
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Is lifesaving temporary?

138
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
At Taishaku, the cardiovascular doctor is saving lives.

139
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Ah no, that Ashura specializes in emergency care.

140
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Ashura? (Kongo) Ah, his real name is Anno.

141
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But she is truly an Ashura-like woman...

142
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
(Daikoku) Let's hurry. (Kongou) Doctor Daikoku! ➡

143
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Ashura, what are you doing!

144
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,330
The temporary electrodes had come off my heart. What! ?

145
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,000
If I were to be relieved again after cardiac arrest, I would die.

146
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'll start using the pacemaker now.

147
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
( Kongo ) Slowly... Don't do anything you like!

148
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,660
Go ahead. Wait a minute. That person is already ➡

149
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,660
He's a surgical patient. obstacle!

150
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,660
Do you know what you're doing?

151
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,660
Anno It's fine now. Leave it to the surgery.

152
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:51,000
Get ahead. Let go!

153
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Professor Kongo, please calm down.

154
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
but… . (Bonten) Professor Anno's anger too➡

155
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
That's right. The reason why management was not completed is

156
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's our responsibility.

157
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm sorry.

158
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Ah... (Kungo) That God Hand...

159
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's a head that can be easily lowered. Or rather, who are you?

160
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's over... ( Kongo ) Hey, this person ➡

161
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Who do you think it is? Apologise! The patient is wandering through the hellish scene!

162
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I won't leave it to you. Life savers will do it.

163
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Ashura... Ashura wait. (Bonten) Teacher, that's fine. ➡

164
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The emergency department doctors go out of their way to see this much ➡

165
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Because I was concerned about it.

166
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Is the pacemaker working? (Daikoku) Ah, it's okay.

167
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So close. (Fudo) Anno is

168
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It caused another fuss. (Bonten) From Surgery ➡

169
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
He is a very patient-conscious doctor who takes away his patients.

170
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
(Fudo) Come to think of it, that woman is apparently a disciple of Tamon.

171
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What about Tamon-sensei? (Unmoving) Yes. ➡

172
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
They're just damn damn two. (Bonten) To meet Ashura-kun➡

173
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I have to be grateful. (Fudo) What does it mean?

174
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
(Bonten) Thanks to her, I came up with a good plan.

175
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
The success rate is 99%.

176
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
(Bonten) Everyone, I'm grateful that you all gathered together despite your busy schedule today.

177
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I have just arrived at Taishaku General Hospital.

178
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
My name is Bonten.

179
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
(Helicopter rotor sound)

180
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
(Emergency personnel) Oh. (Applause)

181
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
(Kongou) Bonten-sensei! This is a letter addressed to the teacher.

182
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
thank you . (Kongou) That's an incredible number.

183
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
There are so many patients waiting for the doctor's surgery.

184
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I really want to have surgery on everyone...

185
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The teacher's operation schedule is perfect up to a year ahead... not that.

186
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
That's pretty tough. (Bonten) Can't handle everything ➡

187
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
My heart hurts. (Kongou) He's cool...

188
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
(CD) (♬ "Majestic") (Bonten) "My master and me ➡

189
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I was about to give up, and then I found out about Bonten-sensei on TV."

190
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
"This is our last hope. With the help of the teacher, please ➡

191
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Save my master's life."

192
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm 62 years old...I'd be two more years younger.

193
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
60 or more is high risk. That's not good.

194
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
This patient is at a higher risk of postoperative complications.

195
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Outside the problem.

196
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
This is no good either.

197
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's a shame! But that's not good.

198
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
No!

199
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Oh? This case was at age 50. He has no particular medical history.

200
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Passed!

201
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Oh? Was there only one left?

202
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
There's nothing I can do.

203
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
For patients with high risk, I would like to have my success rate at 99%.

204
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The only way to get them to give up.

205
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
(Ago) Mr. Fink Welcome. I'm Agon.

206
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Oh Dr. Tamon!

207
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
(English) (Fink) Yes.

212
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Please accept (intercom). (Daikoku) I understand. ➡

213
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It is acceptable. ➡

214
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Another patient is coming. Oh, again! ?

215
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Isn't there a lot of transportation today? ?

216
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
(Kayoko) What does it mean to be 10 people per hour! ?

217
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Started with oxygen and two infusions. (Ayumu) ​​Yes.

218
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Your mouth will open. I'll intubate. (Ayumu) ​​Yes.

(Bonten) Backup Presia starts. ⚟Yes.

222
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
(Bonten) How many minutes have passed? (Nurse) It's 45 minutes.

223
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
(Kongou) Things are going well. (Bonten) My operation is ➡

224
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's always on time.

225
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
(Sanae) Dr. I'm bleeding more frequently. Please wait a minute!

226
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,660
sorry! (Ayumu) ​​I'll get it.

227
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,330
(Daikoku) Going for the CT. Please contact the operating room. ➡

228
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,000
I'll pass! Ah, sorry!

229
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
There are no people at all, it's insane...

230
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
(Ayumu) ​​The blood pressure of the patient who vomited blood is not measured. ➡

231
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Please give me instructions. What...

232
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Take another line and get 4 units of red blood cells.

233
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
(Ayumu) ​​Yes!

234
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
At the same time... it's impossible.

235
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
(Intercom) Go out and accept it.

236
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
But I'm already examining so many times.

237
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Okay, get out early! (Intercom)

238
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000

240
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It could be heart failure. What...

241
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Please accept (intercom).

242
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What are you dazzling? Accept quickly!

243
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
(Sanae) Let's turn this way. (Kayoko) What's wrong? ➡

244
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
OK?

245
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Sorry... We are currently dealing with patients.

246
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I cannot accept anything more.

247
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
We'll accept it. Bring it straight away.

248
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
teacher! It's not possible anymore.

249
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
There's another person coming, so I'll leave the treatment table. The calm patients should be placed in the ICU.

250
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
(Sanae) The ICU is already full. So, look for a ward to enter.

251
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Anywhere is fine. (Sanae) We will contact the ward.

252
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Please take it easy. The patients here now ➡

253
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's severe and everyone needs treatment.

254
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
No matter how you look at it, we can't deal with it anymore.

255
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
(Sanae) Dr. It seems that it is difficult to accept the ward right away.

256
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Then I'll examine you in the hallway. Have it ready.

257
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
(Sanae) I understand. In the hallway...

258
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound) (Ayumu) ​​This is Asis!

259
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Hit adrenaline! (Ayumu) ​​Yes.

260
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound)

261
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
This is... not medical...

262
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Hit another one. (Ayumu) ​​Yes.

263
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Teacher: Isn't this a process for the factory?

264
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Once you accept it, you have no choice but to do it. If you don't help ➡

265
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Get out of here. You should just send it to a different hospital!

266
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
If you make a mistake in a situation like this... (Ayumi) My adrenaline is ready. ➡

267
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's replaced. Even the patients ➡

268
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm not asking for this. This is just arrogant!

269
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I've almost died once.

270
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So if there's a patient looking for help ➡

271
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You can never abandon it!

272
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Stop it. (Ayumu) ​​Yes.

273
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound)

274
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
(Electrocardiograph sound)

275
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
(Ayumu) ​​My heartbeat has returned!

276
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
(Kayoko) Teacher! The ambulance has arrived.

277
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
learn.

278
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
(Ayumu) ​​Yakushiji-sensei, what do you do?

279
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Let the patient get out of the hallway, where they are in a calm state.

280
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
(Daikoku) Sorry I'll pass the stretcher!

281
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Daikoku Sensei, what on earth did it? (Daikoku) Emergency

282
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's full of critically ill patients and it's a tough situation.

283
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
(Fudo) That's difficult! (Daikoku) Excuse me!

284
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
(Unmoving) Oh!

285
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
(Among) There's no problem.

286
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
(Bonten) Shall we start finishing the game soon?

287
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
(Kongou) I understand.

288
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,660
(Bonten) A sin. (Nurse) Yes.

291
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I will never refuse to accept it.

When deciding on a destination,

293
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000

298
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I can't take my hands off yet. Leave the oxygen fully open.

I'll respond with Ambu and I'll be there right away. (Kichijoji) Yes!

Bowes, please. I'll be looking at a patient in the hallway.

333
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
The patients in the hallway are fine now.

334
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You should concentrate on this patient. I'll do something else.

336
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Resident Please place an A-line in a patient with heart failure.

337
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I will stop the trauma. Understood .

338
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000

(Intercom)

340
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Everyone will accept it. I'll definitely help every patient.

(Everyone) Yes!

342
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Ah... It seems like when I look at the patients, I can't leave them alone. ➡

343
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Is it about life-emissions? Woooo...

Please wait a little longer. ⚟ (Knock)

347

Haa... It looks like he's finally back.

348
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
(Ago) Bo... Bonten-sensei, you were the operation, right?

349
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
My operations always end as planned.

350
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Is there no Professor Tamon?

351
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Ah... I think it's coming soon.

352
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Now, I'll give a presentation instead.

353
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Welcome Mr. Fink.

354
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
(Tamon) Two more patients will arrive. (Everyone) Yes!

355
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
(Tamon) Ichikawa-san, take care of your breathing control.

356
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
(Sanae) I understand. (Tamon) Murata stopped the bleeding ➡

357
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Transferred to plastic surgery. (Kayoko) Yes.

358
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Kawada-san: CT preparation. Yoshida-san, put in the line and prepare for the ultrasound.

359
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
(Ayumu) ​​Yes.

360
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It's quiet...

361
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
"Even though there are so many patients, it's quiet."

362
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
(Tamon) Sayama-san: I'm bleeding very badly. It might be an emergency operation.

363
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
This one will be over in 40 seconds. I'll stop the bleeding.

364
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
"This calm atmosphere is ➡

365
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Maybe it's because there are two people.

366
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
(Daikoku) Is it okay? There must have been an important customer.

367
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
(Tamon) No, I'm just trying to help patients now.

368
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Let's focus. (Daikoku) Yes.

369
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Haa... what if Bonten-sensei didn't come ➡

370
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
What happened? I'm grateful.

371
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
home . If you're OK ➡

372
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Shall I come and visit us tomorrow's dinner with Fink?

373
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Oh, what does it mean?

374
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
My operations always end as planned.

375
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
If it were Bonten-sensei, he would do like someone else ➡

376
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
There's no need to embarrass the chairman.

377
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Maybe the real reason you came here?

378
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
You're ambitious. I don't dislike that kind of thing.

379
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Think about it. (Bonten) Thank you.

380
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
(Daikoku) It's finally settled down. (Tamon) Maybe it'll come again. ➡

381
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Please rest now. (Daikoku) Yes.

382
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I can't move anymore...

383
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
⚟Chiba? It came from a very far away.

384
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
(A paramedics) It's faster to come here than to be rejected by multiple people.

385
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
yes . Please come anytime. (A paramedics) So.

386
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
(A paramedic) Even though I came, Professor Bonten wasn't there.

387
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
(A paramedics) That's right. I thought he was actually in charge of saving lives.

388
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
wait a minute . What does that mean?

389
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
⚟ (Knock)

390
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
please .

391
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I heard it from the chairman. In my place ➡

392
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Apparently they responded to Fink. thank you .

393
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
No, I've done what I meant as a friend.

394
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
No, I'm really grateful. Well then.

395
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Actually, I have something to talk about too.

396
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
story?

397
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I had heard about the crisis of saving my life earlier, but I couldn't stand up. ➡

398
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Did you go to help?

399
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
No, I just had the responsibility as the head of the medical department.

400
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Is that really all?

401
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Isn't the blood of life-saving?

402
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
(Tamon) I'm just trying to avoid trouble...

403
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Don't you really want to save your life with your own hands?

404
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I want you to do the new hospital case for me instead.

405
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
ask! I want to be your strength.

406
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
⚟It seems that he bowed his head to the emergency team in this way.

407
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I heard everything from the emergency team just now.

408
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
They were trying to flood patients with lifesaving and get them flat.

409
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
(Bonten) What are you talking about, don't give me any strange comments!

410
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
come .

yes . (Mobile phone) (Ago) Professor Tamon. ➡

413
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Fink collapsed in the hotel!

414
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Is Fink? (Mobile phone) (Operating sound)

415
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
(Mobile phone) I sent him to the ambulance. He's someone important to us. ➡

416
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Definitely help! (Mobile phone) (Currency sounds)

417
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
It's a hellish scene. Come with me.

419

Hmm? Hmm! ? ⚟ (Emergency personnel) Blood pressure of 84 and 56...

420
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:20,610
(Daikoku) Even though he hasn't received the request... Hmm?

421
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:28,110
(Daikoku) Oh, Anno, what's wrong? (A paramedic) Turn back.

422
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:31,110
(Daikoku) Steve Fink! ? Okay, take the line quickly.

423
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,110
Echo preparation. Ah... yes.

424
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:44,110
There's something in the heart.

425
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:48,110
this is… . (Tamon) What do you think?

426
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:51,110
Take a contrast CT scan. (Daikoku) I'll prepare.

427
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:55,110
(Bonten) "That's bad... It's going to be a hassle

428
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:03,110
A malignant heart tumor?

429
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:05,110
If the right ventricular outflow tract is blocked, you will die.

430
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,110
It's a dangerous situation.

431
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,110
(Bonten) {If I run and save Fink ➡

432
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:12,110
The position of the director is suddenly confirmed. ➡

{However, malignant heart tumor operation is very difficult and has a poor prognosis}➡

"I'm sorry I'm going to die and blame you on me."

435
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:23,110
I'll do the operation right away.

436
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:28,110
Wait! Even if this disease is removed surgically ➡

437
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:31,110
The recurrence rate is high. Carbon beam therapy etc. ➡

438
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:34,110
Other methods should be considered. I don't have time like that ➡

439
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:38,110
You can see it. I'm a cardiologist!

440
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:42,110
Don't say anything that the life doctor understands!

441
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:56,110
You just don't want surgery, right?

442
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:02,110
If you die during the surgery, it will become a big problem. ➡

443
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:08,110
The hospital's reputation is falling apart. The new hospital will no longer be realized.

444
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,110
That has nothing to do with the patient!

The only person who can help him is the teacher.

( Kongo ) What? (Bonten) Noisy Noisy!

498
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:51,110
It's noisy! Haa haa haa...

499
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:05,110
( Kongo ) Ashura... why are you?

500
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:08,110
This hellish scene I will take on.

501
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:11,110
Don't be fooled! Don't come in without permission!

502
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:15,110
That's what you did to yourself first, right?

503
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:18,110
Of course, patients cling to your fame.

504
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:22,110
How about you using your patients for your fame?

505
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:25,110
Haa... I guess you understand. ➡

506
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:28,110
My father is the former president of the Medical Association➡

507
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:33,110
His two older brothers are a member of the Diet and a professor at the Faculty of Medicine at Tooh University.

508
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:37,110
It rose as I endured the pressure of hellishness!

509
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:41,110
I've been a chaotic situation ever since I was born.

510
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,110
Every day is at stake!

511
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:49,110
I don't know at all. You risk your life to protect yourself.

512
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:51,110
What I'm interested in is...

513
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:57,110
Only the life of the patient in front of me.

514
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:03,110
Start the surgery. Give me a female. (Nurse) Yes.

515
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,110
Electric female. (Nurse) Yes.

516
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:16,110
Sternum Soh. (Nurse) Yes.

517
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:22,110
A chest opening. (Nurse) Yes.

518
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:29,110
(Ago) Dr. Anno says he has had a heart tumor operation ➡

519
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:33,110
Have you ever done it? (Tamon) Probably not.

520
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:36,110
However, Anno is a life-saving doctor.

521
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:40,110
The best way to deal with this is for the patient.

522
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:44,110
Damn... I can't believe Anno will be running the surge.

523
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:52,110
Presia starts. ⚟Yes.

524
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:58,110
Confirmation of cardiac arrest: Remove the tumor.

525
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:00,110
(Kongou) What are you talking about? It's so big. ➡

526
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:03,110
Moreover, it infiltrates the pulmonary artery. It's ridiculous to cut everything out.

527
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,110
Please give me a sir and metzen. (Kongou) Hey!

528
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:15,110
(Kongou) What will you do if it can no longer be rebuilt?

529
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:17,110
It's just the last time I can maintain my heart function.

530
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:20,110
The main pulmonary artery to be partially removed is followed by an artificial blood vessel.

531
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:24,110
You too can help. (Kongou) Ah, yes.

532
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:27,110
If you're interested, why not come over here and check it out?

533
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:29,110
Are you making fun of me? If it's better than me ➡

534
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:34,110
It's fine to replace it though. It's truly lifesaving.

535
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:38,110
I'm used to seeing a patient's death and not afraid.

536
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,110
So I don't care if it's a high-risk operation.

537
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:43,110
There's no way it's not scary.

538
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:50,110
Still, I have to do it.

539
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:54,110
I'm scared to live my life regretting what I didn't do.

540
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:00,110
(Nurse) Please.

541
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:02,110
3-0 Proline. (Nurse) Yes.

542
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:14,110
(Kongou) Fast...

543
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:34,110
♬～

544
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:39,110
♬～

545
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:41,110
Mayo. (Nurse) Yes.

546
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:48,110
Suture completed. I'm going to leave the cardiopulmonary machine. (Engineer) Yes.

547
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:50,110
Removing the aortic blockage.

548
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:53,110
Flow down. (Engineer) Yes.

549
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,110
Backup. (Engineer) Yes.

550
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,110
Hot shot. (Engineer) Yes.

551
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:11,110
(Electrocardiograph sound)

552
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:14,110
(Kungo) Okay, the beat has returned.

553
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:21,110
(Electrocardiograph warning sound)

554
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:23,110
ＶＦ ！？

555
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,110
(Kongo) Isn't there some bleeding?

556
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:28,110
No, I'm not bleeding. (Kongou) There are still some tumor fragments.

557
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:31,110
It might be stuck. Anyway, hurry up DC.

558
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:43,110
(Electrocardiograph warning sound)

559
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:45,110
Professor Anno. ➡

560
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:49,110
Check with an ultrasound. The patient is probably...

561
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,110
Atrial septal defect.

562
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:58,110
(Kongo) That's true... But did he have no symptoms during the preoperative examination?

563
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:01,110
(Bonten) Congenitally between the right and left atrium.

564
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:04,110
There must have been a hole. Even if it doesn't interfere with everyday life ➡

565
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:08,110
It was a huge burden to leave. Before surgery, it is hidden by the tumor.

566
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:12,110
The hole was not visible due to the echo. You need to closure right now.

567
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:15,110
It will block the aorta. hang on!

568
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:22,110
You're scared, aren't you?

569
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,110
I will do the surgery.

570
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:28,110
Flow down. (Engineer) Yes.

571
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,110
Backup. (Engineer) Yes.

572
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:38,110
you . Bring me a new gown and gloves.

573
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:41,110
(Nurse) Yes. What are you planning?

574
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:50,110
Professor Anno should return to his place.

575
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:59,110
From now on, this is my hellish place.

576
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:12,110
So don't hesitate.

577
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:24,110
♬～

578
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:26,110
(Bonten) Open the right atrium and close the patch.

579
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:29,110
Prepare an artificial pericardium.

580
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:41,110
As expected of Ashura.

581
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:53,110

582
00:40:56,110 --> 00:41:00,110
(Bonten) Haa haa haa...

583
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:03,110
Wooo...

584
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:17,110
He really did well. thank you .

585
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:25,110
It's your fault.

586
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:31,110
You may have thought I was a friend though.

587
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:35,110
I was different. ➡

588
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:38,110
Since I was in college, always ➡

589
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:42,110
I couldn't forgive you for going in front of me. ➡

590
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:47,110
No matter how hard I try, I can't win...➡

591
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:49,110
I was jealous.

592
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,110
I wasn't interested in getting promoted from the beginning.

593
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:58,110
If I could drive you out of here and win ➡

594
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:03,110
I thought I could become 99% to 100% of people.

595
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:10,110
But it seems that it was different.

596
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:19,110
(Bonten) The 1% that I lack is ➡

597
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:22,110
It was about abandoning self-preservation.

598
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:30,110
Thanks to Ashura, I was made to realize it.

599
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:35,110
Please tell me your thank you.

600
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:51,110
Thank you for your hard work, Professor Anno.

601
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:54,110
It's really amazing that they're even doing cardiac tumor operations!

602
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:59,110
Anno-sensei is much more god-hand than Bonten-sensei.

603
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:05,110
"I've almost died once."

604
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:14,110
gentlemen. what?

605
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:18,110
That's what happened just now...

606
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:22,110
He's almost dying once.

608
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:43,110

(Intercom)

610
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:49,110
yes .

611
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:51,110
I understand, bring it with me.

612
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:57,110
Bowes, I'm going. Ah... Yes!

613
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:01,110
[What happened to Professor Anno in the past]

614
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:06,110
[I couldn't listen at this time]

615
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:09,110
[But that's what it is➡

616
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:14,110
Professor Anno is in a hellish scene called "lifesaving life" ➡

617
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:16,110
That was the reason to fight.
