(Hello) Haa...

(Ayumu) ​​Do you hate the emergency department's duty that much?

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
After all, it's impossible for a trainee to be on duty from the first day.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
No one's heart is coming, right?

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
(Ayumu) ​​It's okay. We don't take seriously ill patients.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
If you find it difficult for cardiac arrest or other people, then go to another hospital.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Is that really okay to do that? Because it's the director's instructions.

The damaged area is removed and reconstructive anastomosis with an artificial blood vessel.

00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Professor Anno ➡

178
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
If you do your own mimicry next, you will be dismissed. ➡

179
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Daikoku Emergency Department Chief was demoted to Hira due to lack of leadership.

180
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Demoted! ? No, that's all...

181
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You have a clear chance. Isn't it good?

182
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Is that all you need to talk about?

183
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Well then.

184
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
(Daikoku) I'm sorry. ➡

185
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'll say this a lot later.

186
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
(Stay) Please. ➡

187
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The emergency department is already in the red, and it's a burden for our hospital.

188
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Please do not cause any more unnecessary troubles.

189
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I understand!

190
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Disciplinary dismissal! ? That means headings, right?

191
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Isn't it just a threat? I hope it's (Kayoko).

192
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
(Sanae) I wonder why the director is so keen on emergency departments.

193
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
(Kayoko) Of course, it's to return to Tooh University.

194
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
What does it mean?

195
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
(Kayoko) Last year he lost in the professorial election and was kicked out of Tokyo University.

196
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't want to cause unnecessary trouble to go back.

197
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
If you accept critically ill patients, the higher the risk of making mistakes.

198
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
(Kayoko) And the other thing is my deficit.

199
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
(Ayumu) ​​Ah, Ogura-san will be handed over to surgery.

200
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm going too. (Kayoko) Please come.

201
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'll move to surgery and see the progress.

202
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm not in the emergency room forever.

203
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The role of the emergency department is initial response, so ➡

204
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Once you've settled down, you'll move to a specialized subject.

205
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Wow.

206
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,666
It's Anno. It's Anno. I have to do something about Anno...

207
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:18,000
(Kongou) Hey! Dr. Daikoku. (Okoku) Ah, Kongo-sensei. ➡

208
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Thank you for your hard work. (Kongou) Thank you for your hard work.

209
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
No, it's not.

210
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Um, I was taken to the emergency department yesterday. ➡

211
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
All of them have been decided to be accepted through surgery.

212
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
thank you . (Kongou) You're welcome.

213
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
No, it's not. Not at all.

214
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
This is full of patients I have now.

215
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I hope that the number of patients does not increase any more.

216
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,666
sorry .

217
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,333
Yeah . If you apologise, it's fine.

218
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:48,000
No, it's not. different .

219
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
They accept it without taking care of it until the very end and then go anywhere else.

220
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm jealous of the easy job.

221
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I also want to move to the emergency department... No, no.

222
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
(Kongou) That's not the case. That's not the case.

223
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
My name is Kongo, the head of surgery.

224
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Mr. Ogura will be treated responsibly in the surgery, so ➡

225
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Don't worry. (Sae) Thank you very much...

226
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
(Hina) Mama!

227
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Hina... (Hina) I wanted to meet.

228
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Sae! That's good!

229
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Teacher: Thank you for helping my daughter.

230
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
How can I thank you?

231
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
No, he's done what is only natural as a doctor.

232
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Thank you very much. (Hina) Thank you, Teacher.

233
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Please don't care. No, it's not. you're welcome .

234
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I can't accept it.

235
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It was the emergency department that saved Ogura-san ➡

236
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Why are surgery so grateful?

237
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Well, that's because emergency departments always do.

238
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
In the end, someone else will have it. ➡

239
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's not rewarding, right?

240
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
(Fudo) Regarding the establishment of International Taishaku Hospital ➡

241
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The prospect of receiving a loan is very strict ➡

242
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
There is no prospect of opening the hospital.

243
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Chairman: Why is there no loan?

244
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
There is no doubt that the emergency department will produce a yearly deficit of 300 million yen. ➡

245
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
To realize the new hospital, which is the chairman's long-cherished wish, ➡

246
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
The only way to close the emergency department is to close. (Daikoku) Closed! ?

247
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Director, wait! (Kongou) Hehehe...

248
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
(Fudo) Chairman: What do you think?

249
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
In fact, it's calling my trump card.

250
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
trump?

251
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Please come in.

252
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
(Fudo) Chairman: What is this...?

253
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
(Ago) He is Professor Tamon Makoto. Former emergency department head. ➡

254
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I've been involved in overseas medical services for the past few years.

255
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
He returned as vice-president and medical director.

256
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Vice Director! ? (Daikoku) Medical Department Director! ?

257
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
(Ago) I'd like to ask Professor Tamon, Director Fudo.

258
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I got it .

259
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Director, I look forward to working with you in the future.

260
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
nice to meet you .

261
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
(Kayoko) What? Tamon-sensei is back! ?

262
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
(Sanae) And she is the vice director. It's surprising, isn't it?

263
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
(Kayoko) That's good, Professor Anno.

264
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
This will ensure that the emergency department is safe.

265
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Maybe that's true.

266
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Are you such an amazing person? (Kayoko) Yes, Professor Anno's teacher. ➡

267
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I think Ashura-sensei is also relieved.

268
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Huh? (Kayoko) While Professor Tamon is away ➡

269
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I've been working hard on my own forever.

270
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
(Tamon) "Ashura is the god of battle and the god of guardianship" ➡

271
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
"It's sure to protect the emergency department."

272
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:36,000
"When we get back, we'll work together to change the lifesaving of Japan."

273
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
"yes"

274
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
{Then see you later}

275
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
(The sound of a car door closing)

276
00:18:49,000 --> 00:19:09,000
♬～

277
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
We bring together the best doctors and provide cutting-edge medical care.

278
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
We bring together VIP patients from all over the world. It's probably not that easy.

279
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Still, the International Taishaku Hospital is

280
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
No matter what, it will definitely be realized.

281
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Tamon-sensei, please. (Tamon) We will meet your expectations.

282
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
However, the promise in this article is... (Ago) Of course.

283
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
(Amo) I am the one who absolutely keeps my promises.

284
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
thank you .

285
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I wonder if I'll be on duty with Anno-sensei again today...

286
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
(Daikoku) Is it okay? Don't cause any problems tonight!

287
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
This person should be raised to Noread 8.

288
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Check the blood pressure after 15 minutes and decide the flow rate again.

289
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
(Sanae) I understand. (Daikoku) Hey, listen!

290
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
what? Do you understand the importance of your matter?

291
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Isn't it the head?

292
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
If I was demoted because of you, I'm over...

293
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
(Daikoku) Listen!

294
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,666
come .

295
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,000
(Intercom) (Okoku) Hey wait!

296
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
yes . (Intercom) (Kichijoji) Woman in her 40s. ➡

297
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
He lost consciousness on the street and is currently undergoing cardiac arrest. Please accept it.

298
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
learn.

299
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It cannot be accepted. Please turn it somewhere else.

300
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Are you abandoning the patient again?

301
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
That's the director's instructions. You just don't want to be demoted.

302
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
For patient safety! At our house ➡

303
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
There's no manpower to accommodate critically ill patients!

304
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
If I were alone, that would be fine.

305
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
What would you do if you make a mistake?

306
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It will be the responsibility of the entire emergency department.

307
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
The patient is wandering through a hellish scene. That has nothing to do with it!

308
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Bring me now.

309
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Prepare a Bowes Echo and Resuscitation Set. Ah... Yes!

310
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Do whatever you want!

311
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
(Daikoku) Haa... Go!

312
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
(Kayoko) Also, Dr. Ashura accepted a critically ill patient.

313
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
(Okoku) It's no longer in my hands.

314
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It looks like he's watching the old Daikoku Sensei.

315
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Huh? (Kayoko) Thank you for your hard work.

316
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
(Fudo) Professor If you are having trouble with research funds➡

317
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Please tell me anytime. It will help you.

318
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,666
(Professor) What is this?

319
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:04,000
It's a small gift. Please enjoy it.

320
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
By the way, about the example.

321
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I would love to return to Tooh University ➡

322
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I would appreciate your support from the professor.

323
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
(Professor) Hmm... I hope it's a worthy achievement.

324
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I understand.

325
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I will definitely make the new hospital a reality with my own strength ➡

326
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
We'll take a look with a track record of impeccable achievements.

327
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
That being said, rumors say they are having trouble raising funds.

328
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Don't worry .

329
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
If we close the emergency department, everything will be resolved.

330
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,666
(Professor) However, the chairman of the board member ➡

331
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:46,000
Apparently they called back the former head of the emergency department. ➡

332
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You don't want to shut down the lifesavings, right?

333
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
tired .

334
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,666
(Mobile phone) Already...!

335
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:03,000
(Tanaka) Don't get close, come on! ➡

336
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
You like me...!

337
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Please calm down a bit! (Tanaka) Let it go!

338
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,666
Please calm down! (Tanaka) Looks tasty!

339
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:16,000
It hurts!

340
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
(Tanaka snoring)

341
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Ah, it hurts! (Ayumu) ​​Ah, sorry.

342
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I should have driven him back to being drunk.

343
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Since I've come here, I'm just a patient.

344
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000

Ah, oh, you're not a beautiful teacher. Can I kiss?

It's a problem with the treatment! Please leave!

369
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,666
Dr. Anno: There's no need for an endoscope to stop arterial hemostasis...

370

Typical liver cirrhosis symptoms. Due to increased portal vein pressure ➡

377
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
It's easy to imagine that there are varicose veins.

378
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It can also burst.

379
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Maybe you were checking out just now?

380
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
(Ayumi) Dr. I have prepared an endoscope. Leave it there.

Ah, what should I do? Both are insane.

Bowess Buy time with that drunk SB tube.

389
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I can stop the bleeding.

390
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Bouz? (Ayumu) ​​Have you ever done it?

391
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Before I came here, I trained with my digestive system.

392
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Please give me the camera!

393
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000

Yay! Pean.

408

(Sanae) Yes. Dr. Anno, I was able to stop the bleeding!

409
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
What! ?

410
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Why! ?

411
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Maybe the ring was taken! ? (Ayumu) ​​My blood pressure is dropping!

412
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It's fine! Evacuate at SB.

413
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
No, next time I'll stop it properly!

414
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Quick... quick, quick!

415
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Fast, fast...

416

gentlemen.

423
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
It's impossible for Bowes to do anything more.

424
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
can! Please give me another chance!

425
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000

It's not off.

428

Is it deeper?

(Electrocardiograph warning sound)

430
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Is it a stomach?

431
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
There was nothing earlier.

432
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I saw it.

433
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Why! ? I wasn't bleeding earlier!

434
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
If you stop the bleeding on the top, pressure will be applied to the bottom.

435
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Different areas cause bleeding.

436
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000

There is no other place that is likely to cause bleeding. Now I'll see what happens.

443
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Carry it to the ICU. (Ayumu) ​​Yes.

444
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Sorry.

445
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I'm worried that I can stop bleeding in one place.

446

What you see is no longer visible.

You are not qualified to stand in a hellish situation yet.

Wow, that was difficult.

457
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I was totally useless.

458
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
It's a bother to everyone.

459

Yeah . Do that.

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
My grandson is still inside! What! ?

522
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
(Yoko) The reinforced bars stuck in and I couldn't move...

523
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Please help Hina!

524
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,333
Bowes, I'm going. yes .

525
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:59,666
(Kichijoji) No good! There is a risk of a re-collapse inside, and it is dangerous.

526
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:02,000
The patient's condition may be argued for a moment.

527
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
(Kichijoji) These are instructions from the headquarters. I can't put it inside.

528
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
That's right, Teacher. Follow the instructions of the fire department.

529
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
The patient is wandering through a hellish scene.

530
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I can't abandon my life.

531
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Go ahead. teacher!

532
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Sorry....

533
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
(The members) Are you okay? OK? ➡

534
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
there was! Please urgently!

535
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,666
(Member) It's dangerous! Go outside!

536
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:40,000
What about the patient?

537
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,666
(Member) Hey!

538
00:37:41,666 --> 00:37:45,000
Hina-chan! Hina-chan!

539
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Do you understand?

540
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I'm in cardiac arrest. What is the situation in the rescue?

541
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
(Member) Reinforced bars penetrate the abdomen and cannot be moved. ➡

542
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,666
Now we will remove the debris and transport the reinforced bars outside.

543
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:56,666
hang on . Huh?

544
00:37:56,666 --> 00:38:00,000
First, open your chest and stop the bleeding and make your heart go awry. Opening your chest?

545
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
If you don't run away quickly, it's dangerous!

546
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
It's better to think of ways to do something about reinforcement.

547
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
It won't help unless you resume your heartbeat as quickly as possible.

548
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Don't open your chest and just massage your heart like this.

549
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
If you do not stop bleeding, you will experience heavy bleeding after the heartbeat resumes.

550
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Finish in just one minute. Take the route and open the IV drip.

551
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000

(Member) Are you okay? it's okay .

555
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
The aorta is blocked and the bleeding is stopped. Ventilation and adrenaline.

556
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000

577
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000

Can't get insulin injection for a long time ➡

586
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Ketoacidosis caused hyperkalemia and cardiac arrest.

587
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
It's broken. What! ?

588

I need to do some urgent operation, so I took it to my hospital.

610

Teacher but why?

613
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Did you know that Hina-chan had keto acidosis?

614
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Smell.

615
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Thanks to the temporary resumption of breathing, I noticed the ketone smell from my exhaled breath.

616
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I never thought I'd notice the smell in such a situation...

617

Ah but ➡

618
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000

(Male) What if I went to visit my father?

620
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
That child's mother asked me to.

That's right.

624

The female doctor has now paid back her father's debts.

625
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
It's a little.

Do you need to go? Why?

634
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Because what really helped Hina-chan was

635
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Isn't it Anno-sensei? But...

636
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I didn't help him to be grateful.

637
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
But the teacher is doing his best ➡

638
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I saved him even though I was almost dying!

639

It's fine to get paid off a little bit.

That child's life was saved.

641

Other than that, you don't need it.

643
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Huh? What's wrong? At this time.

00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,000

It's not. Huh?

It's really encouraging that the teacher will come.

699
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Leave it all to me.

700
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Naomi You'll come to Taishaku too.

701
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Dr. Bonten and I hope they join the surgery together.

702
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
What on earth are you plotting?

703
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I'm just...

704
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I just want to save as many patients as possible.

705
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,000
It would be a shame that there is a doctor who is as skilled as you in the emergency department.

706
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
As a surgeon, I save patients.

707
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I'm not interested in surgery. I have a lifesaving.

708
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I'm back to make the new hospital come true.

709
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
The emergency department that cannot be profitable for this reason➡

710
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
It will close soon.

711
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I'm going to kill my life.
