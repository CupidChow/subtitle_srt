1
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,000
(Shura) Adrenaline was administered. (Hand) Yes.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Check the waveform. (Electrocardiograph warning sound)

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Bowes DC preparation. yes!

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm shocked. Get away.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
(Defibrillator sound)

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound)

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
(Electrocardiograph sound)

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Heartbeat resumes! There is a decline in blood pressure.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Blood transfusions and noradrenaline are added. (Ayumu) ​​Yes.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I've raised my arms, Yakushiji-sensei.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
《Bows has finally graduated...》

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Prepare to intubate!

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It hurts!

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What is it...?

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But it was a great dream...

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
(Kongou) It's like a dream! Really, I'm

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Can you become the head of the medical department? ?

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Can you please?

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Of course! Leave it to this Kongo Matayoshi.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
thank you .

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This will allow you to work together with emergency departments and other medical departments.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Please wait a minute. For the new hospital ➡

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Wasn't the emergency department that is in the red closed?

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I got a call from Fink the other day.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
On the condition that emergency department is left behind ➡

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
They will now support the new hospital.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Bonten-sensei says that Anno saved Fink.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Thanks to you for letting me know honestly.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The emergency department's deficit is an undeniable fact.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Even if it doesn't close, I think it should be reduced.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
No, it's the opposite.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
vice versa ! ? (Tamon) Yes, life saving ➡

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
If you don't refuse to accept any patient, you'll save everything.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
This will support the overall hospital profit.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What does it mean?

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
If lifesaving accepts all patients and saves them ➡

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The patient will be able to receive treatment from other departments.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This will lead to increased revenue for the entire hospital.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Certainly a nice idea!

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
No, it's not it! In other words, we will be offering emergency department patients in the future.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Does this mean we will take on more than ever?

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I agree . ( Kongo) No, but that's...

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This is a job that only Kongo-sensei can do.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Huh? (Tamon) Please save your life➡

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Please lend us your help from Professor Kongo.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
(Tamon) What... what are you trying to do?

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Finally, I am also the head of the medical department.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Leave it to me to work only I can do!

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
If we continue like this, Taishaku will be...➡

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
No, on the other hand! I might become the director of the new hospital!

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
To that end, Director Mottamon's expectations➡

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You have to respond well!

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Tamon Comeon! Hahaha...!

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
(Bonten) Today's watch was also difficult.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm getting used to this busyness, but it's still tiring.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
(Everyone) Thank you for your hard work. Thank you for your hard work.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Good morning everyone. (Everyone) Good morning.

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Please listen a bit. I just received an order from the director.

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
From today I will be returning to the head of the emergency department.

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Oh. What? Is it true?

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
After all, the head of the emergency department must be Dr. Daikoku.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Right. congratulations .

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
thank you . I'm looking forward to Yakushiji Temple too.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Hope...?

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes, I'll do my best. (Daikoku) Oh.

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So, Chief News, we're sorry.

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000

(Daikoku) Oh, Anno Good morning!

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Wow.

74

It'll come in 10 minutes. yes!

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It was made out of a dream... Let's do it.

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Can you say your name? I'll touch it.

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound) Saturation 85...

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound) Intubate.

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Wait, Bows. Have you checked your pneumothorax?

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Huh? If the patient experiences tension pneumothorax ➡

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
If you are intubating and ventilating positive pressure ➡

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Cardiac arrest. I should have said it before though.

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Sorry! I forgot. I'll auscultate right away.

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
(Daikoku) It doesn't seem like he's having pneumothorax. I'll intubate.

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
yes . (Electrocardiograph warning sound)

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's cardiac arrest. Hurry DC. Adrenaline preparation.

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
yes!

92
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Huh?

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
(Daikoku) Hurry. yes!

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
(Daikoku) Away. (Ayumu) ​​Yes.

95
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000

96
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Adrenaline quickly. yes!

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Adrenaline. Umm, adrenaline...

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound) (Ayumu) ​​Adrenaline is administered.

99
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:03,000
(Electrocardiograph warning sound)

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
(Electrocardiograph sound)

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Heartbeat resumes! My blood pressure is low. Blood transfusions and norad started.

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Understood!

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Sorry! I'll put it back straight away.

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Sorry....

105
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:37,000
♬～

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
(Kayoko) I'm glad that the surgery responded immediately.

107
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
(Daikoku) But today he accepted it very quickly.

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
(Sanae) That's true. Is there something behind it?

109
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Maybe Kongo-sensei will also say something he dislikes.

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Ha! (Kongou) Hi.

111
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Kongo Sensei! (Kongou) Hello everyone.

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Have you changed? (Kayoko) What if they were to hear rumors?

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
yes . ( Kongo) "If you make rumors"

114
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I can hear it. (Daikoku) Why did you go to the emergency department?

115
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
No, it just happened to pass by so I just showed my face a little.

116
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Is it okay for the surgical director to sell oil somewhere like this?

117
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Surgery chief? Sell ​​oil.

118
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Oil, it's oil.

119
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
(Okoku and the others) Head of the medical department! ? (Kongou) Yes.

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Director Tamon asked me directly.

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Why was Professor Kongo...?

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
There are other better people out there. (Kongou) I can hear it.

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
That's how it means that I was trusted by Director Tamon.

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
From now on, as the head of the medical department, I will become a bridge between surgery and emergency department.

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Emergency... Just a few times...!

126
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We will provide full support to all emergency departments.

127
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Is it true? (Daikoku) Maybe he's plotting something.

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
That's why I can hear it. We are from the same hospital.

129
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Please let me know whenever you have any problems.

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I can hear it!

131
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I haven't said anything. (Sanae) You haven't said that.

132
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
(Ayumu) ​​Ah, I'm tired.

133
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Right, are you dented? Not particularly.

134
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The patients were saved, so it was good.

135
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Thanks to everyone, not me.

136
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Ah, I ended up being

137
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
He's still a thrust-wearing bow.

138
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Haa...

139
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Come to think of it, did you not say you have a promise today?

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Ah! it was . It's insane!

141
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yakushiji-sensei, was he so dented?

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
(Ayumu) ​​Yes, he's holding everyone's legs.

143
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
(Kayoko) There are so many amazing teachers around him ➡

144
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Maybe you think that's even more. (Naomi) I'm a resident. ➡

145
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Of course it's not possible. I don't want perfection.

146
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
(Ayumu) ​​That's right, I'm thinking a little too much.

147
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I can't help but think I'll comfort you.

148
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Ah, I went home just now. ➡

149
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Apparently he's going to meet his childhood friend. (Naomi) What is it? I'm not fine.

150
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I was worried and lost.

151
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Where is it...?

152
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Wow, Keita, it's been a while. Yasu It's been a while.

162
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I wanted to surprise you.

163
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Sorry, can I order it?

164
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
yes .

165
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Sorry. I said I wanted to meet Yakushiji-san.

166
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
To me? Keita is always a proud best friend.

167
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Because I said that. (Keito) Sorry, there are two of these.

168
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
(Keito) Yes. Hmm...

169
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Hoshi is fine with beer, right? Ah, yes, thank you.

170
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
(Keito) Then it's just one live thing. (Shop clerk) Yes.

171
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
(Horse and his friends laugh)

172
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
(Keita) Do you remember Hohachi no Hitsu Park? Wow, it reminds me of it.

173
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's nostalgic, isn't it? There was a Beehive Park near us...

174
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's fine about my story. Keito What's going on lately?

175
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
That's what I was entrusted with starting an overseas branch ➡

176
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's getting tough right now. Yesterday, it was the first time in half a month ➡

177
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
When I returned to Japan. Overseas branch?

178
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
(Keito) That's right. My boss is really terrible.

179
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I was thrown into the area on my own without knowing anything.

180
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's not possible anymore! I used to scream this on the phone a lot.

181
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yeah . ➡

182
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I don't really understand the language and have no sense of the area.

183
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'd like to jump in and start selling in Japan.

184
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
He was chased by security guards. Haha, it was a lot of trouble ➡

185
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Well, after struggling for six months, I think it's finally starting to take shape.

186
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,000
amazing . I'm just a resident.

187
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
{Bows blood transfusion} {Huh}

188
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
《Bows, stop bleeding quickly》 《I can't do it!》 》

189
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
《Bows can't do anything more》

190
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
《Bows cannot satisfy treatment alone➡

191
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's 100 years earlier that I'm worried! 》

192
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
(Keito) Hehe... what do you do when comparing a doctor to a office worker?

193
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
(Keito) Hehe. (Mobile phone) (Vibrator sound)

194
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's from the president. Huh? oh .

195
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Hey, why did Yasu-kun become a doctor?

196
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Huh? Because I take care of someone's lives ➡

197
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It was a tough job, but I still wanted to do it. I wonder why.

198
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Ah... not a big reason.

199
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
My parents are doctors so somehow...

200
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's amazing that I somehow managed to get used to it.

201
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Well, as a doctor, I'm not at all.

202
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
(Keito) Sorry, sorry.

203
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Oh, what were you talking about? Not particularly.

204
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Huh? What is that? (Akane) Secret.

205
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
(Keito) What? Because it's not a big deal.

206
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
(Keito) Huh?

207
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
(Keito) Is that where you really want to put it? perfection .

208
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
(Keito) Can I do it? Ah, it looks a little better.

209
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Thank you...

210
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Get serious. (Keito) Huh? Are you going to get serious?

211
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's here It's here. (Keito) It's here.

212
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
(Keito) A little... can I go? (Akane) Please. ➡

213
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
please . Right. Ah.

214
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
(Keito) Oh, it's in! Yeeee!

215
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Have you in? It's in.

216
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Over here? Over there? Over there...

217
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Can you go over there? It's not obvious. ➡

218
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I see. Is this or this?

219
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Oh, amazing! (Keita) Amazing!

220
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
(Akane) I'm getting better. (Keito) Hey, I've gotten better.

221
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yes, treat. Ah thank you.

222
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Good luck.

223
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
what happened? No, the plane on the way home was small.

224
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I was about to stuff up haha...

225
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Akane-san, you're such a nice person.

226
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I have to try harder too.

227
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm rooting for you.

228
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Thank you.

229
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Preservation. Yeah?

230
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It seems like it's difficult to do work that takes care of people's lives ➡

231
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm rooting for you.

232
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yes, thank you.

233
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Or rather, that's the one I mentioned earlier. I see.

234
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Yeah . (2 people) Hahaha...

235
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
(Akane) Hey, I'll do it soon. (Keito) So, shall we do it?

236
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Alright. (Akane) I've gotten quite good.

237
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
(Keito) Hey, he was throwing a lot.

238
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
good morning .

239
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
good morning . On duty, thank you for your hard work.

240
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Was it fun yesterday? It's been a while since I last visited work ➡

241
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's forgotten. I've been something until now➡

242
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Maybe I was thinking too much about it.

243
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
yes . It's important to take a good breather for a good job.

244
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Yes, I'll do my best again from today!

245
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
(Naomi) But in the first place you're a resident.➡

246
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's fine just fine. Huh?

247
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
(Naomi) It's no use even if you're too tense and spin it without it.

248
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
yes .

249
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Professor Anno Please prepare for the operation.

250
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Understood, I'll go straight away.

251
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'll go home too, please come and see. yes .

252
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Then I'll go see him.

253
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
(Daikoku) It's a little cold. (Kobayashi) Yes...

254
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Ah, it hurts, it hurts... Ah, ah...

255
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Kobayashi-san When did my stomach hurt...

256
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
That's fine, just fix it quickly!

257
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Sorry. (Daikoku) The cause is gallstones.

258
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
(Kobayashi) Gallstones? (Daikoku) Use painkillers.

259
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
please . (mobile phone)

260
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
(Daikoku) Sorry. (mobile phone)

261
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
(Daikoku) Yes. (Mobile phone) (Kayoko) Sakamoto-san at the ICU ➡

262
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's a sudden change. (Daikoku) A sudden change?

263
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
(Mobile phone) Come in right away! (Mobile phone) (Cancel sound)

264
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
(Daikoku) Kobayashi-san could you please wait a little longer?

265
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
(Kobayashi) What? Please do something quickly!

266
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
(Daikoku) Sorry. Then I'll continue.

267
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
(Daikoku) No, I can't leave it to Yakushiji alone...

268
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
it's okay! Please let me do it.

269
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It hurts, it hurts...

270
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
(Daikoku) So if something happens, please call me straight away.

271
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
yes .

272
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Um, there's something allergy...

273
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Do it quickly, whatever!

274
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Sorry! already… .

275
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
The pain seems to be strong ➡

276
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
NSAIDs is fine...

277
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It will work quickly so please wait a little.

278
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
(Kobayashi) Ah, teacher. yes .

279
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Thank you.

280
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
(Ayumu) ​​The doctor had a patient who fell and got injured.

281
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'll go right away. Kobayashi-san, please wait.

282
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
end . (Bonten) It was a hellish scene. ➡

283
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Thanks to Professor Anno, I was able to overcome it.

284
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
(Brahma) Mr.?

285
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
come .

286
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
(Bonten) Eh! ?

287
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
(Hotachi) Take good care of you.

288
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
⚟ (Kobayashi's Cough)

289
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Kobayashi-san, are you okay? (Kobayashi's Cough)

290
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
(Wheezing)

291
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
What... Kobayashi-san! ? ( cough )

292
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Kobayashi-san, are you okay? ?

293
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Professor Anno...

294
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
( cough )

295
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
(cough) Aspirin asthma.

296
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Huh? If you don't do it quickly, your breathing will stop.

297
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Prepare the oxygen start nebulizer. (Sanae) Yes.

298
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Steroids are administered. Prepare adrenaline as well.

299
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
(Ayumu) ​​I understand.

300
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:09,000
(Kobayashi's wheezing)

301
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I tried to check it properly.

302
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Kobayashi didn't say that.

303
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
If I knew that aspirin was asthma, I wouldn't choose NSAIDs.

304
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It didn't even mention it in the medical record...

305
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Excuses do not apply to a hellish situation.

306
00:19:49,000 --> 00:20:09,000
♬～

307
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:29,000
♬～

308
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
♬～

309
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
(Okoku) This time, due to our mistakes ➡

310
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I put Kobayashi in a dangerous situation ➡

311
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm really sorry.

312
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
(Kobayashi's wife) What's going on?

313
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
My husband was almost dead! ?

314
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
(Daikoku) I'm really sorry.

315
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
(Kobayashi's wife) Other patients give priority to residents. ➡

316
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
What do you think of your husband's life?

317
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
(Kobayashi's wife) I don't want you to apologize ➡

318
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm asking what he's thinking!

319
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
(Kobayashi's wife) Why don't you say anything? ➡

320
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Please say something!

321
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Ah, thank you for your hard work. (Daikoku) Thank you for your hard work.

322
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Ah, was Kobayashi's family okay?

323
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
(Okoku) Ah... well, somehow it ended.

324
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Ah...

325
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
What about Yakushiji Dr. (Daikoku) I've already gotten home today.

326
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Is it okay?

327
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's because I left the place.

328
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I did something I'm sorry about.

329
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Thanks to Dr. Anno, the patients were safe ➡

330
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I hope it doesn't drag you too much.

331
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
No, I'm sure I'll be depressed for a while.

332
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Are you really caring about Professor Yakushiji?

333
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Why me?

334
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It's also your job to follow up with interns.

335
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
What will that kid do if he quits like this?

336
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
If that were the case, he would have been such a doctor.

337
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's colder than I thought.

338
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Whether you quit or continue, you don't have to decide if someone tells you.

339
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,000
That might be true though. Even Ashura-sensei was a newcomer ➡

340
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Have you ever been encouraged by someone?

341

Umm... What is it?

359
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Did you get scolded by Anno again?

360
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I... I'm no longer qualified to be a lifesaving person.

361
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I almost killed a patient...

362
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I'm not going to become a life-essential doctor, but I'm going through this hardship ➡

363
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Why do I have to train?

364
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I'm not suitable for saving lives.

365

Huh?

It's impossible for me to save my life.

371
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
He's not as talented as Anno-sensei.

372

Huh?

376
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
The job of a doctor is more important than talent.
