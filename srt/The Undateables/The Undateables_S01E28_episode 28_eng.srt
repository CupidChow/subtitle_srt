1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,230
Come.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:07,730

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,100
Thank you.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,060
Please take good care of Hoon Nam.

5
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:25,220
Bbang Sik. Bbang!

6
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,100
Bbang Soon.

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,240
What is all of this?

8
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,480
You're home.

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,020
We had a drink.

10
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,000
My head hurts.

11
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,630
Thank you.

12
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:12,700
Thief. You stole my heart, and now you've even stolen my dad's heart.

13
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,570
You debtor.

14
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,900
Give me my heart. You didn't give me the heart yet.

15
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,600
Ah, seriously, I can't beat you with words.

16
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,730
Where's my dad?

17
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,230
He went to the hospital to have a second round of drinks with Joon Soo.

18
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:38,150
They're closer than your average father and son.

19
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,220
I'm jealous.

20
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,610
  Are you interested in that woman? Should I introduce her to you?

21
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:52,410
 I guess I'm something that you'd want to return as well.

22
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,490
  If love means hurting someone else,

23
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,360
  I was determined never to love.

24
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,880
 I... am the child born from a mistake two people made.

25
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,380
To be honest, I met your mother today.

26
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,160
You met my mother?

27
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,550
She has a really big heart.

28
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,460
Of course, she's great...

29
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,180
She's put up with everything.

30
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:41,860
Honestly, my mother is the reason I was able to put up with everything until now.

31
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,190
Your mother really loves your father.

32
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,380
- She loves my father? 
 - Yeah.

33
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,960
No, it must be the opposite.

34
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,270
No, she couldn't have lived like that if she was filled with hatred.

35
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,620
Do you have any plans to reconcile things with your dad?

36
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,160
You said you would only make happy memories for me.

37
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,350
If you want me to happy, you have to be happy first.

38
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,730
Stop feeling hatred towards someone.

39
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,290
It's too unfortunate.

40
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,020
I'm home.

41
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,070
What are you doing here?

42
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:08,110
I just stopped by, since I was passing by.

43
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,410
Do you want to have a drink?

44
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,560
I'm drinking alcohol, the alcohol is drinking me.

45
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,750
At the end...

46
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:50,390

47
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:54,590

I'll sing and play the piano.

49
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,820
- Yook Ryong, come here. 
 - Okay.

50
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,130

54
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,320
Wake everyone up.

55
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,260
I'm raising four sons over here!

56
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,100
The family has gone to chaos. What is the meaning of all this!?

57
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,980
 I don't want to see any of you! Get out!

58
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,760
What do we do now?

59
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,390
Uncle, are you hungry?

60
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:47,960
Guys, should we go eat ramen?

61
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:54,590
Ramen? I know a really good place.

62
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,530
You eat ramen, too?

63
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,130
You?

64
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,400
Hyung has been a sucker for ramen for quite some time now.

65
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,780
He's crazy.

66
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,720
Let's go.

67
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,250
I'm just speechless.

68
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,470
This is no ramen specialty restaurant!

69
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:56,100
What is this? A cup ramen restaurant? A convenience store?

70
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,750
What is this?

71
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,720
Give it to me if you're not going to eat it.

72
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,870
No, no, no.

73
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,450
What? Is this how you save money?

74
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,920
So that you can buy pretty things like jewelry for your girlfriend?

75
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,500
Get her a gift. Like bam!

76
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,640
Is that how you live?

77
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,380
What? Hoon Nam, is this all true?

78
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,750
Give it to Hyung if you're not going to eat it.

79
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:23,220
Look at these people... I can't hang out with you guys.

80
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,200
Are you one of the participating teams?

81
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,000
Yes, we are. We're competing today.

82
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,500
Okay, you can pass through.

83
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,800

84
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,000
I'll go sign in, you guys go take a look around the pool.

85
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,700
 Okay!

86
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,800
Hello.

87
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,200
We're from Soon Nyoong High School. I'm the coach and we have four players here.

88
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,000
One second, please.

89
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,000
Can you fill out this form?

90
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,500
Coach! They say we're not on the participant list.

91
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,400
What? What are you talking about?

92
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,600
I think you should double check.

93
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,400
Okay.

94
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,200
What are you talking about?!

95
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,400
Does that make sense?!

96
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,100
Coach.

97
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,200
What's going on?

98
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,800
How are the kids?

99
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,000
I told them to go eat.

100
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,100
What happened?

101
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:37,000
I don't know. They said that our team was omitted from the participant list.

102
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,200
I'm positive that it's an error on the league's end.

103
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:45,040
But, you know that the league will never admit their mistakes.

104
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,100
What are we going to do?

105
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,330
There's going to be a way to fix this.

106
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,700
Cracorn!

107
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,400
I talked with my dad.

108
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,200
To be honest, it was more of a drunken frenzy,

109
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,400
but it was the first time I've spent so much time with Dad.

110
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,300
Good job.

111
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,400
What? I thought you would shower me with compliments.

112
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,400
I'm really happy, but...

113
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,000
Something came up with Coach.

114
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Coach?

115
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,600

116
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,740
You remember this contract, right?

117
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,800

118
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,000
 Blank contract?

119
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,600
 If you use this without my consent, I'll kill you. Make sure you get my approval.

120
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,600
Let me help Sun Hee.

121
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,400
You knew that something came up with Coach?

122
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:16,000
Tell Jung Eum noona to allow me to help Sun Hee.

123
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,400
Me?

124
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,400
Tell her to take back telling me to give up on Sun Hee.

125
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,300
Persuade Jung Eum Noona!

126
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,300
This is what it says on the blank contract.

127
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,710
Will you give him permission?

128
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,800
I can help. I want to help.

129
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,500
But... don't tell Sun Hee. I don't want to pressure her.

130
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,200
Do you even have a way to help?

131
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
Yes.

132
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,400
Soo Ji.

133
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,800
Joon Soo, you're here.

134
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:19,700
Yes. Even though it's just formality, I'm nervous to meet your father.

135
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,200
Thank you, Joon Soo.

136
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,600
For what? We're friends.

137
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,000
Shall we go, then?

138
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,900
This way.

139
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,500
Dad!

140
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,600
We're here.

141
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,200
Hello, my name is Choi Joon Soo.

142
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,200
I've heard a lot about you from Soo Ji,

143
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,200
that you're the man that she wants.

144
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,400
Huh?

145
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,600
Ah, yes.

146
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:59,030
There's nothing more to ask if she says you're the man that she wants.

147
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:03,210
Actually, let me ask one last question.

148
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,400
Yes, Father?

149
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,000
You're alone in a desert right now.

150
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
There's nothing to eat and you're surrounded by sand.

151
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,600
You have five animals with you.

152
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,000
Lion, monkey, cow, horse, and a lamb.

153
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,100
If you have to abandon the animals one by one in order to survive,

154
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,400
in what order would you get rid of the animals?

155
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,800
My dad really loves psychological tests.

156
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,500
Ah.

157
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:41,900
I would abandon the lion first.

158
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,180
Why?

159
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:51,690
Because I feel like the lion would eat me when he gets hungry.

160
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,900
Wow.

161
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,800
Your reason is the same as mine! I like you.

162
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,800
You pass the test.

163
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,500
Dad, you're going to call Geum Sang Chum Hwa to tell them our matching is a success, right?

164
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,800
Sure.

165
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,600
Dad, Joon Soo has to leave now to tend to his patients.

166
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,400
Really? Then you should go. Let's get together soon.

167
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,300
I'm tired.

168
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:31,170
I will drop by again sometime.

169
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,700
- Bye, Dad.
- Okay.

170
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,700
It's so weird that I crave this whenever I come to the hospital.

171
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,600
Manager Bong?

172
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,600
My daughter just came by.

173
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,200
Of course! I really like him.

174
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,400
You're going to stop by? Sounds good.

175
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,800
By the way, can you bring me some chicken feet and soju?

176
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,900
Okay? Okay? Oh, okay.

177
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,400
It's so hard to get my daughter to get married.

178
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,600
Let's see here.

179
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,800
Isn't my dad an odd person? You must have been uncomfortable. Thank you for this.

180
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,500
It was no problem at all.

181
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:54,400
So... there's no formal reason for us to meet again, huh?

182
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,200
Formally, no.

183
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,300
But, you do know that there is more thrill in meeting informally, right?

184
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,400
I don't really like thrill.

185
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,000
Then, can we meet as doctor and patient?

186
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,400
Of course, any time.

187
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,480
Hold on a minute.

188
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,300
Who is this?

189
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,600
Ah, Yook Ryong. What's going on?

190
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,800
Yes. Okay.

191
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,000
I understand.

192
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,200
I'll look into it.

193
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,000
Your timing is perfect. My dad's in a really good mood today.

194
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,400
Okay.

195
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,400
I have to go back to ask my dad something.

196
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,400
Okay. Make sure to come for your treatment next week.

197
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,800
I won't forget.

198
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,400
Okay.

199
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,800
I halted activity at the factory like you said.

200
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,420
We've also put measures into place to make sure things like this don't happen again.

201
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,460
We organized this into a document and have sent it to the PR department.

202
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,730
Good job.

203
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:11,570
Based on the public opinion poll, Uncle's approval rating wasn't affected much.

204
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,590
Fast recognition and a clean resolution

205
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,860
showed good results from the younger generation

206
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,260
and the neighborhood's elders are making conscientious reports.

207
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,710
Really? That's a relief.

208
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,810
Thank you for your hard work.

209
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:28,070
Honestly, there's a lot of unfair things going on during the party's campaign.

210
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,350
It's not important if they're rumors or not.

211
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:36,430
Politics is all about image and it's true that there was a problem with the pickled radishes that the DMJ donated.

212
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:42,670
Even so, it's fortunate that our family can put our heads together like this.

213
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,440
Even Hoon Nam is here.

214
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,480
Well, it's not like I'm much of a help.

215
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,440
You will be from now on.

216
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,780
We can't keep the factory closed forever. We have to protect our employees.

217
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:00,240
Let's see if there's a new item we can push.

218
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,460
If you need, you can take the profits of the gallery collection

219
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,020
and make use of it.

220
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,640
Shall we listen to you play the piano for the first time in a while?

221
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:43,400
I think I can step down now.

222
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:57,380
What? Really?

223
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,520
Thank you! Thank you!

224
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,150
Seriously, thank you!

225
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,000
Coach, what is it?

226
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,850
You guys, after they double checked,

227
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:23,980
they say we are on the participant list We can participate in the competition!

228
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:32,920
I got a call today, saying it was an error on the league's behalf.

229
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,240
Right? I guess things like this do really happen.

230
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,250
Yeah.

231
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,980
I'm going to the league now. Do you want to come?

232
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,250
It's a relief.

233
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,630
 ♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪

234
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,610
 Noona.

235
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:27,720
Please take good care of this collaboration.

236
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:39,210
 Is this how you save?

237
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,600
 So that you can buy pretty things like jewelry for your girlfriend?

238
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,750
 Get her a gift. Like bam!

239
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,000
Yes. I'll take this one.

240
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,320
Okay, I'll get it ready for you.

241
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,960
Okay.

242
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,960
Thank you.

243
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,750

244
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,860

245
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,790
Are you that happy?

246
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,460
Yeah.

247
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:51,260
To be honest, after I ended things like that with Yook Ryong, I wanted to do my best for the kids.

248
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:02,950
  Tell Jung Eum Noona to allow me to help Sun Hee.

249
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,610
 Tell her to take back telling me to give up on Sun Hee.

250
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:08,100
 I can help. I want to help.

251
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:13,260
 But, don't tell Sun Hee. I don't want to pressure her.

252
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,540
- Coach.
- Yeah?

253
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:23,990

254
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,830
- Hello?
- Yeah.

255
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,830
Where are you?

256
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:36,020
Oh, with Coach Yang?

257
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:40,820
Oh, yeah? I'm nearby.

258
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:44,800
Here? You're coming here now?

259
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,720
Tell him to come.

260
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,140
I'll text you the address then.

261
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,240
Bye.

262
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:56,250
I have to see him once. It's even better that I get to see him on such a good day.

263
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,020
Thank you.

264
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,690
Thank you.

265
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,290
It's been a while since we've been here.

266
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,200
It tastes exactly the same.

267
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,500
We used to come here so often.

268
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,600
Right. When you and Hoo Bin—

269
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,010
Sorry.

270
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:37,630
I'm in such a good mood today, I can't even control what comes out of my mouth.

271
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,190
I'll be back. I'm gonna go to the bathroom and use the mirror.

272
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,520
It's my first time meeting Hoon Nam.

273
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,250
It is you. Yoo Jung Eum.

274
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,070
 I had no idea you were this extreme!

275
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,160
  You're finally making me out to be the jerk who ruined your life.

276
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:13,400
 I'll change.  It was all my fault, so please don't act like this!

277
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,400
 Let go of me!

278
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,920
  I got a new girlfriend. Sorry.

279
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:27,660
What? I said hi because I was excited to see you.

280
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,340
Why are you looking at me like you don't even known me?

281
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:42,300
What's the problem here?

282
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,910
Huh?

283
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,360
  I got a new girlfriend.

284
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,690
Let's go.

285
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:12,020
Five years ago at the airport...
