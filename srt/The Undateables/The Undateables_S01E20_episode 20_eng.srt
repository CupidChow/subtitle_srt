1
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:07,150
Why did you tell me to come so early?

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,660
Here.

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,490
You don't like sandwiches.

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,970
I really like sandwiches.

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,650
You even eat cup ramen these days, right?

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,440
Every single day.

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,430
Really?

8
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,470
Do you want a sandwich, too?

9
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,840
No.

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,100
I'll eat crab meat, this is enough.

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,480
Anyway, why did you tell me to come here so early in the morning?

12
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,120
What? What is this?

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,090
You already drew it?

14
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,920
As expected, you only act like you're complaining.

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,960
You're actually so warm on the inside.

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,550
Please take care of Cracorn.

17
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:04,210
- Cracorn? 
 - Yes, that's the character's name.

18
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,330
Cracorn... Okay.

19
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,940
What kind of a character is Cracorn?

20
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:16,390
You have to explain it to me so I can use it in the story.

21
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,750
Cracorn?

22
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,200
Cracorn is...

23
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,510
 Deul? Wow! That's a pretty name.

24
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,440
Really affectionate.

25
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,630
 Didn't you say it was one part for each couple?

26
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,790
 You've worked hard.

27
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,400
Has a warm heart.

28
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,630
 How did you fall?

29
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,870
 Where's your mommy?

30
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,230
Is nosy.

31
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,650
 Stamp!

32
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,580
Cute...

33
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,660
 This is strangely addicting.

34
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,060
 Not thinking about anything...

35
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,210
 I like that!

36
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,690
Energetic...

37
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,200
Just...

38
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,970
She's a really good woman.

39
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,160
Woman?

40
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,820
It's a female cat.

41
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,290
You're in love with that woman.

42
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,640
You fell in love, you really did.

43
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,260
What are you going to do?

44
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,690
 Love is not something that you do

45
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,540
 but something you fall into.

46
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,800
You found Kim So Eul?

47
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,000
Yes, a report came in to the company.

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,130
To the company?

49
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,310
I was on my way to Mt. Jiri and came back after hearing this news.

50
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,260
Where is he? Is it far?

51
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,110
No, he's near Seoul.

52
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,080
- Seoul?
 - Yes.

53
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,830
That place is...

54
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:37,640
So Kim So Eul is here.

55
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,990
I came to meet Kim So Eul, too.

56
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,730
I haven't gotten all the pieces of the tin man yet.

57
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,850
The person who contacted the company...

58
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,700
Because you won't answer my calls—

59
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,890
So Eul.

60
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,040
Have you been well?

61
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,800
We've been looking hard for you.

62
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,980
You look comfortable and healthy.

63
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,750
So Eul, if you're okay with it,

64
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,390
can you please give me some time?

65
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,350
I have something I need to tell you.

66
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:38,610
Can we go sit somewhere?

67
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,750
So Eul.

68
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,990
He's supposed to be silent until 4 p.m.

69
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,970
Shall we talk until then?

70
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,680
I'll help you.

71
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,290
♫  Lately I'm curious about you  ♫

72
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:39,150
♫  I want to know more  ♫

73
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:44,140
♫  In my head I become your other half  ♫

74
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,710
♫  I hastily imagine it  ♫

75
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:54,490
♫  oh slowly slowly  ♫

76
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:58,580
♫  Can I carefully  ♫
	♫  knock on your heart?  ♫

77
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:04,340
♫  oh slowly slowly  ♫
	♫  Can I convey  ♫

78
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,620
♫  my feelings so you won't be surprised?  ♫

79
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,500
♫  My clumsiness  ♫

80
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,230
♫  Even if it's frustrating and disappointing  ♫

81
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:23,930
♫  Oh slowly, slowly  ♫

82

00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:43,440

♫  my feelings so you won't be surprised?  ♫

87
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,150
I'll ask this favor of you.

88
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,250
Yes.

89
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,320
Jung Eum.

90
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,650
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

91
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,050
I know that there's nothing I can say to make you forgive me, but

92
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,140
I've lived my whole life thinking I could control my emotions.

93
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,470
So, I didn't know that what I felt for you was love.

94
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:20,510
I made a bet like a fool. I'm sorry.

95
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,880
I was immature.

96
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,980
Liking someone...

97
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,930
I really didn't know what that was.

98
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:37,350
After meeting you,

99
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,510
I rode a bicycle, which I never knew how to before, because of you.

100
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:51,390
Because of you, I ate ramen, which I'd never had before.

101
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,790
Even sandwiches, which I used hate,

102
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,970
became the most delicious food in the world.

103
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:01,870
I can't even eat alone anymore.

104
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,620
When I walk by and see a pretty flower, I wonder what kind it is.

105
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,210
I think of you first.

106
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,660
I only think of you all day long.

107
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,150
What should I do?

108
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,150
I'm going crazy because I miss you.

109
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,650
What should I do?

110
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,530
Jung Eum.

111
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,750
How can I prove my sincerity?

112
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,760
Give me one more chance.

113
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,790
Let's try it one more time.

114
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,340
Even if you're scared, don't avoid me.

115
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,540
You can't do this here.

116
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,350
I told you to meet me outside.

117
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,590
I wanted to talk about work with you.

118
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,320
With me?

119
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,100
After the "Most Wanted Man" article we are planning a production of the "Most Wanted Woman."

120
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,530
You're perfect as the "Most Wanted Woman."

121
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:54,790
I am the "Most Wanted Woman", but it's annoying. I don't want to do it.

122
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,560
Hey, if you get picked as the best this time,

123
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,460
there's even a special event for the "Most Wanted Man" and "Most Wanted Woman."

124
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,950
Who is the most wanted man?

125
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,680
- Choi Joon Soo?
 - Of course.

126
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,400
Oh, really?

127
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:13,420
Then... I'll think about it.

128
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,320
Okay, things are working out slowly.

129
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,830
Let's go out to buy some clothes.

130
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:22,020
I think I'll have a reason to wear business suit soon.

131
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,530
Business suit?

132
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,010
Yes, I went home.

133
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,300
- What? When? Why?
 - Right away.

134
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,550
No wonder, this is a surprise attack.

135
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:35,310
I was wondering why you needed a business suit, is there an event going on at home?

136
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,450
I want to wear it when both families meet.

137
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,230
When both families meet?

138
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,120
What!? Both families!?

139
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,790
It's nice. The aftertaste is a bit different.

140
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:57,150
We have to recognize how sensitive your taste buds are, Madam Jung.

141
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:00,860
My husband brought them from Italy

142
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,610
when he went on a business trip there.

143
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,160
You know that I like tea.

144
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,340
Whenever he goes overseas, he brings me the best.

145
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,410
Ah, he's handsome and considerate, too.

146
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,190
I'm envious.

147
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:21,450
I apologize for having you come to my home. I have to be careful about meeting with people outside.

148
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,870
The assemblyman's election is only a few days away.

149
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,320
He's pretty much confirmed to be elected, right?

150
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,490
We will have to count the votes to know.

151
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,850
Congratulations.

152
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,160
So, now you only need to get your second son married.

153
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,930
I would try to get him married, but only if he actually wanted to.

154
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:41,770
How many of our children get married because they want to?

155
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:46,420
Marriage is something the parents need to take care of.

156
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:51,550
That's right. When he gets elected, you should try getting involved.

157
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,480
You love your second son so much, but why don't you care about him getting married?

158
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,980
If he doesn't want to get married, what can I do?

159
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,900
But you never know.

160
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,950
I know my son the most. Who else would?

161
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:09,540
I know him the most and he's not the type of person who would ever date anyone.

162
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,700
Jung Eum.

163
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,850
Yoo Jung Eum. Cracorn!

164
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,890
Yoo Jung Eum. Cracorn!

165
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,750

166
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,940

167
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,790

168
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,450

169
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,130
Jung Eum!

170
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,370
 Tips on how to make your lover not be mad anymore.

171
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,840
 Chapter 1: Nothing beats acting cute.

172
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,780
Hoon Nam is really hurt from getting hit.

173
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,980
Blow on it, please.

174
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,220
Please, blow on it. It hurts.

175
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,470
Do you want to get hit again?

176
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,790
Get hit again?

177
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:22,880
 Chapter. 2: Shake them up with an unexpected physical touch!

178
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,190
Do you want to die?

179
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,680
 Chapter 3: Make her laugh without stopping

180
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:47,220
Don't you think you are too much! I have two holes in my heart!

181
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:52,290
There's two and this is mimicking!

182
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,830
 Chapter 4: Just ask for forgiveness

183
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:22,760
I surrender. I'll submit.

184
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,050
Are you joking?

185
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,760
  My methods... were just theoretical.

186
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,710
It's fate.

187
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:02,360
It's not fate.

188
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,130
It's fate.

189
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:08,060
It's not fate.

190
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,990
It's fate.

191
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,770
It's not fate.

192
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,470
So Eul.

193
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,510
You came.

194
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,560
Have you been doing well?

195
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,800
As you can see.

196
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,720
What were you trying to find out?

197
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,380
I was asking about fate in this world.

198
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,750
Fate in this world...

199
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,210
Have you ever thought

200
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:48,920
that Oh Doo Ri might be your fate?

201
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:55,110
To tell you the truth, Oh Doo Ri wants to meet you again.

202
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:02,200
What do you think about making fate with Oh Doo Ri?

203
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,180
I thought that she didn't like me.

204
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,760
 I may not have manners!

205
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,560
 But, you don't even have any hair!

206
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,850
 No, no, I don't like this house.

207
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,970
 Don't stand there like a kid and come sit up here.

208
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:22,850
 I've only lived a stand-up lifestyle.

209
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,660
 Whenever I eat pasta,

210
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,130
 I have to drink coffee.

211
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:32,630
 I'm sure it's hard to find things like that here in the countryside.

212
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:38,050
No, she was doing that because she was shy.

213
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:43,920
She regrets her mistakes on the first night two you met.

214
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,790
Is that so?

215
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:50,310
Yes.

216
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,920
She misses you a lot.

217
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,440
She wants to see you.

218
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:08,140
Would you like to meet her again?

219
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,990
However, I have cut off fate from my body.

220
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:18,340
I'm afraid of being meaningful to someone.

221
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,670
A long time ago, someone

222
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:31,420
grew weeds without knowing they were weeds.

223
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,900
They worked hard growing them

224
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,210
and then they found out one day that they were just weeds.

225
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:41,360
With a disappointed heart he told a monk, and the monk told him that

226
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,150
the minute he'd decided to grow them,

227
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:49,170
they'd stopped being just weeds.

228
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,890
Even if you pour your heart into growing a weed,

229
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:58,070
it will have a meaning, so what would it be like if you did that for a person?

230
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:02,680
Being meaningful to someone

231
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,950
is scary.

232
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,730
 Let's try it one more time.

233
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,490
 Even if you're scared, don't avoid me.

234
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,450
What do you think about trying it?

235
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,040
Even if you're scared, don't avoid it.

236
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:33,740
 Jung Eum, give me just one more chance.

237
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,630
What about giving her another chance?

238
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:42,350
Since the other person really wants it.

239
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,750
 What do I have to do for you to understand my sincerity?

240
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,130
What do you think about listening to

241
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:55,100
Oh Doo Ri's sincerity just once?

242
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,380
Are you going to run away again?

243
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,450
 I'll eat well.

244
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,640
 Syrup?

245
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,010
 Two.

246
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,860
Where are you trying to run away to this time?

247
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,360
I was on my way back.

248
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,040
You remembered.

249
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:51,230
Seeing that we've met once again, it must be fate.

250
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:03,110
I missed you.

251
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,560
I don't know! I really don't know!

252
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,640
Do you know how much I waited?

253
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,040
Why are you doing this?

254
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,160
When did you contact Oh Doo Ri?

255
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,200
I only reported the information.

256
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,330
We should probably go, right?

257
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,170
Should we?

258
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,400
Looks like they will do great, right?

259
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,580
Probably.

260
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,060
Can we talk for a second?

261
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,000
Should we?

262
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,150
Last time...

263
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:54,220
I'm sorry about asking to break up in front of other people.

264
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,570
No, it's okay. It was my fault.

265
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:24,570
Thank you for everything until now.

266
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:49,700
Let's really break up now.

267
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:04,100

268
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:10,950
♫  My greed keeps growing  ♫

269
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:14,310
♫  How much you must have hurt  ♫

270
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:19,260
 Fate becomes a farewell, and a farewell becomes fate

271
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:23,640
 Nothing works out my way.

272
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,350
  Dating is like The Story of the Green Frog.

273
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:32,840
♫  It forms on your lips and finds you  ♫

274
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:39,570
♫  I call you, I call you  ♫

275
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:47,020
♫  I call you like this  ♫

276
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:54,320
♫  I'm even scared to sleep and dream  ♫

277
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,800
♫  In case we drift apart  ♫
