1
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,160
Give it to me! Seriously! What are you doing?

2
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,040
Stop.

3
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,140
Come on...

4
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,780
Oh!

5
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,580
Give it to me!

6
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:52,770

7
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,630
Mother.

8
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,210
You were laughing pretty loudly. And you are...?

9
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,210
I'll tell you.

10
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,810
All right. I'll wait in the cafe.

11
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,360
Wait here for a bit.

12
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:54,550
For someone who knows how to get work done, you aren't the type to bring girls to the gallery for no reason.

13
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:58,510
She's not a woman that I brought for no reason. I'm seriously dating her.

14
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,560
- If you're not taking responsibility— 
 - I intend to.

15
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,520
I'm sorry that I did not tell you earlier.

16
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,620
I won't say any empty words. Go ahead and officially date her.

17
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,790
Since you're at a certain age, both of you should greet each other's families, too.

18
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,070
Yes.

19
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:21,660
Have you met her parents before?

20
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,500
I think you will like them.

21
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,910
Did Mother leave?

22
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,610
You were surprised since it was so sudden, right?

23
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,380
Sit down.

24
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,450
I couldn't officially introduce you to her.

25
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,800
It's okay.

26
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,180
But... what did she say?

27
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,240
Let's meet your father first.

28
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,830
My dad?

29
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:02,750
I should officially greet him first, then let's tell him about our relationship.

30
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,420
There's no need to be nervous.

31
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,900
Hello, Father. I am Jung Eum's boyfriend, Kang Hoon Nam.

32
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,600
I am officially greeting you.

33
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,880
How dare you! My precious...!

34
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,460
daughter! You—!

35
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,560
"You"?

36
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,990
Do you want to die?

37
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,350
I'm really sorry.

38
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,570
Do it seriously! I'm desperate here!

39
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,160
Me, too. Me, too. I'm also serious.

40
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,850
Are you my daughter's girlfriend?

41
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,500
Yes.

42
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,090
NG, NG, NG (not good). Not girlfriend

43
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,180
but boyfriend. Boyfriend. Boyfriend.

44
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,900
Your outfit... I think the one from before was better.

45
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,260
Really?

46
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:16,780
I want to officially date Jung Eum. Please, give us your blessing.

47
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,140
Not until the day my eyes are covered in dirt!

48
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,420
Father, please give me your daughter.

49
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,030
He's bowing and cr**.

50
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:44,320
Hello, I'm your cutie, Kang Hoon Nam.

51
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:53,160
Hello, Father, I am Kang Hoon Nam! Attention!

52
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,000
Yes, hello, hello! I am the handsome guy, Kang Hoon Nam,  officially dating Jung Eum.

53
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,630
I request permission from you, Father.

54
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,460
Come on.

55
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,350
Hello, Father. I really like your daughter.

56
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,920
I would like to officially date your daughter. Please, give us your blessing.

57
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,870
This is it.

58
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,820
Are you okay?

59
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,350
I told you we should have bought flowers.

60
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,090
My dad likes eating the most. He'd say it was a waste of money.

61
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:37,330
Even still, this isn't it. Should I go back and buy some?

62
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:42,020
Are you nervous? This isn't the first time you're meeting him

63
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,180
This is my first time feeling like this.

64
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,790
Your father... about Jook... do you think he'll be mad?

65
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,190
A little.

66
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,100
Still, he'll definitely like you later on,

67
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,110
since sincerity will be conveyed.

68
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,890
Is that so?

69
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,650
Should we go?

70
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,100
Let's go.

71
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,520
Wait a moment.

72
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,070
Do I look okay?

73
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,280
You're handsome, were handsome, and always will be handsome.

74
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,190
Let's go, then.

75
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,160
Mr. Jook?

76
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,120
Dad.

77
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,790
Did you just get back from your business trip?

78
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,060
Yes, yes.

79
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,520
Did you meet on the way here?

80
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,230
Yes.

81
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,860
Let's go in to eat dinner.

82
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,590
Go in. Go in.

83
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:05,820
What is all this?

84
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,710
How much is all that?

85
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,240
Okay, let's eat.

86
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,670
It's been a while since you came back, let's have a drink.

87
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,730
Yes.

88
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:21,460
Wait a minute. Where is the plum wine?

89
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,160
Dad gets in a better mood if he drinks. Tell him then.

90
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,490
Really? Got it.

91
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,680
Father, I will pour you a drink.

92
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,800
No!

93
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,820
I'm sorry, Father. The truth is...

94
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,850
Actually... the truth is...

95
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,960
Is this your first time drinking homemade alcohol?

96
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,030
Like this. Pour it into the kettle.

97
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,620
We have to transfer it.

98
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,120
Ah, yes, we should.

99
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,620
I was wrong.

100
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,780
Take a drink.

101
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,520
Yes.

102
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,790
Okay. Jung Eum, too.

103
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,420
Father, I will pour you one.

104
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,660
Okay, that's good.

105
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,730
Let's toast.

106
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,190
Cheers.

107
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,620
But, why did you buy all the ribs and ginseng?

108
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:46,360
If I didn't know any better, I'd think you were coming to say hello to your future father-in-law

109
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,670
to ask for Jung Eum's hand.

110
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:00,310
Father, Jung Eum and I...

111
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,820
Look at all this blood. You didn't get bit, did you?

112
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,800
No, I'm fine.

113
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,940
Jung Eum, go and get the liquid pain reliever. It's in the drawer.

114
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,290
Liquid pain reliever?

115
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,230
- You know? 
 - Yes.

116
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,470
I know everything.

117
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,620
Yes, you know everything.

118
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:41,730
Did you think that I wouldn't know that you two are in  that  type of relationship?

119
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,030
A parent can tell what their child wants to say just from the look in their eye.

120
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:53,920
Even through her footsteps and breathing, I can tell if my child is sad, happy, or hurt.

121
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,820
I know everything. That's what a parent is.

122
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,650
Well, at least she's not meeting some loser.

123
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:07,110
I'm comforted by the fact that she brought an upstanding man like you.

124
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,800
Thank you, Father.

125
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,070
Thank you, Dad.

126
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:20,400
Did I say I'm permitting it right away? Even plums take a month to ripen.

127
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,250
Don't you think it takes time for relationships to develop?

128
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:30,720
As a father with a daughter, I can't easily permit you to meet some random man. I'll observe for a while.

129
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,090
Of course. You are right.

130
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:37,940
I want to officially date Jung Eum with marriage in mind.

131
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,030
I will show you whether I have the right to.

132
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,940
All right. Have a drink.

133
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,730
Yes.

134
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:53,360
 Breaking news from the pickled radish company run by Kang Jung Do.

135
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:58,700
 It has been discovered that they are donating expired pickled radishes.

136
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,280
 The opposing party, New World Party, is using the donations as an excuse

137
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,110
 to accuse Kang Jung Do of deception.

138
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:12,020
I knew that you would make a mistake someday, you filthy b*stard.

139
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,100
You a**hole. You son of a b****. You garbage f***.

140
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,950
You piece of sh*t, I'll break open your damn skull.

141
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:22,290
You a**hole. You son of a b****. You slimy f***. You deserve to die—

142
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,480
- Dad. 
 - Huh?

143
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,600
Ah, ah, I'm sorry.

144
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:34,770
I became too agitated without realizing it.

145
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,590
I'm not usually like this.

146
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,250
Yes, I know. But...

147
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,490
is there something going on?

148
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:48,450
Kang Jung Do, that a**hole and I, have a history.

149
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,850
What kind of history?

150
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,580
A long time ago,

151
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,660
there was a little girl who I regarded as my real little sister.

152
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,790
Like my Jung Eum, she naively fell in love.

153
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,340
She was also easily fooled.

154
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,350
That person, Kang Jung Do,

155
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:16,350
already had a family,

156
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:21,190
but he seduced her and left her to take care of the child alone.

157
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,350
After taking care of her child for so long...

158
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,430
I should have tried to stop her,

159
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,960
but I couldn't.

160
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,930
It's been over thirty years since I cut off contact with him.

161
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,730
But, of all places, in our neighborhood

162
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:47,440
he does his campaigning. What are the odds?

163
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,420
My Jung Eum is just like her.

164
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,720
I was worried that she might meet a guy like that.

165
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,950
You're not like that, right?

166
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:06,200
Yes, I'm not like that.

167
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,040
Okay, let's stop talking about the past.

168
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,880
Oh, right. What did you say your father does?

169
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,820
Well, I guess that's not important. You're the one that's important.

170
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,170
It's not like our family has a lot.

171
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,880
- Have a drink. 
 - Yes.

172
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,090
The atmosphere got awkward.

173
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,490
The plum wine fermented nicely.

174
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,670
I still get mad whenever I think about it.

175
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:44,510
The short-ribs will be tasty...

176
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:48,700
Hey... Mr. Jook...

177
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,260
It's got to be tasty...

178
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,510
You got to put some...

179
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,050
Come on... Mr. Jook...

180
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,970
Go into your Jook room...

181
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:17,070
If you don't like that...

182
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,840
He fell asleep.

183
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,890
He's the type to sleep as soon as his head touches the pillow.

184
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,970
Do you want to sleep in the Jook room?

185
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:33,540
I have stuff left to finish, so I have to head to the gallery.

186
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,000
Go in. I'll call when I arrive.

187
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,710
But, Dad's reaction was okay, right? What a relief.

188
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:51,810
Yes, what a relief...

189
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:54,880
But, let's be careful of our actions until we get permission officially.

190
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,740
I'm telling you, this is the same as getting permission.

191
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,600
But still...

192
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,720
When should I go to greet your parents?

193
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,780
I'll let you know once I check on the timing.

194
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,670
Ah, bring Father to the gallery. I'll give you an invitation.

195
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,780
Dad will like it.

196
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,900
Sleep well. I'm leaving.

197
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,800
Go ahead.

198
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:46,740

199
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,020
Yes, Hyung. I saw the news.

200
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,510
That has nothing to do with me. You should've done better, Hyung.

201
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,800
Since it's DMJ's problem, they should solve it themselves.

202
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,140
Don't drag in outsiders.

203
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,790
 Kang Jung Do has yet to...

204
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:33,310
 I knew that you would make a mistake someday, you filthy b*stard.

205
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:38,270
 I have a history with that jerk, Kang Jung Do.

206
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,510
 There was a little girl who I regarded as my real little sister.

207
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:44,730
 He already had a family, yet

208
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:48,140
 but he seduced her and

209
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,590
 left her to take care of the child alone.

210
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,190
 After taking care of her child for so long...

211
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,100
 With the reports that he donated expired pickled radishes...

212
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:12,700
 The opposing party, New World Party, is using

213
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,880
 this as an excuse to...

214
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,130
 With this news coming to light ahead of the elections, the New World Party

215
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:24,850
 is unable to hide the fact that they have...

216
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:29,960
Why are you calling at this time?

217
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,560
Okay. I got it.

218
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,070
So, what is it?

219
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:50,720
After the case blew up, you never once contacted me.

220
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,960
You are family.

221
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,280
If we immediately stop production at the factory, then we might run out of funds—

222
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,000
Talk about Hyung's problems with him. Leave me out of it.

223
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,690
All right. What is it you want to say?

224
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:26,110
Mom— Mom... how did you meet her, again?

225
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:37,290
I'm curious. Why did a good person like Mom go back to you?

226
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,780
Especially since you were a married man.

227
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,820
Your mother came to find me first.

228
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:51,110
However, it is not important who came to find whom first,

229
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:55,200
because, in the end,

230
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,170
- we still loved each other. 
 - Forget it.

231
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,200
Do you know a person name Yoo Seung Ryeol?

232
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,830
Wha— How do you know Seung Ryeol?

233
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,750
 My Jung Eum is just like her.

234
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,460
 I was worried that she might meet a man like that.

235
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,870
 You're not like that, right?

236
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:32,340
Indeed, for a girl, it's all in the upkeep.

237
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,260
- Good morning. 
 - Hello.

238
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,730
Yoo Jung Eum.

239
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,370
Such variety in your outfit.

240
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:46,150
I have to go to a client's camping wedding party.

241
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,520
Camping wedding?

242
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,990
Yes. Both of them are outdoor designers and enjoy camping.

243
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,780
So, they are holding their wedding at a camping site.

244
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:59,420
How did you manage to connect those two, the one that rejected one-hundred dates and the ghost?

245
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,120
I heard that the two of them are meeting today.

246
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,640
Didn't you say that Choo Sung confirmed with them?

247
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,430
Yes. They both called this morning.

248
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:12,650
They said they will meet without the manager present.

249
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,260
Yoo Jung Eum, did you not know?

250
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:19,870
No. I knew that Lee Soo Ji picked Choi Joon Soo,

251
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,450
but I didn't know he would say okay right away.

252
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,470
Yoo Jung Eum, you  are crazy.

253
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:26,930
How did you think of matching them?

254
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:31,210
Make it happen for Na Ga Young and Kang Dol Jin, okay?

255
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:32,520
Yes.

256
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,170
- I'll be back. 
 - Have a safe trip.

257
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:36,320
- Have a safe trip. 
 - Work hard.

258
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,420
Let's do it this way.

259
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,870
Since we had our blind date today, we can have one more date

260
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,060
and then greet each other's parents.

261
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,590
If we do that, Jung Eum will believe it.

262
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:02,550
My dad will also be able to confirm that I have a man.

263
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,580
Do we really need to go on a date?

264
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,420
We're meeting out as a strategy.

265
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,270
We still need to follow protocol.

266
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:15,870
All right. Let's follow the course.

267
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,560
That way,

268
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,990
Jung Eum will feel comfortable.

269
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:25,490
Are you really doing this for a woman you like?

270
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,030
No.

271
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm doing it for a friend I like.

272
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,840
I'm jealous of Jung Eum Unni.

273
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,700
I don't really have any friends.

274
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,570
Is it because my personality is so-so?

275
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,160
I can be a casual friend, at least.

276
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,670
Next time, let's meet at a casual place.

277
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:56,060
Here, it really feels like a blind date.

278
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:00,370
Okay. Next time let's meet at a comfortable place.

279
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,100
Where is Hoon Nam?

280
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,630
Ah. He must be busy.

281
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,720
I told him not to come.

282
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,370
That brat... we are family. How can he be so busy?

283
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:23,300
You don't have the right to say that.

284
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,160
Mother, we are in the wrong,

285
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,540
but they also brought in malicious reinforcements to falsely testify.

286
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:35,580
Choon Nam, you, didn't I tell you to always be vigilant, even when it's not election season?

287
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,610
I'm sorry.

288
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:41,660
But it's not like we just started donating the radishes. We've been doing it for years.

289
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,480
This is a bit unfair.

290
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,060
I'll go and apologize for everything, Eun Nim.

291
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:52,090
Whatever the intention, in the end, there was damage caused.

292
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:55,690
We'll acknowledge everything as is.

293
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:58,580
And if anyone suffered, we'll address everything quickly.

294
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,200
We'll keep an eye out for our surroundings.

295
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,690
Eun Nim.

296
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,590
Don't worry.

297
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,710
Everything will be fine.

298
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,870
Forget that.

299
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:22,070
I think that Hoon Nam has a woman.

300
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,390
I think there is a woman who he's meeting.

301
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,430
Hoon Nam?

302
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:33,380
Hoon Nam... he at least won't be like you.

303
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,750
Did you eat?

304
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,030
I'm not eating.

305
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,910
Do you really not feel anything?

306
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:00,730
What? I heard that DMJ is about to fall over.

307
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,310
Aren't you too calm?

308
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,930
It's not my business.

309
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:10,920
President, this is on a completely different level than the Alyang situation.

310
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,570
Whether the trouble my father causes is a romance or a blockbuster,

311
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:19,920
I'll just be buying tickets to watch the show. Will you be making popcorn on the side?

312
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,380
Can you joke right now?

313
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,260
Why can't I? Am I constipated?

314
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,250
Really...

315
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,070
- President. 
 - That's that.

316
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:31,930
You've been looking for the exhibition hall site in Seoul, but not elsewhere?

317
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:36,040
He's seriously continuing talk about in this situation...

318
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:41,910
Actually, because of Aunt's order

319
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:46,870
I have to go, but I was waiting to see you before I went.

320
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:51,460
Do you want to relay anything?

321
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,410
Tell my mother that I'll call her.

322
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,530
- I can't. 
 - You don't even know what it is.

323
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:18,930
 Everything.

324
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:23,440
You were doing all that grinning recently. Why are you acting like the dark, aloof man again?

325
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,770
What do you want?

326
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,430
I thought that you would change after dating.

327
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,400
I'm hanging up.

328
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,260
 No, no, no. You know a lot of people, right?

329
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,830
Is there anyone for this month's "Most Wanted" article?

330
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:39,870
 I've been so busy with character development that I haven't been able to cast anyone.

331
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:42,530
 I don't have time, can you help?

332
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:48,890
It's too hard to get Na Ga Young.

333
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,670
Sorry.

334
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:58,180
In observance of World Population Day, how about someone that does international trade?

335
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:02,970
I don't know what that has to do with World Population Day, but

336
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,360
it's definitely fresh.

337
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,500
I know someone who works in the country's biggest private equity firm.

338
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:13,100
He deals with imports and knows nineteen languages and is in the trade department.

339
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,900
I'll get the interview. You just do the cover shoot.

340
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,470
Okay. I'm more thankful.

341
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,280
Okay. Then, I'll give you their contact information.

342
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,870
Never mind, I'll write up the photo shoot concept and e-mail it to you.

343
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:27,520
Of course, that makes me more thankful.

344
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:32,090
It's impossible for Na Ga Young.

345
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:36,490
He is so busy that he has no time to talk. The conversation ended as I chased after him.

346
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,960
Wait for it.

347
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,130
Do you have a solution?

348
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,600
Yes.

349
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,350
♫  Hard, hard  ♫

350
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,640
♫  Hard, hard, hard  ♫

351
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,800
♫  You're tough mamacita, because you look good  ♫

352
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,800
♫  You're tough mamacita, you are out of league  ♫

353
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,860
Okay. Good.

354
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,860
When will this be over? I have to go.

355
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,900
- Can I... Is it over? 
 - Why are you like this?

356
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,850
Focus.

357
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,350
That's it.

358
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,740
Cut! That's good. We have enough.

359
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:12,210
Now, we will move to the interview.

360
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,270
Yes.

361
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:17,270
Is it...?

362
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,340
Is it over?

363
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:30,180
- Will he really come? 
 - Mhm.

364
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:34,370
Besides work, he doesn't leave time for anything else.

365
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:37,420
Don't worry. Yook Ryong will bring him soon.

366
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:45,190
Mr. Na Ga Young is here!

367
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:52,900
