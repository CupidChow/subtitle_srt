1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,300
You said it was close, right?

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,000
My dad has a check-up, so I need to go home early.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,900
Then, why did you bring a difficult person? If you hadn't, we would have left way earlier.

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,800
I even found a popular restaurant on the way.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,700
- What?
 - Hmm?

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,200
Nothing.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,600
The weather's really nice.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,300
We found Kim So Eul faster than I anticipated, too.

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,400

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,600
Joons?

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,600
Yeah. I'm on my way right now.

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,400
Where are you?

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,300
Home? Aren't you going to be late?

14
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,600
Why be late while waiting for a delivery?

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,000
Pork belly with Dad at home later tonight? Sounds good.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,400
We're almost there!

17
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,500
Ah, eat with Dad first. I'll go once we're done.

18
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,900
Yeah.

19
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,920
Hey, hey! Hey, Yoo Jung Eum!

20
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,730
I was going to tell her about this.

21
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,900
I'll give it to her later then.

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,400
I finally got it.

23
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,900
She'll like it.

24
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,400
 - Why are you crying? Did someone hit you again?
 - No.

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,900
 Were you scolded by your mom?

26
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,800
 Why?

27
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,800
 I told my mom that I was going to buy indoor slippers and that I needed money

28
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,700
 but got caught lying when I tried to keep the money.

29
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,500
 Why did you need money? What were you going to buy?

30
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,000
 Judy?

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,400
 You want that.

32
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,200
 Did someone ask you to buy it?

33
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,800
 I want to buy it for you.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 I can't live because of you.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,400
 Don't do that ever again. Got it?

36
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,900
 Promise.

37
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,600
 Sorry. I'll definitely buy that for you later on when I earn a lot of money.

38
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,200
 Okay. So don't cry. Stop!

39
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,400
 Kang Jeong Do!

40
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,200
No.1 Candidate Kang Jeong Do.

41
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,600
 Thank you.

42
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,000
Candidate No.1, please. Thank you.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Thank you.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
- Our traditional cloth can wrap anything. 
 - Kang Jeong Do!

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,400
- The pigmentation, it lasts a long time, rock-paper-scissors! 
 -  Kang Jeong Do!

46
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,500
Just kidding, just kidding.

47
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,200
- Why is it so noisy outside? 
 -  Kang Jeong Do!

48
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,200
- Did someone come? 
 -  Kang Jeong Do!

49
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,000
If it's Kang Jeong Do, isn't he that handsome congressman?

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,700
They must have come to our neighborhood!

51
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,400
Oh my gosh!

52
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,800
- Nice to meet you. Have you eaten? 
 - Hello.

53
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,400
Yes, we have.

54
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,000
How long have you lived in this neighborhood?

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,700
Three weeks.

56
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,600
You've lived a long time here, then.

57
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,800
Yes.

58
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,400
- No. 1, fighting! 
 - Thank you!

59
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,100
Please vote for No.1!

60
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,600
Father, we have to go to the senior center today. We should get going.

61
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Oh, really?

62
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,400
It's our regular monthly visit. So, we can't miss out.

63
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,200
You should go. You should go serve the seniors well.

64
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,000
Since you're donating the daikons, be sure to buy the best.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Of course.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,500
Father, Mother, I'm sorry.

67
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,400
No, it's okay. I can do enough alone.

68
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,000
- Go on. 
- Okay.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,600
- Father, fighting! 
 - Fighting!

70
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,400
- Okay, then. 
 - Work hard, everyone.

71
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,000
We'll end class with this today.

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,200
Good-bye.

73
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,200
- Aren't you going?
 - I'm going to clean things up and then go.

74
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,400
Alright.

75
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,000
- Go safely.
 - Okay.

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,700
You don't avoid s*** because you're afraid of it. You avoid it because it's dirty.

77
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,800
I'm the head of this neighborhood.

78
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,100
Candidate No.1? Give me a freaking break.

79
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,000
 Kang Jeong Do!

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,600
 Kang Jeong Do!

81
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,700
You've worked hard!

82
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,800
 Kang Jeong Do! Kang Jeong Do!

83
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,000
Please vote for him!

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,200
 Kang Jeong Do! Kang Jeong Do!

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,300
It's been a long time, Seung Ryeol.

86
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,100
You've mistaken me for someone else.

87
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,600
Do those words come so easily out of your mouth?

88
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,900
Also...

89
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:04,000
You can't even protect your own family, but you're going to be involved in politics? Even the neighborhood dogs would laugh.

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,500
Why? Is what you did to Hee Kyung not enough? Is that why you're appearing in someone else's neighborhood, waving your flyers and strutting around?

91
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,700
Don't recklessly spit out a promise you can't keep.

92
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,300
Get lost from our neighborhood, you scum!

93
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,200
You piece of scum, this stuff is precious.

94
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,200
Don't be like that.

95
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:39,600
At that time I... couldn't avoid fate's joke.

96
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,400
"Fate's joke"?

97
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,400
I'm sick of hearing this. Is this something you should say when we're meeting after ten years?

98
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,400
Well, I can't lie when I'm meeting you after ten years.

99
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,000
Such an honest person! Such an honest person.

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,200
Why did you make two women cry?

101
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,300
If I'd tricked them,

102
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,600
neither would have cried.

103
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,300
I'm afraid my daughter...

104
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,500
will meet someone like you, you selfish jerk.

105
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,800
We're almost there. But where is this place?

106
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,400
It's a fishing spot.

107
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,800
- Fishing spot? 
 - Yeah.

108
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,400
He said he would leave the world, but he was fishing.

109
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,500
I think we'll have to take a boat to get there.

110
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Ah, right. You said you were afraid of water, right?

111
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,600
Ah, no. Well, only so much. It's not like I'm going into the water anyway.

112
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,400
Let's go.

113
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,000
Stay in the car. I'll go alone and come back.

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's okay.

115
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,900
Have a nap.

116
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,100
I'll be right back. Head.

117
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,800
It suits you.

118
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Welcome!

119
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,600
Yes, have you seen this person?

120
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,700
Ah! This person?

121
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,700
He should be around here somewhere.

122
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,200
Do you want to have a look around?

123
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,400
Ah, yes. Thank you.

124
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,900
Hello.

125
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,600
Yes.

126
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
Can you go this way?

127
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,900
Yes, thank you. Please go back.

128
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,200
- Kim So Eul. 
- What?

129
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,200
Ah, no. I'm sorry.

130
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,800
So Eul!

131
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,700
Hey!

132
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,400
Mr. Art!

133
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,600
Mr. Art! Mr...

134
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,300
So Eul!

135
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,650
So Eul!

136
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,750
So Eul!

137
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:44,330
So Eul!

138
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,310
So Eul.

139
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,380
Mom...

140
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,450
It's okay.

141
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:45,430
â™«  Why did I realize only now  â™«

142
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:48,920
â™«  I really believed that I wasn't  â™«

143
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,510
Only look at me.

144
00:11:52,580 --> 00:12:00,190
â™«  I thought I wouldn't ever say I'm in love  â™«

145
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,660
â™«  I was confident  â™«

146
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,590
â™«  but why am I like this?  â™«

147
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:11,070
â™«  A day flies by when I think of you  â™«

148
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:17,180
â™«  I can't make any excuses  â™«

149
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:22,650
â™«  I always miss you  â™«

150
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,700
Thank you for today.

151
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,450
Do you want to eat ramen before going?

152
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:12,650
But... is it okay to eat ramen here at a gallery like this?

153
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,500
No, it's not okay.

154
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,000
It's okay for you.

155
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,800

156
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,730
 Hyung!

157
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,390
 President!

158
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,510
 It's Yook Ryong!

159
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:42,770
You've... you've... you've...

160
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:46,420
You've made an international call.

161
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,080
You will be charged international fees, so if you don't want to call, hangâ€”

162
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,900
 You've made an international call.

163
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,900
 You will be charged international fees, so ifâ€”

164
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,710
What the heck?

165
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,820
When did he leave?

166
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:11,680
â‚©3,880,000?

167
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,200
Where did everyone go?

168
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,300
Am I the only one left again?

169
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,740
Noona...

170
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,290
Is that okay?

171
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,430
Yes.

172
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:54,540
Go to the second floor. I'll clean this up and bring coffee.

173
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:21,500
 The power is off. You'll be transferred to voicemail. Leave your message after the beep.

174
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,490

175
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,660
Hey! Get in!

176
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,100
Are you awake?

177
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,450
Oh, Noona.

178
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,020
I didn't know where to go so I drive to the gallery. Is that okay?

179
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,860
Yes, it's okay.

180
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,760
My car is here, too.

181
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,370
Next time you go out to drink, call me in advance. I'll wait.

182
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,680
Go in.

183
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,940
Noona.

184
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,620
What?

185
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,250
Do you want to come in for a bit?

186
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:30,290
Ah, but I...

187
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,710
Can I really go in?

188
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,420
It's okay.

189
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:41,700
To be honest, Hoon Nam is out of the country right now.

190
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:49,350
Really? I really wanted to see where you work.

191
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,110
I'll show you.

192
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,390
Thanks for the coffee.

193
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,400
I'll take you back.

194
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:21,500
No, it's okay. You did a lot today. I can go alone.

195
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,000
Wow!

196
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,090
Coach?

197
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:32,090
Wow, that punk. Why I ought to...

198
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,010
Do you like Iron Man?

199
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,930
Yeah!

200
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:51,270
You scared me! Wow, what is this?

201
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,210
It's cute, isn't it?

202
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,390
Yeah. It's really cute.

203
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,780
You're cuter!

204
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,940
Hey, you!

205
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,740
Ugh, really!

206
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,390
Ah, Noona, do you want to drink something?

207
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:27,240
Huh? Should I? Let's.

208
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,920
â™«  I call you  â™«

209
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,950
â™«  I call you  â™«

210
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:10,460
â™«  I call you like this  â™«

211
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:19,710
â™«  I'm even scared to sleep and dream  â™«

212
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:23,290
â™«  In case we drift apart  â™«

213
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:28,190
â™«  And that I'll be alone again  â™«

214
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:34,460
â™«  It doesn't work even if I push you out of my heart  â™«

215
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:41,780
â™«  From the beginning, you were the only one for me  â™«

216
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:04,540
 You've aged a lot.

217
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,360
She's late.

218
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,860
Go in.

219
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,880
I'll go the gallery tomorrow.

220
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,500
Okay.

221
00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:00,130
Sleep well. Go.

222
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,290
I'll go.

223
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,970
I'm back.

224
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:39,570
Why are you only coming now? Come on. The meat's burning.

225
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,280
I'm sorry. I ate already...

226
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,140
You said you'd eat pork belly with us.

227
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,740
It was kind of crazy today.

228
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:50,960
Dad, it was hard for you today, wasn't it? With the check-up.

229
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,410
It was fine, since Joon Soo was with me.

230
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:54,760
That's a relief.

231
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,550
Then, I'll sleep first. I'm tired.

232
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:06,590
Should I call her out to eat?

233
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:09,240
No. Please eat.

234
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,170
Eat a lot and stay strong.

235
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,310
Today's not the only day. It's okay.

236
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,610
What?

237
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:30,670
Jung Eum doesn't know what to look for in guys.

238
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:36,530
She might be into some loser or bum, so you have to do a better job.

239
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:39,810
You know what they say, "It's darkest under a lamp."

240
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,190
You like Jung Eum.

241
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:49,400
Work the home ground advantage.

242
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,560
I'm on your side.

243
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,450
Yes, Father.

244
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,840
Go on, have some.

245
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,220
Eat meat.

246
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:42,830
â™«  Lately, I'm curious about you  â™«

247
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:47,480
â™«  I want to know more  â™«

248
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,520
â™«  In my head I become your other half  â™«

249
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,560
Perfect.

250
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:57,370
â™«  I hastily imagine it  â™«

251
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:02,970
â™«  oh slowly slowly  â™«
	â™«  Can I carefully  â™«

252
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:07,160
â™«  knock on your heart?  â™«

253
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:12,770
â™«  oh slowly slowly  â™«
	â™«  Can I convey  â™«

254
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:17,000
â™«  my feelings so you won't be surprised?  â™«

255
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,030
Shhh.

256
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:26,720
â™«  Even if it's frustrating and disappointing  â™«

257
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:32,460
â™«  oh slowly slowly  â™«	â™«  Even if I'm slow, I'll give you  â™«

258
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:37,490
â™«  my love that's deepening  â™«

259
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,370
It's open.

260
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,140
â™«  I'll walk to the sound of my own drum  â™«

261
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,500
â™«  It goes, they go, we go yeah, yeah, yeah  â™«

262
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,130
â™«  Oh here we go, feel it in my soul  â™«

263
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:20,700
â™«  Really mean it, mean it, so go  â™«

264
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,460
â™«  Gotta feel it, body takes control  â™«

265
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,380
â™«  Really mean it, mean it  â™«

266
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,590
â™«  I wake up to the city of angels  â™«

267
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:48,890
â™«  To see my name headlining the coast  â™«

268
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:52,090
â™«  They say I'm a walking dreamer, baby  â™«

269
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:55,670
â™«  If I stop, they would make the show  â™«

270
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:59,830
â™«  Can't keep up with my rhythm though they keep trying  â™«

271
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,710
â™«  Too quick  â™«

272
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:03,550
Does he listen to this type of music, too?

273
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:06,950
â™«  I walk to the sound of my own drum  â™«

274
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:10,390
â™«  And it goes, they go, we go yeah, yeah, yeah  â™«

275
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,820
Jung Eum will like this.

276
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,980
Is she still sleeping?

277
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,030
She's going to be late.

278
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:46,270
Jung Eum! You have to get up now!

279
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:50,580
Guess what I have in my hands right now? Hmm?

280
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,190
Hey, Yoo Jung Eum! I'm opening the door!

281
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:58,300
I'm going to open the door, Yoo Jung Eum!

282
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,460
Jung Eum isn't there.

283
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,950
Let's eat.

284
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:40,730
Father! Father!

285
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,110
Father.

286
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,790
There's an emergency patient here.

287
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:26,090
Who are you?

288
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:28,330
Me?

289
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,940
Yes.

290
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:35,830
I'm a girl that used to live with Hoon Nam.

291
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,970
Who are you?

292
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:51,190

293
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,320

294
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,660

295
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,690
 It's a relationship where order, manners, and yielding disappears.

296
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:26,780
 It's a relationship where you can play as dirty as you want in the name of love

297
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:30,540
 Dating is cutting in line.

298
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:38,750
â™«  Oh love, I love you, Only U, I'm in big trouble  â™«

299
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:41,780
â™«  I think about you all day  â™«

300
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:45,110
â™«  My heart feels like it'll explode  â™«

301
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,950
â™«  I can't express it in words  â™«

302
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,690

Preview

303
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,230
 Cracorn, text me!

304
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,370
 Tell me I have a text, tell me I have a text!

305
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:54,730
 What do you think of Joon Soo as a man?

306
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,050
 A triple A, of course!
