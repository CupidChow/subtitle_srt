1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,270

2
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,550
You're back, Hyung? No, I mean, Boss.

3
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:26,030
Today's contract was successful.

4
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,200
You must be happy.

5
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,580
You don't sound so enthusiastic.

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,310
But are you crying?

7
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,170
Thank you, Hyung. I mean, Boss.

8
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,380
This was made by a beer master on a private tap. Swirl it first and then try it.

9
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,900
It's like casting pearls before swine, isn't it?

10
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,030
Why are you so grim today, by the way?

11
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,570
I got rejected while eating spicy fish stew today.

12
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,620
Why is my life all early? An early graduation, an early retirement.  
(T/N: early and fish are the same word here)

13
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,270
Why did you eat the spicy fish stew then?

14
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,870
Is that something you eat when you want to confess to someone?

15
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,510
Why doesn't dating work for me?

16
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,120
Are you wearing my pants?

17
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,500
They're designer pants. They look awful on you. Take them off.

18
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,170
Leave it!

19
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,450
Did you say you have five older sisters?

20
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,090
Yes, I'm the sixth child.

21
00:01:55,090 --> 00:02:00,300
Mr. Six, listen to me carefully.

22
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,550
Relationships happen when those with qualifications meet with others with qualifications,

23
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:08,630
where physical ambition and asset compensation mix in a complex manner. It's like a business.

24
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:12,250
For the business to work, you need to have similar interests.

25
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,380
That means you have to make yourself worth something.

26
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,060
That way, the other person will want to invest in you.

27
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,530
And they won't be able to leave so easily because of their investment. Do you understand?

28
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,040
I think that I'm already valuable enough right now.

29
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,980
What I mean is,

30
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:32,220
you have to make yourself desirable. Don't just give yourself away.

31
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,450
What?

32
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:50,420
I told you not to wear socks with holes in them. You have plenty of new ones.

33
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,590
This smell! Ah!

34
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:02,430
Would you look at that? He didn't even open the vitamin supplement. I gave it to him ages ago.

35
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,800
Bang Shik, Bang Shin! Aigoo. Where are you going, Bang Shik?

36
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,780
Oh, you like it? Bang Shik, do you like it that much?

37
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,230
Did you have food? Did you like it?

38
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,600
What did you eat? Mama's here.

39
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,350
I have three puppies.

40
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,310
Should we go running?

41
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,700
Stop running! When are we going to stop?

42
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,030
I'm going to really run then. I'm fast, I'm really fast, I'm fast!

43
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,570
Why? Why? What happened? Don't do it! Really Don't!

44
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,410
♫  I just want you to look at me  ♫

45
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,090
What?

46
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:24,910
♫  Yummy, we'll fly  ♫

47
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,540
Why are you so fast?

48
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:32,710
♫  Because I liked you so much  ♫

49
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,510
♫  I just wanted to hide you away  ♫

50
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,940
♫  When I see you, I'm happy all day  ♫

51
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:46,770
♫  I laugh without realizing it  ♫

52
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,600
- Rock, Paper, Scissors!  
 - I win.

53
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,350
♫  I like this you, My love  ♫

54
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,050
Nice! Always planning ahead.

55
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,480
- Are you relaxed now?  
 - What?

56
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,800
You always come here when you have something on your mind.

57
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,730
You ghost-like person!

58
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,280
I tried going into the water today, actually, but I failed.

59
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,000
- Really? 
 - Yes.

60
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,220
I was going to run in, pretending like I was going to die if I didn't.

61
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,660
But then I felt like dying even before I did it.

62
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,400
I thought I would be okay with it, but it looks like I'm still not.

63
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,780
You've gone halfway though.

64
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,170
The fact that you tried means that you're halfway to success.

65
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,880
That's what I learned from observing my patients who were going through rehabilitation treatment.

66
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,420
The mind comes before the body.

67
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,720
If you try a little harder, you'll be able to start again.

68
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,770
You don't have to cheer me up on purpose.

69
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,610
They say that giving up also takes courage.

70
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:25,710
I'm going to stop being miserable for not realizing my dream.

71
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,400
I just want to go forward little by little

72
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,930
by doing the  things that I can do.

73
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,710
Ah! What kind of person throws out a cigarette butt on school property?

74
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,300
Should we leave now?

75
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,700
- Sleep well! 
 - You, too. Have a good night.

76
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,500
♫  When your legs don't work like they used to before,  ♫

77
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:15,690
♫  And I can't sweep you off of your feet  ♫

78
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,030
Hoon! 
 ♫  Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love  ♫

79
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,240
You're late.

80
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,870
My photo shoot concept meeting ran long. Sorry.

81
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,660
That's okay. Can you take off your hat though?

82
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,020
This hat is like the comb on a chicken or the antlers on a deer. You can't separate it from me.

83
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,170
What about the manuscript?

84
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,080

85
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,650
Great!

86
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:07,710
I really think that  you're gifted in this.

87
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,700
Don't do that. Don't.

88
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:14,850
I'm not. I was too nosy back then.

89
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,500
Oh, Ms. Editor.

90
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,240
Are you preparing the article?

91
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,880
Yes, a friend of mine from back when I was in the army is the director of Toy Gallery.

92
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,110
They're apparently doing a show all about "kidult" stuff. He's on his way here, actually.

93
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:39,270
The word "army" sounds ridiculous coming from you.

94
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,330
I know that you work hard, but

95
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:46,160
I'm not sure if you have what it takes to be an editor.

96
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,790
I don't know how long I can wait.

97
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,750
Is it because

98
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,400
you're simply not good enough?

99
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,480
I don't think you can work with other people.

100
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,440

101
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,700
We picked your column as the winning piece for the competition.

102
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,400
"Men's words are different from women's words."

103
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,250
"Hoon Nam Jung Eum." You're going to compare it with Hunminjeongeum* to talk about the rules of relationships.
 (T/N: a document announcing the creation of the Korean writing system)

104
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,080
- Hoon Nam... Jung Eum...?
 - I finally...

105
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,780
have a reason to keep you around.

106
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,930
We'll publish this.

107
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,760
That's enough. This time is the last time.

108
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,930
The manuscript. This is the last time. It's yours, so you write it.

109
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,350
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

110
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:00,130
I already paved the way for you. You should start doing it yourself.

111
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,490
No, not yet. Help me at least one more time.

112
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,260
Do you know how many times you already asked me "one more time, one more time"?

113
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,370
Nam-ah!

114
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,690
I'm giving it up.

115
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,490
You're so pathetic.

116
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,600
♫  I didn't know love would come to me, too
 I didn't believe in things like that  ♫

117
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,860
♫  I thought it was only a story in a TV drama
 But you appear in front of me, why?  ♫

118
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,840
Hello!

119
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,780
Hi, would you like to take a survey?

120
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,630
Hello! Hae these wet tissues.

121
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:54,740
This is a survey about how single women think about marriage and having children. Here's a pen.

122
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,700
Please, come this way. All you need to do is check boxes.

123
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,880
Could you agree to provide personal information?

124
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,280
Then I will also give you mask packs.

125
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,850
I'm actually from a marriage information company.

126
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,100
We'd like to provide good information about marriage.

127
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,300
You can always hang up on us if you want to.

128
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,280

129
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,310
Mm. Hey.

130
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,560
Thank you! Here are two face packs!

131
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,460
Thank you.

132
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,430
Unnie! What are you selling?

133
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:31,190
Me? I'm selling fate.

134
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,590
Wenches? You're a bad unnie.

135
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:38,300
I'm not selling wenches. How do I explain this?

136
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,690
- Ah, yes, it's like a thread. 
 - Ah!

137
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,520
- This? 
 - No.

138
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,520
Unnie, run!

139
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,870
 Please clear up!

140
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,290
Please move out of the way.

141
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,220
Move out!

142
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,160
Why are you so down?

143
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,750
I was recruiting new members and got busted.

144
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,320
Do you want me to get you a list from my workplace?

145
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,990
I'll get in trouble!

146
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:18,120
Because of laws on personal privacy, you need to get their approval nowadays.

147
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,480
Really? I guess it's not that easy.

148
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,600
I'm the only one who didn't make their quota for the second half of last year.

149
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,640
Ah, Coach, what are you up to these days?

150
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,860
Me? I make the kids exercise.

151
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,770
And I binge-watch dramas when the kids don't exercise.

152
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,080
Do you not think of men?

153
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,020
What men? I'm forty. Living alone is easier.

154
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,000
Why not try, just for fun? Don't you want to try?

155
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,450
You... are you trying to sell this to me?

156
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,860
Please, I'm really desperate.

157
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,120
Could you just sign up for the cheapest one?

158
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,130
No, thanks.

159
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:01,210
You never know. You might end up meeting your soulmate.

160
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:05,280
Soulmate? What nonsense. If you're going to persuade me, do it right.

161
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,240
I've seen those cases! The people who find love later in their lives.

162
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,950
I've seen them show up, saying  that they've started a new life while holding hands.

163
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,120
I'd rather die.

164
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,830
Alright then! Why don't you try it just once? What's really important right now is...

165
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,880
- The quota, right?
 - Yes.

166
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,440
Is this your first real job after you quit swimming?

167
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,020
Yes, I did many part-time jobs as well.

168
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,030
Give me the sign-up sheeet.

169
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:41,520
I don't care about meeting someone. I just want you to do well.

170
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,380
You can't do part-time work forever.

171
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,450
Is it better to do it by the number of dates or by the term?

172
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,380
This is so dirty! So dirty!

173
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,550
Nobody will ever know how dirty he is.

174
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,060

175
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:08,310
What is this? "Hoon Nam Jung Eum."

176
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,790
If it's "Hoon Nam Jung Eum" it means...

177
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:14,650
Isn't this supposed to be the bible for single people?

178
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,290
But what is this doing here?

179
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,110
What are you doing here? Don't clean my room.

180
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,740
But, Hyung, no, Boss—

181
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,230
Could you leave?

182
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,680
What's this? "On her first night,

183
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,570
- Chapter One: Create a scenario before you prepare the condom." 
 - Hey!

184
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,060
Auntie is going to flip out if she finds out.

185
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,770
That's fine. What do you want?

186
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:45,410
First of all, I want the Armani jacket.

187
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,110
And then what?

188
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,060
And...

189
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,370
Can you... help me date?

190
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,180
Forget about it.

191
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,800
I was lying about having a dentist's appointment on Saturday.

192
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,010
I actually have a blind date.

193
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:16,740
Anyway, she said that she knows a good restaurant in Yeojoo. She suggested going on a drive.

194
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,220
So we went and she treated me to a course meal that costs ₩12,000.

195
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,030
Hyung, Hyung, are you even listening to my story?

196
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:27,080
I was so happy, and I remembered there's an outlet mall around,

197
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,710
so I bought her a bag and shoes.

198
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:35,260
Bu... I never heard back from her again.

199
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:39,320
Is it really true that if you buy shoes, she leaves you?

200
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,790
I shouldn't have bought her shoes.

201
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,990
I should've gotten her a belt. I heard if you buy them belts, good things happen.

202
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:49,420
Hyung, what should I do now? I should probably wait for her in front of her office, right?

203
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,650
First of all, get rid of those acupuncture slippers.

204
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,270
These? Why?

205
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,450
They feel so nice.

206
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,890
Can you do it?

207
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,620
Good!

208
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,280
This set is Pooh's friends without Tigger.

209
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,280
And this one is without Eeyore. This one's cheaper, by the way.

210
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,250
I will think about it one more time.

211
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:40,870
Do you like Pooh? I also like him.

212
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,760
 First, find something you have in common with them.

213
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,060
This one has Tigger, and this one has Eeyore.

214
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,290
 Rather than using negative words like "not,"

215
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,480
 use positive words like "has."

216
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,250
They are both very important friends of Pooh.

217
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:59,220
Who would you prefer to take with you, Tigger or Eeyore?

218
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,660
 Rather than asking closed questions that can be answered with "yes" or "no,"

219
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,200
 ask open questions where they have to choose one or the other.

220
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,970
 If you're lucky, they'll choose both.

221
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,130
I'll get both.

222
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,690
Mr. President, no, Mr. Director, I recently signed up for a matchmaking service.

223
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:26,400
And there are a bank teller and a yoga teacher among the members. Which one should I choose?

224
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,300
They're so different in every aspect.

225
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,090
Meet both.

226
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:23,740
♫  We met and fell in love  ♫

227
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,700
Oh, hey.

228
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,820
Get the most expensive one, the one that comes with rhinestones and stuff.

229
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,450
Unnie, could you get her the most expensive one?

230
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,840
No, that's okay. I'll just go with something simple. This one.

231
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,230
Why? I told you to do the expensive one.

232
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:42,470
But, are you really this happy? You look like a different person.

233
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:47,290
I know. I didn't know I'd be like this either. Thank you, Jung Eum.

234
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,550
Like you said, I think I have met my soulmate.

235
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:52,450
I am really happy because of that man.

236
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:55,380
You said you'd never be persuaded.

237
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,850
But still, I am glad that it worked out well, I mean about your soulmate.

238
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:02,400
I felt kind of bad after forcing you to sign up.

239
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,940
I am actually completely jealous of you.

240
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,990
Why? Don't you have that doctor guy?

241
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,250
Oh, no. He's just a friend.

242
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,470
You never know. Look at me.

243
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:16,290
We're never going to be like that. We've known each other since we were kids.

244
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,620
And we had something going on when we were teenagers. I'm apparently not his type.

245
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,390
It could be different now.

246
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,030
Right now, I'm the one that doesn't want to.

247
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,590
Why do you hate a man like him, even when you had a thing?

248
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:30,120
We were just young then. We didn't know any better.

249
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,390
It would be difficult realistically, for him and me.

250
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:37,420
In my experience, you have to be on the same level for there to be no conflicts.

251
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:44,950
Choi Joon Soo is the top tier. And I'm... Anyway, it's statistically impossible.

252
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,670
What statistics? You can overcome anything with love!

253
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,690
You can't overcome it with love. I've seen so many cases.

254
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,790
That's because those instances weren't real love.

255
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:59,660
When you were dating Hoo Bin, you left in the middle of the match to stop him from going abroad.

256
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,530
Don't you remember? Everyone was trying to talk you out of it because he—

257
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,960
That man, are you not going to meet him today?

258
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:11,030
Today? Ah, apparently, today is the one day of the month where he has to file a report.

259
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,090
I'll just have to wait.

260
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,450
Last month's exhibition income from general admission and VIP admission has increased

261
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:22,390
by 13.68% compared to the month before.

262
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,810
We made about ₩200,000,000 in total.

263
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,600
The income from sales and additional investments

264
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,450
increased by 45.736% compared to the previous month.

265
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:33,070
The net income will be about ₩300,000,00.

266
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:36,160
We did better than I expected.

267
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,690
They say that you can't monetize art.

268
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:44,000
It's better than what you're doing, turning affairs into love.

269
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:49,520
Try not to do anything that could damage your father's public image while he's campaigning.

270
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,130
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

271
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:55,860
Choon Nam, make sure you maintain the sanitation grade at the pickled radish factory so you don't get blamed for anything.

272
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,760
Yes.

273
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,790
Hoon Nam, you should pick your exhibitions carefully so that they're not vulgar.

274
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:01,390
Yes.

275
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:04,840
Yook Ryong, you're older than him, but take good care of Hoon Nam.

276
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,660
Yes, Aunt.

277
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:14,130
None of you should ever bring women to your workplaces.

278
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,230
- Yes. 
 - Yes. 
 - Yes.

279
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,560
Don't do this right now! Let's go!

280
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,790
Go back to your seats!

281
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,060
Hello, let us eat.

282
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,690
Uncle Hoon Nam!

283
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,790
Why is Alphago so smart?

284
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,930
It's because it costs twenty-five million dollars.

285
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,500
Eat your food.

286
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,210
Oppa.

287
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:58,170
Give them the cold medicine in thirty minutes.

288
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:58,980
I got it.

289
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,120
You know there's a class to attend tomorrow, right? Can you attend?

290
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,710
Okay, I got it.

291
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,460
You don't like living like this, do you?

292
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,440
How can I be happy about it every day? There are times when I don't like it either.

293
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,610
That's why you shouldn't have gotten married.

294
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,360
At the end of love, there's responsibility.

295
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,500
That's why I don't want to go all the way to the end.

296
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,540
Once it starts, you will have different thoughts.

297
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,430
That's why I will won't even let it start.

298
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,680
I don't want to pretend like I can be responsible.

299
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,930
And it's worse to run away from it.

300
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,450
That's right. Our dad lived like that.

301
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:44,850
But I don't want you to compromise on love because of that.

302
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,060
Are you leaving?

303
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,670
I prefer to be at the gallery. Why don't you sleep over?

304
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:55,930
I also have to go. I have an appointment.

305
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:58,250
At this time?

306
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,820
Aren't you running at it too hard nowadays?

307
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:04,780
I walk too, like speed walking.

308
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,470
I'll never be like my uncle, though.

309
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:12,600
I'm so impressed that he can have an affair with a younger woman at his age.

310
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:16,540
You're so jealous. You're just like him.

311
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,240
Hyung!

312
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:43,030
♫  Lately I'm curious about you  ♫

313
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:47,440
♫  I want to know more  ♫

314
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:52,710
♫  I hastily imagine it  ♫

315
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:57,450
♫  I hastily imagine it  ♫

316
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:03,120
♫  oh slowly slowly  ♫

317
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,260
♫  Can I carefully knock on your heart?  ♫

318
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,050
 Jung Eum.

319
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:35,970
Coach, why are you calling so early?

320
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,090
 Today, the Han River looks so beautiful.

321
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,940
What? Han River?

322
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,730
 I remember seeing this bridge at Park Hills that night.

323
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:46,110
Park Hills?

324
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:58,600
Jung Eum, love fooled me.

325
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,590
What? What happened?

326
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:04,910
He told me I was the only one.

327
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:13,650
He went to a motel with another woman.

328
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:21,440
♫  Another love is leaving me  ♫

329
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,390
♫  During this night  ♫

330
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,080
Coach!

331
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,260
Live well!

332
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,660
Hello?

333
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,420
What is she saying?

334
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,560
 The person you are calling has switched off their phone.

335
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,060
 You can leave your message after the beep.

336
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,200
 Phone is switched off.

337
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,960
 Phone is switched off.

338
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,230
Coach!

339
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:34,530
Oh, no. You're not her. I'm so sorry!

340
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,560
 Hey, you son of a bitch!

341
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,620
Oh, Coach! Coach! What are you doing up there?

342
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,820
I'm going to take the greatest revenge.

343
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,630
Coach!

344
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:35,510
I loved you. A**hole!

345
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,120
No!

346
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,990
 Korea: Kang Seon Hui 
 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10; Difficulty: 10, Penalty: 0.

347
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,290
Does anyone know how to swim?

348
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:21,080
Does anyone know how to swim!?

349
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,190
Thank you!

350
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,350
What are you thanking me for?

351
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,450
Over here, over here!

352
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:01,300
What do we do?

353
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,220
Oh, what to do?

354
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,300
Please save me!

355
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,090
Oh, what to do?

356
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:06,700
- Please help me. 
 - Hey!

357
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,320
Hey!

358
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,120
Hey!

359
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,630
Don't speak! Swim!

360
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:17,840
Oh, no!

361
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,520
What should I do?

362
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,350
Hurry!

363
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,180
Come here, faster, faster!

364
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,260
Over here.

365
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,660
Be careful.

366
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,430
Oh, come here, faster!

367
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,260
Oh, come here fast! Faster!

368
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,080
Hurry!

369
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,050
They're here.

370
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:08,160
Here, here, come up!

371
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,690
Coach, are you okay?

372
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:17,750
Ah, yes, I am fine, but isn't he dead?

373
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,790
Excuse me, are you okay?

374
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:24,340
Hey! Come to your senses!

375
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:28,610
What happened? What should I do? Come to your senses!

376
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:50,880
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!

377
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:12,630

378
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,400
 Please, tell me that I'll never have to see him again.

379
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,020
 This is a competition as well.

380
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,490
 How do you feel when someone steals something of yours?

381
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,490
 Relationships are all about memories. They can be totally different if you flip them upside down.

382
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:30,220
 Different recollections of the same thing.

383
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:33,360
 That's a relationship.

384
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:43,140
♫  Oh love, I love you, Only U 
I'm in big trouble  ♫

385
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:46,200
♫  I think about you all day  ♫

386
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:52,830
♫  My heart feels like it'll explode 
I can't express it in words  ♫

387
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:56,140
♫  I'm falling in love with you forever  ♫

388
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,330

389
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:01,130
 Yoo Jung Eum?

390
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,610
 - Why are you doing this? 
 - What do you mean "why?"

391
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:05,290
 If it was just one person, I wouldn't say anything.

392
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,110
 Eight people at the same time? Are you human?

393
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:09,150
 There's a relationship column called "Hoon Nam Jung Eum."

394
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:11,230
 It's called "Hoon Nam Jung Eum." It's really popular these days.

395
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:14,820
 Why don't you work with professionals like them and give lectures or counseling for relationships?

396
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,660
 I work at a matchmaking company.

397
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,250
 Oh my God!

398
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,290
 Take care of all of them in three months.

399
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:22,970
 Are you talking about the absolutely undateable ones?

400
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,990
 You'd better quit!

401
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:27,160
 You dirty bastards!

402
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,590
 I like the kind of women who are innocent and healthy.

403
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,260
 Someone who feels like a good friend.

404
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:35,060
 I think your love is up to the test.
