1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:05,800

2
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,700
What's this? This happened?

3
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
Excuse me.

4
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,300
You're making me look younger, right?

5
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,500
Yes. Since you rolled your hair into a baby perm, you will look young.

6
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,200
I need to look at least ten years younger.

7
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,700
Ten years, please.

8
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,100
Trust me.

9
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,800
♫  I'm happy all day  ♫

10
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,700
♫  When I see you  ♫

11
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,300
You did a baby perm, so it's ₩345,000.

12
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,700
- How much?
- A baby perm. ₩345,000.

13
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,100
I can't buy the kids chicken...

14
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,500
Here...

15
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,860
The transaction of your baby perm for ₩345,000is complete.

16
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,300
How can I look him in the face?

17
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,100
Should I just act like nothing happened? No, no, that's even weirder.

18
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,800
Should I just say it?

19
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,200
Right, I'm going to give him my body.

20
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,500
Hurry and give it to me.

21
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,000
I've been waiting for you since this morning, why are you so late?

22
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,850
Did you sleep after eating ramen? You're really swollen.

23
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,760
Why aren't you coming in?

24
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,700
Go ahead and get something to drink from the fridge.

25
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,200
Okay.

26
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,700
Look at the way he's displayed each and every one.

27
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,500
You crazy guy.

28
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,700
You must really think about your health a lot.

29
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,700
Do you not know the phrase "a sound body is a sound mind"?

30
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,800
You said you were an athlete.

31
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,500
You couldn't even find this after all this time, even thought you're a professional collector?

32
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,400
When I was looking for it, I couldn't find it.

33
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,060
I found it in a really random place.

34
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,900
About yesterday...

35
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:21,000
Carpe diem! Quam minimum credula postero.

36
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,500
Hold onto today, trust in tomorrow as little as possible.

37
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,900
It's a line from the movie "Dead Poets Society."

38
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,900
Let's just think of now and forget about everything else.

39
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,300
Let's do that. Forget everything.

40
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,700
I will only remember your bad pronunciations from today.

41
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,010
I bet you won't ever forget my amazing pronunciations.

42
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,300
What's the next project?

43
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,300
I want to see those legs as soon as possible.

44
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,700
- I wasn't talking about your legs...
- I know, those legs.

45
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,300
This leg, that leg... there's something more urgent.

46
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,330
Urgent?

47
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:31,700
They said to find only A-list men until Oh Doo Ri is satisfied.

48
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,500
- So? 
 - It's not that easy to find A-list men,

49
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,900
Other managers find them somewhere.

50
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,700
So what are the standards of the A-list?

51
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:45,300
You know, a good education, wealth, career, everything in the top 5%.

52
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,300
If it's those things, I can probably find them close by.

53
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,900
Yook Ryong.

54
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,510
Hey.

55
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,900
I know you're there. You've been caught.

56
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,700
Come here, you've worked hard.

57
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,600
Come here.

58
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,900

59
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,000
No.

60
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,300

61
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,100

62
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,100
No.

63
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,500

64
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,300
No.

65
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,900

66
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,900
No!

67
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,500

68
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,300
- No. 
 - No.

69
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,700

- No!

70
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,700

- No!

71
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,300

- No!

72
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,300

73
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,700
No, no, no, no, no, no!

74
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,400
I can't, I can't do it. Just kill me instead.

75
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,800
Hey, come on.

76
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,500
Please, think about it.

77
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,600
There's gotta be one. There must be, there must be.

78
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,300
There aren't any.

79
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,100
She would say no even if we sat Jung Woo Sung or Lee Jung Jae in front of her.

80
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,200
In these cases, even if she's that unique, there's no point.

81
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,800
Did you just make me do all that for nothing?

82
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,100
You little...!

83
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,700
Can you explain it a little simpler?

84
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,900
These things are called the "primacy effect."

85
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,700

86
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:28,500
When the information that came in first has a much stronger effect than

87
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,500
the information that comes in later.

88
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,500
Who was the first man that Oh Doo Ri met?

89
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,400
Kim So Eul.

90
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Does that even make sense?

91
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,700
That's how dating is.

92
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,300
No, that makes no sense.

93
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,800
Then, maybe you should try and see if it makes sense or not.

94
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,530
Where does Kim So Eul live?

95
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,900
What about Oh Doo Ri?

96
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,400
She said she'll take a taxi.

97
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,300
She said when she's in Seoul, she only stays at hotels so she uses taxis.

98
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,600
What about Kim So Eul?

99
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,100
He's a really nice person, so he readily invited us over.

100
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,700
I just said I'd be bringing some people with me.

101
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,700
He didn't ask, so I didn't tell him who.

102
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,500
It's not like we're tricking them, so there's no need to do all that.

103
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,900
But still, I don't think this is right.

104
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,500
Maybe I should cancel.

105
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,900
No, since it turned out this way, it's going to be either a hit or miss.

106
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,200
♫  something this good will end?  ♫

129
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,900
He said cars can't go in, so we should park here and walk in.

130
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,700
Is he someone who almost lives in the wild?

131
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,600
Kim So Eul says that he doesn't like throwing things away so he doesn't even have a refrigerator.

132
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,900
She's already here.

133
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,800
You're here.

134
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:28,790
All the way here... who do you want to introduce me to?

135
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,300
It's Miss Oh Doo Ri Over Flowers*. 
  (A pun on the drama "Boys Over Flowers.")

136
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,200
This neighborhood is brighter now that you're here.

137
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,850
Well ,the air's pretty nice. Where should I go?

138
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,390
Oh, yes, we just need to walk a little.

139
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:47,020
Over there?

140
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,380
Oh, give this to me.

141
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,910
You've become prettier since the last time I saw you.

142
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:01,480
Oh, not even.

143
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,700
Where are we going?

144
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,580
Oh, really? Oh, what to do!

145
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,450
- Oh, did you do something? 
 - A body massage.

146
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,680
Do you know a good place?

147
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,490
There's really a house here.

148
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,780
Jung Eum, welcome.

149
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,060
It must've been hard coming out all the way here.

150
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,460
Come in.

151
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,780
Thank you.

152
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,540
What is this? What is this? What is this house?

153
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,350
Let's go in.

154
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,120
Well, here it is. This is my house.

155
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,960
This house is very pretty.

156
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:02,450
This is the house I built brick by brick with my own hands.

157
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,340
I can feel your philosophy.

158
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,080
Oh, I'm embarrassed.

159
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,090
Thanks for the exhibition invitation last time.

160
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,830
No, I was more thankful.

161
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:16,230
I don't like this, don't like it. I don't like this house.

162
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,040
Wait here.

163
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,390
I will finish up the seed potatoes I've been planting.

164
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:28,350
No, no, we will do that.

165
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:35,110
That... Jung Eum plants seed potatoes well.

166
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,150
Jung Eum used to be an athlete so the seed potatoes....

167
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,350
I planted a lot during training.

168
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,300
Because the duck walk really helps.

169
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:58,550
You even remember these things, right, Jung Eum?

170
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:04,420
Oh! Sometimes I want to plant them so much that they even fly around in my dreams.

171
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,470
If you insist, then.

172
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,350
Did you guys see the poplar tree while you were coming here?

173
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,150
Yes, we saw.

174
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:15,120
- You saw, right?
 - Yes, we did.

175
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,790
There's actually a field in front it.

176
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,270
We will finish up over there, then.

177
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:24,110
The two of you can speak alone.

178
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,550
Let's go, Jung Eum.

179
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,490
Here.

180
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,180
Oh Doo Ri really isn't getting mad.

181
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,750
I thought she'd flip out.

182
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,420
What did I say? I told you.

183
00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:00,360
Alright, I acknowledge you as an expert. You really are an expert.

184
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,780
Mr. Art.

185
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,910
Yes, Mr. Art.

186
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,810
They are alone so things will go well.

187
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:14,260
We'll go to the poplar tree.

188
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:35,220
Don't stand there like a little kid and come sit here.

189
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,340
I've only lived a stand-up lifestyle.

190
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,870
Oh my God! What do I do!?

191
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,140
What do I do!?

192
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:59,100
A sitting lifestyle isn't too bad either, sit and rest comfortably.

193
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,050
- Are you hungry?
- No!

194
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:23,590
Wait here, I'll prepare something that will fill you up.

195
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:34,960
You're crazy!

196
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,930
Let's see.

197
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,980
This is a poplar tree?

198
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,030
Yes, it looks like it.

199
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,050
Oh, there's seed potatoes there.

200
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:05,890
Oh, there are. Let's go.

201
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,950
What are you doing? Hurry up!

202
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:29,840
♫  Lately I'm curious about you  ♫

203
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,240
♫  I want to know more  ♫

204
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:40,220
♫  In my mind, I become your other half  ♫

205
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,230
What are you doing? Why aren't you helping?

206
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,240
Have you ever seen someone in the arts do fieldwork?

207
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,780
It's doesn't seem like there's much. Hurry, plant them and then rest here.

208
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,300
It's nice and breezy.

209
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:54,940
Wow.

210
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:59,220
♫  There's no love like this in movies  ♫

211
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:04,080
♫  That's what I believe  ♫

212
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,010
♫  I'm excited for the first time in a while  ♫

♫  I smile for no reason  ♫

214

216
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:29,180
♫  oh slowly slowly  ♫
	♫  Can I convey   ♫

217
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:33,310
♫  my feelings so you won't be surprised?  ♫

218
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:38,340
♫  My clumsiness  ♫

219

223
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:08,370

	♫  Even if I'm slow, I'll give you  ♫

224
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:13,880
♫  my deepening love  ♫

225
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,160
This is strangely addicting.

226
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:36,910
I like that I'm not thinking.

227
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,390
She's having fun while working.

228
00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:02,080
Should I dig up this much?

229
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,960
Yes, that much.

230
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,420
Okay, then dig up mine, too.

231
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,340
You do it.

232
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,830
How childish.

233
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,220
Give me some potato seeds.

234
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,680
It's "seed potatoes."

235
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,850
Potato seeds, seed potatoes, same thing.

236
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:19,350
They are very different.

237
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,380
But you know...

238
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,640
This really is quite addicting.

239
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,070
Right, right? It's fun.

240
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,320
What's this?

241
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,910
What is?

242
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:11,730
It feels different, like some really big beetle—

243
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:22,200
What? You're scared of bugs?

244
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,720
I'm not sure if you'll like this.

245
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,570
I'll eat well.

246
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:59,010
But when I eat pasta, I have to drink coffee.

247
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,120
Well, I'm sure this country side neighborhood doesn't have it.

248
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,490
- It does! 
- It does?

249
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,340
Although we have to go out a bit, we have everything we need.

250
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,150
Really?

251
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:14,030
But... we don't have a car.

252
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,720
Wait a little.

253
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:25,550
What's going on, is he about to bring out a sports car?

254
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,670
 Get in!

255
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,910
Giddyup.

256
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,730
Giddyup.

257
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,440
It's nice.

258
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:58,180
Will you be okay?

259
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,600
Yes, I'll be fine.

260
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,550
Do you think you can do it?

261
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,900
I can do it.

262
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,710
If you have anything to say, you can say it while jumping.

263
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,250
Yes.

264
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,860
Are you ready?

265
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,480
Let's go.

266
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,060
Are you ready?

267
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,190
Yes.

268
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:41,980
Three. Two. One.

269
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,520
I don't want to go back!

270
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:52,830
 I don't want to go back!

271
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,220
Would you like to order?

272
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:21,020
The same one I always drink.

273
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,590
- Syrup?
- Two!

274
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,870
Two pumps of syrup.

275
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,910
It's so nice!

276
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,160
Giddyup.

277
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,810
Giddyup.

278
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:51,930
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

279
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:03,110
Thank you for everything.

280
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,130
I'm glad you're thankful.

281
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:09,420
What should we do now?

282
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:15,620
Since we had some coffee, you can go.

283
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,530
Eh?

284
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:21,480
This is the end of what I can do for a person.

285
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,950
Our connection seems to end here.

286
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,640
Kim—Kim So Eul...

287
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,440
So tiring...

288
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,100
What do you think they're doing?

289
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:03,250
I'm not sure. A man and a woman alone in a house, what would they be doing?

290
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:06,120
Shouldn't we wait until later, then go in?

291
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,010
Do you want to ride a bike?

292
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:13,580
No, I don't want to.

293
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,480
Why not? We can ride the bike and have fun and go in later.

294
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,190
No.

295
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:20,140
Why? Let's ride it!

296
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,210
It's annoying. No.

297
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:27,160
What is this? By any chance, do you not know how to ride a bike?

298
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,170
You really can't ride one!

299
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,950
I don't want to ride one.

300
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,100
Look here, you can't ride a bike.

301
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,660
Who says I can't ride one? I'm not riding! I just don't want to.

302
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,230
- You can't ride a bike. 
- That's not it!

303
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,450
Then try riding it.

304
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,630
I'm dumbfounded.

305
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,080
Are you okay?

306
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,490
I don't want to ride it.

307
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,390
How can you not know how to ride a bike?

308
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:31,890
What did you do when you were younger?

309
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:36,650
I'll teach you, you'll learn fast.

310
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:39,730
Ride it again, come here.

311
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,500
Don't let go.

312
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,820
You don't trust me?

313
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,710
Start!

314
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:03,490
Oh Doo Ri?

315
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,100
Where is Oh Doo Ri going?

316
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,110
Hey!

317
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:16,110
Get on!

318
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,560
Oh, Oh Door Ri.

319
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,760
Hurry, hurry hurry!

320
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:25,780
Oh Doo Ri! Oh Doo Ri!

321
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,150
Hurry and go!

322
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,970
Call her.

323
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,610
I have no battery.

324
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,190
What do you think happened?

325
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,550
I'm not sure.

326
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,490
What should we do?

327
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:17,080
Let's think of it while we go back to Seoul.

328
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,660
Okay.

329
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,820
My car key...

330
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,900
You don't have it?

331
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,180
No.

332
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,750
You really don't have it? Look for it carefully.

333
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:40,580
I put it in my pants pocket, but I think at the seed potato farm...

334
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,790
What is it?

335
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:47,690
It feels different, like some really big beetle—

336
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:55,720

337
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,890
Do you think maybe...?

338
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,920
That beetle...

339
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,300
Car, car key?

340
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,050

341
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:05,730
 It's easy to go in, but hard to come out.

342
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:09,220
 It's like trying to reach that sole  exit through

343
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:13,160
 a continuation of a complicated and confusing crossroads.

344
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,610
 Dating is a maze.

345
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:23,210
♫  Oh love, I love you, only U  ♫
♫  I'm in big trouble  ♫

346
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:26,260
♫  I think about you all day  ♫

347
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:29,530
♫  My heart feels like it'll explode  ♫

348
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:32,790
♫  I can't express it in words  ♫

349
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:36,090
♫  I'm falling in love with you forever  ♫

350
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,540
♫  I'm feeling like I'm feeling this is love  ♫

351
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,620

Episode Preview
♫  I'm feeling good I'm feeling this is love  ♫

352
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,300
She's crazy, she's crazy. Does she even know what time it is?

353
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,430
 I will be gone for a while. Don't look for me.

354
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,950
 Let's just look for something.

355
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,350
You said you didn't want any.

356
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:52,420
These are specialties. Steamed potatoes are full of nutrients.

357
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,090
 The mind controls the body, not the other way around.

358
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:57,760
 I don't know, maybe he's a pervert.

359
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,530
 Hoon Nam changed. Is he dating?

360
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:04,230
 Jung Eum said it wasn't. I trust her.

361
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,370
Then, do you have anything interesting you look for in men?

362
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,990
A man who's good at driving in reverse?

363
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:08,600
 In reverse?

364
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,020
 That's really sexy to me.

365
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,490
I'm dying of pain!

366
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,570
You're such an elementary school kid!

367
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,790
You have no athletic abilities.

368
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,460
 I'm just going to go forward.

369
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:24,110
 I feel him coming towards me.

370
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,700
♫  Your love, could it be this good?  ♫
