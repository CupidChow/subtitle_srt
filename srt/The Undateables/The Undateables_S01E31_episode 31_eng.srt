1
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:37,680

2
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,500
Oh, what about this jacket style?

3
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,790
Nowadays, even the dresses have become chic,

4
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,990
so this redesigned jacket style is very in.

5
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,430
For me,  it's this one. This style is sexy, yet sophisticated.

6
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,380
It's also his signature design.

7
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,100
Charlie! You're so sharp.

8
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,530
Anyway, I think you that should pick based on the bride's preferences.

9
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,950
What design would you like to proceed with?

10
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,300
This one.

11
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,880
All right, bride and groom! If you're ready, please come out.

12
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,150
Wow.

13
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,460
You're such a beautiful bride!

14
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,520
I'm comfortable in formal attire because I've been parties so often.

15
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,720
You look better in a tux than a hanbok, Kim So Eul.

16
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,700
Oh! Doesn't it seem a little awkward?

17
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,390
It feels like I've suddenly put on a wig.

18
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:48,600
Something is missing.

19
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,350
Hat. I'll prepare a hat.

20
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,700
Thank you.

21
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,250
Oh, my goodness. You look beautiful.

22
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,920
I know.

23
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,910
Don't go overboard.

24
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:11,500
I know, right?

25
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,700
You need to come back in one week for a fitting.

26
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,390
I have work to discuss with the designer, so I'll head back inside.

27
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,680
Thanks to you, Charlie, I got to try on his dresses.

28
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,430
- Merci beaucoup.
 - You're welcome.

29
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,300
Then, I'll be going now. Please, go safely. I'll call you later.

30
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,680
Thank you.

31
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,710
Go on.

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,650
Jung Eum, please pass this to Sun Hwa— I mean, Team Leader Bong.

33
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,430
What should I say when I give it to her?

34
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,550
She'll just know what it is.

35
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:50,470
Oh, and the man that did the chocolates for that event.

36
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,060
I was hoping to hire him to make wedding desserts.

37
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,880
Oh! Ah, yes, I'll contact him.

38
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,270
Then, I'll see you next week.

39
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,180
I'll see you next week. Please, return safely.

40
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,880
- Shall we go?
 - Shall we go?

41
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,290
- I'm hungry. What should we eat?
 - Ah... Jjampong?

42
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,590
Jjampong? Let's!

43
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,240
Didn't they say that they're having a small wedding?

44
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,860
That's the thing.

45
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,430
Let's go.

46
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,500
I have to go back to work. I'll go to the gallery tomorrow.

47
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,540
Oh-ho, are you neglecting me just because you have me now?

48
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,950
I'm sorry. Ah, I'm a wedding planner when that's not even written in my stars.

49
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:33,420
I only get paid if Oh Doo Ri's wedding is a success.

50
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:38,010
Getting paid is most important. I'll take you to work.

51
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,000
- Here.
 - What is this?

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,420
Oh Doo Ri said you'd know when you saw it.

53
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,440
That's funny. What would I know just by seeing it?

54
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,700
How's the wedding planning going?

55
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,420
Still on pins and needles.

56
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,600
Don't get relaxed just yet.

57
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,220
President Woo said he'll make the payment as soon as they've entered into marriage.

58
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,320
That's the day we'll get promoted.

59
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,480
That's why I'm wedding planning so tirelessly.

60
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,190
Once that's done, is Kang Hoon Nam the last one?

61
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,210
Yes.

62
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:23,620
Isn't it weird? He's got that face and those qualifications.

63
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,810
Could he be sick?

64
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,130
I'll get going now, then.

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,210
What is this now?

66
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,040
Oh, my gosh. Really—

67
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,460
 It's hot. Take off all that warm attire.

68
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:10,880
 Don't be too grateful. My dad taught me these manners.

69
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,200
Oh Doo Ri, you... seriously...

70
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,070
The ceremony will be officiated by Cho Sung. Soo Hee is taking care of the decor at the wedding hall.

71
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:29,070
Catering will be done Mr. Kil. Dessert will be handled by Mr. Ahn. All that's left is the wedding singer and musician.

72
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,670
I'll handle the wedding singer. And the musicians, too.

73
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,100
I'd be grateful.

74
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,280
But... ah, this is the biggest problem.

75
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,900
- You're having a small wedding?
 - Yes.

76
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,220
We don't want more than that. And a fancy wedding is too luxurious.

77
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,420
I was taught to think this way by my father.

78
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,410
Well, for me, I don't need a fancy ceremony.

79
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,740
But I can't just take her away like that.

80
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,280
So that's why, for our wedding...

81
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,460
Could you two plan it?

82
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,020
Act as our wedding planners?

83
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,570
Of course. For you two, it's a truly meaningful time.

84
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:21,980
Jung Eum will be great at planning. I'll help, too.

85
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,900
One more favor.

86
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,180
It's been a while since I was last social out in the world.

87
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,350
I don't really have anyone to call.

88
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,190
Me either.

89
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,190
I don't really have many friends.

90
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:43,120
How can we be so similar?

91
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,490
That's what I'm saying.

92
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,730
Since we won't have an officiant, we'll need a bridal party.

93
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:00,790
Could you two find us a bridesmaid and groomsman?

94
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,830
We can't really do that for you because

95
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,930
those roles are usually filled by those close to the bride and groom.

96
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,850
I'll look for people to fill in the bridal party.

97
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:13,160
We'll take care of it and find some people for you. Don't worry.

98
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,300
That's great.

99
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,660
Bridal party. The bridal party is the biggest problem.

100
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,430
I knew you that had answered without thinking.

101
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,560
There needs to be three people each for bride and groom.

102
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,040
Oh! We can't ask complete strangers.

103
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,540
We might be able to find them closer to us than we think.

104
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,960
I told you not to.

105
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,910
I'll do it. I'll do it. Noona, you go rest. Go rest.

106
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,610
Really?

107
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,880
Then, while you're at it, clean under the desk and the sink, too.

108
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,520
They're sticky.

109
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,470
All right! I'll do all of it.

110
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,150
What is this?

111
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,800
When did you buy this?

112
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,730
It's not like that. My kids bought it.

113
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,140
Wait. The kids

114
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:28,180
are so great. Let's try them on.

115
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,400
Oh! Yook Ryong, your phone.

116
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,830
I have nothing urgent. Let's go try them on.

117
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,850
OH! Me! Me! My phone.

118
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,350
Oh. Come on.

119
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:42,470
Stop it. It might be important.

120
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:50,380
It's Jung Eum. Yes, Jung Eum? Yook Ryong?

121
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,200
Yes.

122
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,340
Hoon Nam says that he knows that you're trying to signal that you're not here. Just answer the phone.

123
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,960
What's up?

124
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,200
- Yes, boss.

125
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,570
What?

126
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,570
- Bridal party? 
 - Bridal party?

127
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,120
You can go surfing now. Thank you for everything until now.

128
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,830
I didn't do much. The good doctor has suffered because of his delinquent patient.

129
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,120
So, you're acknowledging my hard work?

130
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,480
You really need to be careful now.

131
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,960
I can only see you again if I'm not careful, right?

132
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,180
I won't be in Korea for a while.

133
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,530
Are you going somewhere?

134
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,480
Excuse me.

135
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,260
Oh, Jung Eum?

136
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,000
What's up, Hoon Nam Oppa?

137
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,040
- Bridal party?
- Bridal party?

138
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:50,900
So, you're asking me and Soo Ji to be in a bridal party?

139
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,810
We don't even know them that well.

140
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,930
How could you not? You've heard so much from me.

141
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,450
No, wait, but what about me?

142
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,120
Don't you like Bari Bari Girls?

143
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,720
Oh Doo Ri is a famous collector of Bari Bari Girls.

144
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,480
Jung Eum, we're here!

145
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,250
Hello.

146
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,600
We got them.

147
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,340
Hello.

148
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,680
How can the bridesmaid look prettier than the bride? 
♫  Oh love, I love you, Only U, I'm in big trouble  ♫

149
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,510
Are you a doll or a person?

150
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:36,470
Too pretty. 
 ♫  I think about you all day  ♫ 
 	♫  My heart  ♫

151
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,140
Wow.

152
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,810
Let's pick. 
 ♫  I can't express it in words  ♫

153
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,340
More than the flowers.
  	♫  I'm falling in love with you forever  ♫

154
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,560
You are more beautiful. 
  	♫  I'm falling in love with you forever  ♫

155
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,030
I've pulled a list of honeymoon spots. Would you like to see?

156
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,800
The Maldives. I like it.

157
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,980
Pass, please.

158
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,000
- I like it!
 - Pass, please.

159
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,980
- For a honeymoon, it's got to be the Bulguksa Temple. 
 - Seriously?
- I'm going home then.

160
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,530
- No! 
- You can't do that.
- Let's look at some more.

161
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,460
Ah, so tiring.

162
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,530
We just need to send the invitations.

163
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,210
This is why you're not supposed to get married more than once.

164
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,640
Were you going to get married twice?

165
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,860
Who knows? I might get married two or even three times.

166
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,480
This woman is going to be trouble.

167
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,100
You plan on doing this twice?

168
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,710
I didn't say who I was going to marry.

169
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:36,030
That's not important, since you'll be marrying me anyway.

170
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,960
Yes, Oh Doo Ri? I was just about to call you.

171
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:49,320
What? The wedding is... cancelled?

172
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,030
What are you doing here, Editor?

173
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,890
Is it true that there's another person who actually writes Hoon Nam Jung Eum?

174
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:14,150
Charlie, this is a moment that requires explanation.

175
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:31,500
I... just... trusted him!

176
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,580
I believed that... So Eul and Doo Ri... were becoming one.

177
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,930
I believed in that!

178
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,050
But...!

179
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,050
Drink this.

180
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,360
Oh Doo Ri.

181
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,810
Can you calm down and tell me what happened?

182
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,230
Tell me slowly.

183
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:01,830
Jung Eum, you know that I'm normally a size 44 1/2, right?

184
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,290
Size 44 1/2?

185
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,940
Of course, I know that.

186
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,210
- But?
 - Since I was a little girl,

187
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:11,520
my dream has been to have a beautiful wedding.

188
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,670
So, on my wedding day, I wanted to look even prettier.

189
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,260
I've been dieting.

190
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,990
Look at my sunken cheeks! What am I going to do?

191
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,990
For three weeks,

192
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,650
I've only eaten cucumbers.

193
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,640
Cucumber in the morning.

194
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,850
 Cucumber for lunch.

195
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,700
 Cucumber for snacks!

196
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:56,450
I've been holding back and waiting for my wedding.

197
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:00,430
Even elephants that eat only grass are huge...

198
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,510
And so, what happened?

199
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,070
It was yesterday.

200
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,800
I still hadn't gotten a proposal from him.

201
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,620
To be honest, I wasn't expecting much.

202
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,600
Are we there yet?

203
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,850
Where are we going?

204
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,900
Don't peek.

205
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,090
You can't.

206
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:24,150
Almost there. Almost there. Tah-dah!

207
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:27,080
Oh, my goodness! What is all this?

208
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,110
Oh, my! "I will only race for your heart."

209
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,120
I love it!

210
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,250
Catch me if you can!

211
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,240
Let's go.

212
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,170
We're here.

213
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:49,650
Will you marry me?

214
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,230
Yes!

215
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,630
Phew!

216
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,180
- What's wrong with this? 
 - Push harder.

217
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,820
Harder?

218
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,660
I'll do it.

219
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,590
You do it.

220
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,020
That was even worse than telling me to diet!

221
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,560
So, you're calling off the wedding? Are you crazy?

222
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,560
From what I've heard,

223
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,870
I think it's not just Oh Doo Ri who got her feelings hurt,

224
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:50,580
but Kim So Eul, as well.

225
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,410
Proposals aren't just about the person that's being proposed to.

226
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:58,720
The one doing the proposing requires courage.

227
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,970
He didn't know that he was going to get rejected.

228
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:03,530
You rejected him.

229
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,570
But, I...

230
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:10,040
Do you know where Kim So Eul is?

231
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,310
His phone is turned off.

232
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,930
Rook Yong, I'm sorry but

233
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:19,120
that friend of yours that does locating, let's ask him for help.

234
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,390
All right.

235
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,700
Isn't today the bridal party rehearsal?

236
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,910
We need to fix a problem first.

237
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,580
You ladies stay here and talk.

238
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,100
Joon Soo and I will be back. Let's go, Joon Soo.

239
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,750
Me?

240
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,790
- Hello.
 - Ah, yes, hello.

241
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,610
Water is water.

242
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,170
Mountain is mountain.

243
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,880
Kim So Eul.

244
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,420
You're so admirable.

245
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:16,230
How did you find this place?

246
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:22,060
I'm the admirable one.

247
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:25,250
I heard what happened.

248
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,730
How could such a delicate woman

249
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:32,020
have such thick fingers?

250
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,660
I would've never imagined.

251
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,850
He said delicate!

252
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:43,090
I think that she's just overwhelmed by the wedding.

253
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,260
No, even if that's the case,

254
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:49,420
how could she call it off for that? Oh, women are so...

255
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,410
Call off the wedding?

256
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,320
It's not "just that." Before the wedding, women are—

257
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,120
It is all

258
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,670
my fault.

259
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:05,850
However, this is such a small thing to call off the wedding over.

260
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:09,060
I don't know if I can spend the rest of my days with someone like that.

261
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,670
It makes me think.

262
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,710
If I get dragged around like this now,

263
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:20,370
I'll need to get permission for everything later on.

264
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,680
You're right! That's how I've been feeling lately.

265
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,880
Don't allow yourself to get pushed around in the beginning.

266
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,510
- First, let's go back to the gallery—
- You can't!

267
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,480
The enemies are stationed there right now!

268
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,990
Are you referring to the ladies as the enemies?

269
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,490
Then, I cannot go there!

270
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:49,120
All right. Even I don't think it's good to go now.

271
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,940
Then... where will we go?

272
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,460
I know a good place.

273
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,620
Meeting like this is fate, too.

274
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,400
Oh, my...

275
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,180
It's plum wine.

276
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,530
Cheers.

277
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,770
- Thank you. 
 - Cheers.

278
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,240
Go ahead.

279
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,600
- How does it taste?
 - It's tasty! It's tasty!

280
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,580
One more?

281
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,630
Have some more.

282
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,030
We made it ourselves.

283
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,190
Kim So Eul, success!

284
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,100
Jung Eum, what are you doing? Come quickly!

285
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,610
Okay.

286
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,950
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

287
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,820
So refreshing.

288
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,360
It'll be delicious.

289
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,630
Why'd you order so much?

290
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,620
Do you want one?

291
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,870
No, it's okay. I'm only eating cucumbers.

292
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,810
Right? Isn't that true?

293
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:17,880
His height was great, but I told you.

294
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:24,300
Do you guys think I'm in the wrong?

295
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,620
Isn't it a bit much?

296
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,190
How could he propose with the wrong ring size?

297
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,660
Really! I don't think that's right.

298
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,370
Right?

299
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,620
To me, it's all the same pink.

300
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,360
BBB Pink, coral pink, peach pink, hot pink.

301
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,300
There are so many different pinks. He doesn't even notice if I'm wearing something different.

302
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,110
That's what I'm saying.

303
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,490
Even if no words are said...

304
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,580
...everything, just everything...

305
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,570
... should be understood.

306
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:51,700
I want a relationship where we talk about everything together.

307
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,710
Why do women compare us with other men?

308
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:58,280
Why do men stare at other women?

309
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,220
- Really! 
 - Seriously!

310
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,780
Even when we're together!

311
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,860
Even when you're together?

312
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,490
I can't understand women at all.

313
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:07,590
I really can't figure out men.

314
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,000
I have a friend who just got married.

315
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So, I asked how it feels after getting married.

316
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,190
And they say...

317
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,380
Imagine that your came over to hang out.

318
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,220
You ate lots of food and have fun,

319
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,140
but at the end, she won't go home.

320
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,970
You need to send her home so you can play video games

321
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,520
and do the things that you need to do.

322
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:31,250
Imagine that your mom goes away on vacation, so you need to take care of your younger brother.

323
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,780
You feed him, play with him, and clean up after him, but your mom doesn't return.

324
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,970
Marriage is like that.

325
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:40,720
- No way! 
 -  Oh, wow!

326
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,780
I totally get it!

327
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,650
My goodness.

328
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:49,580
That's what marriage is, though.

329
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:54,790
Two complete strangers get together and spend every day together.

330
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,820
They eat, sleep, laugh, and cry together,

331
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,800
they fight together and then make up. That's what marriage is.

332
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,930
Then, why get married?

333
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:03,860
I'm sorry, Father.

334
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,630
No, no, no. That was a good question.

335
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:12,580
Why marry? Because God cannot tend to each being.

336
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:16,790
So instead of God, do you know what acts in his place?

337
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,260
I'm not sure.

338
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:22,220
Not sure? That means you don't know.

339
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,150
It's family.

340
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:28,390
When everything's going well, we don't look, but when things get bad, we look for God.

341
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,820
That's what family is.

342
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,660
When there's no one else around, they'll still be there for me.

343
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,080
That's why you get married, so that you can be family for one another.

344
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,100
You understand, right?

345
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,510
I get it.

346
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,690
He gets it. Then, lets have a drink.

347
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:45,380
Cheers.

348
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,510
How did you find this place?

349
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:55,640
Yook Ryong let me know.

350
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,090
Charlie Hyung was urgently looking for you, Boss.

351
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,710
Hoon Nam.

352
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:06,050
I got caught lying about writing Hoon Nam Jung Eum.

353
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,700
It's all over!

354
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,740
Just have a little bit.

355
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:25,400
I can only eat cucumbers these days.

356
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,760
How about this one?

357
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,440
No, it's okay.

358
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,880
It's ok—

359
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,150
I'm sorry.

360
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,610
Oh Doo Ri! Oh Doo Ri!

361
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:47,960
She said that all she ate was cucumbers, so why? Is she...?

362
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,290
That's right. Usually, in dramas, when they do that, it means they're pregnant.

363
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,420
Now, let's have another...

364
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,460
What to do?

365
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,460
Hoon Nam. What do I do now?

366
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,350
What can I do?

367
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:13,620
What can you do? You have to end Hoon Nam Jung Eum.

368
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:20,530
You only say that so carelessly because it has nothing to do with you.

369
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:26,160
Get rid of Hoon Nam Jung Eum and rewrite it with your name.

370
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,160
What if the editor says no?

371
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,390
If the column you write is good, why would she say no?

372
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:37,670
Stop making excuses.

373
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:41,770
Get it together and pick yourself up.

374
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:47,390
Rewrite Hoon Nam Jung Eum from the beginning.

375
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,530
Hello?

376
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,360
- Hello?
 - Yes?

377
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,520
- What?
 - Oh Doo Ri is?

378
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:09,910
I was completely in the wrong!

379
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,350
Oh Doo Ri! Oh Doo Ri!

380
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,660
Marriage is supposed to be forming a family.

381
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,920
Are we really having a family?

382
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,420
Yes!

383
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:33,990
Do you want to eat anything?

384
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,890
What about that pasta?

385
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:44,230
Let's go eat pasta! You think that I can't get you pasta?

386
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,450
Let's go!

387
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:49,140
Move aside!

388
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,830
Hoon Nam!

389
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:56,520
Hyung!

390
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,260
Mother...

391
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,550
Mother?

392
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:04,320
She's left home.

393
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,230
She's disappeared. She only took the table.

394
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,100
Why the table?

395
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,650
That table was a gift from her parents.

396
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,580
She's always treasured it.

397
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,480
She left without saying anything?

398
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,370
She left this and disappeared.

399
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:37,050
 Our family has gotten up to here well.

400
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:40,200
 After seeing things that I should and shouldn't have,

401
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,960
 I have no regrets.

402
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,360
 We loved enough and hated enough.

403
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,570
 It's now time for me to find myself.

404
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:52,970
 Don't worry. I will take "table" with me.

405
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:56,820
Hoon Nam, any ideas?

406
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,200
 Let me be like this.

407
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,430
 I've been preparing for this for a while.

408
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,820
 I have no regrets.

409
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,760
I'm sorry. I should've suspected something earlier.

410
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,430
Even if you had, nothing would've changed.

411
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,170
Don't worry too much.

412
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:18,570
Mom just needs time for herself.

413
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,290
I'm back.

414
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:25,240
You're coming in now?

415
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,290
Did you have dinner?

416
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:30,390
I have no appetite.

417
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,030
What's with the long face? Did you fight with Hoon Nam?

418
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,390
No.

419
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:50,430
Dad. Hoon Nam's mother...

420
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,130
She mentioned that she was looking for a room.

421
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,990
 You must be a teacher at the center?

422
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:04,980
 I'm also looking for a place to live by myself.

423
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,260
Huh? What did you say?

424
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:11,110
No, no, no. It's nothing. They can't get in contact her?

425
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,200
She won't even answer her phone.

426
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,100
Really?

427
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,130
 Hello. I came to learn after hearing about your class.

428
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:26,820
 I've had a lot on my mind lately. Sewing this is really clearing my thoughts.

429
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:30,620
Am I supposed to say something or not?

430
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,790
What is it?

431
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,400
To be honest...

432
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:36,800
