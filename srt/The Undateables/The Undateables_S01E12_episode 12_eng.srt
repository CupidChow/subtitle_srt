1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,750
I'm so exhausted! I'm so exhausted!

2
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,180
Let's hurry and go to the field to find the car keys.

3
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,840
The whole day is about to pass by.

4
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,680
Oh, alright.

5
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,610
 Don't just shake them. Look and see if the keys are in there.

6
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,600
 Ah! I already said they're not here!

7
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,260
 Yeah? Are you sure? Did you look carefully?

8
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:59,610

9
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,640
What are you trying to pull?

10
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,230
You're surprised to get your hand grabbed when you have my keys in there, huh?

11
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,090
You're so athletic at times like this.

12
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,900
I definitely told you to look for this yesterday.

13
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,000
If you had found this yesterday, we wouldn't have suffered like this!

14
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,380
Sorry.

15
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:48,190
It's just that, you know... I'm sorry.

16
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,210
Things are just getting twisted. I'll never do it again.

17
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,240
I'm going to really check from now on and everything, okay?

18
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,920
Please take me with you. Please.

19
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,650
I suppose you can ride the bicycle back to Seoul. You ride it so well.

20
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:06,760
But I carried all the potatoes because I thought you were going to die from starvation.

21
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,660
Then I'll see you in Seoul.

22
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,090
No! Let's go together.

23
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,650
Then, I'll take my luggage at least!

24
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,320
Mr. Art.

25
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,730
Oh, really!

26
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:26,750
Excuse me! You have to give me my bag!

27
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,420
What am I supposed to do if you take my bag? How am I supposed to go?

28
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,620
Ugh!

29
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,020
Sitting and praying to the Buddha.

30
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,730
I don't know what to think of this.

31
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,700
How many cups did you have?

32
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,870
How did you know I was here?

33
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,690
What do you mean "how"?

34
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:48,310
Your father, Chairman Oh Yeong Seok, called early in the morning to tell me that I must take responsibility, so—

35
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,410
My dad usually sleeps through the morning...

36
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,880
He called so many times while I was on my way here.

37
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,090
Hey, my battery is going to wear out.

38
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,450
What did Dad say?

39
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,570
What do you think? He said you've stopped eating and drinking since last night.

40
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,990
He said that if you don't eat, he'll immediately come to Seoul.

41
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:07,840
He raised hell with the resort employees and all. He basically turned Jeju Island upside down.

42
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,040
Does he know about that person, too?

43
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,060
Who? Kim So Eul?

44
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,990
He doesn't.

45
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,420
His phone is off.

46
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,900
 The power is off. You'll be redirected to voicemail.

47
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,310
Yoo Jung Eum, what are you doing that your phone is still off now?

48
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,060
This person. Why I ought to—!

49
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,530
Don't blame Jung Eum.

50
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,890
It wasn't fate.

51
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:40,290
If you had nothing since last night, that means you only missed breakfast this morning, right?

52
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,430
I feel like it was all my fault.

53
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,680
 I may not have any manners, but

54
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,730
 you don't even have hair!

55
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,000
I even called him bald.

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,460
You talked about how he was bald!?

57
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,690
 I don't like it. I don't like this house.

58
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,750
I said his house sucked as well.

59
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,980
You said his house sucked?

60
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,430
Pasta. Coffee.

61
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:19,380
He put in his entire soul into everything.

62
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,650
You're lucky you didn't get slapped.

63
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,530
Hey, stop your sobbing already.

64
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,470
Get up. Let's go eat.

65
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,940
I don't want to eat. I have no appetite.

66
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:40,990
If you drank this much coffee with whipped cream, it's not that you have no appetite, but that you're already full!

67
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,230
My heart keeps beating.

68
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:48,120
If you keep drinking coffee, you're going to die!

69
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,100
What do you know!?

70
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,840
Do you know what it's like to drink caffé mocha in a cow cart?

71
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,630
Cow... cow what?

72
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,660
I don't know. I don't know!

73
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,170
For now, let's get out of here.

74
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,780
No! I can't go out!

75
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,480
Why?

76
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,470
I can't leave Sobok Coffee Shop.

77
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,060

78
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,600
Yes, this is heaven.

79
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,170
♪ You are the only love of mine forever ♪

80
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:34,210
- ♪ Whoa! ♪
 - ♪ Whoa, whoa. ♪

81
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,510
Having the time of your life, eh?

82
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:41,440
What about you? Were you studying on Mount Gyeryongsan?

83
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,850
I was riding a bicycle. Take this in for dry cleaning.

84
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,370
You look like you've been riding on a rickshaw.

85
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,860
Ugh, this is dirty.

86
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,260
It's money! Dirty, dirty.

87
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,140
I was going to give it to you.

88
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:21,650
Don't. I never forget even ten cents of my money.

89
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,400
Does your shoulder suddenly hurt?

90
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,450
Take this in, too.

91
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,580
I said that's not it!

92
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,830
Father, Father!

93
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:46,430
I said it was because of work!

94
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,280
Father, Father! Father, calm down!

95
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,480
Hey, Yoo Jung Eum. Quickly beg for forgiveness. Quickly!

96
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:57,180
I swear to heaven that I didn't do anything shameful. There really was a situation.

97
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,680
This girl, you got a mouth on you—!

98
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,900
Joon Soo, go out for a bit!

99
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,390
Come here!

100
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:11,690
Father! Father! I don't know about anything else, but Jung Eum doesn't lie!

101
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:15,390
Won't you let go? Let go!

102
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,450
Both of you get out!

103
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,550
You little... Your mother would be ashamed!

104
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,870
How can you under my roof...?

105
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:31,940
You little...!

106
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,720
Isn't that my spot? We switched.

107
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,540
You're right.

108
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,200
Was it really because of work?

109
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,680
Of course. What else?

110
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,100
I thought you were with a man again.

111
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,560
What man?

112
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,690
If that isn't it, then fine.

113
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,430
I think your dad is eating now.

114
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,770
Do you have money?

115
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,800
In my room, of course.

116
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,990
- Good morning.
 - Good morning.

117
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,140
It's premium. Your finances must've improved.

118
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,890
It's because I have constipation.

119
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,610
Speaking of which, I can't poop because of the stress you give me.

120
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,820
Now it's even my fault that you can't poop?

121
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,400
What happened with Oh Doo Ri?

122
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,430
What happened that made her stop eating and drinking?

123
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:50,690
She keeps looking for Sobok Coffee all day. Just what happened with Kim So Eul?

124
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,770
I don't really know either.

125
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,910
Oh Doo Ri's father is saying that he needs to see Kim So Eul.

126
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,280
What?

127
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,520
He said he's curious as to what kind of person made his daughter that way.

128
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:09,460
I don't think he should get involved now. What if this setup gets broken?

129
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,430
What, really? It wasn't broken?

130
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,220
Wow!

131
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,980
I got taken in by her act once again.

132
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,220
What happened?

133
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,790
Oh Doo Ri and Kim So Eul have something going on right now.

134
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,300
You're... telling me the truth, right?

135
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,140
Yes.

136
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:38,460
Then catch the timing when the two have gotten better.

137
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,990
Okay.

138
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:43,250
Do well, okay?

139
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,080
The company isn't in such a great situation lately.

140
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,730
We are in a mass member dropout situation.

141
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,630
There are not a lot of members joining, with the overflowing numbers of unsuccessful members.

142
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:00,150
And we have a member that's giving us all the biggest headache.

143
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,190
We might have to get an exorcism or something.

144
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:07,000
The member that gives you the biggest headache?

145
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,330
Rejected one hundred times!

146
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:14,990
Rejected one-hundred blind dates? Is that person crazy? Who is it?

147
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:18,290
First, start with Oh Doo Ri.

148
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,020
Do well.

149
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,970
How am I supposed to find Kim So Eul who said that he has left this world?

150
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:39,680
Don't ask about my age.

151
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,170
♪ Don't ask me for my name ♪

152
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,100
♪ This and that... ♪

153
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,280
These girls, what's with all this laundry?

154
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,300
Oh!

155
00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:00,260
These kids are dating, I'm so dumbfounded.

156
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,440
They're pretty though.

157
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,300
Hello?

158
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,400
I just called because I thought of you.

159
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,960
What are you doing?

160
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,820
Oh, you're reading.

161
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,740
I'm just, well... watering the grass.

162
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,400
Oh, I turned on the TV on earlier and they were showing a crab restaurant that's supposedly very good.

163
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:51,230
It looked really good. You want to know where it is?

164
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,170
I'll send it to you through Kakao Talk. Try going there sometime, it looked really delicious.

165
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,950
You're going to make a reservation?

166
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:05,660
I wasn't asking you to treat me. Well, of course, that'd be good for me though.

167
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,900
Sure.

168
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,750
Then, see you later.

169
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,390
Oh! You scared me!

170
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,710
Don't you know that if you water the grass while there's sunlight, the sunlight is going to burn the grass?

171
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,280
Oh.

172
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,470
That's why when you watch American shows, the sprinklers go off in the afternoon.

173
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:39,030
No way... Is that cup ramen?

174
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,800
Hello?

175
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,400
Hello?

176
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,870
Yuna! What are you doing today?

177
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,790
C'mon, Coach!

178
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:07,720
You guys should have said you were here if you came!

179
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,880
We kept telling you, a couple of times, too.

180
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,300
You did?

181
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,320
Hey, should I treat you guys to chicken?

182
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,860
Yes! Chicken!

183
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,890
But since you're treating us, can you treat us to something else instead of chicken?

184
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,460
We keep eating chicken and—

185
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:30,160
They said if we order ten times, they'll give us another for free. Once we fill up to ten, I'll order something else for you guys. Where else are we going to get free chicken?

186
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,070
Alright, alright. It's just one chicken. We'll endure.

187
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:38,030
- I'm going to get pig's trotters next time.
 - I want chicken feet. 
 - Oh, chicken feet!

188
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,620
You guys ran a hundred laps around the field, right?

189
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,100
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

190
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,090
She's being timid, so it's true. Hurry and wash up.

191
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,860
 Okay!

192
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:05,260
Since I heard that you didn't like foreign food,

193
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,010
I chose this place. How is it? Do you like it?

194
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,670
Hm? You remember what I said that time.

195
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:14,590
It's a basic courtesy towards the interviewee by an interviewer, of course.

196
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:20,420
The way you speak is cool, too. The food's good. It's really good! I need to bring my hospital co-workers next time.

197
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,850
That's a relief.

198
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,320
Here's the magazine.

199
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,060
Ta-da! The picture came out nice.

200
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,890
Oh, really?

201
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:40,360
Wow, I really look like a celebrity!

202
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,190
Ah! You could have sent this to me through delivery.

203
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,330
Delivery? How quaint.

204
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:49,400
It's not even far. If there's no traffic, it takes thirty minutes.

205
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,080
Is that so?

206
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:55,090
If it's because you feel uncomfortable with me—

207
00:15:55,090 --> 00:16:00,230
No! It's not like that. I was just worried that I was taking up your time when you're busy.

208
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:04,570
Let's meet sometimes and eat together. I know all the good places.

209
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,150
Let's.

210
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:10,970
But lately, Hoon Nam has become different.

211
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,960
Hoon Nam...?

212
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:17,760
Kang Hoon Nam, the gallery manager, you know, the real writer.

213
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:24,010
- Oh.
 - His column style has changed. Maybe he's dating.

214
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,070
Really?

215
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,570
Remember that party at the Bari Bari Exhibition?

216
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:31,680
He took that friend of yours and her client and went to the countryside.

217
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,850
He even stayed out overnight that day.

218
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,560
Friend? Who?

219
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,590
That couple manager. She said she's your friend.

220
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,510
I don't know about anyone else, but he can't fool me.

221
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:48,200
If my instinct is right, that night, the two of them probably...

222
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,030
Probably not.

223
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,300
Jung Eum said they didn't.

224
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,820
She said it was because of work.

225
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,790
You believe that?

226
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,790
Yes. I do.

227
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:13,190
There's a member who rejected a hundred blind dates.

228
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:16,770
So then why did they even join, if they were just going to reject the dates?

229
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:20,120
I don't know. He must be a pervert I guess.

230
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,050
So, are they telling you to take care of him?

231
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:27,940
No. Team Leader Bong is fixated on Oh Doo Ri right now.

232
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,160
So, why?

233
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,860
Why do you think Team Leader Bong suddenly said that to me?

234
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,790
I have feeling that I will be in charge of this.

235
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:42,690
I can feel that member who declined a hundred blind dates coming to me.

236
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:58,650
Let's talk again later. I'll check the schedule and let you know.

237
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:02,310
I've only been here for five minutes though.

238
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,800
Just go for now.

239
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,890
What kind of situation is this?

240
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,250
Then, how about we write up a blank contract right now?

241
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,620
Don't play around.

242
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,090
What's the occasion?

243
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,140
I came to make a return.

244
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,510
I'll call Yook Ryong for you.

245
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,850
Do you know that woman?

246
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,120
Why?

247
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,190
Are you interested in that woman? Should I introduce her to you?

248
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:55,590
This punk. What do you see your father as?

249
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,440
She's pretty similar in age to the singer you were seeing before.

250
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,820
If you're interested, just tell me. I'll introduce you to her.

251
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:09,730
Alright. In your life,

252
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:15,220
I guess I'm something that you'd want to return as well. But, Son,

253
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:19,280
there are some things in life that you can't return.

254
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,600
The only way out of it is to

255
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,480
accept it.

256
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,870
That's a really sad reality.

257
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,060
Finish your return well.

258
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:41,720
Hey. Hey!

259
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,200
Oh, you came, Uncle?

260
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,120
Ah, right. I came to return this to you.

261
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,680
I'm sorry, but can you come again next time?.

262
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,610
I have to leave urgently.

263
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,990
I'm really late.

264
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,060
I love you.

265
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,260
You're so cool!

266
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,190
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

267
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,530
Here!

268
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,100
- Why aren't you eating?
 - Uh? Ah...

269
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,430
I'm eating a lot, too.

270
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,800
It's really good.

271
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,370
This is huge!

272
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,700
Yeah, it's pretty fresh.

273
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:51,300
Wow, that looks like fun.

274
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,400
I want to try.

275
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,130
Then after this meal, shall we go and take some photo stickers?

276
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,100
- Photo stickers?
 - Yeah.

277
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:06,270
Photo stickers. They are cute. I think they're really pretty.

278
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,930
Are you kidding me?

279
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:11,780
Kidding?

280
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:15,850
Does it make sense? It's childish at our age.

281
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:21,120
It's childish, right? Photo stickers at our age...

282
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,570
Yeah, right, it's childish.

283
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:26,200
Of course. Photo stickers... it'd be embarrassing!

284
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,170
Things like that are for children.

285
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:32,460
I know, right?

286
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,410
But, what should we do for this next birthday?

287
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:38,070
Birthday? Already?

288
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,490
You don't remember?

289
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,600
That day...

290
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,620
The day we went to the motel for the first time.

291
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,650
Since we share the same birthday, we have the same zodiac sign.

292
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:56,010
You said, "Let's have a party while drinking the zodiac wine."

293
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,570
You said that sauvignon blanc was the wine for year of the dog signs.

294
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,910
Did I say that? Let's do that then.

295
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:06,820
Yeah? Then I'll prepare a pretty wine set.

296
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,220
Just a minute.

297
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,410
You have this.

298
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,450
Hello?

299
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:23,930
I'll call you later... Today?

300
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,420
You want to meet right now?

301
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,490
No.

302
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:35,540
Not today. Hang up, I'll call you later.

303
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,820
Oh, my kids called.

304
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:48,690
I'll have to go to the dorm. What should I do?

305
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:56,450
Go ahead and eat.

306
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,780
 Music for today begins now.

307
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:13,090
 How would you like listening to a carol in spring? This is Michael Bolton singing

308
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:16,430
 "Santa Claus is Coming to Town."

309
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,110
♫  You better watch out, you better not cry  ♫

310
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:35,380
♫  You better not pout, I'm telling you why  ♫

311
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,100
♫  Santa Claus is coming to town!  ♫

312
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,400
♫  Santa Claus is coming to town!  ♫

313
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,650
♫  Santa Claus is coming  ♫

314
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:09,050
 You... You're hard for me, too.

315
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:13,630
 Your sudden appearance in my life

316
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:18,270
 makes me baffled, angry, and about to go crazy.

317
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,390
 I'm just acting tough,

318
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:26,830
 because my self-esteem is hurt, because I don't want to fall anymore.

319
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:33,020
 I'm... just hanging on, too!

320
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:16,050
 A decisive moment in life comes without warning.

321
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:22,700
 Like a Christmas Carol that plays in spring, as if it's been released.

322
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:29,230
What's that for?

323
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,010
Just...

324
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:37,360
I got stood up. She wanted to meet, but—

325
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:43,790
The Han River suicide incident girl, why are you seeing her again?

326
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,280
Because I like her.

327
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,960
Then why do you meet other women?

328
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,540
Because it's fun.

329
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:01,210
She seems to be putting everything into you and it's fun?

330
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,240
I didn't do this so you—

331
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,390
Honestly, I just got my wings so how do I fold them right away?

332
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,220
What?

333
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:10,230
Like is like and fun is fun.

334
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,270
Can't I fly around a bit?

335
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:16,870
Women say they like me. I was always the victim and now I've finally opened my wings.

336
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,620
I want to have fun, too.

337
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:24,850
 I thought he was warm, but he's harsh and cold.

338
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,810
 Like a baffling spring breeze.

339
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,460
 They suddenly come and hurt you, but...

340
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:37,220
 Kang Hoon Nam, the gallery manager. He went out of town with your friend.

341
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,950
 He stayed out overnight that night.

342
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,920
 I thought you were with a guy.

343
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,590
 What guy?

344
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,650
 If my instincts are right...

345
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:46,550
 Maybe they're dating.

346
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,320

347
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:58,020
 Where are you? You didn't pass the Star City Snack House, right?

348
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,870
Why?

349
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:02,860
 What do you mean "why"? Bring back some spicy rice cakes and ugly dumplings.

350
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:06,600
No, I already passed the snack house.

351
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:17,330
Spicy cakes are the best with pepper paste.

352
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:18,550
Isn't that obvious?

353
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,970
You really don't want to eat any?

354
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:23,470
I don't eat with liars.

355
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,600
What are you talking about?

356
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,490
By the way, is it common for guys to not know how to ride bikes?

357
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:44,770
Not really,  because we learn at a young age usually.

358
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:49,030
So then what's with a guy who can't ride a bike?

359
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:54,190
Well, he was probably lonely as a young kid.

360
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,130
That means he played alone,

361
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:00,750
with no one to teach him to ride or to go riding with him.

362
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,020
Why do you ask? Do you want to ride a bike?

363
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,170
Do you want to go ride a bike?

364
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:11,360
That's okay. I rode too much.

365
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:18,230
I transformed you from a tadpole to a frog, but what is this?

366
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:22,990
What about you, then? Why are you so intimidated by that woman?

367
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:26,370
When was I intimidated?

368
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:30,200
Why would a player like you make things so hard, then?

369
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,070
You could just seduce her then get the rest of the tin man.

370
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:37,900
This is all because of you!

371
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,190
You skinny little guy...

372
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:43,190
Do you like that woman?

373
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:47,360
But what do to do? She doesn't seem to be interested in you at all.

374
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:56,770
What do you mean she's not interested!?

375
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:01,720
It's because I'm not hitting on her! What do you mean she's not interested?!

376
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,020
Do you want to make a bet?

377
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,660
A bet?

378
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:16,720
I... will seduce her then dump her.

379
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,590
I'll bet a blank contract.

380
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,230
A blank contract?

381
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:26,530
I'll show her how scary this world is.

382
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:33,350

383
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:37,380
 It's like a bet I can't lose.

384
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,590
 Just like a flower that has to bloom.

385
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:46,130
 Whatever it takes, I have to accept and overcome it.

386
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:52,140
 Dating is a spring breeze.

387
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:56,910
♫  Even if it's frustrating and disappointing  ♫

388
00:29:56,910 --> 00:30:02,690
♫  oh slowly slowly  ♫	♫  Even if I'm slow, I'll give you  ♫

389
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:07,830
♫  my deepening love  ♫
