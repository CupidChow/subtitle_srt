1
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,100
Five years ago at the airport... that dog bark?

2
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:48,460

3
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,660

4
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,000

5
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,760
Ah, yes, I picked up this mobile phone—

6
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,170
 Jung Eum, I'm at the Han Sang Emergency Room. You need to come here right now. Your mom just lost consciousness.

7
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,060
H-Hello? Hello?

8
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,030
 Let go!

9
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,020
 I said, let go!

10
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,030
I thinkt hat this belongs to that woman who was just escorted out by the security guards.

11
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,920
I will pass it on to her.

12
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:21,820
Her father just called and to tell her to go to the ER at Han Sung quickly.

13
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,130
Her mother has lost consciousness.

14
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,790
Really?

15
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,870
Where's the woman you just carried out?

16
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:43,050
That... was Jung Eum's cell phone, wasn't it?

17
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,960
That time, at the airport, you threw your cellphone.

18
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,520
This is the man who picked it up.

19
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,760
Then... you saw everything?

20
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:18,060
What is this? Have you into her since the airport incident?

21
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,190
Oh my... so, is that your type?

22
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,250
Let's go.

23
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,100
Let's go.

24
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,090
Hey, where are you going?

25
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,600
- Ko Eub? 
 - Oh!

26
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,150
You jerk!

27
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,340
- Why did you show up? 
 - Wait, wait—!
 - Why did you show up in front of Jung Eum?

28
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,350
Are you mad because I didn't say anything?

29
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,510
It's not that I didn't, but that I couldn't.

30
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,700
 Five years ago. One-sided.

31
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,520
 A break up. That's my gut feeling.

32
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,970
It's not that I'm mad.

33
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,470
I'm embarrassed.

34
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,580
How could you? You knew about it all this time.

35
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,230
- Jung Eum. 
 - I'm sorry. Let's talk later.

36
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,580
Just go tonight.

37
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,490
Father, do you have more plum wine?

38
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,500
Your plum wine goes perfectly with rice in water.

39
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:11,160
Well, the thing is, Mr. Jook took all the plum wine.

40
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,090
Kang Hoon Nam did?

41
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:19,300
Last time while we were eating, he grabbed my hand and asked what the seasoning sauce was, then he took all of it.

42
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,730
Joon Soo's here.

43
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,620
- Yeah. It's been a long time. 
 - It has.

44
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,860
I called him over for dinner. Did you eat?

45
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,650
I did. I'll go change and come back.

46
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,300
- Let's eat. 
 - Okay.

47
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,830
What to do?

48
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,500

49
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,300
Do you remember? What happened five years ago.

50
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,660
When I was at my lowest point.

51
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,560
Why are you bringing that up all of a sudden?

52
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,960
That day at the airport, Kang Hoon Nam was there.

53
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:14,470
He saw me in that state. What am I supposed to do?

54
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,360
Kang Hoon Nam was the one who found the cellphone I'd lost.

55
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,510
But... how could he pretend to not know all this time?

56
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,710
I'm touched.

57
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:43,660
All that aside, for him, it's still you.

58
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,860
Just the way you are, he's accepted you.

59
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:56,010
And you... you weren't that bad back then.

60
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,410
I told you it was that bastard, Ko Eub, who was the problem.

61
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:04,480
He made you like that because he didn't want to be vilified.

62
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,510
So, don't worry about it.

63
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:13,480
He's the worst. Not you.

64
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,300
Kang Hoon Nam is your savior.

65
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,450
What are you talking about?

66
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:27,230
You said that he was the one who found your cell phone.

67
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,970
What would've happened if you'd never got that apology text?

68
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,090
They say that it's more about the interpretation than the dream itself.

69
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:42,490
Without that interpretation, you might've never escaped the nightmare.

70
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,970
Obliviate, obliviate...

71
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,480
You repeated it endlessly.

72
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,180

73
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,630
You're not going to answer?

74
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:12,600
He needs to be punished so he's taught to never do that again.

75
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,600
 This call was not connected and will be forwarded...

76
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,460
Okay. You probably need some time.

77
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,900
 Katalk.

78
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:36,890
 We're going to do the final confirmation on Kato, so don't be late to the meeting.

79
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,900
 Katalk.

80
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,910
 You're not waiting for a text from a woman right now, are you?

81
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,310
Only at these times...

82
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,940
 Katalk.

83
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,520
 Once I'm done thinking, I'll contact you first.

84
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,890
All right. Let's wait until she's settled down.

85
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,600
Aren't you hot?

86
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,240
It's not the exhibition you went to last time, but

87
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,770
this is a list of the workspaces in neighboring areas. I made you appointments for tomorrow.

88
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:29,910
You're not going?

89
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,240
I have an important matter to deal with tomorrow.

90
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,060
Are you sure you're not hot?

91
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,590
My season is winter.

92
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:46,650
All year round, I'm a cold winter.

93
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:50,060
- I'm asking if you're hot. 
- Not at all.

94
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,870
That's right. Love is pain.

95
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,910
Kids, let's hurry up so we won't be late for the competition. Let's go, let's go!

96
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,370
I'm telling you that I got a flat while on the road.

97
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,520
I'm in a rush right now. There's an important competition that my kids need to get to.

98
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,980
- Oh no, what to do? 
 - Oh, no. What do we do? Oh no.

99
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,550
No, I already told you, I told the person in charge earlier.

100
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,780
We've been like this for thirty minutes now.

101
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,180
There are no taxis.

102
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,120
So, how long will it take?

103
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,380
Please, hurry up! How long will it take?

104
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,070
Get in.

105
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,240
What are you doing? Get in the car.

106
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,770
Right. Hurry, get in the car.

107
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:59,050
Coach.

108
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,710
I can't go anyway. Hurry, I'll follow later.

109
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:06,670
Da Bin, you look after everything. Be careful!

110
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,960
Girls!

111
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,450
 Good job!

112
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,640
 It was hard wasn't it?

113
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,840
Thank you, guys.

114
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,160
 You did great.

115
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,700
 You're the best.

116
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:25,120
What do you think? It won't be an issue if we produce it at our factory.

117
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,930
That's true. It won't be an issue for our fish line to marinade the sauce.

118
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:35,010
But... the sauce ratio is different. Are we allowed to use this?

119
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:38,390
I'll take care of it. How's Mother?

120
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:43,110
She's busy going around talking to shareholders, reporters, and victims.

121
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,370
Wasn't it all taken care of?

122
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:50,300
You know that Mom's style is making sure there are no loose ends.

123
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,110
And Father?

124
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,610
Don't worry. Where there's a thread, there's a needle.

125
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,610
I'm off.

126
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,920
Okay, go.

127
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,670
I'll take this.

128
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,450
- Bye.
 - Bye.

129
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,540
 Jung Eum.

130
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,370
 Just go tonight.

131
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:20,830
 Once I'm done thinking, I'll contact you first.

132
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,710
Right, since this is something that involves Father-in-law...

133
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,850
Ah, yes, Father-in-Law, how have you been?

134
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:37,840
I wanted to see you to discuss something.

135
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,720
Oh, yes, of course, I know. Come with a light heart and heavy hands.

136
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,230
Today's weather is really nice. Have you eaten?

137
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,770
No, not you. I meant Jung Eum. Did she eat before she...?

138
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,180
I was just kidding.

139
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,940
Kids, time to eat.

140
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,640
Where is everyone?

141
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,250
They're all sleeping. They must be really tired.

142
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,870
I guess so. Do you want to eat?

143
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,510
- I'll eat later.
 - Really?

144
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,900
Then, I should leave this covered.

145
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,810
- Listen, Coach. 
 - Hmm?

146
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,690
I don't know if this is something I should say.

147
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:30,720
Mr. Yook Ryong worked really hard today.

148
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,720
I don't know why you two broke up.

149
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,540
When you weren't there, Yook Ryong

150
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:42,960
bought us medicine to relax us and cheered us on from the stands.

151
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,460
And at the end...

152
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,620
At the end?

153
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:53,230
We asked him to see you before he left, but he said...

154
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:57,000
  I am ashamed to see your coach.

155
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,330
  Congratulations. You all were awesome today.

156
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,820
 Go now.

157
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,840
That's what he said before he left.

158
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,670
 What is all this?

159
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:25,710
 Wow! It looks so good!

160
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:30,800
 This will be delicious!

161
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,140
That bastard, what does he want to do after all this time?

162
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,210
Delivery!

163
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,960
Is no one here?

164
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:17,820
This is the delivery for today. Please sign here.

165
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,800
In the future, please come early.

166
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,090
I'm sorry. Today, the traffic was so bad.

167
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:29,090
Do you, by any chance, have any food?

168
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,360
We're closed.

169
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,450
If you have anything left... The traffic was so bad that I couldn't eat dinner.

170
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,800
I only had toast for lunch and my stomach is grumbling.

171
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,350
Bring the tray over.

172
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,850
Oh! Thank you!

173
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,400
I'm sorry for inconveniencing you during closing.

174
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,860
I'll eat well.

175
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,180
Wow! Fried eggs. Thank you, I'll eat well.

176
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,940
Oh, you can eat more and leave the tray over there.

177
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,590
Okay.

178
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,130
What now...

179
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:35,680
 Hello, this is Yoo Jung Eum from Geum Sang Chum Hwa. You didn't forget Thursday's counseling appointment, right?

180
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,000

181
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,860
Now that I think of it, since I've been spending all my time with Cracorn, I haven't been able to play with any of you guys.

182
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,770
These toys... Are they the toys you played with when you were young?

183
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,980
Yep, when I was young,

184
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,320
rather than friends, I played alone with toys.

185
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,310
It's a sad memory.

186
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,940
Here, let's eat this.

187
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,020
Oh, boiled potatoes.

188
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,740
This is sugar. This is salt.

189
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,070
For potatoes, you have it with sugar.

190
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,070
Here, this too.

191
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,700
You always drink just this.

192
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:11,640
You have me now, so why don't you forget about the sad memories?

193
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,770
I can't forget just because I want to.

194
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,780
Do you know this?

195
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:23,990
Butterflies think that they were originally just small butterflies, they don't believe that they were once caterpillars.

196
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:29,500
If they remember being caterpillars, they won't fly even as butterflies because they will feel scared.

197
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,920
That is why God gave the butterfly the gift of ignorance.

198
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:37,350
Eventually, they get the courage to fly freely.

199
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:40,230
So, you have to forget the sad memories.

200
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:45,210
Just like how the butterfly forgets about being a caterpillar so it can fly.

201
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:56,260
Will I have to forget to become a butterfly?

202
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,920
Good morning.

203
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,660
How's the progress on Kang Dol Jin going?

204
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,080
We're working on it.

205
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,220
Is that so? You know that we don't have much time left, right?

206
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:23,940
Yes.

207
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,430
We only need to match one more person. Kang Dol Jin.

208
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:31,480
As soon as he gets matched, you will become Geum Sang Cheon Hwa's ace again

209
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,960
and I can take over the head position again.

210
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,470
- Deal?
 - Deal.

211
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:39,990
Deal. Oh, it's so hot.

212
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:16,230
I'm looking so bright today, too.

213
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,280
Why are you coming out of there?

214
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,910
Did something good happen to you?

215
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,890
Do you not care?

216
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:30,380
Use this. Your face looks horrible.

217
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:38,590
I made the PPT report on the collaboration you asked for.

218
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,170
I'll get going.

219
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,120
Yook Ryong.

220
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:47,080
Your face looks horrible, use this.

221
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,240
The product must be for certain.

222
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:58,450
Who does he think he's playing word games with?

223
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,650
So bright.

224
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:13,350
So... you're saying that you need my pickled plum and sauce recipe?

225
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,850
Yes.

226
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:19,020
My older brother's pickled radish factory closed.

227
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:23,440
My brother is really nice and diligent. I'd like to help him.

228
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:29,880
With your permission, I'll produce them without ruining them.

229
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,170
What if I say no?

230
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,440
Huh?

231
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,120
You fought with Jung Eum, right?

232
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,870
Yes.

233
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:46,120
If you two make up, I'll tell you.

234
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,080
Of course, I want to make up.

235
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,380
A man should know how to snap a woman in two.

236
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,750
She's not a tree branch. How can I just snap her in two?

237
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,140
I don't want to do that.

238
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,970
Oh, gosh...

239
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:11,190
Look at Jung Eum's photo albums while I go make the plum sauce.

240
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,360
Oh! Thank you, Father.

241
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,070
So pretty...

242
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,750
She was a little rascal.

243
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:39,100
Oh, my goodness. This must be Joon Soo. He looks like a weasel.

244
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,450
 I'll go to the gallery tomorrow.

245
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:54,540
 I told Kang Dol Jin to go there too, so we'll see you there.

246
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,000
I'll see you then.

247
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,870
Coach.

248
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:04,410
Did you fix the car?

249
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,950
No.

250
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:06,970
Who did that?

251
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:11,510
Why did this...? When did this get here?

252
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:27,450

253
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:49,850

254
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,950
You're here?

255
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,930
- Did you eat?
 - Yes.

256
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:10,650
Oh,  you ate. I waited so we could eat together.

257
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,740
You're still mad?

258
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,610
How many times will you fool me?

259
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,410
Fool you? That's a bit much.

260
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,310
You pretty much did.

261
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:26,500
There's the intention, the process, and the effort, too.

262
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:31,610
Instead of just looking at the result, can't you acknowledge my heart, too?

263
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,430
Your guest is here.

264
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,650
Let's talk later.

265
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,310
Hello.

266
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,930
Is he really a professional?

267
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:21,660
He's actually a professional. He just dresses this way.

268
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,100
You can't do it?

269
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,760
It's a full-scale crisis.

270
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,950
I haven't seen a character like him in five-thousand years.

271
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:34,920
Will it be hard?

272
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:39,800
No. I... enjoy a challenge.

273
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:57,720
Is it okay?

274
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,140
Yes!

275
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,010
It's hot.

276
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,450
Barber!

277
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,260
No! I don't know about anything else,

278
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,560
but I really can't do this!

279
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,200
To complete your fashion change, we need to remove the hair.

280
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,320
I can't! I have a superstition about this!

281
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,230
Remove it.

282
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,090
No!

283
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,800
Hold on!

284
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:46,700
Let's just keep his hair for now.

285
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:56,730
How can you make me style a guy with armpit hair?

286
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:59,660
Your fashion is obscure, too.

287
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,190
What are we going to do about not getting rid of his armpit hair?

288
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,430
You can cover it with a jacket.

289
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,250
You're saying that can be hidden with a jacket?

290
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,630
Do you think that you can cover the armpit hair with a jacket?

291
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:12,660
You've covered your balding with a hat before.

292
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,490
He does dangerous work.

293
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:24,040
Superstitions aren't taken lightly with those kinds of people. I'm asking you for a favor.

294
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,730
He can never take off the jacket.

295
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:35,290
He's going to be a tuxedo cat from now on. A penguin.

296
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,180
Okay, you've worked hard.

297
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,840
Thank you.

298
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,060
Don't go.

299
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:44,700
Damn it.
