1
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:38,920

2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,280
- Father. 
 - Who are you calling father?

3
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,740
I'm your father.

4
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,190
I am dating Jung Eum with marriage in mind. Please, give us your blessing.

5
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,320
Marriage?

6
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,460
- Yes, Father. 
 - Who are you calling father?!

7
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,620
Dad! I really like Hoon Nam.

8
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,790
Does it make everything okay just because you like him? And does Son-in-Law Kang...

9
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,580
No, no. What do you like about Jook? His looks?

10
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,090
Okay, let's say that it's his good looks. Are you going to live off his good looks?

11
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,840
He is handsome since he takes after me.

12
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,010
His job?

13
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,000
 - Wow, look at this? 
 - Hello.

14
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,950
Look at all the issues his family has.

15
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,790
What's wrong with his family!?

16
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,680
I said, no! Where would that blood go?

17
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,800
Where would it go? To mosquitoes since it's summer!

18
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,790
Father, I'll come back next time.

19
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,400
No, it's okay.

20
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,540
I'm done here.

21
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,370
Father!

22
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,630
Dad, you used to like Hoon Nam.

23
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:20,380
He has a good career, good looks, and a good family.

24
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,190
Dad, you even said this with your own mouth.

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,960
Dad, don't you think he would make a good son-in-law?

26
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,570
You're the one who wanted me to get married and enrolled me in a matchmaking service.

27
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,830
I know why you're against us getting married, but what are you going to do?

28
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:52,370
It might be hard, but it's not Hoon Nam's fault.

29
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,770
Dad, are you going to sleep? I'll do it for you.

30
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,620
I couldn't find you when I was looking so hard.

31
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,760
 How old is Aunt Hee Kyung's son?

32
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,820
 He's your oppa since he's three years older than you.

33
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,360
 Jung Eum, stay put right here. I'll be right back.

34
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,490
 This was in Aunt Hee Kyung's bag. Doesn't it belong to the baby oppa?

35
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,610
That means the baby oppa was Hoon Nam.

36
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,400
Looks like the Tin Man found it's rightful owner.

37
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,150
Good morning.

38
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,320
 - Hello. 
 - Hello.

39
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,430
 Come to my office when you get to work.

40
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,310
Do you think thirty people will be enough?

41
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,440
Oh, you're here.

42
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,780
What kind of fashion is this?

43
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,530
The client that Cho Song brought

44
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:19,580
owns a really popular shellfish restaurant, so I have to catch a boat as soon as we're done talking.

45
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,230
Wow.

46
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,290
Anyways.

47
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,790
Why are the results of three nights and four days of brainstorming so lacking?

48
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,080
Your performance isn't so great after clients Oh Doo Ri and Na Ga Young.

49
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,410
When are you planning to show me the results of the overnight brainstorming? After I die?

50
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,510
I'm going to get started working on client Kang Dol Jin.

51
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:41,740
The ghost client, Lee Soo Ji, and Choi Joon Soo, who turned down a hundred people, have agreed to go on a second date.

52
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,790
Really?!

53
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,740
Really?!

54
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,710
Oh, my! Member Kang Hoon Nam.

55
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,390
What brings you here without even calling?

56
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,270
Hello, how have you been?

57
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,920
Ah, I had something to discuss with Manager Yoo Jung Eum.

58
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,450
Can the two of us talk outside?

59
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,860
Of course, of course.

60
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,960
Yes, you can comfortably take your time talking over things.

61
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,520
Hurry up and go.

62
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,970
We can finish talking later.

63
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:19,310
I'll see you next time, Kang Hoon Nam.

64
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,910
Why does he have to come on a day like this?

65
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,020
I did well, huh?

66
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,790
What are you doing? I have to go meet Kang Dol Jin.

67
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,230
But I'm hungry.

68
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,580
You should go eat if you're hungry.

69
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,700
I told you that I can't eat alone anymore.

70
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:54,840
Oh goodness, how did you live when I wasn't in the picture? You're such a baby.

71
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,630
Did you make this yourself? For me?

72
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,170
I stacked each layer while thinking of you.

73
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,420
How much did you think of me?

74
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,670
I can't put my guard down around you.

75
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,730
Don't you know that it's the trend for a girl to have her guard down?

76
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:39,740
I must be a trendsetter then.

77
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,760
But, did you call me out just to feed me this sandwich?

78
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,380
I thought it about it, and of all the memories we have together,

79
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,500
the memory associated with sandwiches wasn't that great.

80
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,630
So, I wanted to change it to a good memory.

81
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,200
It's okay. We cleared up the misunderstanding.

82
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,220
Just clearing up the misunderstanding wasn't enough.

83
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,860
I want all your memories about me to be happy.

84
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,040
The past is the past. Be good from here on out.

85
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,110
The past...

86
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,530
 I'll change. Everything is my faultâ€”

87
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,590
 Let go of me!

88
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:42,780
Even if it's already passed, I'm going to change things if I can.

89
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,270
But Joon Soo and Soo Ji...

90
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,890
- Did they really went on a blind date? 
 - Yeah.

91
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:54,860
Don't you that think those two look good together?

92
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,770
I hope that things go well for them.

93
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,330
Joon Soo...

94
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:04,400
I think that he's a better person than I thought he was.

95
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,320
Right?

96
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:18,030
No reminiscing or being wishy-washy about another man.

97
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:21,470
When was I being wishy-washy?

98
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,990
When was I being jealous?

99
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,470
So, this sandwich is all you wanted to do?

100
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,630
Why are you so business-like?

101
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:37,360
I'm busy. I have to figure out a solution for Member Kang Dol Jin.

102
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,400
Then, let's find a solution for Kang Dol Jin together

103
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,040
and win over your father together.

104
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,840
 Is there a way to look good to my future in-laws? This is a real question.

105
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,730
 Since this is anonymous, I'm asking with a light heart.

106
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,470
 I went to see my future in-laws not too long ago.

107
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:17,820
 My future father-in-law didn't take much of a liking to me.

108
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,820
 It turns out he knew my parents back in the day

109
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,200
 and they had a bad relationship.

110
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,310
  Do you not know why he didn't like you?

111
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,400

First of all, you should change your ID.

112
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:37,760

If you want to look good to your in-laws, just be good to them.

113
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,000
 Actually, back in the day, when I was in the army, there was a relationship expert.

114
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,900
 He would probably know if you asked him. Would you like his phone number?

115
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,120

If you knock, it shall open.

116
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,010
 The only way is to keep approaching and spending time with them.

117
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,590
Although, there are doors that don't open.

118
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,280
Doctor, you have a patient.

119
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,280
Okay, I'll be right there.

120
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,890
Alright, sounds good.

121
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:18,140
Father, you just wait for me.

122
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,530
 (A list of all the things Hoon Nam is going to do try to win over Jung Eum's father)

123
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,030
You're going to do all of this?

124
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,490
Starting when?

125
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,010
What are you doing here?

126
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:00,840
Starting today, I'm going to be your secretary.

127
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,520
Just watch me and the day you approve of me,

128
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,720
please hang up this handkerchief.

129
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,010
â™«  I want to know more  â™«

130
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:18,200
â™«  In my head I become your other half  â™«

131
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:23,030
â™«  I hastily imagine it  â™«

132
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,680
â™«  oh slowly slowly  â™«

133
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,680
Thank you.

134
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,830
â™«  Can I carefully  â™«
 â™«  knock on your heart?  â™«

135
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,440
â™«  oh slowly slowly   â™«

136
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,430
Father, here you go.

137
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:42,560
â™«  my feelings so you won't be surprised?  â™«

138
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,530
â™«  My clumsiness  â™«

139
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:50,110
â™«  Even if it's frustrating  â™«

140
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,450
â™«   and disappointing  â™«

141
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,050
â™«  oh slowly slowly  â™«

142
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,100
â™«  Even if I'm slow, I'll give you  â™«

143
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,860
â™«  my love that's deepening  â™«

144
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,950
â™«  There's no love like this in movies  â™«

145
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,720
â™«  That's what I believe  â™« 
 Father, I'm doing well, right?

146
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,730
â™«  I'm excited for the first time in a while  â™«

147
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:31,470
â™«  I smile  â™«

148
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,260
â™«  oh slowly slowly  â™«

149
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,300
â™«  Can I carefully  â™«

150
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,430
â™«  knock on your heart?  â™«

151
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:44,050
â™«  oh slowly slowly  â™«

152
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,930
â™«  Can I convey   â™«

153
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,820
â™«  my feelings  â™«
 Sit.

154
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,630
â™«  so you won't be surprised?  â™«

155
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:10,830
Class ends here today. Tomorrow,

156
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:15,980
we'll learn about traditional thimbles, which will help you not to prick yourself.

157
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,750
- Good work today. 
 - I'll keep this here, then. 
- Sure, sure, put it there.

158
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,310
Excuse me. Hello, everyone!

159
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:25,350
I've brought food for you all. Please, eat before you leave.

160
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,340
What is all of this?

161
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,150
- What good timing, I was hungry! 
 - Right?

162
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,820
Who is this handsome fellow?

163
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,350
One of the guys trying to become my son-in-law.

164
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:48,120
Really? Where did you find such a handsome future son-in-law? You must be happy.

165
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,130
Why, thank you. Enjoy your meal.

166
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:03,330
Bon appetit.

167
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,770
 Hoon Nam.

168
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,450
 I love you, son.

169
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,060
 Mom!

170
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,490
That poor kid lost his mother and grew up in an unfamiliar home.

171
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,080
He's grown up well.

172
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,320
You can stay seated.

173
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,910
Your mom, Hee Kyung, used to love this.

174
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,820
She would often sit here with me and eat this.

175
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:07,090
Looking at you now, you look a lot like Hee Kyung,

176
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:10,100
not just the wretched Kang Jung Do.

177
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:17,560
But, it looks like there's a lot going on according to the news. Can you be here like this?

178
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,690
There's nothing more important to me than Jung Eum.

179
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,320
What do you like about Jung Eum?

180
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,680
Honestly, she's my daughter, but she's nothing compared to you.

181
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,570
According to Jung Eum, you guys are different ranks or something?

182
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,490
Different ranks?

183
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,620
You know how matchmaking companies have a ranking scale for each person?

184
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:49,740
Jung Eum is the perfect rank for me.

185
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,230
She has everything I need.

186
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,330
 Grab this by your left hand.

187
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,590
 Left hand?

188
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,300
 Don't be scared! Throw away all your fears!

189
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:19,910
 Stamp.

190
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:26,590
 Didn't you say that I'd earn one every time we successfully match a couple?

191
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,410
 You've worked hard.

192
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:34,410
All I need is... Yoo Jung Eum.

193
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,470
It feels cool outside today.

194
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,670
Cut! Okay.

195
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:20,240
- The stunt double can leave now. Can the actor come in? 
 - Hello. Thank you for your hard work.

196
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,240
Please, take one!

197
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,130
Please, have a drink!

198
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,940
Oh, hello.

199
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,000
Hello. You're early.

200
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,840
You look so cool during your action scenes.

201
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,350
- Oh, you saw everything? 
 - Yes.

202
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,970
I got here earlier than planned.

203
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,830
But, you were so into your work that I just waited here until you were finished.

204
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:42,730
Oh, I see. I'll be right out after I change.

205
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:46,600
There's a coffee shop over there. I'll wait over there. Take your time and come meet me.

206
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,870
Remember to remove all your special effects make-up.

207
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,870
Yep!

208
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,040
Good work.

209
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,920
Good work.

210
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,210
He looks so cool and is so passionate about his work.

211
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,320
Let's go!

212
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,890
He's good looking.

213
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:18,560
He seems to have a nice personality, too.

214
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,480
Could it be that his career is the problem?

215
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,460
Wow. Oh my god. Look at that guy.

216
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,200
You waited too long, didn't you?

217
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,860
Would you like to drink something? I'll go and order it.

218
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,670
I would like iced coffee.

219
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:12,450
- Excuse me. 
 - Iced coffee, right?

220
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:17,120
Yes. One iced Americano, please.

221
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,970
Please give me a receipt.

222
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,510
Okay.

223
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,040
My dream is to become like Arnold.

224
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,910
Arnold?

225
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:50,710
- Arnold Schwarzenegger. The Terminator. 
 - Ah!

226
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,270
Arnold overcame all of his obstacles

227
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:57,250
and became one of the highest paid actors.

228
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,640
Once he made his debut in Hollywood,

229
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,460
everyone wondered how someone who couldn't act,

230
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,690
had a weird name, bad pronunciation,

231
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,640
and wasn't good looking could succeed.

232
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,590
He encountered a lot of criticism.

233
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,890
However, just a few years later

234
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:15,130
- he became one of the highest paid actors. 
 - Ah...

235
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:19,110
People tell me that I should've just become a personal trainer.

236
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:22,120
They ask me why I'm wasting my time trying to become an actor.

237
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,570
But my dream has always been to become an action star.

238
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,430
That's why I've worked so hard to get the body I have now.

239
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:29,630
This is all my hard work.

240
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,880
Is that why your clothes...?

241
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,850
Yeah. There's no reason for me to hide all the muscles that I'm proud of.

242
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:40,060
No matter what anyone says, I like me the way I am right now.

243
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,440
It's good to see you have so much confidence,

244
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,670
But that...

245
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,500
Oh, this? It's a jinx.

246
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,710
Whenever I shave my armpits, there's always an accident on set.

247
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:58,950
So, I never shave.

248
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,860
- Ah, I see. 
 - I've heard a lot of great things from Team Leader Bong.

249
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:07,260
She said that she scouted you because you're so good at your job.

250
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,590
Ah, yes.

251
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,730
I'll entrust everything to you, Manager Yoo.

252
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,210
I have some business to tend to. Honestly, I currently work two jobs.

253
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,710
- Two jobs? 
 - Yeah.

254
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:23,200
I have to pay for living expenses, so I also do delivery work.

255
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,920
- I'm sorry, but is it okay if I leave first? 
 - Of course! Of course!

256
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,420
I'll be waiting for your call then.

257
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,570
Be careful on your way out.

258
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,300
- Manager. 
 - Yes?

259
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,120
His career wasn't the problem.

260
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,550
Father.

261
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,030
Father?

262
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,090

263
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:26,150
He's in a deep sleep.

264
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,320
 Just watch me, and on the day you approve of me

265
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,730
 please hang up this handkerchief.

266
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:56,250

267
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:20,220
I planned out a date since you both agreed to have a second date.

268
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,190
Based on both of your styles, instead of a normal date,

269
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,650
I thought it would be better to go to an indoor surf park or

270
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,250
to go outside to a zoo or

271
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,830
going an arboretum would be a good date course.

272
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,200
We don't need another date.

273
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:37,100
Since this is an arranged marriage, we don't need to go on a date

274
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,990
as long as I put my dad at ease.

275
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:44,290
And Joon Soo just needs to put you at ease.

276
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:46,480
I only came here to tell you

277
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,320
that we don't need all that stuff in the middle, so you don't need to feel pressured.

278
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:54,950
You really don't have to feel bad!

279
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:57,240
My shoulder is getting much better.

280
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,480
Meeting Joon Soo was fate.

281
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,930
But, judging by both Hoon Nam Oppa and Joon Soo,

282
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:22,890
seeing that there are a lot of good people surrounding you,

283
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,910
I feel like you must be a really good person, Unni.

284
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,790
Then, Soo Ji,

285
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:33,370
how about we be friends?

286
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,750
Okay!

287
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,530
Hello?

288
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,510
Yes.

289
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,880
Ah, yes.

290
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,610
Yes, I understand.

291
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:56,790
I'll see you later, then.

292
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:03,010
What kind of call was that?

293
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:10,770
You said you know Hoon Nam well, right?

294
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,220
Why?

295
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:16,130
 That  person that just called.

296
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:19,200
Ah, yes,  that  person isn't easy.

297
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,730
And, if I help you right now...?

298
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,570
I'm not the type of person who can be indebted to someone.

299
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:28,310
You have to repay me later on then.

300
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:32,180
When you first meet this person you'll feel really small,

301
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,450
but don't ever avoid eye contact.

302
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:37,130
Even if it's not funny, make sure you smile.

303
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,940
You must speak earnestly

304
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,700
and be energetic.

305
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:12,610
 Is this the water cup scene I've seen in dramas?

306
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,020
 Is this the envelope filled with money?

307
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:08,490
Let's meet together with Hoon Nam when he has time.

308
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,790
Thank you.

309
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:16,820
If Hoon Nam is happy with everything, then I am, too.

310
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,440
There's nothing that I need.

311
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,060
I'll just give you a word of caution.

312
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:27,020
Hoon Nam is definitely going to live up to his looks.

313
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:31,350
Even if he says no, girls won't leave him alone,

314
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:37,260
so you have to grab him by the roots from the start.

315
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,480
That way, he won't turn his eye towards other women.

316
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,450
This family's playboy habit,

317
