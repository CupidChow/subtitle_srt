1
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,020

2
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:43,800
 Let's really break up now.

3
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,900
What did you just say?

4
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,950
I said, let's end it here.

5
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:03,190
I'm officially giving a farewell notice to Kang Hoon Nam.

6
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,560
- No, Cracorn— 
 - Don't call me that.

7
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,790
I have no reason to be called that by a stranger.

8
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,210
Strangers? We're strangers?

9
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:15,760
Thank you for everything until now.

10
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,850
I...

11
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,540
Even though I helped with Oh Doo Ri?

12
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,410
That's why I gave you the rest of the Tin Man.

13
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,220
I...!

14
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,080
Even though I spent the entire day with you!?

15
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,740
I never asked you to come.

16
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,790
I— I...!

17
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,720
I...

18
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,220
You have nothing else to say, right?

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,700
Even though I begged like this?

20
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,420
Who do you think you are?

21
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,810
The well-off curator of a gallery?

22
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,880
The well-off relationship expert?

23
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,320
Because you are such a well-off man, does that mean you can play with people's feelings?

24
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,590
Jung Eum, it's not that—

25
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,680
You said that... saying good-bye is a moment.

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,340
 It doesn't matter what happens, a break up is a moment.

27
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,920
 No matter what you do, the result cannot be changed.

28
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,520
 Instead of holding onto the result that you can't change,

29
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,500
 let's just make a wish to "obliviate."

30
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,410
Don't cling to the results that won't change.

31
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:15,510
Just make your wish.

32
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:35,020
♫  Even if I try to hide it  ♫

33
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:41,580
♫  It shows ♫ 
 ♫  I can't hide my heart  ♫

34
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:48,150
♫  Am I the only one in love?  ♫

35
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:57,310
♫  Truthfully, I'm afraid you aren't  ♫

36
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,450
You have no heart, just like me.

37
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,780

38
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,620

39
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,600
I thought that you had nothing else to say.

40
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,610
I thought that too, but I actually don't have a heart.

41
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,850
The Tin Man's heart. You promised, so give me the heart.

42
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,590
The Tin Man's heart...

43
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:23,320
I'll look for it later at home and have a messenger deliver it.

44
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,090
You said ythat we're strangers now, so how can I trust your words?

45
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,130
Don't you know how a debt collector stalks their debtors?

46
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,160
I can't leave until you give me the Tin Man's heart. Hurry.

47
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,560
Give it to me.

48
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,140
Give me the heart! Give me the Tin Man's heart!

49
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,360
Travel safely.

50
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,230
Thank you.

52

53

65
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,970
Here. Have some late night snacks.

♫  oh slowly slowly  ♫
♫  Even if I'm slow, I'll give you  ♫

00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:18,110
♫  my deepening love  ♫

68
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,400

69
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,450
You can leave after physical therapy today.

70
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,140
Okay.

71
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,400
Isn't that Jung Eum?

72
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,590
Yes, that's right.

73
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,300
Was she a diver?

74
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,070
Yes. She was an athlete before.

75
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,690
But how did you know that she was a diver?

76
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:54,870
Isn't that a medal for diving athletes?

77
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,050
My dad is the chairman of the swimming federation.

78
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,750
Oh, really?

79
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,810
But why is she now...?

80
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,820
Uh... She has her reasons.

81
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,800
She's no longer an athlete and now works as a couple manager.

82
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,950
It's interesting that she used to be a diving athlete.

83
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:24,450
 Yes, the female ten-meter diving national contest is being held. There's a lot of nervousness here today.

84
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:28,320
 The fierce, tense competition will continue today

85
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,620
 with the many athletes taking...

86
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,610
 We have been highly anticipating the contest.

87
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:39,260
 Yes, with a lot of spectators and cheering teams today, it's getting hotter.

88
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,300
 Next up is Yoo Jung Eum.

89
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,950
Fighting!

90
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,040
 Yoo Jung Eum.

91
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:54,140
 - 105B.  
  - Yes, she's shown us quite a spectacular performance earlier, so she may be feeling some pressure.

92
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,650
- Jung Eum, do well! Mom and Joon Soo are here, too! 
 - Fighting!

93
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,970
 Just do as you practiced! Do well!

94
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,880
 Jung Eum! You can do it! Jump!

95
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,600
 Yoo Jung Eum, you have nintey seconds.

96
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,870
 Yoo Jung Eum doesn't seem to be in good shape today.

97
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,450
 Oh, she is looking very uneasy.

98
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:25,270
 She may be feeling some psychological pressure.

99
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:28,070
 It appears that she is having difficulty concentrating.

100
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:33,200
 In this relay, it's a situation where she must dive.

101
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,090
 Oh! This is an unprecedented situation!

102
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,720
 What's going on?

103
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,150
 Is Athlete Yoo Jung Eum giving up on today's competition?

104
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,910
 That is unfortunate.

105
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:58,600
 Her posture was unstable earlier.

106
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,600
 There's chaos among the cheering teams and the audience.

107
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,450
I just remembered where I've seen her.

108
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,060
No wonder her face was familiar.

109
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:27,930
Do you believe the saying that nothing ever happens without a reason?

110
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:33,340
Yes, well. That is what I think.

111
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,690
I'm leaving.

112
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,980
Yes. Oh, please don't forget to get physical therapy before you go.

113
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,570
Yes.

114
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:49,370
The heart must have fallen around here somewhere.

115
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,190
 I don't see the heart.

116
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,370
 The Tin Man's heart.

117
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:59,760
 You promised. Give me the heart.

118
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,890
Where is it?

119
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,580
It's so small that I can't see it.

120
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:23,210
 Why is Hee Kyung not back from the real estate dealer?

121
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,330
 How old is Aunt Hee Kyung's baby?

122
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,760
 An older brother, older than you by three years.

123
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,000
 Why is Aunt's name  Yoon  Hee Kyung when Dad's is  Yoo Seung Ryeol?

124
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,480
 Aunt Hee Kyung is not my real sister.

125
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,540
 We grew up together, we went to the same school and played together

126
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,650
 in the same neighborhood for about thirty years.

127
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,280
 If so, how come I've never seen her?

128
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:51,950
 That's because before you were born, she lived in the neighborhood we visited a while ago.

129
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,520
 But, now that she is moving closer, we can see her often.

130
00:11:55,530 --> 00:12:02,000
 When you meet Aunt Hee Kyung's son you have to call him "oppa" and be nice to him. You can't hit him or scold him, or I'll scold you.

131
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,150
 Why?

132
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,560
 Why? Why?

133
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,620
 There's a call.

134
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,510
 Hello?

135
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,200
 The hospital? Hee Kyung is?

136
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,880
 Hey, hey! There'd a car accident patient name Yoon Hee Kyung here.

137
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,520
 I heard that my sister was in an accident. Yoon Hee Kyung...

138
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,220
 Excuse me!

139
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:33,170
 Slowly. Hee Kyung.

140
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,870
 What's going on here?

141
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,360
 Hoon Nam...

142
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,940
 My Hoon Nam...

143
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,680
 Where is Hoon Nam?

144
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,440
 Jung Eum, stay here. I'll come back soon.

145
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,220
 Excuse me.

146
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,790
 Jung Eum, did you return safely?

147
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,590
 Here, Dad.

148
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:19,380
 It was in Aunt Hee Kyung's bag. Does it belong to that baby oppa?

149
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:24,710
 Then, we should return it. When can we meet him?

150
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,910
 Later.

151
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,500
 Later?

152
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,320
 Later.

153
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,380
 What else? I should just return it later.

154
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,190
That Tin Man's owner is someone else.

155
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:50,160
I was going to return it once I met him, but I never did.

156
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,470
Ah! You surprised me!

157
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,360
Why are you here and being like this?

158
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,440
Like a rejected person.

159
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,480
How surprising.

160
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,950
Yook Ryong.

161
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,460
Yes?

162
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,880
You've been dumped before a lot, right?

163
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,110
Did you get rejected?

164
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,610
You got dumped. Dumped!

165
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,000
Does getting dumped mean giving up right away?

166
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:03,130
I'm not sure. It depends on how you got dumped.

167
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,780
It depends on how you got dumped?

168
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:10,460
Of course. Because there are various ways to dump a person.

169
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,670
Like?

170
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:21,980
 First, there's breaking up through ghosting.

171
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,630
 Are we meeting all together?

172
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:40,260
 Sometimes, through a friend. A third-party break up.

173
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,920
 We should stop meeting.

174
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:52,060
 Without an ounce of respect, there's the text break-up.

175
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,600
 - Let's end it here. 
 - If you call me, I'll kill you.

176
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,440
 The other person has canceled your couple's phone plan.

177
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,150
The most heartbreaking one is

178
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,790
is hearing the words face-to-face.

179
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,220
Face-to-face?

180
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,200
Yes.

181
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,880
Hearing them say it directly,

182
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,290
to let you know that they're breaking up with you.

183
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,760
As much as it is out of respect,

184
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,380
it means that they're sticking by their decision that much.

185
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,760
So...

186
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,830
So?

187
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,280
It is that much harder to go back.

188
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,070
 We should now...

189
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:52,590
 - Let's... 
 - truly...

190
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,470
 - break up. 
 - end this.

191
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,960
Are you heading to work?

192
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:31,780
I'll ask you directly since I'm the type to get to the point.

193
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,780
It's true that you broke up with Hoon Nam, right?

194
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,340
You should hear it from him. You said that you know him well.

195
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,040
Hoon Nam keeps pretending like you haven't.

196
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:49,240
If you two really broke up, I no longer have to step back, right?

197
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,630
I've also found a reason to not back off.

198
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,380
You should deal with your own feelings.

199
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,760
I will deal with mine.

200
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,650
But, at the time, why did you do it?

201
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:06,570
Five years ago, I also went to see the national women's diving competition.

202
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,470
You left during the competition.

203
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:16,640
Was it because of a man?

204
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:23,120
Yes. It was because of a man.

205
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,060
Because of a man I liked.

206
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:31,820
But now, I won't make those sorts of stupid decisions anymore.

207
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,790
So,

208
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:38,200
if you came to get permission from the ex-girlfriend,

209
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:43,610
I have completely ended it with Kang Hoon Nam, so you can do whatever you want.

210
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,980
I'm late, so I'm leaving.

211
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,440
I'm back.

212
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,810
You're here?

213
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:14,570
Yeah. Did you eat dinner?

214
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,620
I ate.

215
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,260
Go rest.

216
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,990
Do you want to watch a movie? It's been a while.

217
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,250
I'm too lazy. I want to rest at home.

218
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,490
Joon Soo.

219
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,510
I've brought something really nice.

220
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:50,710
Got it? I'm going to go for a walk, so you and Jung Eum...

221
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:55,740
I think I'll be home very late, so you two have fun.

222
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,300
Thank you.

223
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,050
I'm going.

224
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:23,770
 Don't give it to anyone else. It's mine.

225
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,610
  All day, I think of you.

226
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:36,550
 What should I do?

227
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:42,620
 I think I'm going crazy from missing you. What should I do?

228
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,680
 Jung Eum, come out.

229
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:58,160

230
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,250
What is it?

231
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,030
A yard theater.

232
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,700
Where did you get this?

233
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:21,090
I think Father brought back the equipment he used at the recreation center.

234
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,640
Dad is working hard these days.

235
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,860
That's not all.

236
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,850
Thank you.

237
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:35,000
Here.

238
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,230
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers!

239
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:49,040
Joon Soo. You know—

240
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,640
We're friends right now.

241
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,930
My friend is sad and I can't even console her?

242
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:02,330
I don't do cowardly things like try to get into someone's heart while they're weak.

243
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:07,730
Receive this kindness as a friend.

244
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:17,560
They say that if you keep receiving kindness, you get swayed.

245
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,990
You seem to be feeling a lot better now that you're even joking.

246
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,350

247
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,790
A new member?

248
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,620
Looks like things will work out.

249
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,650
Things worked out with Oh Doo Ri, too. It seems like we're on a good streak now.

250
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:57,270
We really must be.

251
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,960
He seems like he will be quality A class material, so give him a good consultation.

252
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,940
He said he'd be here in an hour on the dot.  I'll send him to the consultation room when he arrives, so go get ready.

253
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,990
Okay.

254
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:10,400
Jung Eum, fighting!

255
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,410
Fighting!

256
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,590

257
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:51,010
Because you're such a well-off person, you must think that my work is a joke.

258
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,620
If I don't do this, you won't see me.

259
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:56,400
Our company has a separate membership fee.

260
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,500
- Along with the fee— 
 - Why won't you answer your phone?

261
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,930
If you want to be a member, you have to fill out your basic information.

262
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,450
Is your talent drying up someone's blood?

263
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:09,620
I am supposed to ask questions to the member.

264
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,400
Give it to me.

265
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,050
The heart.

266
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,490
I couldn't find it.

267
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:17,880
Did you throw it away?

268
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,760
I didn't throw it away, I just can't find it.

269
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:25,290
Just wait a little more. I'll find it as soon as possible.

270
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:29,820
It's okay, even if you never find it.

271
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:34,830
I can use that heart as an excuse to see you every day.

272
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:37,400
Forever.

273
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:47,840
- If you're not going to sign up, I will get— 
 - Ah!

274
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,150
You have no patience.

275
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,950
I'll sign up. Let's sign up.

276
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,980
- Age? 
 -Thirty-five.

277
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,030
- Occupation? 
 - Gallery manager.

278
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,940
- Father's occupation? 
 - Member of the National Assembly.

279
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:13,610
- Mother's occupation? 
 - DMG Food's chairwoman.

280
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:22,510
- Should I talk about my ideal type now? 
 - Sure.

281
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,620
- What's your type? 
 - Yoo Jung Eum.

282
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:32,540
- How tall do you want the women to be? 
 - About Yoo Jung Eum's height.

283
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,990
- Do you have a standard for weight? 
 - About Yoo Jung Eum's weight.

284
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:40,030
- A hairstyle you prefer? 
 - Just like Yoo Jung Eum's.

285
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,300
Ah, yes.

286
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,510
Have you filled out all the information?

287
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,930
Yes, you have a very skilled manager.

288
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:58,890
I'll contact you after I organize the potential match.

289
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,350
Then... good-bye.

290
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,830
-Let's— 
-Oh, really?

291
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:09,140
Thank you for signing up with our company.

292
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:12,430
This isn't much, but it's a gift thanking you for signing up with our company.

293
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:15,570
- We prepared some wine. 
 - Ah... thank you.

294
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:20,390
This is also a little something you can use, though you may have a better one at home.
