1
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,610
♫  After your everything covers me up  ♫

2
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:40,590
♫  I can't move, not even a step  ♫

3
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:49,060
♫  Like that star in the night sky  ♫

4
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:55,970
♫  I'm in you  ♫

5
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:02,610
♫  I call you, I call you  ♫

6
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:10,230
♫  I call you like this  ♫

7
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:17,450
♫  I'm even scared to sleep and dream  ♫

8
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:25,160
♫  In case we drift apart, that I'll be alone again  ♫

9
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,780
It's Jung Eum.

10
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,580
The master of kissing.

11
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,760
I guess it's not anything like that. You're more lame than I thought.

12
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,300
Mhm.

13
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:43,140
You're right, it was lame, because that kiss didn't have heart.

14
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,230
Well, okay then.

15
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,160
What did you find out about my love life with that lame, heartless kiss?

16
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,370
Will you be okay though? I don't want to stir up anything.

17
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,750
If you don't know, just say that you don't know.

18
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,820
Don't try to act like you're cool.

19
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:12,810
Five years ago. One sided.

20
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,720
A farewell notice.

21
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,660
 Let go! Please, just let go!

22
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,170
 I have a new girlfriend. I'm sorry.

23
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,890
It's a burden.

24
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,750
 Yoo Jung Eum!

25
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,440
You were here. I've been looking for you for a while.

26
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,420
You're not alone.

27
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,970
We just finished talking. Have a nice talk.

28
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:56,730
I think we've met before. Haven't we?

29
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:04,540
Yes, weren't you a "most wanted man"?

30
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,370
Yes, I think that was it.

31
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,800
Am I intruding?

32
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,010
Not at all. Thank you for coming.

33
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,720
Then, have a nice time together.

34
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,910
"Most desired man." It's become such a label.

35
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,820
Yoo Jung Eum... Hey!

36
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,260
Joon Soo, when did you come?

37
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,070
What's wrong with you?

38
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:41,080
What about me? Why are you here?

39
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,500
Unbelievable...

40
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,630
I was dragged here over asking him to dress your friend up as a favor.

41
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,680
That's what happened?

42
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,860
You sure you're okay?

43
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:00,900
Yeah, of course. Of course, of course I'm okay.

44
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,620
They're doing something inside, let's go in.

45
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,660
It's because I haven't worn heels in a while.

46
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,570
Ahjumma.

47
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,560
Hold onto me.

Wow!

65
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,030
Give it to me.

66
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,960
Wow!

67
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:01,470
Please give this flower to the woman you will spend tonight with.

68
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,520
 Who could it be?

69
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,200
 Oh, my...

70
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,400
Are you eating all your meals?

71
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,160
Your face looks worn-down.

72
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,650
Why would you worry about someone like me?

73
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,630
Don't say that, and be sure to eat this.

74
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,530
Thank you.

75
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,250
 Oppa, what are you doing?

76
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,200
Why aren't you coming?

77
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,350
Oppa, let's go watch the show.

78
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,690
Let's go.

79
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,940
- Hurry, let's go.
- Wait a minute.

80
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,420
What is this? Who's this old lady?

81
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:53,720
How dare they take someone's precious...

82
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,780
Oppa, who's this old lady?

83
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,750
She must be crazy.

84
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,720
You go on ahead.

85
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,990
I'll be right there.

86
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,520
I... can't send you away like this.

87
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,790
For just one month, let's date.

88
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:28,490
If you still don't like me, then just dump me again.

89
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,050
♫  Destiny  ♫

90
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:38,720
♫  You're my destiny  ♫

91
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,220
My name is Kim Soeul.

92
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,750
It's nice to meet you.

93
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,090
Look here.

94
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,380
What kind of an impolite behavior is this in front of a person?

95
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,460
Are you scolding me right now?

96
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,650
Yes.

97
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,630
I'm someone who's never even had my own father tell me what to do.

98
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:18,400
That's why you don't have any manners!

99
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,240
I don't have manners!

100
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:27,160
And you... don't have hair!

101
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,230
It's not embarrassing to not have any hair.

102
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:35,160
But for you to be at this age and have no manners is a very embarrassing thing!

103
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,690
For me to come see someone like you,

104
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:43,780
I left behind my potatoes and violets for this...

105
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,360
I'm embarrassed.

106
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,670
Potatoes... violets...

107
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:56,170
Look here! Look here!

108
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,780
Right?

109
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,160
Would you like to order?

110
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,520
In the 007 movies, what James Bond always drinks...

111
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,020
I'd like a martini over here.

112
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,280
Oh, yes, a martini. Please mix one up.

113
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,690
What do you mean "mix one up"?

114
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,730
What, why not? Alcohol is all the same.

115
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,550
We'd like a sweet martini.

116
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,970
What's a sweet martini?

117
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:37,330
When it comes to martinis, the taste changes depending on the ratio of gin and vermouth.

118
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:41,060
2:1 is a sweet martini, 4:1 is a medium martini,

119
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,000
and 7:1 is an extra dry martini.

120
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,490
Please make mine an extra dry martini.

121
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:54,190
Oh, I see, then I'd like the sweet martini.

122
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,270
So, this is what James Bond drinks?

123
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,270
In the movies, James Bond always says,

124
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,250
"Shaken, not stirred."

125
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:06,410
Rather than James Bond, Hemmingway or Churchill's drinks were more famous.

126
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:10,780
I heard that Hemingway drank his martini with the ratio of 19:1 gin and vermouth.

127
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:15,320
Don't we do this when we drink somaek  (beer cocktail) ? We wonder if we need to put in one or two shots of soju for one glass of beer.

128
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,190
Hey, hey, this won't do. Let's just go drink soju.

129
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,900
That sounds good.

130
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,730
By the way...

131
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:27,870
I'm curious as to why you chose me out of all these people.

132
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,510
Was it because at our first meeting—?

133
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,760
Hold on.

134
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,430
CEO Kang.

135
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,260
Can we talk for a second?

136
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,360
About what?

137
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,860
- Business talk.
- Business?

138
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,280
Let's go somewhere quiet and talk.

139
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,550
Should we call a cab?

140
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,400
The weather is nice, so why don't we just walk until we reach the main road?

141
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,400
Are you going to be okay in your heels?

142
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,910
Tada! I came prepared!

143
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:16,310
Wow, a bandage inside that clutch. That is so you.

144
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,340
Hey, hey! Seriously...

145
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,610
Do this.

146
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:30,110
Hey, hey. Do it like this, cover it up.

147
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,630
I already put it on.

148
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:36,080
You haven't worn a mini skirt in a long time so it must be uncomfortable. Do this.

149
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,980
You can wrap this around your waist.

150
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,700
Thank you, friend. You're the only one.

151
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,970
But you know... is there such a thing as mind reading?

152
00:12:58,970 --> 00:12:59,920
Mind reading?

153
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,010
You know,  like reading people's minds, a superpower.

154
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,090
Rather than a superpower, it's more like affecting the other person's mind and

155
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:12,560
getting the answer you want. It's kind of a psychological trick.

156
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,420
Psychological trick?

157
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:19,850
You... kissed, right?

158
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,510
Instead of asking you a question that's unlikely to have happened like that...

159
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:35,880
Ask a question like, "You drank, huh?" Get down to the psyche with a question that was likely to have happened

160
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,690
and then narrow it down. It's a psychological technique. It's sort of like...

161
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,650
Like twenty-questions.

162
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:50,200
In the medical field, they're currently doing research on using mind reading for patients who have difficulty communicating.

163
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,280
Would that be possible if mind reading was a superpower?

164
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,900
That's true.

165
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,810
But why do you ask that all of a sudden?

166
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:00,340
Huh? No reason.

167
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,700
It's suspicious.

168
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,480
No, it's not.

169
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,190
Did something really happen to you?

170
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,270
Maybe you really—

171
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,590
You want to play twenty questions?

172
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,460
- Twenty questions? 
 - It's not...

173
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,690
human.

174
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,500
Wait. Just a minute. It's too broad.

175
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,260
Can you eat it?

176
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,730
- You can eat it. 
 - Is it solid?

177
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,010
It's liquid.

178
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,610
- Alcohol.
- What the heck? How did you get it so fast?

179
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,190
That's why you have to ask the right questions.

180
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,070
Aww.

181
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,180
Do it like me.

182
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,160
Do it.

183
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,780
It's an animal.

184
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,940
An animal?

185
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,300
Does it have fur?

186
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,230
Yes, a lot.

187
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,190
Does it like to eat a lot of bread?

188
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,980
What is it? Do we really have to talk right now?

189
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,960
Let's sit.

190
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:52,310
I heard that you're helping Mirae Books with character creation?

191
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:55,030
Are you doing background checks on me now?

192
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:58,460
End that and let's work together.

193
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:03,060
Le Chic is starting a publishing company that includes character creation.

194
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,970
I want to do it right. I'm in charge of the general management.

195
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,800
Really?

196
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,550
That's great, congratulations.

197
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,390
Don't do things that will benefit others. Do it for your sake.

198
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:17,220
I'll support you for sure with your character creation this time.

199
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,080
I'm a businessman, not an artist.

200
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,990
You think that I don't know you want to create characters?

201
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,800
Charlie.

202
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:33,170
I will politely decline. You don't have to do this just because you're thankful. Look for another artist.

203
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,030
No, no, no. I'm not doing this because I'm thankful.

204
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,890
I'm investing in your talent.

205
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,430
Officially.

206
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,690
How much will do?

207
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,980
How much do you want?

208
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,660
Ah, you're too...

209
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,280
too much.

210
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:06,150
Okay. You'll do it, right?

211
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,630
My head hurts from using it too much!

212
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,730
It's warm.

213
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:18,350
This is it for today, let's do it next time. My head will burst if we keep going.

214
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,480
I'll have to attack you with twenty questions every now and then.

215
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,790
- Go.
- Why? We should go drink soju.

216
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,780
No, you must be tired too, so sleep. Go.

217
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,470
No, I'm fine. Hurry and go change, I'll be waiting.

218
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,080
You said you had to work night duty. Aren't you tired?

219
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,330
I went to the party thinking of it as an all nighter anyway. Where do you want to drink?

220
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,240
I just want to sleep.

221
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,830
Okay.

222
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,340
I really wanted to drink soju together, it's been a while.

223
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:19,460
Right, to give him the torso tomorrow... No.

224
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:24,340
I'm meeting you to give you this.

225
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:34,020
 What did you find out about my love history through this lame, unwanted kiss that didn't even mean anything?

226
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:38,760
 Five years ago. One sided. A farewell notice.

227
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,260
Thank you for coming.

228
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,730
Thank you.

229
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,990
Yes, thank you.

230
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:35,140
♫  What words to begin with  ♫

231
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:39,180
♫  How you would think  ♫

232
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:44,980
♫  I don't know anymore  ♫

233
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:51,500
♫  It's hard for you too now  ♫

234
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,330
 So, how is my love history?

235
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:04,530
♫  Because I feel like I could go back if I closed my eyes  ♫

236
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:08,990
 It was boring. Because it was a kiss without heart.

237
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,240
♫  I can go back if it means I can find you  ♫

238
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,830
Did I crush her too much?

239
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:24,160
♫  I can go in if it means you can rest  ♫

240
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,130
♫  To make you uncomparably happy  ♫

241
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,960
♫  To make you uncomparably happy  ♫

242
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,960
♫  I have to protect you like that  ♫

243
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:44,190
♫  Tell me we can go back  ♫

244
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:51,340
♫  Because I feel like I could go back if our hands touched  ♫

245
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:58,950
♫  I caught you, I looked for you  ♫

246
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:04,780
♫  I can go back, if it means finding you  ♫

247
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:10,340
♫  I can go in, if it means you can rest  ♫

248
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:16,000
♫  To make you uncomparably happy  ♫

249
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,610
♫  I need to protect you like that  ♫

250
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,850
Son, stay here and eat the bread.

251
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:11,680
If you get bored, draw pictures.

252
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,420
I'm going to visit the new house we're moving into and then come right back.

253
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,420
You can't go anywhere else. Stay put, okay?

254
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,950
You'll come back fast, right?

255
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,100
I'll hurry and come back.

256
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,560
I'll come right back.

257
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,860
Okay.

258
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,440
I'll come back soon.

259
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:38,550
Meow, meow.

260
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
♫  We were young and we both know  ♫

261
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,630
♫  Take us where we want to go  ♫

262
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,480
Meow.

263
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,900
You said you'd come back soon.

264
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,870
Fine.

265
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,880
Meow.

266
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:10,410
Meow. Meow.

267
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,590
Meow.

268
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,030
Eun Im.

269
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,780
What are you doing tonight?

270
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,710
Shall the two of us go out somewhere nice and have dinner?

271
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,050
It's more comfortable to eat at the table.

272
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:06,250
I've spent more days eating at the dinner table alone than with you, my husband.

273
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:14,090
Eun Im, I... switched my campaign ground.

274
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,490
- What? 
 - Um...

275
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,100
- To Byuldongu. 
 - Don't you want to get elected?

276
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,120
That's always been Onnara Party's ground. Don't you know?

277
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,960
You said a politician shouldn't be fearful of losing an election.

278
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,230
That's when you were running for the first time! You've been working on your campaign ground all this time...

279
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,460
Do you even know how much money and time went into all that?

280
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,810
Eun Im, you're not that type of woman.

281
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,880
What's your reason?

282
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,140
That area is going to be redeveloped.

283
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:47,790
The neighborhood has beautiful magnolias and hydrangeas.

284
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:51,570
I want to protect that.

285
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:54,580
Now, you're trying to protect magnolias and hydrangeas?

286
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:57,510
We started there.

287
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:00,800
Don't you remember our newlywed home?

288
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,990
I don't like the idea of that area disappearing.

289
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,450
Do you like pretending to be cool?

290
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:17,630
I thought you'd like it, Eun Im.

291
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:20,710
Forget it. Don't look for me today.

292
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,550
Why not? Is something wrong?

293
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:25,810
I want to play. I will. I'm going to go out.

294
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:30,260
I'm going to focus on myself instead of you from now on.

295
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:39,800
Now, you wrap it like this, like this. Push it like this. Hold this and you make a circle.

296
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:44,110
Relationships can overlap and create a new relationship.

297
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:48,830
It can tangle and become loose. Just like that, hold this line here and...

298
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:53,400
put it through here and make a knot like this.

299
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,270
I heard that Candidate Kang Jung Do is running for the assembly in our neighborhood.

300
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:01,350
Oh, my, my... that handsome assemblyman is coming to our neighborhood?

301
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:06,790
He has to get elected to become an assemblyman! How could he be that? It's not like the position is given.

302
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,790
That's how it works. He has to get elected.

303
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:17,860
You have to untangle a knot that's tangled like this, so that you can tie it right again.

304
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,360
I'll try to undo the knot that's been tangled.

305
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,740
I'll check on the product.

306
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,510
Ah, yes.

307
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,410
By chance, did you eat chicken?

308
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:40,030
Ah, yes. With my kids.

309
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,390
Coach.

310
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,960
Oh, hi. You returning it, too?

311
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,980
I saw your car outside.

312
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,880
Here are the dress and the accessories.

313
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,560
I'll check them.

314
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,610
Did you eat ramen?

315
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:01,560
I didn't eat it while wearing it. I ate it with the dress sitting next to me.

316
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,290
How can you eat chicken and ramen while wearing brand name clothes?

317
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,710
Do you know how much this costs?

318
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:12,040
Are people more important than brands, or are brands more important than people?

319
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:16,420
Eating chicken and ramen isn't prohibited while wearing a brand name dress.

320
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,670
I believe this is looking down on people.

321
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,790
Who do you think we are? Hey, let's go.

322
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,900
Let's go, Coach.

323
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,020
Hey. Domestic clothes are good nowadays, too.

324
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:32,370
What's so good about them?

325
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,620
I didn't see you last night.

326
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:39,300
It was so chaotic. There were so many people.

327
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,370
Did you meet him okay?

328
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,890
Where are you going?

329
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:48,760
Noryangjin.

330
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,430
I was going to drive you if we were going in the same direction.

331
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,870
It's okay. I can take the subway.

332
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:57,030
Okay. I'm going to go grocery shopping and then head to the dorm. My students started dorming.

333
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:59,800
You're going to start getting busy.

334
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,640
With this and that.

335
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:06,600
Bye. Drive carefully.

336
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,540
- Jung Eum. 
 - Yes?

337
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:16,720
There's only one life to live. What's left if you take love out of it?

338
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,910
Bye.

339
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,650
If you take love out of life...

340
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:37,010
Me. I'm left, Coach.

341
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,410
Yes, this is Geum Sang Chum Hwa.

342
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:49,110
Yes, CEO.

343
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:53,110
Yes. Oh Doo Ri...

344
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,500
I'm sorry.

345
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:02,910
No, no. It's not Manager Yoo Jung Eum's fault.

346
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:07,260
I did arrange them. It was misjudgment on my part.

347
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:12,010
From now on, I'll contact only the men who fit Oh Doo Ri's standards.

348
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,880
I'll do that from now on.

349
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,220
Yes, yes. Okay.

350
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:28,670
Geez, that Oh Doo Ri... How do I get rid of her?

351
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:33,380
Hello. I'm from a marriage consulting company. Take a look.

352
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:39,920
Hello. Aigoo, it's tough, huh? Take a candy and stay strong! Fighting!

353
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,280
- Joons! 
 -  Jung Eum, I'm in trouble!

354
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,840
Trouble?

355
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:51,800
Ah, the PPT file?

356
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,920
Look at you. Seriously. Where are you?

357
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,270
Yeah. Yeah.

358
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,900
- Did you bring it!? 
 - This is it, right?

359
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,170
- As expected of Yoo Jung Eum. 
 - Payment for running your errand.

360
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:14,190
I have it prepared.

361
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,400
My first coffee today. This is the taste. It's like a recharge.

362
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,100
Right side. Left side.

363
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,680
Wow, I was so nervous, wondering if you'd make it on time.

364
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,340
So, be sure to remember your things. Don't be so forgetful.

365
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,680
Aigoo, can't be worse than Yoo Jung Eum.

366
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,790
But you wasted your time because of me. Are you okay?

367
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:47,220
I had to come, even if it's not okay. You stayed up all night putting that file together.

368
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,160
How did you know?

369
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,040
You left for work throwing a fuss because you slept in.

370
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,270
It was obvious you stayed up late to work.

371
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:57,600
There are some benefits to living in the same house.

372
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:24,410
Yes, Team Leader. Yes, go ahead.

373
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:28,070
Pardon? Oh Doo Ri?

374
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:33,450
I mean... you know we only have two top tier men...

375
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,010
It never ends.

376
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:41,780
What? Is something wrong?

377
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:46,030
Hey, why is your ear so red?

378
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,440
Oh... I'm hot.

379
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,300
 Give me the torso.

380
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:00,350
Hey, then why is  your  face so red?

381
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:04,090
- I told you I'd give him my body. So impatient! 
 - What?

382
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:08,610
Huh? Nothing. I'm leaving.

383
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:14,500
Take care. Bye.

384
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,300
