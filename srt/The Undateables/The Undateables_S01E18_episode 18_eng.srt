1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,730
in a movie I was watching long ago fell down but got back up

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,570
and started running again.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,630
I really cried a lot while watching that scene.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,680
I actually fell kind of hard for my husband, too,

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,950
while watching him play this song on a piano.

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,480
Here.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,270
That man over there is the one who also requested this song.

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,550
Cheers to the apple of your eye.

9
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,950
It's been

10
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:55,890
quite a while since we've sat next to each other like this, hasn't it?

11
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,000
Eun Nim, regarding that incident with her,

12
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,520
it's not what you think.

13
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,710
It seemed that she felt uncomfortable

14
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,160
being with an assemblyman, so I involved myself. That's all.

15
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,200
I know.

16
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,830
You know?

17
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:25,430
Did you say that you know? Then, why have you been acting that way all this time?

18
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,640
Even if it wasn't true,

19
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,040
what could possibly change?

20
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:39,390
We did well until now.

21
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,410
So, let's just do it up to here.

22
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,940
You'll get elected and I'll find my life.

23
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,070
Okay?

24
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,760
Both you and I

25
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,950
fell in love somehow

26
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:05,130
and worked hard to come all the way here.

27
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,100
You really worked hard.

28
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:15,360
♫  When it needs to be there  ♫

29
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,700
♫  There is nothing in the world  ♫

30
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,080
♫  that consists of only bad things  ♫

31
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,920
♫  That you must remember  ♫

32
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:33,530
♫  these words  ♫

33
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,110
We're back.

34
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,970
You guys are late.

35
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,240
Father.

36
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,560
Drink this.

37
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,460
This is something that I really like.

38
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,280
Also, keep this and drink it tomorrow morning.

39
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,690
No, no, let's share this right now.

40
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,620
Shall we?

41
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,510
As expected, it's great.

42
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:17,310
How did he know that I like this?

43
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,830
Good morning.

44
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,910
What are you doing there? You're not leaving?

45
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,860
I will, a little later.

46
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,000
Should I take you?

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,380
No, go first.

48
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,130
Are you by any chance waiting for Jook?

49
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,420
No.

50
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,640
Hey.

51
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,230
Look, he already left.

52
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,700
You're right.

53
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,320
Anyway, I'll see you later.

54
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,950
Go.

55
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,730
Come out.

56
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,080
It's so hard for us to be alone.

57
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,850
We're late.

58
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,360
We are late.

59
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,840

60
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,470
It's nice.

61
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,730
Drinking coffee and coming into work together.

62
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,940
Ah, about Na Ga Young...

63
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,130
Why are you so businesslike?

64
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,940
I'm in a rush right now.

65
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,640
I ran a matching program like you told me last time and

66
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,460
I pulled out a list, but it's obvious that it will be a fail.

67
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,990
Then, why don't we go to the gallery together and have another meeting?

68
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:17,890
Gallery?

69
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,100
I have to go there anyway.

70
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:25,440
What about working outside the office?

71
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,670
I have to stamp my hours first.

72
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,840
Go stamp. I'll be waiting.

73
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,420
I'll come back soon.

74
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,430
Hey...

75
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,310
Can you stamp me, too?

76
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,060
Why are you doing this?

77
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,140
Why am I doing this?

78
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:46,730
Why am I doing this? You didn't do it last time either. Why are you doing this?

79
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,920
Stamp!

80
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,560
That little... she's an expert.

81
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,700
She's definitely an expert.

82
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,580
Good morning.

83
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,180
- What's the occasion?
 - Team Leader told me not to steal yours.

84
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,770
Really? Then, what will you do now?

85
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,800
She gave me a different mission instead.

86
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,120
- Different mission? 
 - Finding Kim So Eul, who's left the civilized world.

87
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,870
Oh, she knew.

88
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,420
But, why isn't she bugging me about it?

89
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,170
It must've been the seaweed soup.

90
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,860
Anyway, is there any news?

91
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,710
He was in Gangwon province until yesterday,

92
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:55,430
but the day before yesterday, someone said that they saw him in Gyeongsang-do.

93
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:59,060
The way he pops up here and there, he is pretty much a Hong Gil Dong  (Korean Robin Hood character) .

94
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,700
So?

95
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,570
I'm going to Dokdo tomorrow.

96
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:15,030
You are suffering a lot.

97
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,630
Where are you going?

98
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,990
Working outside the office!

99
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,610
Are you two coming into work together?

100
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,310
Yes, it happened that way.

101
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,770
Are you going somewhere?

102
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,960
Since we are meeting like this, you're okay with a cup of tea, right?

103
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,810
I'm finally greeting you properly.

104
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,980
You just left like that last time.

105
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,240
It's okay, right?

106
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,280
It wasn't anything.

107
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,900
That's good, then.

108
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,500
I ate the sandwich.

109
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,520
Mr. CEO.

110
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,790
The next exhibition artist is here.

111
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,110
Go ahead.

112
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,240
I'll be back in a bit.

113
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,510
I will fill that empty spot.

114
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,470
 We made a bet for him to seduce then dump her.

115
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,460
 Oh, so it was a bet.

116
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,980
 It's not a bet. I'm being sincere.

117
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,950
It's my first time seeing Hoon Nam Oppa like this.

118
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,410
Is that right?

119
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,080
You seem to know a lot about my oppa.

120
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,750
Perhaps.

121
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:31,370
We've lived together before and I've tried to seduce him, too.

122
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,420
But he wouldn't fall for me.

123
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,770
Hoon Nam Oppa is a guy who can be trusted.

124
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:46,100
He only seems like a playboy on the outside.

125
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,570
But the problem is...

126
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,330
I am

127
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,940
not a girl who can be trusted.

128
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,340
 I received a lot of help while I was in Australia.

129
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,160
 Joon Soo is a part of my precious memory.

130
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,020
 Can you give him some respect?

131
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,620
 I understand.

132
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,240
I'll respect it.

133
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,270
Can I call you "unni"?

134
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,000
Whatever makes you feel comfortable.

135
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,950
But, haven't we seen each other somewhere?

136
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,780
Why do you look so familiar?

137
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,780
I'm seeing you for the first time.

138
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,980
The meeting ended.

139
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,390
- Already? 
 - Already?

140
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,140
Let's go do our meeting.

141
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,400
To be honest, it's a bit of a waste. Watch.

142
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,700
As you can see, there is nothing wrong with it,

143
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,940
but because the expiration dates for salt-based foods like this are ambiguous,

144
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,550
I don't feel right about discarding them just because the expiration dates were a day or two ago.

145
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,450
But it's the law, so what can we do?

146
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,900
Then, how about distributing them without charge?

147
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,990
No. If it causes a problem, it'll be worse. Discard all of it.

148
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,950
I understand. I guess there's nothing we can do.

149
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,840
This is fine, though.

150
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,330
Please, do as I ask.

151
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,930
- Daddy! 
 - Daddy!

152
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,680
Hey, San, Deul!

153
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,620
Hello.

154
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,490
- Have you eaten? 
 - Yes.

155
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,620
You must be busy, raising twins.

156
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,850
Don't even mention it.

157
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,350
Then, I'll leave the rest to you.

158
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,220
Don't worry and go.

159
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:52,020
- San, Deul, we'll see you next time. 
 - Yes!

160
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,690
- Good-bye. 
 - Good-bye. 
 - Alright, alright.

161
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,820
Good-bye.

162
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,400
Go in.

163
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,180
Oh my, you guys are heavy.

164
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,260
Honey, you have to stand in line properly today if you want the kids to get at least one more experience.

165
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,970
Understood. San and Deul are going to help me, right?

166
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,280
- Yes! 
 - Yes!

167
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,330
Don't come out.

168
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,400
It'll be good if we have lunch together.

169
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,560
I also want to do that, but I have to go because it's Coach Yang's birthday today.

170
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,930
I'll see you at home later.

171
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,760
At home...

172
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,560
Oh? Shady Ryong. Coach Yang's birthday cake later—

173
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,610
He requested to leave early today.

174
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:40,190
I think he's trying to go to Coach Yang's birthday party.

175
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,990
I'm leaving, go and work.

176
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,530
- Hi, Da Bin. 
 - Oh, you're here.

177
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,380
- And Coach? 
 - She went for a bath.

178
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,370
Bath?

179
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:07,190
It's her birthday today. She must be in a good mood. She said she's going to scrub and look good.

180
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,430
What about the others?

181
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:12,980
Shopping for party goods. Ah! Since you're here, would you take a look at this?

182
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,470
Why are you looking at underwear?

183
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,700
I want to buy our coach some underwear.

184
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,010
She's always wearing raggedy panties, trying to take care of us.

185
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:30,340
I'm going to the store with the girls later, but I don't know what to buy her.

186
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:34,240
Okay, let's see.

187
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,980
I think this is what she'd prefer.

188
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,760
Regarding underwear, the person's preferences are important,

189
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,000
but the partner's preferences are just as important, baby.

190
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,210
Eh, who looks at underwear?

191
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,250
This is pretty, what do you think?

192
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:59,000
Oh, yes, of course. Ah. You're coming to the party later, right?

193
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,190
I might not be able to come at night, so I came early.

194
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,520
You can't come later?

195
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,930
This looks delicious.

196
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:12,470
What's this, rice?

197
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,300
This is amazing.

198
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,390
Thank you.

199
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:23,250
Hey, why did you order so much? There's so much variety, there's everything.

200
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,590
You didn't think I'd be able to provide this much for your birthday?

201
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,300
This is so good.

202
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,700
Happy birthday!

203
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,520
Yum, it's delicious!

204
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,560
Thank you.

205
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:47,040
You don't need anything else? I was going to buy cake, too—

206
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,490
It's okay, someone said they would buy the cake.

207
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,080
Shady Ryong?

208
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,410
You— I told you not to keep calling him that!

209
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:01,020
He's also Mr. Art's cousin.

210
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:06,180
Yook Ryong told me before that he would definitely buy my birthday cake and the wine for my zodiac sign.

211
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,390
So, it's okay for me to not be here tonight, right?

212
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,480
What? Why?

213
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,530
To be honest, Mr. Art rented a room at our house.

214
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:24,110
What? Rented a room?

215
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,630
But we haven't done anything together at night.

216
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,340
Do what!?

217
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,630
He sneaks into your house, then tries to pull something—

218
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,080
You, come here.

219
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,760
Oh? Why? Why?

220
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:51,590
Because I called him Shady Ryong? I'm sorry. I'll stop doing it from now on.

221
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,640
Jung Eum.

222
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,480
What? You're scaring me with that low voice and all.

223
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,800
To be honest, I heard something from Yook Ryong.

224
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,190
What did you hear?

225
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,300
Truth is...

226
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:22,520

227
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,740
You've worked hard.

228
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,150
It's really hard to make reservations at this restaurant.

229
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:41,290
Since I know the chef, I was able to make reservations.

230
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:47,200
But there is no way you can get a reservation suddenly like this. That's how amazing this restaurant is.

231
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:52,530
We can go there today and have a meeting with the "Most Wanted Man" and "Most Wanted Woman"...

232
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:58,530
So, we have to go there today, okay?

233
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,510
Yes, Editor. No, no.

234
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:10,660
Huh, right now?

235
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:17,090
Oh, yes, not at all. I'll go right away. Yes, I understand. Ah, yes.

236
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,490
What to do? The editor has asked me to come.

237
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:26,610
It's okay, why don't you go already? I can eat at home.

238
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:31,780
Why? He says it was a restaurant where it's hard to make reservations. Go with me.

239
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,580
- Oh, that—
 - Are you uncomfortable with just us two?

240
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,650
No, no, no. It's not that.

241
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:43,110
I'm not trying to hit on you. I already like another guy.

242
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,730
Oh, I see.

243
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:50,500
So let's go. I need to see how good this place is for him to make a fuss about it.

244
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:55,210
Joon Soo, please take care of Soo Ji. I'm leaving.

245
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:59,320
It's so good, you won't regret it!

246
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,140
Don't miss me too much, and you must go.

247
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,490
- Shall we go? 
 - Yes.

248
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,030
Hold on a second.

249
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,210
Yes, Charlie?

250
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,740
 What do I do? What do I do?

251
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,120
Why? What's going on?

252
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,940
 They said that the reservation isn't valid.

253
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,350
It's okay.

254
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:33,610
 This just means that the heavens want us to go togther. I'm sorry. I promise I'll buy next time.

255
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,070
Okay, sounds good.

256
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,760
- What should we do? 
 - It's  a good thing.

257
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,130
I'm not too fond of fancy restaurants anyway.

258
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:47,760
Then I will take care of you today.

259
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,420
Sounds good.

260
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:21,800

261
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:28,300
♫  It shows   ♫
 ♫  I can't hide my heart  ♫

262
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:34,900
♫  Am I the only one in love?  ♫

263
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:39,840
♫  Truthfully, I'm afraid you aren't  ♫

264
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,290
 I heard something from Yook Ryong.

265
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,820
 Honestly, you're a bet.

266
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,480
 Dating you was a bet between Yook Ryong and that bastard.

267
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,420
 A bet to seduce and then dump you, do you understand?

268
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,730
 Wake up.

269
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:56,350
 That's why that rich bastard crawled into your house.

270
00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:01,540
♫  I really believed that I wasn't  ♫
	♫  I thought I wouldn't ever say I'm in love  ♫

271
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,260
 I'll be living in this house, staring today.

272
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:08,020
 My name is Kang Hoon Nam.

273
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,390
♫  why am I like this?  ♫

274
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:17,800
 Let's just think about now. Forget everything.

275
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,230
 - Some kind of a beetle— 
 - Whoa!

276
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,200
 What? You're afraid of bugs?

277
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,650
 Can you see me riding a bicycle?

278
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:32,040
 Don't get scared! Get rid of fear!

279
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:36,980
 When I was little,  I just thought someone who kicked shuttlecock well was so great.

280
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,380
 There are all sorts of strange tastes.

281
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,020
 Now?

282
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,180
 A man who can drive confidently in reverse.

283
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,760
 Let's date.

284
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,800
♫  With what words should I   ♫

285
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,170
 Don't give it to some other guy.

 Mom.

289
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,580
 It's okay, just look at me.

00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:40,720

♫  If not you  ♫

296
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,770
Cracorn!

297
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,600
Did she not come in yet?

298
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:09,860
Cracorn, are you in your room?

299
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:21,430
What is this? Why aren't you responding when you're here?

300
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,630
Let's go eat something good.

301
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,360
Cracorn!

302
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,720
What's wrong?

303
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,910
Did I do something wrong?

304
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,340
If you're angry, why is that, and if you're riled up, why?

305
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:23,400
You have to talk, so I understand. If you just—

306
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,050
Okay, I understand.

307
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:32,350
Let's talk when you've gathered your thoughts.

308
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,630
Let's get a drink.

309
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,330
When is Jung Eum Unni coming?

310
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,010
She's not going to come today.

311
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,340
So, who are we waiting for then?

312
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,670
I told you that a guest is coming and that's why we set up the wine glasses.

313
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,290
When is he coming?

314
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:03,810
Wait a little bit. He said he was coming, so I'm sure he will.

315
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,810
No, you girls eat first.

316
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,490
Ah!

317
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:18,780
It's your birthday dinner, Coach. You should eat with us.

318
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,550
Since he hasn't even called up until now—

319
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:24,550
No. He's coming.

320
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,390
He said he'd come.

321
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,720
 - Is there something on my hand? 
 - Yeah.

322
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,590
 That's it.

323
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,850
 - Come on. 
 - No, no. Oh, right.

324
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,540
 When is your birthday?

325
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,030
 Me? June 22nd.

326
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:54,220
 Amazing! Me, too. My birthday is June 22nd, too!

327
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,220
 Really?

328
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:59,310
 Would I lie to you? We must be meant for each other.

329
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:02,820
 Yeah! We must be fated.

330
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:09,410
 Noona, do you want to share a bottle of wine on our birthday? Zodiac wine?

331
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,420
 Zodiac wine?

332
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:14,180
 You see, each zodiac sign has a wine.

333
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:19,120
 For highly sensitive people like us, the cancer sign, it's sauvignon blanc.

334
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,300
 Sauvignon blanc? Whoa...

335
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,350
 My honey knows so much!

336
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:33,700
 I don't know about anything else, but I will throw a birthday party for you.

337
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:40,020
 Okay, you do that for me.

338
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,020
 I'll do everything else for you except that.

339
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,010
 Happy birthday!

340
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,080
Yook Ryong.

341
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,480
Your sign is cancer, right?

342
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,500
Yes, I am.  That's why I'm highly sensitive.

343
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:03,320
In that case, I've prepared your zodiac wine. Ta-da!

344
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,690
Sauvignon blanc.

345
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,820
Wow.

346
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,470
This—

347
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,110
 Do you want to share a bottle of wine on our birthday? Zodiac wine?

348
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:18,540
 I don't know about anything else, but I will throw a birthday party for you.

349
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:21,230
 Since we share the same birthday, we have the same zodiac sign.

350
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:25,390
 You said, "Let's have a party while drinking the zodiac wine." You said that sauvignon blanc was the wine for cancer signs.

351
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:29,440
 Did I say that? Let's do that, then.

352
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,720
 Yeah?

353
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,930
 Then, I'll have to get a pretty set of glasses.

354
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,660
He said he'd make sure he'd come.

355
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:21,900
Teacher, we prepared something. One, two, three.

356
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,470
 Ta-da!

357
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,960
How is it, do you like it?

358
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,460
It's pretty.

359
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:53,790
You said that the wine for the cancer sign is sauvignon blanc.

360
00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:02,240
Son of a b*itch. A worthless bastard.

361
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,880
Noona.

362
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:22,250
♪ Happy birthday to... you... ♪

363
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:31,820
 ♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪ 
 ♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪

364
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,860

365
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,770

366
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,060
Blow out the candles.

367
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,210
Make a wish.

368
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:55,380

369
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:22,700
 Yeah, it was like that.

370
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:27,670
 As expected, you...

371
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,730
Cheers, cheers!

372
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:50,790
I don't know if you're okay with this kind of place.

373
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:53,360
Why? I can't eat at these kinds of places because there aren't any.

374
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,460
I like it. I like all kinds of intestines.

375
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,930
I'm a regular here and I really like this place.

376
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:06,290
It's really good. They'll make fried rice later.

377
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:08,210
It's good.

378
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:16,740
Come in. You're with a different man today.

379
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:20,120
That guy is with another woman, too.

380
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,270
Over there.

381
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:38,980
What are you doing? Hurry and come.

382
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,490
Yoo Jung Eum.

383
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:09,860
I prepared some good pigskin to give you, so take it.

384
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,430
Eat. I'll bring it over.

385
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,460
I didn't introduce you two.

386
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,230
You guys haven't met before, right? She is a patient that Charlie introduced.

387
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,600
We don't need to greet each other.

388
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,750
It must be fate. Right, Unni?

389
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,190
You don't call this fate. You call it a coincidence.

390
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:34,090
What? You all know each other?

391
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:37,290
I'm living at Hoon Nam Oppa's house right now.

392
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:42,390
I'm the past woman, and she's the present woman.

393
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,090
What?

394
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:48,830
You're trying to make them misunderstand again.

395
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:53,890
Hold on, what do you mean Soo Ji is at your place?

396
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,260
You're at Jung Eum's place, too.

397
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,390
I have been renting a room there for a long time.

398
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,530
She and I go back a long way, too.

399
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:05,170
Even though you go back a long way, you don't let them stay at your house.

400
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:09,120
A friend renting a room is not so nosy either.

401
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:16,030
Kang Hoon Nam.

402
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:26,350
Let's... break up.

403
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:37,330

404
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:42,470
 Depending on what vowel follows, the meaning can change completely.

405
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:49,370
 Depending on the choice made, the relationship can change completely.

406
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:53,430
 Relationships are consonants.

407
00:32:54,940 --> 00:33:01,620
♫  I call you, I call you  ♫

408
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:09,340
♫  I call you like this  ♫

409
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:16,460
♫  I'm even scared to sleep and dream  ♫

410
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,020
♫  In case we drift apart  ♫

411
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:24,100
♫  and I'm alone again  ♫
