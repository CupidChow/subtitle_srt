1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:01,510
You're here!

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:02,900
What is all this?

3
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,410
Put this in the fridge.

4
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:09,020
The kids are going to the competition, so I brought some stuff to cheer them on.

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,940
I haven't been able to do much, so I should do at least this much.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,430
But you... your face is dark.

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,330
- Really? 
 - Why? Is it because you broke up with him?

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,880
I'm... dating him again.

9
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,780
I know you are worried. It turns out,

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,900
that the bet happened, but he really likes me.

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,910
You believe that?

12
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,980
Yes. I do.

13
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,780
If you believe him, then that's that. You're not the type to be stopped anyway.

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,370
I'll root for you.

15
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:55,550
But, since the both of you are back together, why are you like this?

16
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,130
Because of dating, I could lose my best friend of thirty years.

17
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,200
That doctor friend?

18
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,090
What are you saying? If he is really your best friend he should congratulate you.

19
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:10,170
If he'd really stop seeing you because of this, he wouldn't have stayed by your side for thirty years.

20
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,760
- Right? 
 - A thirty-year friend isn't just any friend.

21
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,270
Since you've made a tough decision, I hope you have a beautiful relationship.

22
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,800
Yes.

23
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,650
What about you?

24
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,080
Forget it. I'm fine.

25
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,870
I have my mind full preparing the kids for the competition.

26
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,120
I have to leave. What about you?

27
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,120
I also have to leave.

28
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,430
The kids will like it.

29
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,530

30
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,950
♫  Oh love, I love you, Only U  ♫

31
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,100
This was what you wanted to do with me?

32
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,320
Yes. I've always wanted to try.

33
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,620
 Have you ever spun a top? Have you?

34
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:01,060
 You have to turn it like this. Now, let's throw it and then grab it, like this.

35
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,260
 One, twom three! Throw and then pull!

36
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,840
Actually, it looked really fun last time.

37
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,150
You should have said something.

38
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,430
How do I do this?

39
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,840
Try it.

40
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,470
♫  It's like a sea breeze for my blocked heart  ♫

41
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,400
♫  It's like a sea breeze for my blocked heart  ♫

42
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,940
The way you hold it is important.

43
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,340
Tightly.

44
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,420
Hold the top like this.

45
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,470
Use your pinky to hold it tightly.

46
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,140
♫  Oh love, I love you, Only U  ♫

47
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,140
Hold it tightly like that.

48
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,020
Like this?

49
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,180
Then, throw and pull.

50
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,380
♫  My heart feels like it'll explode  ♫

51
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,270
♫  I can't express it in words  ♫

52
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,590
♫  I'm falling in love with you forever  ♫

53
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,460
♫  I'm feeling like I'm feeling this is love  ♫

54
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,560
♫  I'm feeling good I'm feeling this is love  ♫

55
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,130
♫  I'm feeling like I'm feeling this is love  ♫

56
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:05,670
♫  I feel the love, do you feel the love?  ♫

57
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,810
What did you do when you were younger? You didn't even spin a top.

58
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,100
You never rode a bike.

59
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,920
I was a loner.

60
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Were you a prankster?

61
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,700
Joon Soo was hit a lot by me.

62
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,690
Joon Soo must have liked it.

63
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,040
Being hit by me?

64
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,480
Knowing everything about your childhood.

65
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:47,380
That's true. He's a part of my memories.

66
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,200
One more time?

67
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,970
Okay.

68
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,440
 This is Kang Hoon Nam.

69
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,490
What did you want to talk about?

70
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,520
Jung Eum said

71
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,050
that you are a friend, teacher,

72
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,870
and sibling to her.

73
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,840
For being by Jung Eum's side until now,

74
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,900
thank you.

75
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:07,930
Jung Eum wants for you of all people to respect her decision.

76
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,750
I won't ask you to trust me, but

77
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,900
can't you believe in Jung Eum's choice?

78
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:41,570
Joon Soo, should we play a round to sober up?

79
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,200

80
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,330
Deal.

81
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,590
 The man you want.

82
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,200
 The man you want.

83
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,860
Ha.

84
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,130
- Go ahead and hit first. 
 - I'll bat first.

85
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,570
Yes.

86
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,260
Ah! Wow...

87
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,370
Mistake. It was a mistake.

88
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,710
The machine is weird.

89
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:47,400
  Expert that got it right. Expert that got it right.

90
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,510
I'll bat.

91
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,570
That was so close.

92
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,540
Ah, well.

93
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,740
My body is not warmed up yet.

94
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,810
That's right. It's because our bodies haven't warmed up yet.

95
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,270
 Can't you trust Jung Eum's choice?

96
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,190
 Trusting Jung Eum...

97
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,340
 Kang Hoon Nam,

98
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,880
 I'll trust you.

99
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,600
 Please take care of Jung Eum.

100
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,840
 Yes. I'll keep that in mind.

101
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,920

(T/N:pronounced like Coach Yang)

102
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,950
Coach Yang...

103
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,610
I miss you.

104
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,430

105
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,440
 Should we go take sticker photos?

106
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,100
 I saw them and there are so many cute ones.

107
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,710
 Are you serious? At our age, that is so childish.

108
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:40,280
 It's childish, right? At our age...

109
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,460
 That's right.

110
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,460
 Yook Ryong,

111
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,980
 chew it thoroughly. You'll get indigestion.

112
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,930
Sun Hee Noona.

113
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:15,450
 Let's end this.

114
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,620
I'm sorry.

115
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,310
I'm sorry.

116
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,730
Don't leave.

117
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,090
Don't leave.

118
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,830
The poor thing...

119
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,690
Catch me if you can.

120
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,970
Sun Hee, I'm sorry.

121
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,640
It was my fault.

122
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,840
Come in.

123
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,120
Here.

124
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,280
It's just the two of us today.

125
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,390
It looks like Jung Eum left for work very early today.

126
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,650
Father.

127
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,500
What?

128
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,970
I'm going to have to leave the house for a while.

129
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,590
Will this be too much of  a burden?

130
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,640
Here we go.

131
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,130
I'm going to miss you.

132
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,990
It's not like I'll be gone forever.

133
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:49,680
It's just a long-term business trip. I'll be back soon.

134
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:56,310
Father, you can't drink a lot just because I'm not here, okay?

135
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,520
Without you here, who would I even drink with?

136
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,310
I'm sure you'll have someone to drink with soon.

137
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,800
I'm really leaving now.

138
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,610
Make sure you eat all your meals.

139
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:15,110
Bbang Sik, Bbang Soon, take care okay?

140
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,230
- I'll contact you when I get there. 
 - Take care.

141
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,820
Yes.

142
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,460
Hyung, bye.

143
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:53,650
Heung Gook. Come here.

144
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:59,480
You can have this.

145
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,440
Stop eating ice cream. Listen to your mom, okay?

146
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,290
I should give this to Ah Reum!

147
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,270
 Friends Forever Certification.

148
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:46,290
 Choi Joon Soo, Yoo Jung Eum.

149
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:53,090
 The two mentioned above have certified that they are armed with the strongest of friendships.

150
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:58,210
 Now, they will never forget the excitement they felt the first time they met,

151
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:03,550
 and will understand, embrace, and respect each other as friends.

152
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,130
 Until the sun becomes a lump of coal,

153
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,750
 until the waves stop crashing,

154
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:13,650
 they will believe in each other and in this agreement.

155
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,710
Jung Eum, you have to go to work!

156
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:57,630
That slipper, Joon Soo changed it before he left.

157
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,310
Choi Joon Soo, really...

158
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,440
Why isn't she coming?

159
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,690
I can't tie her up and keep her with me.

160
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:54,110
Or squish her to keep her in my pocket.

161
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,650
I'm going crazy.

162
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:06,120
♫  These days, I keep growing curious about you  ♫

163
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,810
♫  I want to know more about you  ♫

164
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:15,760
♫  I become your other half in your head  ♫

165
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,640
♫  Awkwardly, haphazardly  ♫

166
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,280
Today, we're going to have to sleep here and

167
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,560
have the Zero Member Emergency Meeting!

168
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,320
Sleep here?

169
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,190
♫  May I carefully knock on your heart  ♫

170
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,820
What is this?

171
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,950
Right?

172
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,870
This is Na Ga Young's daily schedule.

173
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:58,780
- Should we stop looking at this? 
 - When is he supposed to go on a blind date?

174
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,800
He doesn't even have time to attend a blind date.

175
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,840
That's right. Stop looking at this. Do you want to eat something?

176
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,980
Even if I schedule a date, I'll just be cursed at.

177
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:09,440
That's right. Let's stop and rest.

178
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,830
I guess there's no choice.

179
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,990
Let's work separately.

180
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:40,780
What are you doing? Why are you sneaking looks at me instead of working?

181
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,290
I'm not. I'm looking at myself.

182
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:46,160
You're looking at my face.

183
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,460
You're too pretty.

184
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,520
How dazzling!

185
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,500
What happened to your pen?

186
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,820
 I'm the person that called earlier, Kang Hoon Nam.

187
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:38,550
 There is a matter of order. This isn't right.

188
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:41,450
You used to always used brand named ones.

189
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,440
Are you busy?

190
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:56,850
What's up with this cat mug?

191
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,600
Well, since I'm making a cat character...

192
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,120
What is it? I sent the final draft through e-mail.

193
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:10,110
The character development exhibition we're doing, have you found a location?

194
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:13,100
I received the list from Yook Ryong. I'll give it to you when you leave.

195
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,240
Okay. Good.

196
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,910
This time, we did the "Most Wanted Woman."

197
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:26,810
Soo Ji became the queen of the "Most Wanted Woman." Did you know?

198
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,250
Soo Ji is doing well, right?

199
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:35,490
Well, it seems so. But I heard it's been a while since you guys contacted each other.

200
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:42,320
Well, dating is nice and all, but it's not like you're not going to ever see her again. Just clear things up with her a little.

201
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,830
It's been awhile, Charlie.

202
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:58,440
"Wanted Man"?

203
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:04,060
Oh, the "Most Wanted Man." I'm the best "Most Wanted Man"?

204
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,900
First place? Yes.

205
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,910
Photo shoot with the best "Most wanted Woman"?

206
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,690
I'm a bit embarrassed about that.

207
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:18,960

00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,680
Joon Soo.

212
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,500
I was going to contact you.

213
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,900
Why are you here?

214
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,370
Ah!

215
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,390
By any chance...?

Oh, I see.

222
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,650
I didn't know I was.

♫  Dirty work  ♫

225
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:10,130
Now, what about your dating lives?

226
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,480
I was recently rejected.

227
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,250
You were rejected? Even though you are so perfect?

228
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,440
I was also rejected recently.

229
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,050
Even though you are this perfect?

230
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,480
- I'm not popular. 
 - I'm not popular.

231
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,660
I mean it. Because I really wanted to date,

232
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,240
I even signed up with a match-making company.

233
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,270
Me, too.

234
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,360
I'm sorry. I liked it so much that I talked for too long.

235
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,040
Well, the thing is, I have an appointment at the salon today to...

236
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,380
Oh, no worries. You need to get going.

237
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,660
Please go. It's okay.

238
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,240
Thanks for your hard work.

239
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,970
Thanks for your hard work.

240
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,440
Thanks for the good work!

241
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,300
- Should we go, too? 
 - Okay.

242
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:26,850
That match-making company is the one that Jung Eum works at, Geum Sang Chum Hwa, right?

243
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:27,940
Yes.

244
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,860
That's great. I'm also in Geum Sang Chum Hwa.

245
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:36,290
You said that you believe that nothing ever happens without a reason.

246
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,120
Yes.

247
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,410
It really seems that things happen with a reason. I'll see you soon.

248
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,700
Yoo Jung Eum! Come in!

249
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,360
What is with those clothes?

250
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,810
It's the Green Mother's Association. Have you heard of it?

251
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:02,060
- Aren't you hot? 
 - I'm not.

252
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:06,690
You had that emergency meeting and everything. The ghost member and the member that rejects all the dates,

253
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,970
how's it going with them?

254
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,360
Well, at least the ghost member went on a blind date. Let's leave her for now.

255
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:19,080
Do something about that member, the one who rejected one-hundred dates.

256
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:28,290
He's got a good resume and looks pretty nice, too.

257
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:31,740
Why is he rejecting so many?

258
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,710
Did I interrupt?

259
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:57,830
That day...

260
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:01,990
Forget it. I'm not here to talk about it.

261
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:07,270
I know that Hoon Nam is not the one.

262
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:11,580
Thanks to the two of you, I truly feel like I've hit the bottom.

263
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,810
So, will you take care of me this time?

264
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,010
My dad is really sick. That's why I have to go on blind dates.

265
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:25,620
If I'm going to marry someone, I thought Hoon Nam wouldn't be a bad choice.

266
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:30,490
But there aren't a lot of guys that meet my dad's standards.

267
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,610
I want to choose someone again.

268
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:34,970
Yes, tell me.

269
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,310
Choi Joon Soo.

270
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,870
I heard that Joon Soo is also a member here, right?

271
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:48,870
Set me up with Joon Soo.

272
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,160
 I chose you as my blind date.

273
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,830
 If you go on the date with me, Jung Eum will feel less pressure,

274
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,520
 and I think her record will go up, too.

275
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:29,020
 A successful match aside, isn't it killing two birds with one stone?

276
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,290
 I'll choose again.

277
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,640
 Yes, please tell me.

278
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,070
 Choi Joon Soo.

279
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:07,330
Can you even look at your work when you're with me?

280
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:10,250
I'm asking, can you even look at your work when you're with me?

281
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:16,160
What? No. Work became complicated.

282
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,530
Complicated? Then I should make it un-complicated.

283
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:22,450
- Give it to me. 
 - I can't.

284
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,050
Yook Ryong!

285
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:29,120
Again.

286
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:38,130
Give it to me! Really, what are you doing?

287
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,590
Give it to me, hurry!

288
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:52,690

289
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,980
Mother.

290
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:11,170

291
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:16,360
 Whether you like it or not, whether it's small or big,

292
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:23,260
 it comes over you without warning. Dating is a typhoon.
