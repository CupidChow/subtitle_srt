1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,300
They're Zero Members for a reason.

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,100
I've become a legend!

3
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,100
The eldest and only son of six children.

4
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,400
Wow!

5
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,300
He writes poetry.

6
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,800
He busks in Uijeongbu at night.

7
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,200
Yook Ryong, that bastard, seriously!

8
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:06,900
Hello?

9
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,900
 Is this by any chance Yook Ryong's phone?

10
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,500
Yes, it is. May I ask, who is calling?

11
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:20,300
 You gave me your business card in Gangnam the other day and asked if I wanted to get a meal with you.

12
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,500
 Don't you remember? I have short hair.

13
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,500
Short hair...

14
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,900
Oh, I remember. You look like Meg Ryan.

15
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,500
 Oh, my! Meg Ryan?

16
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,100
 Do I?

17
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,600
 If you have some time, would you like to have some coffee?

18
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,900
- Oh, but today I'm a bit busy... 
 - Oh...

19
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,700
 I see. I really wanted to see you again.

20
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,400
If you really want to, I absolutely need a cup of coffee every day no matter how busy I am.

21
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,100
Where should we meet? I know that place. See you later.

22
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,100
Oh, you surprised me!

23
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,700
Are you going somewhere?

24
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,500
I am going to have a cup of coffee.

25
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,700
There is a cafe.

26
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,400
Employees get 50% off. Why would you go somewhere else?

27
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,900
Ah, you see... My high school friends suddenly want to meet—

28
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,900
Bring them here. I'll personally make coffee for you guys.

29
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,900
Don't trouble yourself. It's okay.

30
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,400
It's fine. Bring them here. We just roasted some new beans today.

31
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,100
Are you trying to keep an eye on me?

32
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,300
Yes, I am.

33
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,500
You're being too much!

34
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,500
If you screw up one more time, I'll have to let you go.

35
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,300
You know that, right?

36
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,900
I do, but...

37
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,700
His wife went to visit her family so he said he needed to bring his kids.

38
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,700
He has two kids. I didn't want to bring them to the gallery.

39
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,700
Go then.

40
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,400
Yes.

41
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,900
Perhaps...

42
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,160
It's me. Geum Sang Chum Hwa.

43
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,000
Hey!

44
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,600
Come here, quick!

45
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,100
Let go of me and we can talk.

46
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,100
Let's just have a talk.

47
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,700
If it was just one person, I wouldn't say anything. But eight at the same time? Are you human?

48
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,900
It's not like I planned to...

49
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,500
They said that it's okay to meet many of them at once!

50
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,600
All at once?

51
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,900
Who said so? Which insane match-making company told you that?

52
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,300
It's not a company. It's my cousin. He's an expert in relationships.

53
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,200
- Expert my a**!
 - There's this thing called "Hoon Nam Jung Eum."

54
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,100
It's a relationship column. It's written by a real expert.

55
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,700
I'm going to fix you up!

56
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,800
No, please! I'm afraid of heights!

57
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,900
But I'm telling the truth!

58
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,100
Look at my face. Do you think I would be able to seduce multiple women with this face?

59
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,100
I learned everything from that expert.

60
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,500
I also used to be a Zero Member, Noona.

61
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,100
- I'm not your noona!
 - I'm sorry.

62
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,500
But, there were some bad women, too!

63
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:48,100
They took advantage of me!

64
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,900
I also wanted to carry out the same revenge!

65
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,700
An eye for eye, a tooth for tooth!

66
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,500
You're supposed to be reflecting on your actions right now, why are you preaching to me?

67
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,700
Hey! Hey! Are you not going to come here?

68
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:11,100
I'm giving you one last chance. Go and sincerely apologize to those women.

69
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,300
Do you understand? I asked, do you understand?

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,900
This is an agreement to accuse you for fraudulent behavior.

71
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:26,100
I met with every single one of them and persuaded them and got this.

72
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,100
Seven out of eight of them signed.

73
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,600
Just seven of them?

74
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,100
Who do you think is that one person?

75
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,300
Yoo Ri?

76
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,700
Coach Yang, you idiot!

77
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:41,000
Anyway, until this situation is fixed, you're going to be at my beck and call.

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,300
Pick up the phone within five seconds when I call you.

79
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,700
If you try to disappear, we'll cross the river of no return

80
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,600
and meet each other in court, understand?

81
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,100
Okay, three months.

82
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,300
I'll take care of all of them in three months!

83
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,700
Let's see...

84
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,700
What do you want me to do?

85
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,200
What do you want me to do? What do you want me to do?

86
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,500
How in the world am I supposed to match them up in  three months?

87
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,300
Is this  Mission Impossible ?

88
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,700
I'd rather rob a bank in Switzerland.

89
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,700
They say that you only need three seconds to fall in love.

90
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,600
Three months is 7,776,000 seconds.

91
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,500
You can fall in love 2,592,000 times, right?

92
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,700
Wow. You were like a math genius just then.

93
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,100
So eat this and do it.

94
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,200
- Aaah! 
 - One, two, three.

95
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,300
This works...

96
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,400
What are you trying to do?

97
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,300
I read that this is how you give a forehead kiss in a magazine.

98
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,600
Wow!

99
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,000
What kind of doctor has enough time to read magazines?

100
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,100
This is actually kind of cool.

101
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,100
You should also have a look at it.

102
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,500
This is a magazine called "Le Chic" and it's popular among men.

103
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,400
I hate it. I don't read magazines.

104
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,300
There's a relationship column.

105
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,300
It seems pretty useful. I see why it's so popular.

106
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,300
That's enough. They're all just theories.

107
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,900
No, you should look at it at least once.

108
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,500
It's this thing called "Hoon Nam Jung Eum." It's well known among men who have never dated before.

109
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,800
"Hoon Nam Jung Eum"?

110
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,100
 - It's my cousin. He's an expert in relationships. 
- Expert my a**!

111
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:31,900
 There's this thing called "Hoon Nam Jung Eum." It's written by a real expert!

112
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,500
I heard that some matchmakers work with these relationship experts these days.

113
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,100
They give lectures and counseling to members.

114
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,900
Don't you think it'd work?

115
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,500
 How do you think I seduced eight women with this face?

116
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,500
 I really learned it all from that relationship expert.

117
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,100
 I also used to be a Zero Member, Noona.

118
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,100
Give it to me.

119
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,000

120
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,200

121
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,000

122
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,500
Hello, this is Le Chic.

123
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,600
Editor Charlie?

124
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,300
Yes, this is Charlie.

125
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,800
Hello.

126
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,900
I'm Yoo Jung Eum. I work for a match-making company called Geum Sang Chum Hwa.

127
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,900
 I read the column you wrote, Hoon Nam Jung Eum—

128
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,800
It's okay, I am not buying.

129
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,700
Hello, I would like to meet Editor Charlie.

130
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,100
Charlie? Please wait a minute.

131
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
Okay.

132
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,300
Are you the head of the reporting team?

133
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,300
What?

134
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,250
He's right there.

135
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,320
Thank you.

136
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,400
I am sorry. Sorry! Sorry!

137
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,280
Can I meet Editor Charlie?

138
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,910
- Do you have an appointment? 
 - No.

139
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:59,690
He's in the middle of a photo shoot. How can I help you?

140
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:02,110
I don't have a lot of time. Should I wait upstairs?

141
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:05,980
That would be great. Have a nice time.

142
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,760
Yes.

143
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,320
 Okay! Nice!

144
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,850
You're sad right now. So sad.

145
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,120
It's pouring down, it's raining.

146
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,550
That's it! That's amazing!

147
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,930
Great!

148
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,520
 We'll take a break.

149
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,700
You really are desirable.

150
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,070
Who else do you desire?

151
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:36,390
You're the only celebrity. There's one soccer player, but the other three are normal people.

152
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,960
You know, a decent looking office man type.

153
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:45,170
There's a doctor who I don't really like. He's as tall as you but his face is not pretty.

154
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:48,500
Are you looking for a doctor? I know a really handsome doctor.

155
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,390
Who?

156
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,720
He's a friend of mine. He has a tiny face—

157
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,640
But, I have been really curious about this for a long time, who are you?

158
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,330
Excuse me?

159
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,150
I am...

160
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:07,780
I'm from the matchmaking company, Geum Sang Chum Hwa. We talked earlier on the phone—

161
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,440
You scared me!

162
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,780
What?

163
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,870
Who are you?

164
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,660
Mr. Kim, take care of her.

165
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,230
What do you mean, "take care of her"?

166
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:20,470
The friend I just mentioned is really handsome. I told you I work at a matchmaking company.

167
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,800
I know a lot of doctors who are our members.

168
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,610
No...

169
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,500
Hello.

170
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,910
Are you done with the photo shoot?

171
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,100
Yes, just now.

172
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,680
Let's have a look at the big picture during the meeting next Monday.

173
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,820
You're taking too long planning the column these days.

174
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:42,080
If it's still like that this month, we might put an ad in that section next month.

175
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,390
Yes?

176
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,170
First, can I have a look at that doctor's face?

177
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,770
Yes.

178
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,400
- Why are you so late? We're apparently having the worst drought ever.
 - Oh, really?

179
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,410
Why did you come?

180
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,460
This. Can you remove this part?

181
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,020
This strange figure in the background.

182
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,700
What is...?

183
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,690
- What is this? 
 - I also don't know.

184
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:29,960
I didn't notice it when we were taking the photo. But when I looked at it later, it was there. Do you think the film was exposed to light?

185
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:34,050
Hey, this is not because of the light. It's obviously a face.

186
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:39,100
Look right here. These are eyes and this is a mouth. What else could this be if it's not a person's face?

187
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,390
It's a bit blurry, but it's definitely a face.

188
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,860
Look carefully.

189
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,760
It looks like they're sticking their tongues out.

190
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,130
I get it. They were hanging upside down from a tree branch.

191
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:58,200
What a funny coincidence. How was this captured on camera?

192
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,050
This picture is amazing!

193
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,420
That's enough. Can you remove it?

194
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,250
How am I supposed to fix the original?

195
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,050
You have an expert on your team.

196
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,650
They work digitally. This is—

197
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:13,240
Charlie, I'm asking you.

198
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:21,630
I don't have the negative. This is the only copy.

199
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,510
The only picture I have with my mom, who has passed away.

200
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:32,440
I didn't touch it because I didn't want to damage it, but it bothers me too much.

201
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,410
- But—
- I know, I know.

202
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:39,090
Do you know that we have a deadline this week? Got it, got it?

203
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,290
Aren't you going to eat with me?

204
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,720
I thought you had a deadline to meet.

205
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,910
So sassy. I know how much of a softie he is inside.

206
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:55,840
The youngest member of you team looked unfocused. It makes him look pathetic.

207
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,010
 The process where you only show just enough emotion

208
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,860
 and play easy or hard to get is a relationship.

209
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,110
 Especially since relationships operate on a level of self-care nowadays.

210
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,640
 Falling in love too quickly

211
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,870
 doesn't make you seem romantic anymore.

212
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:34,300
 Rather, it makes you appear like a novice, not having caught on to the changing rules of dating.

213
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,580
 If you don't want to end up as the person who fell for an illusion,

214
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:47,480
 or the fool who falls in love easily,

215
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:05,040
 you need to be more experienced in controlling your emotions

216
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,370
 and perfect how you express them.

217
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:28,620
♫  I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
 You got me thinking 'bout  ♫

218
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,500
♫  when you were mine   ♫

219
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,040
Is there a reason why you became a doctor at a rehabilitation clinic?

220
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,470
When I was a teenager, I used to think it'd be cool if I could take care of someone I like.

221
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,890
I think it started from that kind of show-off thinking.

222
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,580
You're so romantic.

223
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,070
Whoever you're dating must be very happy.

224
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,990
I'm not seeing anyone yet.

225
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,860
I know this is a cliché, but what's your ideal type?

226
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,980
Ideal type?

227
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,340
I've never really thought about it.

228
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:06,060
Someone who looks lively, even without makeup.

229
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,930
I like the kind of women who are natural and healthy.

230
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,260
Someone who has natural hair with no perm.

231
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,770
Someone who's not picky with food. Someone energetic.

232
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:22,210
Rather than someone who's too polished or trendy, I'd like someone who I can feel comfortable with, like a friend.

233
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,570
No, no, no!

234
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:36,910
I like someone who's really skinny with really long wavy hair who belongs in a city, a woman like that.

235
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,570
Yes, that's my type.

236
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:52,180
That's a wrap for the interview. Let's go get dinner.

237
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,310
I'd like to treat you.

238
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,180
- Give me the photo.
 - What's the rush?

239
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,150
 What do you think? Pretty good, huh?

240
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,960
Yeah.

241
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,460
- What's this? 
- The original print.

242
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,460
I asked you to fix the original one, not give me a copy.

243
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,970
You have to keep the original as it is.

244
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,260
If you were going to do this, why do you think I—?

245
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:39,550
Say hello! This is the first person to be featured in "Desirable Man: The professionals."

246
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:43,770
Rehabilitation doctor, Choi Joon Soo.

247
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:48,200
Nice to meet you, I'm Choi Joon Soo.

248
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,340
- This is—
 - I'm Kang Hoon Nam.

249
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,490
What is this? This is a work of art.

250
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,950
Hey! Mr. Kim, come here and get a photo of the two of them!

251
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,440
A dragon and a tiger.

252
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,890
Who's the tiger and who's the dragon?

253
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,590
Don't worry about him. He's always like that because of his job.

254
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,180
Oh, I see.

255
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,760
If you haven't eaten, you should join us.

256
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,500
I actually have to get going. Enjoy your meal.

257
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:26,460
Don't worry about it. He's always like that.

258
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,850
What would you like to eat?

259
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,060
We can go wherever you'd like.

260
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:40,000
I wanted to take you to a good Spanish restaurant nearby.

261
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,590
I don't really like foreign food. I'm not very cultured.

262
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:46,740
You're so modest. You're the completely the opposite of him.

263
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:52,420
He's extremely prickly and snobby.

264
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,030
It seems like you guys are pretty close.

265
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,930
We met while we were in the army.

266
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,620
I see, it's like that then.

267
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:07,830
I used to go by Chul Soo, not Charlie, back then.

268
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,460
 It stinks!

269
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,260
 I'm sorry.  I can't, sir.

270
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,910
 You're not letting me change my underwear?

271
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,090
 Let go. Let go!

272
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:45,020
 Seriously? I said let go!

273
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:48,860
 This is mine, sir.

274
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,880
 Are you out of your mind?

275
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,430
 I can just give you one of mine later!

276
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,460
 I don't want other people's underwear, sir.

277
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,260
 Oh, really?

278
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:05,440
 Excuse me, Unni? Why did you come to the army then?

279
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,690
 What are you looking at? If you joined the army, you'd better act like a man!

280
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:12,620
 Acting like a little bi***...!

281
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,990
 Then, do you think it's manly to take someone else's underwear?

282
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:22,590
 And you called him a bi***? Please watch your mouth.

283
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,450
 You think I'm unusual too, don't you?

284
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:42,010
 I think you're detail-oriented and clean.

285
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:45,440
 You're very perceptive of people.

286
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,140
 I think it's more important to be true to yourself than try to satisfy everyone and get hurt along the way.

287
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,880
 You have the right to be yourself.

288
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,090
 You really have a great friend.

289
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:02,200
He's the one who made me the way I am today.

290
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,160
Do you want another drink?

291
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,460
I get drunk really easily.

292
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,700
Here you go.

293
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,880
I'm so happy!

294
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,970
I'm sorry.

295
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:35,260
Sorry about that.

296
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,590
 Joon Soo!

297
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:43,280
 I really need him!

298
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,510
 My life is so hard.

299
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:49,340
 Without him, I'm sad!

300
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,300
 What are you doing right now?

301
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,980
 Remember when I was being bullied by some girls—?

302
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,860
 That's when you were eight years old. How much longer are you going to bring that up?

303
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,260
 Then when we were in middle school...

304
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,880
 Where do I need to go?

305
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,800
Do you think you could help Jung Eum out a bit?

306
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,690
You're an iconic figure in that field.

307
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,220
You can treat it like one of your columns.

308
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:18,200
Excuse me, Hoon Nam Jung Eum is...

309
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,510
- Are you okay?
 - Yes.

310
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,610
I don't write Hoon Nam Jung Eum.

311
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,650
You fool.

312
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:32,470
I'm not the writer!

313
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,920
- I brought you some bindaetteok  (mung bean pancake) . 
 - Hey!

314
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,110
Did you drink?

315
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,360
Sir, I'm here!

316
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,890
Oh, you're here. Have you eaten?

317
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:50,860
I have. I brought you some bindaetteok by the way.

318
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,120
Do you have makgeoli?

319
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,790
Of course, we do. Hold on a second.

320
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,900
Sir, I already had dinner so I just need some kimchi.

321
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,610
Forget that. So what happened? Tell me, quickly.

322
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:09,070
How did it go? Is he going to help me?

323
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:11,360
Apparently, he's not the who writes the column.

324
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,320
What?

325
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,890
I don't know the details, but there's a ghostwriter.

326
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,400
I have his business card.

327
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,630
Hurry!

328
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:26,050

329
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:29,620
Why are they using a different name for the column?

330
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,390
I'm sure there's a reason, like if he didn't want his identity to be known.

331
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,110
Is that so?

332
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,550
He might change what he said when he sobers up tomorrow.

333
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,630
I need to go now.

334
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,850
Share the bindaetteok with Dad. I'll be right back.

335
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:39,840
Right now?

336
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,100
Yeah, save me some. I'll eat it later when I come back!

337
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,620
Are you feeling okay?

338
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,490
You're not sick, are you?

339
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:15,020
It's heavy. You can call me when you need someone to carry heavy stuff.

340
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:15,950
Why are you here?

341
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,740
I thought I'd drop by on my way home.

342
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:22,220
You work in Yangpyeong and your house is in Jamsil, but you're dropping by Bulgang?

343
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,920
Sorry—

344
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:31,000
I just wanted to see you. I'll leave now.

345
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,660
Take this with you.

346
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:12,480
Thank you.

347
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,890
Awful jerk.

348
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:26,160
I was just getting over you.

349
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:34,950
What's gotten into you? You don't normally do this kind of stuff.

350
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:46,220
Hyung, by the way, can you go to jail for fraud?

351
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,440
I guess—

352
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:53,070
Did you do something?

353
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,250
To be honest, a manager from a match-making company I signed up for

354
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,670
keeps threatening that she'll sue me,

355
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:02,380
- just because I had a few one-night stands. 
 - Hey!

356
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:06,440
I clearly told you that you have to behave yourself right now. With the situation right now, did you have to—?

357
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,630
It'd have been better if you were the one being scammed!

358
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,360
This is all your fault!

359
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,900
Why did you have to make me so charming!?

360
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:17,160
Are you crazy? I helped you when you were getting dumped all the time!

361
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,140
That's why, help me out with this, too.

362
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,020
That woman is really scary.

363
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,810
You probably know how to deal with an ignorant and violent woman.

364
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:29,330
Please save me, Hyung!

365
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:37,400
 I don't write Hoon Nam Jung Eum.

366
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,700
 You fool.

367
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,450
 I'm not the writer!

368
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:49,940
Hoon! She didn't call.

369
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,220
Who are you talking about?

370
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,260
So, the thing is...

371
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:04,220
I had too much to drink... Put that thing away!

372
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:17,950
The column... I said that you wrote...

373
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:20,690
That's enough. I can't understand you at all right now.

374
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:24,690
Have a seat. I'll bring you some ice water.

375
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:26,920
 What did you eat, anyway?

376
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,920
 Disgusting!

377
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,890
Don't touch me.

378
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:32,440
Excuse me...

379
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:35,040
is there Mr. Kang Hoon Nam...?

380
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,080
Let go!

381
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:43,150
 It's me, Geum Sang Chum Hwa.

382
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:50,040
Hoon Nam! It's her!

383
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,970
 I'm from the matchmaking company, Geum Sang Chum Hwa. We talked earlier on the phone...

384
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:58,120
Hoon Nam! She's the one I was talking about!

385
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:07,060

386
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:25,400
Are you... Kang Hoon Nam?

387
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,720
♫  Oh love, I love you, Only U  ♫

388
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,160

389
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,470
 Relationships are like fate.

390
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:37,750
 Just like it was predicted that the world would end, but the earth still hasn't collapsed,

391
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:41,260
 you can never know what will happen in the end in with relationships.

392
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:45,820
 That's what relationships are.

393
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:53,630
♫  Oh love, I love you, Only U 
I'm in big trouble  ♫

394
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:56,700
♫  I think of you all day   ♫

395
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,070
♫  My heart feels like it'll explode ♫

396
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:03,290
♫  I can't express it in words  ♫

397
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:06,650
♫  I'm falling in love with you forever   ♫

398
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:08,950
♫  I'm feeling like, I'm feeling this is love  ♫

399
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,280
♫  I'm feeling good, I'm feeling this is love  ♫

400
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,640
♫  I'm feeling like, I'm feeling this is love  ♫

401
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,280
♫  I feel the love, do you feel the love  ♫

402
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,220

403
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,060
 Where did Jung Eum go?

404
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,190
 She's going to find the relationship coach.

405
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:20,940
 A relationship coach?

406
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,610
 Go get me some chocolates and coffee.

407
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:24,490
 Okay.

408
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,340
 What am I, his slave?

409
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,200
 I have no intention of cooperating with you at all. Leave.

410
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,370
 - What do you need to come to an agreement?
 - Bait.

411
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,620
 What kind of bait would work for him?

412
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,820
 A woman?

413
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,120
 Just throw in the bait for now.

414
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,100
 She's a weird one.

415
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,870
 Okay, what do you need from me?

416
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:46,320
 He took the bait!

417
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,500
♫  Your love, I'm excited for it every day  ♫
