1
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,300
Mom, will our town really be

2
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,290
- turned into a lake? 
 - Yes.

3
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,020
They said they have no choice because of the dam construction.

4
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,160
If they make the dam, the whole town will be submerged up to where that mountain is.

5
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,190
Then, is our house also going to disappear as well?

6
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,540
It won't disappear. It's just going to remain inside the lake,

7
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,880
though we won't be able to go there.

8
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,990
I see.

9
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,770
We could go there in a submarine!

10
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,350
Oh, yes we could!

11
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,490
When I go to Seoul, I want to learn how to swim.

12
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,200
- Really?  
 - Yeah, I want to learn with you.

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,760
That's great. Then let's go take a picture.

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,270
- Okay. 
 - Great.

15
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,290
Since it's the last day before the move, let's quickly take a picture and then go. The movers are probably waiting for us.

16
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,690
- One, two, three. Kimchi! 
 - Kimchi!

17
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,130
 Excuse me, are you okay?

18
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:38,120
 Hey, please come to your senses!

19
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,600

20
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,460
- You, you... 
 - Ah!

21
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,010
Did you follow me all the way here to get your revenge?

22
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:03,990
What revenge? I didn't know, I really didn't know! I thought you were raising your hand since you put up your arm

23
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,620
How did you know that I can't swim? Did you do a background check on me? Huh?!

24
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,670
Background check? Why would I do such a thing? No!

25
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:16,350
How can you try to kill someone just because of a contract? Murderer!

26
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,590
- I'm telling you it's just a misunderstanding! 
 - What misunderstanding?

27
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,220
Hey, wait!

28
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,390
Excuse me! This woman... just...

29
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,570
pushed me into the river...

30
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,700
- Are you alright? 
 - Yes! We are alright!

31
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,580
Don't come near me! Don't! Don't! Don't!

32
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,990
Don't do it!

33
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,960
Stop right there! Dear god.

34
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,290
Why?

35
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,080
Let's go to the police station.

36
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,790
- The police station?
 - We have to ask you some questions.

37
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:08,920
Hey! Hey! Hey!

38
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,600
And you there, you come with us, too.

39
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,890
You can write on this.

40
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:27,100
That bastard, with another woman...

41
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,620
went into a motel.

42
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,970
I hope that he'll be alright...

43
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,080
Yeah, it's better if you keep sleeping.

44
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,700
Where am I?

45
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,820
At the police station.

46
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,450
That was a good idea. Now go and turn yourself in.

47
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,720
What do you mean turn myself in? It really wasn't intentional.

48
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,820
It's the end for you now. Do you know how big of a crime murder is? Hmm?

49
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:39,030
W-w-why? Why are you crying? You didn't do anything good.

50
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:44,610
I'm not crying because I did something good. I was so worried that you were actually dead.

51
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,600
To be honest, the woman over there was betrayed by a jerk.

52
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,240
After being hurt by that guy, she jumped into the Han River.

53
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,620
He said he would only go to hotels with her, but he apparently has been going to motels with other women.

54
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,390
Oh, so that's what happened?

55
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,840
It's so unfair! They were hanging out together.

56
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,760
I agree. Men are pigs.

57
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,510
Hello, sir, are you awake now?

58
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,420
Don't you think you should go to a hospital?

59
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,980
No, it looks like I'm fine.

60
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,880
Then, could you two come here as well? I have some quick questions.

61
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,270
Yes.

62
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,460
You're... a diving coach?

63
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,250
Does it make sense that a diving coach wants to die by drowning in a river? Are you joking?

64
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,620
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,380
And you almost killed this man right here.

66
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,560
I was in hurry.

67
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,470
If you were in such hurry, you could have gone in yourself.

68
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,690
You're a diving athlete yourself.

69
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,780
I'm so sorry.

70
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,100
- She didn't do anything wrong. I'm the one who should be punishedâ€”
- Back off, Ahjumma.

71
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,210
I am not an ahjumma.

72
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:22,150
What would you like to do? Do you want to press charges?

73
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,050
If not, would you like to go for a settlement?

74
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,250
I'll consider it if you promise not to show up in front of me ever again.

75
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,220
Yes, I will. You'll never see me again.

76
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,970
To be honest, we don't really have a reason to ever see each other again, right?

77
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,110
Yes, it's fine then.

78
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,850
Then, I will take it as you have come to an agreement and I will allow you two to go.

79
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,100
Excuse me.

80
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:30,380
Is the woman who tried to commit suicide by jumping into Han River okay?

81
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,340
It turned out that she's a diving coach.

82
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,530
But... are you a witness?

83
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,050
No, I am...

84
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,880
I forgot where I was going to.

85
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,480
You still have to pay the fine

86
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,810
for dumping trash in the Han River.

87
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,930
Thank you!

88
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,330
Give it to me, I'll pay for it.

89
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,420
Why would you?

90
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:05,630
I'm responsible for all this. I forced you to sign up and everything.

91
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,400
I'm stupid for sleeping with that jerk.

92
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,710
Give me.

93
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,220
No, I said that I'll pay.

94
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,120
It's not your fault.

95
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,380
 The entertainment newspaper, This Touch revealed a paparazzi photo of

96
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:22,900
 Congressman Kang Jung Do from the Shin Nara party and the singer, Ms. R.

97
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,360
 Congressman Kang has been buying and reselling artworks

98
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,700
 using Ms. R's name at an art gallery owned by his son.

99
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,510
Father's caused trouble again.

100
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,500
This is annoying.

101
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:41,040
Don't be so stubborn. I'll pay. It makes sense that way.

102
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,100
Okay, I'll pay for your meal then.

103
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,750
Let's go eat something.

104
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,750
He left. I didn't get a chance to thank him.

105
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,040
Are we allowed to leave now?

106
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,280
- Are you still here?
 - We're leaving right now.

107
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,700
Thank you. Bye.

108
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:09,140
 Yeouido is in shock because of this scandal

109
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,920
 involving a potential presidential candidate and a female singer.

110
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,010
 Congressman Kang also has been criticized for his inappropriate behavior...

111
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,680
He's not even breaking a sweat yet and he's already causing problems.

112
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:24,360
That old man still has his old, bad habits.

113
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,770
- Do you know him?
 - I don't know him!

114
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,960
How would he know a well-known congressman like him?

115
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,370
Aigoo! How embarrassing.

116
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,770
A congressman should know better than to cheat and then get caught.

117
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,940
He is really handsome, though.

118
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,250
He's probably popular among women.

119
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,830
Don't you think so?

120
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,450
Excuse me, we'll order more!

121
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,150
We'd like another soybean stew and a bowl of rice.

122
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,910
 Okay!

123
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,650
He clearly thought of me as a joke.

124
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,200
I didn't even know and I gave him my body and my heart.

125
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,500
What's so good about him anyway?

126
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,540
I'm such an idiot.

127
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:20,160
I shouldn't have thought it was possible to find love at my age.

128
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,100
That bastard, seriously...

129
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,120
Don't worry! I'll find him and destroy him.

130
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,800
- I'll slap him as hard as I canâ€”
 - Don't.

131
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,050
What do you want me to do, then?

132
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:40,000
Should I write all about him on Agoura so it'll destroy his life?

133
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,370
I said don't.

134
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,850
I still...

135
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,970
like him!

136
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,180

137
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,430
- Yes, Team Leader?
  - Where are you right now!?

138
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:15,750
 Please calm down!

139
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,300
Is everything okay?

140
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,050
 Where is it?!

141
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,560
 Let's hurry up!

142
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,560
 Yeah, what's going on?

143
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,740
 Until when are you going to do this to us?

144
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,020
I don't know what to do.

145
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,480
What's going on?

146
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,190
 I asked you when she's coming.

147
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,500
- Team Leader!
 - Jung Eum!

148
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,360
Yoo Jung Eum?

149
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:51,640
- Why are you doing this!?
 - Why am I doing this?

150
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,040
Say something!

151
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,830
Hey! Stop it!

152
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,880
Jung Eum!

153
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,550
 â™« Dirty hair â™«

154
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,810
This is the worst day in all my twenty years of

155
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,990
experience as a matchmaker.

156
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,100
Let's die together today.

157
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,480
No.

158
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,820
You'll die on your own.

159
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,900
I'll kill you, Yoo Jung Eum!

160
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,820
Get out of my face for now.

161
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,520
Did you know about Congressman Kang's adultery?

162
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,970
Did you really not know?

163
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,990
Since when was he setting up his slush fund?

164
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,660
 In order to be faithful to the subject,

165
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,590
 I paint my subjects to look nothing like them.

166
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,840
Oh, Elvis.

167
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,010
A strange feeling.

168
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,830
That's interesting.

169
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,080
Do you know what's really interesting?

170
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,750
People recognize the person immediately

171
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,720
even though it's been exaggerated so much.

172
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,460
Some say that it can't get more faithful than that.

173
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,960
Even if you try to exaggerate the relationship as if its love,

174
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,700
people will recognize that it's adultery.

175
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,930
Ah! You must be the second oldest son.

176
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,780
The one who resembles you.

177
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,430
But I don't think this is adultery like you think.

178
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,210
I really respect your father.

179
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,710
Unfortunately,

180
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:19,630
I think that love needs to be tested.

181
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,660
Excuse me.

182
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,150
Hey. Son.

183
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,480
Hey!

184
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,180
This is the only door you can use to avoid the reporters.

185
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:35,300
But you'll have to overcome it with the power of love.

186
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,160
Mr. Congressman!

187
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,040
I'll call you.

188
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,340
Darling!

189
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:49,580
- Do you have ramen?
 - No.

190
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,860
We have rice, though.

191
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,430
Don't you have any kimchi?

192
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,810
You should have a sense of shame.

193
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:13,490
How do you think Eun Rim is doing?

194
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,580
Are you scared, or are you really worried about her?

195
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,990
Both.

196
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:25,020
Then you should stop now. It's about time you stopped.

197
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:29,310
Love is not something you do.

198
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,880
It's something you fall into.

199
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:37,030
That's because you tend to fall in love so easily.

200
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,640
Did you know?

201
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,830
You're supposed to become fearless from lack of judgment when you fall in love.

202
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,630
I don't thinkthat you're completely in love

203
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:48,920
considering that you're still scared of Mom.

204
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:54,120
You must be a coward for not falling in love, then.

205
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,160
If that's not true,

206
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,700
then stop acting like a coward and try to find someone.

207
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,330
Stop obsessing over toys like a kid.

208
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,750
This is a present for you.

209
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,970
Have you been waiting for me here this whole time?

210
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,810
No, I was waiting for the toy.

211
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:48,090
Haven't you read the article about how investment in toys make more profit, even than investments in the stock market?

212
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,290
There are more and more adults who feel nostalgic about their childhoods

213
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,400
and their memories are fading.

214
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,280
The price has no choice but to keep increasing.

215
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:01,690
It's a world where you can make money from nostalgia these days, Father.

216
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:18,990
I'm the owner of Kang Jung Do.

217
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:22,520
Did you think that I didn't know about this?

218
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,970
Adultery isn't a crime anymore.

219
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,160
It doesn't end until I decide to get a divorce.

220
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,120
Don't waste your time on this kind of stuff

221
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,830
and focus on what you promised.

222
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,150
My husband is the one

223
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,670
who'll end up being elected, anyway.

224
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:09,260
Eun Rim, I'll just resign.

225
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,270
Shut up!

226
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:14,540
That's hot liquid, Eun Rim.

227
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,860
Resign? Don't even think about it!

228
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:22,030
You betrayed your wife and got caught with adultery, and now you suddenly develop a conscience?

229
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:25,640
Couldn't you use your great conscience on me!?

230
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,490
Kang Jung Do, listen to me carefully.

231
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:32,910
I didn't support you in becoming a congressman because you're a good husband.

232
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:36,200
It's because I thought that you had the potential to be a good politician.

233
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,950
I don't expect a lot from you.

234
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,170
I'm the head of this family anyway.

235
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,060
I'm going to protect my family

236
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,730
so you justdo what you're good at.

237
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,800
Prove that you're valuable

238
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,460
to your kids, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren.

239
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,850
Choon Nam.

240
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,960
Forget you.

241
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:04,280
Hoon Nam, you'd better be careful.

242
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,840
If you ever embarrass yourself,

243
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,570
I'm going to send you off

244
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:12,860
to a temple on Jiri Mountain with shaved heads.

245
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:17,160
The same goes for Yook Ryong. Watch him carefully, too.

246
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,730
Yes.

247
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,430
Thankfully, I was able to

248
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,300
give the eight of them refunds for their memberships without paying a penalty.

249
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,640
What about that guy, Yook Ryong or Jab Ryong or whoever he is?

250
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,520
There's nothing we can do, since he already canceled his account.

251
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,970
He just took all of our women and then left?

252
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,080
What a bastard.

253
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,800
In that case, don't you think we should at least sue him?

254
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,260
- The victims are against it.
 - Why?

255
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,030
They apparently loved him.

256
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:01,470
That's why they agreed to settle and get their money back and stay quiet.

257
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,880
Are they crazy or something?

258
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,780
- Yoo Jung Eum. 
- Yes?

259
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,870
You have things to settle with me.

260
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,880
This is the list of the "Zero Members."

261
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,890
By Zero Members, you mean

262
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,870
the legendary clients who never got a date with anyone? The absolute Undateables?

263
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,700
I'll give you three months. Take care of all of them.

264
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,770
Three months? Are you kidding?

265
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:34,410
Do you think this is a joke? My seniors think I should fire you.

266
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:38,770
I barely convinced them not to when they told me to blame you for the accident.

267
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:43,210
No! Why are you doing this to me,

268
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,880
when all of this is that Yook Ryoung guy's fault?

269
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,590
Of course, I'm responsible for not being careful enough.

270
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:53,250
But if we let this slide, he's going to create more and more victims.

271
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,640
Don't you think it's right to officially sue him?

272
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,430
Are you trying to close our business? Wasn't it enough to make us lose eight members!?

273
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:02,530
Do you think our other members will be okay with it when rumors of this go around?

274
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:05,500
I don't care if you kill him or keep him alive, deal with it on your personal time!

275
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,320
You've got to give me and the company a break!

276
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:12,110
- Team Leader!
 - You either resign or take care of the Zero Members.

277
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:14,980
I can't do this anymore.

278
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,530
- What?
 - Do you think love can justify everything?

279
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:21,740
Do you think it's acceptable to do all kinds of horrible stuff if it's in the name of love?

280
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,240
I cannot forgive a person who had an affair!

281
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,430
I can't accept this!

282
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:34,650
Who does she think she is to talk about love in front of me?

283
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,220
You came.

284
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,740
What are you still doing out here?

285
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:01,010
I can't go back because of the reporters.

286
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:19,160
But, Hyung, are there people who can really die for love?

287
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,900
- There are. 
 - There are?

288
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,950
Male bees have genitals inside of their bodies

289
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,870
- so if they mate with the queen bee, their stomachs explode. 
- Jeez.

290
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:30,920
But we're not bees. We're humans. So in the human world,

291
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,310
the odds are much higher that you'll

292
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:37,200
get stung by the queen bee while trying to do this and that.

293
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,750
Don't visit the flowers too often.

294
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:48,260
The queen bee is getting ready to sting you with her poison.

295
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:58,480
The reporters probably haven't left yet.

296
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,690
Is love a scam?

297
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,050
I'd rather quit.

298
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:32,060

299
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,290

300
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:44,180
English? Fine, I can take classes.

301
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,820
I'll start by writing a personal statement.

302
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:55,700
Hello, I am Yoo Jung Eum.

303
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:01,240
I used to be a professional diving athlete,

304
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,140
and I have also worked as an exercise and life coach at a cultural center.

305
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:20,360
But due to lack of students, the classes got canceled.

306
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,060
And I've been doing various part-time jobs...

307
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,610
No, this isn't it.

308
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:36,220
You'd better start paying the rent for the room before I re-paper the walls and let the real estate agency take over.

309
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,450
Enough is enough!

310
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,090
Exploitive employers!

311
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:49,180
I'll kill all of you!

312
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,350
Attack, attack!

313
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,100
You are all dead!

314
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,040
Look at what we have here. Good, good.

315
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,020
Die, just die!

316
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,850
Come on, come on!

317
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,840
Attack, attack, attack!

318
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,980
Reverse turning kick!

319
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,710

320
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,870
What is it?

321
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,590
I'll do it.

322
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,490
You'd better.

323
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:42,520
What? She just hung up? Oh, I should just...!

324
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:50,760
That's right. I will meet with her and let them know clearly

325
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,870
what the reality is for them, what their ranking is like,

326
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:58,820
why they are the Zero Members.

327
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:03,950
Hello, do you know where Na Ga Yong is?

328
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:06,160
Here he is.

329
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,780
I'm Na Ga Yong.

330
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:13,960
Hello, I'm Yoo Jung Eum from Geum Sang Chum Hwa. We talked on the phone earlier.

331
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,400
Hello, let's talk on the way.

332
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,480
I suddenly have to go on a business trip, so I need to go to the airport.

333
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,240
Since you're busy, I will try to explain things to you quickly.

334
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,140
The reason why I wanted to see you today isâ€”

335
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,090
Please excuse me.

336
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:43,980
I'm sorry, it was a Chinese client. They wanted to know when I'm arriving.

337
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,350
It's okay.

338
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:48,360
The reason why I visited you today isâ€”

339
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,870
Excuse me.

340
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,920
I'm sorry, it was a Thai client. There was a misunderstanding with the orders.

341
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,480
I'll have to go there myself. My subordinates can't seem to figure things out.

342
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,680
Oh, that's a shame. I will help you.

343
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:28,080
Taxi!

344
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:33,210
I'm sorry, it won't be possible to talk today, I have to leave right now.

345
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:37,760
Then, when do you get back from your trip? When can I see you?

346
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,460
I'll be back tomorrow night and leave again the next morning.

347
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,230
If it's something urgent, do you want to come to the airport with me?

348
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:48,100
Excuse me, could you give me a call later?

349
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,520
Yes, sir, I am leaving now.

350
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,910
Did you wait for a long time?

351
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,660
I made it myself, please give it a try.

352
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,020
Thank you.

353
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,500

354
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:18,050
It is so delicious!

355
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:25,290
You're very beautiful and have great qualifications.

356
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:29,480
I feel like you'd be very popular among men.

357
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,200
Please excuse me, a customerâ€”

358
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,470
No problem, take care of the customer first.

359
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,910
She looks okay.

360
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,900
Here.

361
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,900
Oh, yes.

362
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,850
What happened?

363
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:20,260
The thing is, I have facial blindness.

364
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:27,710
Am I also able to fall in love?

365
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:31,840
Of course you... can...?

366
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,260
Really?

367
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:39,800
If you watch the movie  50 First Dates ...

368
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,160
The woman only has long-term memory,

369
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:48,440
but she found someone who she loves and they got married and lived happily.

370
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:02,630
Thank you for your hard work.

371
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,280
See you next time.

372
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,130
See you later.

373
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,440
My name is Kang Dol Jin.

374
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,050

375
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:19,590
Hello, I'm Yoo Jung Eum from Geum Sang Chum Hwa.

376
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:23,250
But... your blood make-up looks so real.

377
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:25,320
This is real blood.

378
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,120
Are you alright?

379
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,690
Of course, this is my work and my dream.

380
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:36,560
Women dislike these types of things, dont they?

381
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,450
I'm certain that

382
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:41,670
there'll be a woman who can understand your dream.

383
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:45,410
No, I'm sure of it!

384
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,500
