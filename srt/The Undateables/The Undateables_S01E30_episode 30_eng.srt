1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,790
Your style is so much better now that a professional has helped.

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:11,090
You're definitely an actor. Your figure is also very nice.

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,550
You should always dress like this.

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:18,460
Really? To be honest, I don't know why I have to do this.

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,890
Every person has their own uniqueness.

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,380
It's just... do you think there isn't any woman who would accept me as I am?

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,890
Being too unique can be excessive.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,980
Your uniqueness is important, but so is being considerate towards the other person.

9
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,880
Ah. I understand what you're saying.

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,330
I only thought of myself and my own comfort. I'll try to change.

11
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,750
I'll e-mail you your date's profile.

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,970
If you give me an okay, I'll schedule the meeting.

13
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,280
Okay. About that..

14
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:59,160
There's actually someone who I have in mind.

15
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,520
Ah, is that so?

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,470
Then, do you want me to match you with her?

17
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,070
Can you? I thought that it had to be another member.

18
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:16,400
The right thing is for you to meet someone who you like.

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,330
If you can just tell me who it is...

20
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,580
To be honest...

21
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:29,130
I've never seen her face before.

22
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,060
Are you telling me that you like someone you've never met?

23
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,490
Yes. I've never seen her face.

24
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,790
But... I like her.

25
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,900
If you tell us who she is, we'll try to meet with her.

26
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,950

27
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,000
Isn't it rude to ask someone we've never met before to go on a date with a stranger?

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,550
Well, we should at least give it a try.

29
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,930
Hello. Can I please speak to the nutritionist here?

30
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,210
One second.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,160
I'm the nutritionist. How may I help you?

32
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,700
Hello.

33
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,200
Do you know the grocery delivery man, Kang Dol Jin?

34
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,440
The grocery delivery man?

35
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,980
Is he the guy with the nice physique and good fashion sense?

36
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:42,280
The one that looks good in a sleeveless shirt?

37
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,880
Yes, that's him.

38
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,990
If you're not too busy, may we have a word with you?

39
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,750
- I'm sorry. I don't think that I can.
 - Don't feel burdened.

40
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,750
How about having a casual meeting?

41
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,050
No, it's a bit overwhelming.

42
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:09,620
That's true,  but he's very interested in you.

43
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:15,200
It's not that I don't like him. He's always sincere and energetic.

44
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,990
It's just that he hasn't seen me properly yet.

45
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:25,390
He's going to feel burdened once he sees how tall I am.

46
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,010
I'll be on my way.

47
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,220
If that's what is overwhelming you...

48
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,160
How about going on a blind date?

49
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,160
A blind date?

50
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,150
What's the point of having a date in the dark?

51
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:01,370
If a person is insecure about their looks or cares a lot about their looks,

52
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,240
it's not a bad idea to have a meeting where they can't see each other.

53
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,260
What if they end up disliking each other?

54
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,030
Let's just be open. If they connect, good. If not, then, oh well.

55
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,330
It's like burying your head in the sand.

56
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:18,330
We might be deluding them.

57
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,470
Can you see me?

58
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,700
No.

59
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,770
Then, can you feel that I'm looking at you?

60
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,410
Yes.

61
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,300
We're not trying to delude them with the blind date.

62
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,980
She doesn't want to show herself, but she wants to see him.

63
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,710
Although it's not visual, l do feel like they'll be able to see each other.

64
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,270
What do you want to do?

65
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,970
Okay, let's try it.

66
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,540
Don't be too nervous.

67
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,190
Just relax. It's not like you'll be able to see anything.

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,020
Relax. She can't see whether or not you take your jacket off.

69
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,800
You have nothing to lose.

70
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,510
Okay.

71
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,580
You can't see sincerity with your eyes. It's to your advantage that it will be dark.

72
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,540
I didn't know this before...

73
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,910
But when I couldn't see anything, I was able to feel things I wasn't able to before.

74
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,080
- Really?
 - Is that so?

75
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,210
- Okay. You're on your own from here. 
 - Okay. You're on your own from here.

76
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,300
- Fighting! 
 - Fighting!

77
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,990
Did Gil Da Ran go inside?

78
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,010
How about Kang Dol Jin?

79
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,740
He went inside.

80
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,100
Should weâ€”?

81
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,380
Can you come with me somewhere?

82
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,990
Let's go.

83
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,530
Hello. My name is Kang Dol Jin.

84
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:27,240
Hello. My name is Gil Da Ran.

85
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,590
I heard that this is called a "blind meeting"?

86
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,430
I can't see a thing.

87
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,580
I'm an action actor.

88
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,340
I'm just a body double though.

89
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,510
You're so cool.

90
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:51,930
Thank you. There are not a lot of people who think that way. They usually don't like it.

91
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,340
Why don't they like it?

92
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,000
Because it's dangerous and doesn't pay well.

93
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,250
What job isn't dangerous these days?

94
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,820
Being a nutritionist is more dangerous. You're around knives and fire.

95
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,680
Ah! You're right.

96
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,420
To be honest, I wasn't going to come today.

97
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,830
Do I make you feel uncomfortable?

98
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:19,530
No! I thought that I might make you uncomfortable.

99
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:24,820
I'm actually... really tall.

100
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,680
- Does that mean that you hurt people?
 - Pardon?

101
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,740
If that's not the case, then what does it matter?

102
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:37,860
To be honest, I have really long armpit hair.

103
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,400
But I don't hurt anyone.

104
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,080
I know that it doesn't look good, but it's a superstition of mine.

105
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,430
I'm afraid that something bad will happen if I shave it off.

106
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:53,470
Then... shave it on a day when something good happens.

107
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:57,730
Then the day you cut it off will be the day that something good happened.

108
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,780
Just now... did you smile?

109
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:09,610
How did you know? It's dark.

110
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:16,160
I could feel your smile.

111
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,120
I guess this is what she meant when she said I can feel more when I can't see anything.

112
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,480
Are you going to get rid of all this?

113
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,690
There are all rare items.

114
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,080
You'll be the hot topic of the auction.

115
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,410
They are all precious to me. Please, find them each a good home.

116
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,840
Yes, of course.

117
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,210
We're going to have to authenticate everything, but it looks like they're all going on the special list.

118
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:54,970
We'll do our best for the auction exhibit.

119
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,000
Please take good care of everything.

120
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,650
Will you be deducting commission from the final bid price?

121
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:03,210
- No, please donate all of the proceeds.

122
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,140
It will be quite a bit of money.

123
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,790
I heard the partner of this auction, NGO,

124
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,090
is doing a toy donation campaign.

125
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:14,130
Yes, you're right. It's for children overseas who don't have any toys.

126
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,210
We will send toys to those children.

127
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:20,340
I could have donated to that campaign myself,

128
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,310
but I thought that it would be best to donate the proceeds from this auction.

129
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:27,070
That way, more children will be able to have toys.

130
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:30,320
You're very smart about your charity work.

131
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,290
Umm...

132
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:04,470
If it's okay with you, I'd like to see you again!

133
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,240
A-am I moving t-t-too f-fast?

134
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,730
W-w-were you caught off guard?

135
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:20,290
I really like you.

136
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,570
So...

137
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:38,340
Can we meet again?

138
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,750
Next week, same time.

139
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:47,820
Should we... meet here again?

140
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,520
Are you okay?

141
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,950
Yeah.

142
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:06,330
I'm going to believe that I'm a butterfly, just like you said.

143
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:11,170
Plus, I have Cracorn by my side now. It's fun being with you.

144
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,950
I do feel bad for my toys because of this though.

145
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,920
Let's go together.

146
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,940
Like this? With me?

147
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,220
Let's go for another take.

148
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,160
I'm sorry.

149
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,320
Do it right.

150
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,490
Thank you.

151
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,360
- Get me another one.
 - Okay.

152
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,900
Thanks.

153
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,560
Good work. You can leave now.

154
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,500
Thank you.

155
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,100
 I'm sorry. It's time to close.

156
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,360
I'm sorry, but can you give this to her for me?

157
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,160
I quit my delivery job.

158
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,800
I want to focus on my acting.

159
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,520
I wanted to give it to her myself.

160
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,210
She didn't show up though. I guess she was burdened by me.

161
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:12,720
I'll introduce you to someone else.

162
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,600
Okay. My soulmate must be out there somewhere.

163
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,050
I have an audition, so I have to get going.

164
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,560
You must be nervous.

165
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:27,230
Thankfully, Charlie styled my outfit for the audition.

166
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:30,870
Why don't you just go to the audition as yourself?

167
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,590
Huh?

168
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:34,820
I used to think that being too unique was excessive,

169
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:41,210
but when it comes to you, Kang Dol Jin, I believe that  I was wrong.

170
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,550
I was wondering why I felt so awkward.

171
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:50,310
It's because your normal self is the true you.

172
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,760
- Really?
 - Yes.

173
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,730
Go impress everyone with your uniqueness.

174
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:00,400
Should I?

175
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,420
Kang Dol Jin asked us to give this to you.

176
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,540
This is the first time I've received a gift like this.

177
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:35,030
I'm sorry. Kang Dol Jin doesn't know much about women.

178
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:40,950
No one has ever given me a pair of high heels.

179
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:47,960
My tall height has always been a source of shame for me.

180
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:52,360
I've always wanted to try wearing high heels.

181
00:15:52,360 --> 00:16:00,750
I've always wanted to take a walk with someone I like wearing pretty high heels.

182
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:06,900
Why don't you have another meeting with Kang Dol Jin?

183
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,450
I don't have the confidence to.

184
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:13,220
If you don't have the confidence, then why don't you leave it up to fate?

185
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:22,650
If the both of you come to my gallery on the same day and stand in front of the same painting, why don't we just say that it's fate?

186
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,760
Do you think she'll come?

187
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,520
Yes, she will come.

188
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,860
How are you so certain?

189
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,610
Sincerity was conveyed.

190
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,110
What are you going to exhibit?

191
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,830
I'm not sure yet.

192
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:02,220
I hope that the both of them stand in front of the same painting.

193
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,410
They will, if they're destined to be together.

194
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,410
An Do.

195
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,030
Coach.

196
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,070
Why here at this hour?

197
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,530
Just because.

198
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,980
Are you hungry? Do you want something to eat?

199
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,290
I already ate.

200
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,110
Did you? Then, what is it?

201
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,050
Is something wrong?

202
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,190
Coach.

203
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,600
Did you get yourself into trouble?

204
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,920
Oh, seriously...

205
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,380
Then, what is it?

206
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:06,730
You know how our team was omitted from the league list?

207
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:09,500
Yook Ryong is the one who helped.

208
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:16,090
He used the blank contract that he'd gotten from the bet to help you.

209
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,690
I've relayed the truth to you, so I'll be on my way now.

210
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,290
Thank you, for letting me know.

211
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:38,930
You know, they say that sincerity is always conveyed.

212
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:43,290
You would have found out, even if I hadn't told you.

213
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,920
I'm leaving now.

214
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:53,330
Wait a sec! I met that jerk, Ko Eup, again.

215
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:56,930
I think he's been working for the league since he's come back from studying abroad.

216
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:01,530
I ran into him again at the league.

217
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:08,160
But... that text that you received. Ko Eup didn't send it.

218
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,130
Do you remember? Five years ago.

219
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:15,840
You said that Ko Eup sent you an apology text. You kept chanting "obliviate."

220
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,860
You kept saying "go away, bad memories."

221
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,840
Yeah.

222
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,720
Then... who sent it?

223
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,820
So it turns out...

224
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:29,040
 Don't even talk about it.

225
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,570
I stepped in poop the day I'm leaving.

226
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,210
Why did she have to follow me to the airport?

227
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,360
That's why I'm completely fed up with her.

228
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,120
Babe, you would never be like that.

229
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,310
I'll call you as soon as I land.

230
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,510
Yoo Jung Eum, you disgust me until the very end.

231
00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:00,330
 Let go of me! Please, let go of me!

232
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,700
 I got another girlfriend.

233
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,350
 I'm sorry!

234
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:07,980
 Jung Eum, I'm at the Han Seung Emergency Room. Come quickly, your mom

235
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,150
 just lost consciousness.

236
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,950

237
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,780
Excuse me.

238
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,330
Me?

239
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,310
I normally don't butt into other people's relationships, but...

240
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,370
But?

241
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,580
There's common courtesy when it comes to breakups.

242
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,550
From the sound of it, it's not like you guys weren't serious.

243
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:33,530
What does it matter to you if I'm courteous or not?

244
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,610
It's over now.

245
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:42,030
Spend just one more minute of your time on that breakup.

246
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:46,680
Then the both of you can avoid seeing the worst in each other.

247
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,650
What is her contact saved as?

248
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,750
I erased it.

249
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,110
Her phone number?

250
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,220
I don't remember.

251
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,240
I have a text from her.

252
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,650
Here.

253
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:28,210
 I'm sorry. I'll change.

254
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,020
 Wait for me. I'm on my way.

255
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,700
She's a nice girl.

256
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,080
Huh?

257
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,280
â™«  I can go back if it means I can find you  â™«

258
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:44,550
 Even though I did my best, I made you be your worst.

259
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,540
 I'm sorry.

260
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:51,350
â™«  To make you incomparably happy  â™«

261
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,160
â™«  I have to protect you like that  â™«

262
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,980
 I'm sorry. I hope that the bad memories will disappear and that only good memories will remain.

263
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,240
 Obliviate.

264
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,670
How could something like this happen?

265
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:10,340
Right? I was so baffled.

266
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,070
I'll be back.

267
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:27,400
Where are you rushing to on a Sunday morning?

268
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,000
- Dad. 
- What?

269
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,630
Sincerity will be conveyed, right?

270
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:35,400
Huh?

271
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,280
Nothing. I'll be back!

272
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,750
What nonsense is she babbling about?

273
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:55,730
It's almost time. Should we go, too?

274
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,910
Do you think they will stand in front of the same painting?

275
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:02,420
Who knows? Let's leave it to fate.

276
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,430
Let's go.

277
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,420
 If the both of you come to my gallery on the same day

278
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:49,190
 and stand in front of the same painting,  why don't we just say that it's destiny?

279
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:44,290
High heels look good on you.

280
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:48,340
Thank you.

281
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,950
Are you okay?

282
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:07,830
Yes, I'm okay.

283
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:28,730
What's this? I thought they would leave it to fate.

284
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:32,090
Hard work can change fate, too.

285
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:35,150
What a twist of fate.

286
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,850
They look good together, right?

287
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:39,610
Yes, they look good.

288
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:43,890
Receiving each other just as they are...

289
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:53,780
And... you, too.

290
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:10,010
That text from five years ago.

291
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,280
I heard that it was you.

292
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,800
What is it?

293
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,250
There's something...

294
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,610
Hurry, Coach!

295
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,130
Let's go!

296
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,340
You'll see.

297
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:45,590
â™«  After your everything covers me up  â™«

298
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:51,570
â™«  I can't move, not even a step  â™«

299
00:26:52,610 --> 00:27:00,040
â™«  Like that star in the night sky  â™«

300
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:05,740
â™«  I'm in you  â™«

301
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:14,160
â™«  My greed keeps growing  â™«

302
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:20,820
â™«  How much you must have hurt  â™«

303
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:28,850
â™«  It's engraved into my heart  â™«
 â™«  Your hurt name becomes tears  â™«

304
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:36,310
â™«  It forms on your lips and finds you  â™«

305
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:42,490
 From now on, I'll cast a spell on you.

306
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:50,000
 Your bad memories will disappear and only the good ones will remain.

307
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,690
â™«  I call you, I call you  â™«

308
00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:00,630
 Obliviate.  
 â™«  I call you like this  â™«

309
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:08,810

â™«  I'm even scared to sleep and dream  â™«

310
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:11,480
 Although they can't be heard...

311
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,730
â™«  In case we drift apart  â™«

312
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:19,830
 feelings are hidden somewhere within the heart.

313
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:24,020
â™«  It doesn't work even if I push you out of my heart  â™«

314
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:33,390
 Dating is... a silent consonant.

315
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:49,000
â™«  I call you, I call you  â™«
 â™«  I call you like this  â™«

316
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,520
â™«  I call you like this  â™«

317
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,710

Preview
â™«  Like sunlight shining through when opening your eyes  â™«

318
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,820
 Will you marry me?

319
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,370
 Our wedding preparation...

320
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:58,550
 Can the two of you do it?

321
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,760
 Kind of like being a wedding planner?

322
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,880
 Pardon? This wedding... is canceled?

323
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,540
 I asked how it feels to be married.

324
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,990
 Women are hard to understand.

325
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,580
 You think you know men, then you don't.

326
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,440
 Sweep, clean, and fight. That's marriage.

327
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,550
 I didn't say who I was going to marry.

328
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:18,430
 Why is that important? You'll be marrying me anyway.

329
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:23,200
