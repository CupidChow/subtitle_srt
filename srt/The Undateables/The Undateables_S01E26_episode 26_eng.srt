1
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,530
I'm sorry. I had a phone call from a Chinese client.

2
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,120
This...

3
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,670
What is all this?

4
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,890
It's your daily workload, Na Ga Young.

5
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,230
All this?

6
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,930
Na Ga Young, from all this,

7
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:37,420
can you check off all the things that you absolutely have to do today?

8
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,090

9
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,010
No, no, no. Only the ones that must be done today.

10
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:01,500
You should check off the things you would get fired over if you didn't do today.

11
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:31,110
So, Na Ga Young, why do you do all this work

12
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,820
that doesn't have to be done today?

13
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,580
"Do not push today's work to tomorrow."

14
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,290
There's a saying like that.

15
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:43,290
From what I see, you're doing today's, tomorrow's

16
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,340
and even next week's work early.

17
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,790
If I don't do them ahead of time, it makes me anxious.

18
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,580
Anxious.

19
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,490
If I don't do my work properly,

20
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:01,040
I won't be respected. If I'm not respected, it makes me anxious.

21
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,020
Ah, wait... but...

22
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,440
Na Ga Young, did you bring the receipts?

23
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,390
I was told to bring the last receipt from the last blind date.

24
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,930
So, here, it's in order.

25
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,460
These are all receipts from one date?

26
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,530
Yes, that's right.

27
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,090
Why are there so many?

28
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,860
According to survey results,

29
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,050
these are places that men and women ordinarily go to while on a blind date.

30
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,520
Number one, coffee shop.

31
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,200
Then, restaurant, bar,

32
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,330
movie theater, concert hall, and then,

33
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:07,020
an art gallery or exhibition where you can enjoy culture or the arts.

34
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,460
So, you went to all of these in one day?

35
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,290
Yes.

36
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,810
She'll remember me if I show her a lot of places.

37
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,280
This... isn't a date.

38
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,970
It's work.

39
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,420
Is it... really?

40
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,560
There's something that I'm curious about.

41
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,030
If you're so busy with work, why are you trying to date?

42
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:35,670
I want to meet a good woman and date and get married.

43
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,200
That's how I work.

44
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,860
Na Ga Young, do you know how to write "busy" in Chinese?

45
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,000
"Busy"?

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,430
Yes.

47
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,790
You write it like this.

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,230
The character for "heart"

49
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,600
combined with character for "lose."

50
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,900
Therefore, the character for "busy"

51
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,980
means "lose heart."

52
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:10,360
Like you said, Na Ga Young, if you want to meet a girl and date then get married,

53
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,080
you'll have to work less.

54
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,200
Look here.

55
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,270
Do you think you can do just the checked off ones?

56
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,240
It'll be hard to do right away, but

57
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,750
I will try to decrease my workload.

58
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:47,870

59
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,830
I said, let's eat out.

60
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,900
And I said that I'm doing this because I'm so thankful.

61
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,040
I have to bring some seasonings next time.

62
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,260
What did you eat before you met me?

63
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,300
I didn't make anything. I just ate out.

64
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,860
A person needs home cooked food to gain strength.

65
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,350
Wait for a little bit. I'll make you food.

66
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,730
There's nothing for me to help with?

67
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:12,050
Just rest. You said you've been busy lately.

68
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:39,690
So, when will I be introduced to your family?

69
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,470
There's some stuff going on with my family lately.

70
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,780
Really?

71
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,190
Once that's all settled, I'll arrange it.

72
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,060
Have you brought Na Ga Young's match list?

73
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,450
Yes. There are two people.

74
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:01,520
These profiles were matched by their data.

75
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,080
Let me see.

76
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,230
But, these two are so different from one another.

77
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:13,000
Aren't they? Oddly, two completely different profiles were chosen.

78
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,970
One of them has a lifestyle similar to Na Ga Young.

79
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,020
She makes work a priority.

80
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:24,000
The other woman has a completely different lifestyle, and makes leisure a priority.

81
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,610
Which one do you think will be a better match?

82
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,080
I vote for the similar one.

83
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,670
I... vote for the opposite.

84
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:35,280
No, people need to date similar people.

85
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,970
No, actually, opposites attract.

86
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,460
Then, we'll have Na Ga Young meet both.

87
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,800
And we'll see who he matches better with.

88
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,530
Okay then.

89
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:51,370
Then, whoever loses has to grant a wish to the winner.

90
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,770
- I like it. 
 - Oh!

91
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,920
Have you heard? About the radishes.

92
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,450
Apparently, they originally said that they couldn't donate them because they were expired,

93
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,200
but they were convinced it was fine and gave them out.

94
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,800
That's right. We brought them, too.

95
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:15,100
The vice president originally said no, that the president would get fired.

96
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,440
We said it was wasteful and begged for them,

97
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,460
said that we would take responsibility.

98
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:25,370
That's right. Those people have always helped us a lot.

99
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,070
They've been coming to the senior citizen center for years and have done a lot of volunteer work.

100
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,000
What a shame.

101
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,040
Chief Yoo, you should help them.

102
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,300
That's right. If you're the one asking, the senior citizens will all help, too.

103
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,210
You could gather evidence from the seniors at the citizen center.

104
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,300
Why should I?

105
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,790
 Because Chief Yoo, you're a good person!

106
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,030
Just go back to sewing.

107
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:55,480
Hello, do you remember me from last time?

108
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,950
I came after hearing about your class.

109
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,000
I didn't think that you'd actually come to my class.

110
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,030
I told you that I'm really interested in sewing.

111
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,900
There's been a lot on my mind lately,

112
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,000
but now that I'm sewing, it's clearing my mind. It's great.

113
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,900
All right. Let's end it here for today.

114
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,730
Let's go. I'll take you home.

115
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,770
What is this?

116
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,300
Aren't you sending your girlfriend home too early?

117
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,650
I need to look good to your dad if I want his official permission.

118
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,970
I told you, if he's like that, it's the same as getting permission.

119
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:55,400
No, I should be even better at times like this.

120
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,330
Also, here.

121
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,510
It's an invitation.

122
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,570
It's okay for me, so bring your father anytime.

123
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,230
Thank you.

124
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:20,890
Ah. Do you think that Na Ga Young will flake on the blind date because he's too busy?

125
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,400
He won't.

126
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,910
He's divided up his work a lot. Respect.

127
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,240
Who are you?

128
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,940
I'm Yook Ryong. I came in place of Na Ga Young.

129
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,770
Good! Thank you!

130
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,790
It's so cute, isn't it?

131
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,390
- That's right! 
 - That's right!

132
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,160
I'll order this.

133
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,960
Thank you.

134
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,030
Thank you.

135
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,920
Kang Hoon Nam, I hope you fall and keep on falling.

136
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,050
I told you that I will send them to you by today.

137
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,590
No, I said that I'll send them by today.

138
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:37,140
Okay, I'll send them.

139
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,900
I'm sorry. It was from a client.

140
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,530
It's all right. Please, sit.

141
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,270
Thank you.

142
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,820
Just a moment. Can I answer?

143
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:04,030
Yes, answer. Then while I wait, I'll work on my laptop.

144
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,100
This is perfect. I actually had some documents that I need to go over.

145
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,380
Sure, go ahead. I think I'll be a while, too.

146
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,180
Are you hungry?

147
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:51,400
Hungry?Ah... I think so.

148
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:57,050
Should we just order some sandwiches here to eat while we work?

149
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,510
Here!

150
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,230
How was your date today?

151
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,660
It was a busy blind date. I was able to finish three papers that I hadn't finished before.

152
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,410
What did you two talk about?

153
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,990
Oh. Um...

154
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,690
Hungry... Sandwich...

155
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:27,480
From what I see, it looks like you didn't talk at all.

156
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,740
Uh... um...

157
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:36,470
Instead of a date, you basically just worked.

158
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,530
That's true.

159
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,860
What to do? Do you want to meet your other match?

160
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,580
- Go out, again? 
 - Go out.

161
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,560
Hello. I'm Han Ga Ye.

162
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:04,620
Hello, I'm Na Ga Young.

163
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,160
Please, sit.

164
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:13,850
Something to drink?

165
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,600
Coffee—

166
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,240
I'm sorry. Just a moment.

167
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,440
Yes, Director?

168
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:32,650
The order from Thailand is complete. I'll wrap it up by today.

169
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,020
Yes, you can trust and depend on me.

170
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,520
All right.

171
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,220
Coff—

172
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,920
Yes, Director?

173
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,150
Hey! That's my work!

174
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:16,390
I came to talk to you, Na Ga Young, not watch you work.

175
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:21,260
So, shall we have a conversation now?

176
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,250
Sure.

177
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,150
What part of the day makes you the happiest?

178
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,850
Happiest?

179
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,190
When I've completed all my tasks for the day.

180
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:36,050
That's nice. What do you do after work?

181
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:41,610
I just sleep. I'm usually tired and there's a lot of work to do the next day.

182
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:47,010
So, you rest to work, not work to rest?

183
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:52,730
- What? 
 - Na Ga Young, I appreciate the small joys in everyday life.

184
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:56,150
I came out to search for someone who can share those joys with me.

185
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:59,130
The small joys in everyday life?

186
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:03,240
But ,if I were to date you, Na Ga Young,

187
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:09,070
I think I'd just be watching you work every day.

188
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:14,040
What a shame. From your first impression, you seem to be exactly my type.

189
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,760
I think that you and I are totally wrong for each other.

190
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,250
Let me excuse myself.

191
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,120
Let's go together!

192
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,670
Han Ga Ye!

193
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,690
I'm coming, too!

194
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,930
See? Now look.

195
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,110
You don't have to push yourselves in your designated categories.

196
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,030
If you try to do a complicated technique and make a mistake, you get zero points.

197
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,550
Be diligent. Where did I say?

198
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,850
 Your lower back and butt!

199
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,970
That's right. Your lower back and butt.

200
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,580
 Yes!

201
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,320
What was that sound?

202
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,330
I'll go out and see.

203
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,670
Okay.

204
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,850
Huh?

205
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,570
Coach!

206
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:21,030
- What's all this? 
 - What? What is it?

207
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:27,320
Wow! It'll all be so tasty!

208
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,900
Wow!

209
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:39,010
Wow! There's this, too.

210
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:42,930
A**hole. Why is he doing this now?

211
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,890
Where to?

212
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,220
To Hoon Nam's gallery.

213
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,140
All right.

214
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:16,470
 I think that Hoon Nam has a girlfriend. I think he's meeting with a woman.

215
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:22,000
Hey, how long has it been since we went on a date?

216
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,550
It's nice coming out.

217
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:32,060
Dad, let's go out on dates here and there, even if we can't do it that often.

218
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,560
I'm okay. Just meet a good man.

219
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,150
Mr. Jook is a good man, right?

220
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,380
Don't worry.

221
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:43,020
Don't worry? Is it much further?

222
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,970
We're almost there.

223
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,880
Is there an important guest coming today?

224
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,020
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

225
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,680
Whoa. Look at this.

226
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,540
These aren't toys. This is artwork!

227
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,280
Dad.

228
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,200
Wow, look at these.

229
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,020
You're here.

230
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:23,580
You look even more handsome here.

231
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,980
Ah, yes, thank you.

232
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,660
Since you came all the way here, I'll give you a tour.

233
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,580
Sure. I'm getting this kind of treatment thanks to my daughter.

234
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,720
Hold on one second.

235
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,180
Sure.

236
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,730
What's the matter?

237
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,020
Go back.

238
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,550
How can you act like this to your dad—?

239
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,250
Go back!

240
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,390
Don't interfere with my life anymore.

241
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,530
Please leave.

242
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,280
Is there something wrong?

243
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,910
No.

244
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,830
Father, let me guide you. Let's go.

245
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,800
Jung Eum, stay here a moment.

246
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,330
- Huh?
 - I have something to talk about with Mr. Jook.

247
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,660
Sure, go ahead.

248
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,300
Let's go.

249
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,260
All right. Let's go.

250
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,060
Noona.

251
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:18,910
So... So...

252
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,800
The person that was just here

253
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,060
was that Assemblyman Kang Jung Do?

254
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:50,100
Yes. That's right.

255
00:20:51,890 --> 00:21:02,320
Are you, by any chance... Kang Jung Do's son?

256
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,260
Yes.

257
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:35,140
I won't say much. I don't want you seeing my Jung Eum.

258
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:42,410
Father, I'm not like my dad.

259
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:47,000
I'll give you time. End things with Jung Eum.

260
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:54,960
Should I take her with me or will you talk to her

261
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,470
and send her home right away?

262
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:09,010
I'll end things and send her home.

263
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:11,090
Do that, then.

264
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:33,790
How's Sun Hee Noona nowadays?

265
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:42,580
I know that you're not a bad person, Yook Ryong,

266
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:47,800
but I don't think I can watch Coach Yang get hurt another time.

267
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:53,960
Unless you're really going to take responsibility, I don't want you to cause her doubt.

268
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,410
Jung Eum.

269
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,030
I'll go first. Come home after you're done.

270
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,110
Already?

271
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:13,260
Yes, some work came up at the center.

272
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,070
Where's Hoon Nam?

273
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:18,540
I've already said good-bye, so you should, too.

274
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,980
Okay. Go ahead.

275
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,150
You have to hurry home, okay?

276
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,690
Okay.

277
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:46,190
 Are you, by any chance... Kang Jung Do's son?

278
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:52,300
 I won't say much. I don't want you seeing my Jung Eum.

279
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:04,380
Something happened with my dad, didn't it?

280
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,440
Tell me.

281
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:34,070
I really don't know what to do.

282
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,540
 I won't be going on any more blind dates.

283
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,860
I won, right?

284
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,410
Looks like it.

285
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:15,660
Opposites attract.

286
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:21,120
You remember that you have to grant me a wish, right?

287
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,240
Yes.

288
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,920
Let's confront things head first.

289
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,670
We're the ones in love. So, why should we care what others think?

290
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:40,770
As long as we're sure, I don't care.

291
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,260
Is that you, Jung Eum?

292
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:21,660
Let's talk.

293
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,190
How dare you come here.

294
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,350
Get out.

295
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:29,390
Get out of my house, you bastard!

296
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:42,050
All right. It's fine,

297
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:46,670
even you treat me like trash or a dog.

298
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:50,190
But Hoon Nam's different than me.

299
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:54,690
Like father like son. Do you think that blood would go anywhere?

300
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,770
Seung Ryeol—

301
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:58,640
What? What!?

302
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:07,060
Hoon Nam is not only my son. He's also Hee Kyung's son.

303
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,650
 How old is Aunt Hee Kyung's son?

304
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:18,160
 He's an oppa since he's three years older than you, Jung Eum.

305
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,260
 Hee Kyung! What happened?

306
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:26,880
 Hoon Nam... Please, take care of my Hoon Nam.

307
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,270
 Hoon Nam.

308
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:41,310
Then, that kid from back then...

309
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:48,850
I can't do anything about you hating me, but don't hate Hoon Nam.

310
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:52,460
Hee Kyung would want that, too.

311
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,800
How can you mention her name right now!?

312
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,260
Hey, hey, hey!

313
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:00,030
Hoon Nam is completely different from me.

314
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,280
He's a straight and sincere guy.

315
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,960
Nothing's different!

316
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,170
- He looks like a slacker. His looks will cost him someday. 
 - Hey!

317
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:10,950
Hoon Nam's good looks aren't his fault. They're mine.

318
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,770
It's all my fault!

319
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:16,110
Oh, really? Just because you have a hole for a mouth, you're saying whatever you want.

320
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:19,780
Do you know how innocent Jung Eum is? He seduced such an innocent girl.

321
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,660
She came onto him first!

322
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:25,660
- What?
 - My Hoon Nam never used to date!

323
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,700
How the hell did she seduce him into actually dating now?

324
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,230
Why, you little!

325
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:34,250
Oh, my back!

326
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,940
Are you okay?

327
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,020
Okay? Would I be okay?

328
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,360
Why, you little!

329
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,040
Let go!

330
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,090
You're not letting go?

331
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,370
You punk!

332
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:10,960
You rascal!

333
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,020
You punk! Let me go!

334
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,770
Let go!

335
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,410
Dad!

336
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,080
Father!

337
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,740
Calm down.

338
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,030
Calm down, Dad!

339
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,520
Calm down.

340
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,660
Wait, wait.

341
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,330
Are you that jerk's daughter?

342
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,490
Hello.

343
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,060
Jung Eum, don't you dare greet him!

344
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,870
Father, I'll apologize for him. I'm so sorry.

345
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,160
I don't need anything. I got hit.

346
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,160
That jerk!

347
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,390
Throw it! Throw it, you bastard!

348
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:43,030
How can you hold this up?

349
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,170
That a**hole!

350
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:46,910
Come!

351
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:51,600

352
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,590
Come here! Come here!

353
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:56,350
 Even though things can go well, if left alone, they will lose strength and fall down.

354
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,090
Dad!

355
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,320
 It may seem like it'll fall over, but

356
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,570
 if you touch it, it springs back to life.

357
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:07,300
 A relationship is like a spinning top.

358
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:12,860
♫  Oh slowly slowly  ♫ 
 ♫  Can I carefully  ♫

359
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:17,030
♫  knock on your heart?  ♫

360
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:22,760
♫  Oh slowly slowly  ♫
 ♫  Can I convey  ♫

361
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,630
♫  my feelings so you won't be surprised?  ♫

362
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,440

363
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,300
 Dad, don't you think he would be a good son-in-law?

364
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,490
 Is everything okay if you like him? What do you even like about him?

365
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,170
 Knock and it will open.

366
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:35,430
 From today onward, I'm going to be your secretary.

367
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:39,620
 Thief. You stole my heart and now you've even taken my father's heart.

368
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,220
 I want all of your memories of me to be happy.

369
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,850
 If I'm going to be happy, you need to be happy first.

370
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:46,960
 What is all this?

371
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,860
 You're here?

372
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:54,170
 We had a drink.

373
00:30:54,170 --> 00:31:00,200
