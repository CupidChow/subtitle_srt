1
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:38,000
 A long long time ago, there was a woodcutter who fell in love.

2
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,400
 The woodcutter was cursed by a witch before he could propose

3
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,000
 and lost his limbs to an axe.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,800
 Luckily, he met a tinker who made him a body of tin,

5
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,800
 but he paid the price by losing his heart.

6
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,400
 The woodcutter, who lost his heart, no longer wanted to see his lover,

7
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,200
 whom he had loved so much.

8
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,200
 One day, after leaving her without even saying good-bye,

9
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,400
 he was hit by a rain shower in the forest

10
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,000
 that made his body slowly rust and harden.

11
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,800
Thank you.

12
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,800

13
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,000
  .

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,400
  Ladies and gentlemen.

15
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,000
  We are now making our final descent to Seoul-Incheon International Airport.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,200
  Please recheck that your seat belt is securely fastened.

17
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,400
 When you meet someone, just as the first impression is important

18
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,000
 the last impression you leave is important as well.

19
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,400
 Because depending on the kind of break up,

20
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,100
 the time spent together can become fond memories

21
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,340
 or turn into wounds.

22
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,880
Hey, don't misbehave while I'm not around, and take care of the juniors, alright?

23
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,000
Jung Eum?

24
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,600
Don't even go there. What kind of girl is so unaware of what's happening?

25
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,000
Do I really have to say with my own mouth that we should break up?

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,200
What do you think? I ended up just letting her know through text.

27
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,400
Cruel? Hey, two months is just right.

28
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,700
Well, right now... she's probably on top of a diving board.

29
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,400
Sunbae, where are you going?

30
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,200
Aren't you in the middle of a competition? Shouldn't you be at the stadium—?

31
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,800
You didn't... give it up, did you?

32
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,600
I can give up the competition, but I can't give you up.

33
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,800
You stupid—! You idiot!

34
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,200
- Sunbae.
 - Are you a child? Huh?

35
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,800
Why give that up because of me? Why, why?

36
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,000
I mean, loyalty, love, promises, what's so important about those kinds of things?

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I always knew you were stubborn but

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,900
you—I had no idea you were this extreme!

39
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,600
You're finally making me out to be the jerk who ruined your life.

40
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,100
We...

41
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,210
were good together.

42
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,600
I'm not sure if you're naive or dumb.

43
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,960
I'm leaving.

44
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,400

45
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,000
Let go. Let me go.

46
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,600
I'll change.

47
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,400
It was all my fault, so please don't act like this!

48
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,800
Let me go.

49
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,700
Just... just, please let go!

50
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,600
I got a new girlfriend. Sorry.

51
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,500
Please, let me go!

52
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,900
I said, let me go!

53
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,700
Sunbae!

54
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,400
 If you wish to be remembered as a fond memory instead of a wound,

55
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,000
 you must prepare parting words, just like first greetings.

56
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,000

57
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,800

58
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,100

59
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,300

60
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,300

61
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,500
Excuse me.

62
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,800
Take this.

63
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,800
Oh my goodness, it's raining.

64
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,300
I'm cold.

65
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,400
Thank you.

66
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,000
Oh, hey! Thanks for the umbrella!

67
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,690
What is your name?

68
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:41,300
Your customer feedback card! I really must get that!

69
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,800
By the way, your umbrella is so pretty.

70
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,400
It's not easy for a man to care about an umbrella,

71
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,200
but you've got great fashion sense.

72
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,600
Thank you.

73
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,300
Your uniform suits you as well, the trench coat...

74
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,400
But, why would you give away such an expensive umbrella?

75
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,900
The taxi is here.

76
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,600
She was so nice.

77
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,200
How can I give it back to her? Should I drop it off at the airport?

78
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Touch me not.

79
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,900

80
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:57,700
Yoo Jung Euuuuuuum!

81
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,800
What's wrong with you lately, huh? Was I wrong about you?

82
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,000
Every couple you put together used to have 100% success. My "hope for love" Yoo Jung Eum,

83
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,600
just where did she go, huh?

84
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,200
About that... slump—

85
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,000
Slump?

86
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,200
I see.

87
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Alright then, you can quit.

88
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,800
What? Quit? No way, if I quit here, I won't be able to do anything.

89
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,000
You know that all I ever did was sports.

90
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,800
- If you know that, can you say that you're in a slump whenever something bad happens!?
 - I'm sorry.

91
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,200
Your dad registered you here to get you married off since you weren't doing anything for years after your athletic career!

92
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,800
But you were sending out your friends on every date. You were such a nuisance to me back then.

93
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,800
In order to save face, I brought you in here to at least give you a job if I couldn't get you married off,

94
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,300
but are you going to not get yourself together and continue to screw up like this?

95
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,200
If you age another year, you'll be at an F-rating, not even a D!

96
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,100
You suck!

97
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,000
And so...

98
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,800
Oh Doo Ri, forty years old, a collector.

99
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,400
She owns an eight-acre apple and mango farm on Jeju island.

100
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,000
Her father's assets— A daughter of a truly wealthy family, I see.

101
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,200
We were also classmates in high school.

102
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,000
Really?

103
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I heard that her rich father will invest in a dating company if his daughter gets married within the year.

104
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,600
One billion won.

105
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,400
Wow!

106
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,200
Our industry is going bonkers trying to get Oh Doo Ri.

107
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,800
That totally makes sense!

108
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,300
- Let's get her.
 - What?

109
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,070
Get her! Use whatever means necessary.

110
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:40,600
This is a God-given opportunity to recover the second half of our annual performance, so we must get her no matter what.

111
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,420
We can do it—no, no,  you  can do it. You're the only one who can do it.

112
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:51,800
You must do it no matter what. It's to the tune of one billioooon!

113
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,400

114
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,320
Thank you!

115
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,490
 Yoo Jung Eum! Stay focused!

116
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:44,140
 Is the athlete, Yoo Jung Eum, going to just give up?

117
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,930
 I'm sorry.

118
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:09,900

119
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,840
Hello!

120
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:53,660
You're half a size bigger than me, right? I'm a 44.5, and you're a 55.

121
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:59,200
Here, say hello to the ocean first. We'll talk afterward.

122
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,380
Excuse me, Ms. Customer!

123
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,900
Here!

124
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,370
Put on the life jacket over there.

125
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,650
Oh, yes.

126
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,790
Get on!

127
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,190
Are you not getting on?

128
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,970
Oh, yes...

129
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,980
Here, hold my hand.

130
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,210
Now, slowly!

131
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,170
You can do it. Take it easy, and come on over.

132
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:27,180
You can come over to me.

133
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,400
This horrible guy!

134
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,400
It's okay! It's okay, it's okay! I'm here. Hold on tight.

135
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,650
Let's try one more time. It's okay, it's okay, right!

136
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:46,630
Come here. Yes, one, two... right!

137
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,460
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

138
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,050
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

139
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,770
Ms. Customer? Ms. Customer?

140
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,800
- I heard that you used to be a diver. You certainly know how to take charge. 
 - What?

141
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,150
Gong has a good eye for people. I like you.

142
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,890
Let's go!

143
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,780
Sit down.

144
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:02,410
It looks nice if you cut it up before serving, but it's tastier if you cut it right before you eat it.

145
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,540
Here.

146
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,520
Thank you.

147
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,310
This is really delicious, the juice!

148
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,010
Is this your collection, by the way?

149
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:24,670
They're called "Bari Bari Girls." It's my hobby to customize them.

150
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:29,190
That's a blonde Bari, that's a long Bari, that's an extra long Bari, and that's a shaggy Bari.

151
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:33,560
I'm probably the only one who has this big of a collection of them in the whole country.

152
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,220
There's a famous gallery that wants to do an exhibition with them,

153
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:42,450
but I've never done it because I don't like to send out my babies.

154
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:45,600
By the way, I'll just come right out and tell you what I want.

155
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,070
Ah, yes.

156
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:50,400
First of all, I want someone who isn't more than thirty-five years old.

157
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,540
I'd like them to be around 180 cm in height, and I care about their body proportions.

158
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:59,520
Also, I don't like them too muscular. Some abs that look like a bar of chocolate will be good.

159
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:04,470
I don't like them too handsome either. Someone like Lee Seo Jin  (Three Meals a Day host)  will be good.

160
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:09,520
I'd also like them to have some swagger and strong vibes, something like that.

161
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,170
Since I already have money, someone who has a long-term lease in Gangnam will be adequate.

162
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,920
What do you say? These conditions won't be hard to find, right?

163
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,840

164
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,420
It's not hard at all. I think that you're too modest, actually.

165
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,810
I think if it's you, you could expect more.

166
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:29,180
That's how my father taught me. Shall we have a look, then?

167
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,530
- You have a list of men? 
 - Ah, yes.

168
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:36,910
Uh, hmm...

169
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,880
If you'd like my recommendation...

170
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,100
Hmm...

171
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,460
Oh! This one is only 178 cm.

172
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,020
Oh! What a shame!

173
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,210
This one is too perfect-looking.

174
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,810
I only want the abs to be perfect.

175
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:55,730
I don't think he's her type either.

176
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,400

177
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,830

178
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,990
He's thirty-five years old.

179
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,610
He's an artist!

180
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,240

181
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,110
 Hyung! I mean, Boss, did you arrive?

182
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,630
Yes, right now.

183
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,400
 Is someone there by any chance?

184
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,770
 Nana Gallery is there to make a contract with Oh Doo Ri as well.

185
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,350
I'm sorry, but I'm not supposed to give out private information.

186
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:50,390
I can give you more details once you sign up as a member.

187
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,890
Is that so?

188
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,980
Let's do it.

189
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,160
Here you go.

190
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,110
Pen.

191
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,810
- Who's this?
- My name is Kang Hoon Nam. I gave you a call earlier.

192
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,810

193
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,630
I'm speechless.

194
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:33,910
They say that there's an order for who drinks rice water first, but this is really not fair.

195
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,770
I think the idiom is "there's an order for who drinks cold water first."

196
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:38,900
Cold water? Do you think we're by the well or something?

197
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,880
I think the idiom is "looking for rice water by the well", not "cold water."

198
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:47,430
Of course, I know that. I was just getting it mixed up because I'm upset.

199
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,250
That's not what's important right now!

200
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,050
Yes, that's why...

201
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:54,800
Could I talk to you in private?

202
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,600
You—!

203
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,900
Wow, wow!

204
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:05,570
I need you to show him that he can't deceive us anymore,

205
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,780
that justice is still alive.

206
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,850
Please wait outside.

207
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,900
Definitely.

208
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:03,110
How did it go? Did you sign with her?

209
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,850
Did you or did you not!?

210
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,810
Isn't that none of your business?

211
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:10,750
Don't you think you at least owe me that much if you stole my client?

212
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,070
You're not even sorry. Aren't you being too much?

213
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,930
This is obviously a competition, too.

214
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,200
A competition?

215
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,870
Come on, this is not right!

216
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:23,720
Don't you have any morals?

217
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,280
Your forehead is red.

218
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,280
What? Hey!

219
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,860
I mean, I wasn't going to go this far, but...

220
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,970
Royal? Noble?

221
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:42,660
Who do you work for? I can easily find out by doing a little research.

222
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:49,000
So you're not going to tell me? Fine. Even if I don't pay back my debts, I never let go of an opportunity to take revenge!

223
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,080
My nickname is Slave Hunter for a reason!

224
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,780
Taxi!

225
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:02,560
- We're going to the airport! 
 - Yes.

226
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,490
What are you trying to do right now?

227
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,790
How does it feel to get something of yours stolen?

228
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,600
So you're paying for the taxi.

229
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,390
Don't live like that. How much success do you want, anyway?

230
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:24,910
You come into this world with an empty glass and leave with an empty glass.

231
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,980
You mean, "empty-handed."

232
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,310
Empty glass or empty-handed, it's the same for me!

233
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:34,220
Look at that, shaking his head when someone's talking to him!

234
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,920
They say if you've seen one, you've seen them all.

235
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,920
I can tell what kind of person you are by just looking at one incident.

236
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,750
Even though this field is competitive, we should still respect each other.

237
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,020
What are we, hyenas that are looking for things to eat?

238
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:48,500
You should have eaten rotten meat, at least.

239
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,600
Can you call it a victory if you just show up

240
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:55,720
without a warning, and steal?

241
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:07,420
♫  Oh love, I love you, Only U
 I'm in big trouble  ♫

242
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,390
♬  I think about you all day  ♬

243
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,810
♬  My heart feels like it’ll explode  ♬

244
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:17,070
♬  I can't express it in words  ♬

245
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:21,620
♬  I'm falling in love with you forever  ♬

246
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,630
♬  I didn’t know love would come to me, too  ♬

247
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,070
♬  I didn't believe in things like that
 I thought it was only  ♬

248
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,420
♬  a story in a TV drama  ♬

249
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,410

250
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:32,040
♬  But you appear in front of me, why?  ♬

251
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,390
♬  Sometimes I think it's a dream and pinch myself  ♬

252
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,660
♬  I’m so happy, but I’m a bit scared  ♬

253
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:42,130
♬  Maybe in the future something this good will end?  ♬

254
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:50,740
I wouldn't be this upset if I lost a client because I wasn't good enough,

255
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,860
but I basically set everything up and you swooped in and stole it!

256
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,200
I'm like a dog who's looking at the roof now.

257
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:00,030
Ah, right. The umbrella.

258
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,900
I borrowed this when I was in Jeju from a flight attendant from Korean Air. Would you be able to give this back to her?

259
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,720
Her name is... Ah! She looks like Oh Yoon Ah.

260
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,850
Please make sure to give her good feedback.

261
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,700
Please! You have to.

262
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:32,200
You... is this how you are going to work?

263
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:39,240
But still it looks like Oh Doo Ri liked you.

264
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:39,980
What?

265
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:43,540
Why did you just leave? She said she told you to wait outside.

266
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,250
What?

267
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,290
She said that you left after she agreed to seal the deal for the gallery show.

268
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:50,450
Why did you just leave? She called and asked.

269
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:53,420
A gallery exhibition?

270
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:59,350
In a few days she will be in Seoul and she said she would sign the contract then.

271
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:03,910
Anyway, I'll take care of this case.

272
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,470
Why don't you try to

273
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,650
sign new contracts or try to make a deal with old clients?

274
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:10,710
 Try to build up your record!

275
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,740
 There's a gallery owner who's supposed to come from Seoul today.

276
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,000
Look at that face.

277
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,720
You worked hard. Go home and rest.

278
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,690
Your face!

279
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:36,080

280
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:43,690
You are here. You must be really hungry.

281
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:46,030
I'm not hungry at all. How could I be hungry?

282
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,880
What are you talking about? You look really hungry.

283
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,140
Joon Soo, I had to do all these degrading things

284
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,780
to this man who I met for the first time.

285
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,490
What? How?

286
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:59,690
I don't know. It just happened to be that way.

287
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:02,610
Please tell me that I won't have to ever see him again.

288
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:05,590
You won't. People's paths don't cross that easily.

289
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,960
Here, eat a lot.

290
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,930
Right?

291
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,280
The pancake and the peppers over there, give them to me.

292
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:18,390
Here's the green onion salad and the dipping sauce.

293
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,420
Am I talking funny again?

294
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:25,070
I'm smart enough to understand whatever rubbish you say. Don't worry.

295
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,010
Your father is coming.

296
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:31,810
My dad? Were you here together?

297
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:35,860
Yeah. Except, he's kind of drunk.

298
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,010
These dirty people...

299
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:45,510
What the hell?

300
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:48,990
You all are insane...

301
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,220
- Huh? 
 - Huh?

302
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,130
My daughter is here!

303
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,890
Everyone! She is my daughter.

304
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:00,550
A national athlete, a diver!

305
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:07,210
She used to get all the gold medals, but now she doesn't even go to the public bath anymore.

306
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,380
Do you even exfoliate?

307
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,460
Here we go again! Your karaoke song is coming on.

308
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,470
I used to clean you from head to toe when you were little.

309
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,890
But I can't do that anymore. Could Joon Soo—?

310
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:19,460
You're so embarrassing!

311
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,810
Do you scrub her back and stuff?

312
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,900
Jun Soo.

313
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,460
Dad, let us go home.

314
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,670
Aigoo, aigoo.

315
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,760
Hold on.

316
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,450
I'm going to start singing.

317
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,790
Here we go!

318
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,870
The alcohol...

319
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,350
How much was it?

320
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,460
The guy with you already paid for it.

321
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,190
Really?

322
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,860
You must be so lucky, to be in such a good relationship.

323
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,590
He's not my boyfriend. He is just a friend.

324
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:50,500
Really? I thought you guys were dating because you're always together.

325
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,920
Thank you for the food!

326
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:57,230
She's going to kill me if she finds out.

327
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:00,680
Where am I going to find new members?

328
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,360
What? I'm already a member.

329
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,820
You can still sign up again!

330
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,720
I still have a lot more to go on the contract.

331
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,620
Why did you say no to the date again?

332
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,120
Because I didn't like her!

333
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,290
Do you have eyes in the back of your head?

334
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:16,700
I only sent you the ones with the A+ grades.

335
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,460
Are we talking about beef right now?

336
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,700
Just choose someone and date, will you?

337
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,860
I need to build a record.

338
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:29,900
Don't you think it's weird for you to tell me to be in a relationship when you're not?

339
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,150
Do you have to taste it  to know if something's poop or chocolate?

340
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,420
You should be able to tell by just looking.

341
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,620
You suddenly sound like an expert in relationships. You're the biggest dummy when it comes to relationships.

342
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,510
The biggest dummy? Speak for yourself.

343
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,120
- What about me? 
 - Hey.

344
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,750
Remember how you were acting all dramatic when your ex was getting married to someone else?

345
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:48,550
I'm the one who saved you when you were

346
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,620
drunk out of your mind, rolling in the mud on the street on her wedding day.

347
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,040
It wasn't mud. It was dirty water, okay?

348
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,190
You can't deny it though, can you?

349
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:56,730
No, there was a rainbow in the sky that day. It was so annoying.

350
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:00,630
You were crying so much while looking at that rainbow.

351
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:07,090
We've seen everything that needs to be seen from each other.

352
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:09,790
- Don't you think?
 - We have.

353
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,060
Isn't he heavy?

354
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,160
I feel like I'm dying.

355
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,220
Let's go!

356
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,400
