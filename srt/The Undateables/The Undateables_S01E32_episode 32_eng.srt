1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,330
So that was how you guys met.

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:05,830
The two of you must be fated for each other.

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,550
Is it comfortable in your new place?

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,530
It's comfortable for me.

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,090
For the first time in my life, I've eaten ramen three times a day.

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,540
I garden and sew all day.

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,450
I'm not living as someone's wife or mom.

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:27,100
It's enough to be spending my time as Go Eun Nim.

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:32,900
Hoon Nam. I'm really happy right now.

10
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,780
That's enough, then.

11
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,260
I'll keep it to myself that you attend the class.

12
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,790
Ask your father-in-law...

13
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,220
to please do the same.

14
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,740
Of course.

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,080
I want the two of you to come together next time.

16
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,420
Okay.

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,730
Mother is very impressive.

18
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,600
Leaving is a hard thing to do.

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,660
She didn't leave back then, but now that she's left this time,

20
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,280
I find her really impressive.

21
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,930
Boss, come outside.

22
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,010
Hello.

23
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,460
Whoa! Toys.

24
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,120
It looks like they didn't sell.

25
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:32,950
What happened?

26
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:38,050
Ah, about that, the winning bidder asked us to send these back to the gallery.

27
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:43,130
All proceeds have been donated. Here is the donation certificate.

28
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,620
Is it possible to find out who the winning bidder is?

29
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,900
Ah, that... the winning bidder. Ah!

30
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,240
It was someone by the name of Kang Jung Do.

31
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,320
Is it someone you know?

32
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:05,130

33
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,110
- Did you eat?
 - I did.

34
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,260
How about you, Father?

35
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,220
I ate, too.

36
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,650
Your mom left individual servings of Oxtail soup

37
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,480
in the freezer so it's easy to reheat. She knew she was leaving.

38
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,720
I don't understand why she did all of that.

39
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,270
I received everything you sent me.

40
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,010
Thank you.

41
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,430
I'm sorry that I'm always one step behind.

42
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,210
Why am I always so awful with timing?

43
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:51,380
Timing comes back. If a person doesn't want to miss it again,

44
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,010
they have to prepare. You especially have to, Father.

45
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,330
You're right. I probably have to.

46
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,380
At this time...

47
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:11,540
is it alright if I... give you a hug?

48
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,790
It's a little early, but I don't think you should miss this timing.

49
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,220
But, Father,

50
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,750
I have a favor to ask.

51
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,900
- It tastes good. 
 - Ah!

52
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,720
Where is Jung Eum?

53
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,660
She's busy preparing for the wedding.

54
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,470
Wedding preparation?

55
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:12,590
Yeah. She said her client Ga Doo Ri or Oh Doo Ri is getting married.

56
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,400
Jun Soo, you have to meet a nice girl, too.

57
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,290
It'll happen for me later.

58
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,570
Time flies by fast.

59
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,800
Time flies by so fast.

60
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,400
- Father?
 - Yeah?

61
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,700
Father, do you like Ronaldo?

62
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,300
- Ronaldo? The soccer player?
 - Yes.

63
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,730
I do like him. Why do you ask?

64
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:49,940
I was chosen to be Ronaldo's team

65
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,430
- rehabilitation doctor.
 - What?

66
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,170
I applied and they actually called me back.

67
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,310
Good for you! You've always wanted to do something like that.

68
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,320
I know, right? It's a really good thing.

69
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,620
So that's why...

70
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,970
I have to leave.

71
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,650
This is something we should celebrate, but I feel disappointed.

72
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:22,120
Father, you can come to see them play. You've always wanted to see Ronaldo play.

73
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,340
That works. Anyway, Joon Soo,

74
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,960
I'm proud of you.

75
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,130
I'll leave your room the way it is. Stay here when you're in Korea.

76
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:38,270
No, it's okay. I'm going to store all my stuff at my parents' home.

77
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,180
You can put the room back on the market. You have to collect rent.

78
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,510
No! You don't think I'm capable of doing this for you?

79
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:47,110
No, it's okay. I'm going to pack all of my stuff and mail it home.

80
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,340
Don't worry about it, Father.

81
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,100
I think that you have some stuff in the storage room, too.

82
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,860
Oh, really?

83
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,290
Yes.

84
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,230
Whoa, what is all of this?

85
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,800
Why is this here?

86
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:38,010
Joon Soo! Here's the baseball glove you used to play with.

87
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,380
How old is all of this?

88
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,700
What is this?

89
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,050
 Hoon Nam...

90
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,270
 My head hurts.

91
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,370
What is that?

92
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,700
A first birthday video.

93
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,800
First birthday?

94
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,100
It looks like a first birthday video I filmed.

95
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,870
- You're going to need a VCR if you want to watch that.
 - Really?

96
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,570
Give it to me. I'll convert it for you.

97
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,840
The flowers are coming tomorrow morning...

98
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,300
The wedding singer and band...

99
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,130
Will you be the team manager after this wedding is over?

100
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:19,100
I've really been concerned about that lately.

101
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,860
Why?

102
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,300
I'm wondering if this is the right path for me.

103
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,030
You've been thinking about things like that lately?

104
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:30,490
I told you how I got started in this field.

105
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:34,500
I'm not sure if its because I started working in this field for an absurd reason or what.

106
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,560
I guess I'm just having doubts.

107
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,240
When I look at Kang Dol Jin

108
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,400
and even the kids taking part in the diving competition,

109
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,310
it seems everyone is chasing after their dream.

110
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,210
It makes me question what I'm doing right now.

111
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,980
You've work hard though. What's the matter?

112
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,890
Of course, I work hard, but

113
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:58,070
I'm not sure if I'm doing a good job.

114
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,870
I was only able to match everyone, including zero members, with your help.

115
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,000
I feel like this is the perfect job for you.

116
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,540
You think of others before yourself. Isn't that the first quality a matchmaker should have?

117
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,390
No one can go back in time and start over. However,

118
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:19,410
it depends on how you live from now on that allows you to create a new ending.

119
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,390
Your start may have been absurd,

120
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:26,100
but it could be your fate, just like us.

121
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,770
Oh! You used to be in such denial!

122
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,800
It amuses me, too!

123
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,490
- Hello.
 - Hello.

124
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,790
Oh goodness, thank you.

125
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:49,440
Ah, yes! The bouquet and boutonniere.

126
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,630
I envy you.

127
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,680
The Most Wanted Man and the Most Wanted Woman.

128
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,150
Can you please...?

129
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,430
Just let me be.

130
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,590
Everyone let's get moving.

131
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,280
Eun Nim.

132
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,330
You came?

133
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,220
Hoon Nam asked me to come.

134
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,900
San and Deul

135
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,900
keep looking for their captain.

136
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,530
They'll get used to it.

137
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,740
San and Deul

138
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,920
want to eat tteokbokki.

139
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,830
I gave them my recipe.

140
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,790
Wait. San and Deul—

141
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,550
Enough about San and Deul.

142
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,230
I...

143
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:47,060
They think that I love you a lot.

144
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,350
Let's go out and eat some time.

145
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,150
- Captain! 
 - Captain!

146
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,760
Oh! Oh! My San and Deul. Let me take a look at you guys.

147
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,240
Have you been well? So pretty!

148
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,860
Oh, my. You guys are sweating.

149
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,720
The two of them will be okay, right?

150
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,060
Yes. The timing isn't so bad today.

151
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,100
- Hoon Nam.
 - Yeah?

152
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,100
You...

153
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,970
What, what now? What is it?

154
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,220
I think you're going to be an uncle again.

155
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,740
Really?

156
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:35,470
Yes. I've only told you. It's a bit awkward to bring it up at a time like this.

157
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:39,540
Oh. You're so silly.

158
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,800
What should I name the kid?

159
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,890
Hmm... Kang, if it's a boy. Byul, if it's a girl.

160
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,690
San, Deul, Kang. I like it.

161
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:54,200
You're going to have three boys?

162
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,810
I have to have a daughter, too.

163
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,190
That's too much.

164
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,290
Can I ask for a favor?

165
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,180
Sure, what is it?

166
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,240
This is a poem that I wrote.

167
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:19,610
I'm embarrassed, but can you recite this poem as a surprise?

168
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,780
Sure, I can do that.

169
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,240
Thank you.

170
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,440
 The wedding will be starting. Everyone, please take a seat.

171
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:08,330
 The bride and groom, please come forward.

172
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:14,860
 You're pretty! You're handsome!

173
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:23,470
 You look good together.

174
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:45,850
 Next is the recital of the poem written by the groom.

175
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,930
"I love you."

176
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:14,290
"Dream, stars, spring, flowers."

177
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:19,390
"First, sweat, always, strength."

178
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,270
"The single words that make up the two words of my life."

179
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,690
"Love."

180
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,800
"Through love the two of us become one."

181
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,440
"That is why I trusted you."

182
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,270
"I... had no thoughts."

183
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:48,760
"I..."

184
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,160

185
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:08,820
"I... had no thoughts."

186
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,340
"I just loved you..."

187
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,020
"So, please just believe this one thing."

188
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,990
"You are real."

189
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,860
"Forget about the past,

190
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:51,170
in order to start a new day."

191
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,720
Now, can everyone please raise their glass?

192
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:07,020
Obliviate!

193
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,270
 Obliviate!

194
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,450
 Obliviate!

195
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,960
- Obliviate. 
 - Obliviate.

196
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,940
- Obliviate. 
 - Obliviate!

197
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,960
Yes, that.

Here it goes. One, two, three!

207
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,580
You should have caught that.

208
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,480
Joon Soo!

209
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,430
Soo Ji.

210
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,390
Can you give me a ride?

211
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:52,130
I think it might be better if you find another ride.

212
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,740
Aren't you going to the airport?

213
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,480
You're right. How did you know?

214
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:00,860
I see as much as I know. And I know as much as I have interest.

215
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:08,890
I need to catch a flight, too. Can you give me a ride to the airport?

216
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:13,160
I'm going to Australia. You're going to Europe, right?

217
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:18,210
I can give you a ride to the airport. Let's go.

218
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:23,400
What happens if I change my mind at the airport?

219
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,000
Why don't we have a drink, Senior?

220
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:52,610
Here you go. You worked hard today.

221
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:56,180
You worked hard, too.

222
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:02,440
What are you going to do? They say you'll be single forever if you don't get married within six months of catching the bouquet.

223
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,860
I have no plans to propose soon. What are you going to do?

224
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,580
I'm busy too because I became the team manager.

225
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,180
Oh, right.

226
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,080
Here.

227
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,450
What is this?

228
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,990
My dad gave it to me. He said that it belongs to you.

229
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,360
This is mine?

230
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,250
That's what he said.

231
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:35,960
What is this?

232
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,440
I'm not sure. Open the file.

233
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:51,380
 Hoon Nam! Oh, you're so cute.

234
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:58,120
 Hoon Nam. Hoon Nam. Look over here. Uncle is here to film you.

235
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,400
 Hoon Nam. Look over here.

236
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,450
 He's here to film you.

237
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:08,470
 Hoon Nam! Hoon Nam! It's your day today.

238
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,730
 Why does he keep on crying? Did he sleep enough?

239
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:18,550
 Hoon Nam! Peek-a-boo. Look at me! I'm handsome, right?

240
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:34,430
 Hoon Nam, it's Mom.

241
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:41,120
 To future Hoon Nam who will be watching this video,

242
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,750
 there's something that I'd like to say.

243
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:50,980
 Even if I were to go back in time, I'd make the same choice,

244
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:56,370
 because it was how I was able to meet you.

245
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:03,390
 In my life, the past, present, and future, are all the roads to meeting you.

246
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:08,880
 That's the only thing. So, I'm very happy right now!

247
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:15,090
 To future Hoon Nam, who will be watching the past, and to the one year-old Hoon Nam...

248
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:20,960
 Hoon Nam, I love you, always.

249
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,460
 That's enough.

250
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,400
 A big thank you to everyone who worked on this drama!

You said that you wanted to try this inside a car, right?

257
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:14,620
 You didn't know? I like that kind of thing, so I want to try it inside a car.

258
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,230
 I'm definitely going to try it inside of a car.

259
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:20,600
 Watch the sunrise.

260
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,510
You remembered that?

261
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,440
Of course, I'm a relationship expert.

262
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,470
Shall we go outside?

 (Final Credits)

265
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:49,530
Wait here. I'll go buy some coffee.

266
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:57,080
 (Final Credits)

267
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:05,050
 (Final Credits)

268
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,880
What is that?

269
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,470
Say hi.

270
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:26,380
This is Cracorn, the cat doll I made while thinking of you.

271
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,690
Her name is Cracorn?

272
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,210
Yeah. She's Cracorn.

273
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:35,320
You're Cracorn, too. There are two Cracorns.

274
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,120
Take a look.

275
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,780

276
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:14,230
 I, Yoo Jung Eum, will only love Kang Hoon Nam,

277
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,180
 will only look at Kang Hoon Nam,

278
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:21,540
 and will only serve Kang Hoon Nam a.k.a Mr. Art. I promise this.

279
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:27,900
I told you, you shouldn't just pass out blank contracts like that.

280
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,820
Oh, goodness.

281
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:45,420
♫  I call you, I call you  ♫

282
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:52,060
♫  I call you like this  ♫

283
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,190
♫  I'm even scared to sleep and dream  ♫

284
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,730
You're cute.

285
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:00,530
♫  I'm even scared to sleep and dream  ♫

286
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:05,020
By the way, I have something to give you, too.

287
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,860
Close your eyes.

288
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:12,010
Open your eyes on the count of three.

289
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:17,110
One, two, three.

290
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:28,450
I found it.

291
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:34,450
♫  I call you like this  ♫

292
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:40,080
You took my heart as well. Give me back my heart.

293
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,430
I can't give that back.

294
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:46,950
I'll give you mine instead.

295
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:54,520
♫  I hope you'll be my love  ♫

296
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:14,440
 And like that, the Tin Man who lost his heart was able to find it again.

297
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,620
 The couple that overcame the worst first impression,

298
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:22,880
 Kim So Eul and Oh Doo Ri, became a family.

299
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:30,340
 Coach and Yook Ryong continue to extend their relationship every month

300
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:34,210
 and are still dating.

301
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:38,780
 DMJ avoided closing down thanks to their new pickled plum sauce.

302
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:42,040
♫  In my head I become your other half  ♫

303
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:46,510
♫  I hastily imagine it  ♫

304
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:52,450

♫  oh slowly slowly  ♫
♫  Can I carefully  ♫

305
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:56,600
♫  knock on your heart?  ♫

306
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:02,360
♫  oh slowly slowly  ♫
 ♫  Can I convey  ♫

307
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,440
 Top Spot 
♫  my feelings so you won't be surprised?  ♫

308
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,470

♫  My clumsiness  ♫

309
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:16,260
♫  Even if it's frustrating and disappointing  ♫

310
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,160
♫  oh slowly slowly  ♫

311
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,700
 And here we have Australia's East Coast Surfing Champion, 
 ♫  Even if I'm slow, I'll give you  ♫

312
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,650
 Soo Ji Lee. How does it feel? 
 ♫  my love that's deepening  ♫

313
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:28,450
♫  There's no love like this in movies  ♫

314
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:33,530
 Australia's No. 1 Surfing Champion!

315
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,510
 A round of applause for everyone who is trying hard to make it on their own.

316
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:00,160
What's this?

317
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,330
Practice for our underwater wedding.

318
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,090
What?

319
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:09,480
Come. Time to practice walking with me.

320
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,130
Here.

321
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,330
Oh, it's cold!

322
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,470
- That surprised me! 
 - Get it.

323
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,540
Come in, come in.

324
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,650
Come in.

325
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,910
Come in, it's okay.

326
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,100
What are you doing?

327
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:48,700
Again. One... two...

328
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,930
How is it? It's okay, isn't it?

329
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,660
Yeah.

330
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:16,160

331
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,110
 There are memories that fade away without any effort.

332
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:26,530
 There are memories that don't fade away, even without any effort to remember.

333
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,410
 Memories either get erased, stay remembered...

334
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:35,280
  Or they get repaired.

335
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:46,750
 Dating... is remembering memories.

336
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,850

337
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:57,450
♫  Oh love, I love you, Only U  ♫

338
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,530
♫  I think about you all day  ♫

339
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:04,360
♫  My heart feels like it'll explode  ♫

340
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,160
♫  I can't express it in words  ♫

341
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:11,590
♫  I'm falling in love with you forever  ♫

342
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:14,720
♫  I didn't know love would come to me too  ♫

343
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,090
♫  I didn't believe in things like that  ♫

344
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:19,430
♫  I thought it was only a story in a TV drama  ♫

345
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,960
♫  But you appear in front of me, why?  ♫

346
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,350
♫  Sometimes I think it's a dream and pinch myself  ♫

347
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,650
♫  I'm so happy, but I'm a bit scared  ♫

348
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:29,670
♫  Maybe in the future  ♫

349
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,670
♫  something this good will end?  ♫

350
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:36,230
♫  Your love baby, it lets me breathe  ♫

351
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:41,420
♫  It's like a sea breeze for my blocked heart  ♫

352
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:47,230
♫  Your love, could it be this good?  ♫

353
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:47,300
♫  Cuz you are a part of me, baby  ♫
