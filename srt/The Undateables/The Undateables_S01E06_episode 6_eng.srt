1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:08,900

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,350
Isn't this your third cup already?

3
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:17,430
It's not every day that you can drink this kind of coffee at a hotel. Hey. You should also have another one.

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,520
Excuse me.

5
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,840
Thank you.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,000
Why didn't you just bring a tumbler bottle with you?

7
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:41,260
What do you take me for? Pass me the bread.

8
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,000
Put them in here. My kids will like them.

9
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,770
Those flowers must have been really expensive, too.

10
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,320
I'll make the most of my money with this meal.

11
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,800
They are pretty, but it feels like it's kind of a waste, since you'll toss them when you're done.

12
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,370
You can spend a little since it's a once-in-a-lifetime event. The only reason people don't do it is because they don't have the money.

13
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,300
Is that it?

14
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,340
I've only been to other people's weddings.

15
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,130
I never got to have my own ceremony.

16
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,200
Really?

17
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,190
We said we'd do it later when we could afford it.

18
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,060
"Let's just do this first instead."

19
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,450
And then we never did.

20
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,180
Instead, you had Min Ji and Hyun Ji, and now you have a great life.

21
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,170
I'm only living by looking at my kids.

22
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,160
Hey, don't live like me.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,490
- Congratulations! 
 - Congratulations! You look so beautiful!

24
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,390
Oh, the groom also looks to be in great condition.

25
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:58,500
Ah,  truly. Have a great honeymoon.

26
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,330
And we'll see you when you get back.

27
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,920
Err, sure.

28
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,660
- Thank you for coming. 
- Not at all, it's a given.

29
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,440
- Congratulations! Congratulations! 
 - You must be so busy.

30
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,280
Oh, congratulations! You are so beautiful!

31
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,110
We said hi, we can leave now. I have to return the clothes I'm wearing.

32
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,550
Can you smell anything?

33
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,550
That won't do.

34
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,200
Should I give you some deodorant spray?

35
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,830
Spray some right here. Here, here.

36
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,630
Is it unscented? Good, it's unscented.

37
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,890
Let's hurry up!

38
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,730
Why did you have to get such expensive clothes?

39
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,290
You don't understand how these VIPs are.

40
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,520
You can't even enter the wedding venue if you're not wearing designer clothes.

41
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,590
Come on. There can't be rules like that.

42
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,720
You can't see it, but they're all there.

43
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,110
It's just them showing off.

44
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,290
This is all because of you! Everything is, you know?!

45
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm doing this because our team is not doing well.

46
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,210
What about our team? Is it bad?

47
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:51,080
Think about all the trouble you've caused. Remember that Yook Ryong guy?

48
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,620
- You're the one who gave him a consult.
 - What?

49
00:03:54,620 --> 00:04:00,130
If you can't take care of the Zero Members this time, our team is going to end up being zero, okay?

50
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,300
Did I make them Zero Members? If it were something that could be taken care of, it would have happened already—

51
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,010
Bong Sun Hwa?

52
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:33,160
Oh Doo Ri.

53
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,140
Fancy meeting you here. What brings you here?

54
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,500
I was just at a wedding...

55
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,310
Is that so?

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,730
Ah, this...

57
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,700
For a refund?

58
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,990
No, exchanging it.

59
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,410
Ah, an exchange?

60
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,690
- Do you want to exchange that?
 - Yes, to a different color.

61
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,450
This jacket only comes in two colors, would that be okay?

62
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:08,020
The one I saw earlier was better. You see, I have too many black jackets.

63
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,990
I see. You have a lot of black ones. Please wait a moment.

64
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,100
Are you aware of how much one costs?

65
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,260
How would I return it in front of her?

66
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,100
But still, it's going to cost you one year's worth of your salary.

67
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,110
Customer.

68
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,680
This is the right one, correct?

69
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,800
Right. Correct. That's the one.

70
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,210
Then would you like to try it on? Please come this way.

71
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:25,290
I wondered who would wear that kind of thing, but It actually looks good on you. Why don't you just wear it and go?

72
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,860
Would you like to wear it out of the store?

73
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,210
Please excuse me.

74
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,240
How was it? Did it go well?

75
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,200
What? Yes.

76
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,120
They thought it was a fun idea.

77
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,880
Mr. Kang has so many great ideas. It was his idea to customize our clothes for Bari Bari.

78
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,840
- I'm really excited about this collaboration.
 - Thank you.

79
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,340
I'm glad. Thanks to you, my babies get to wear designer clothes.

80
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,410
It's nothing.

81
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,300
Since we're finished,

82
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,140
shall you and I talk?

83
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,470
Last time, you mentioned an artist?

84
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,920
That... is best discussed with our team manager.

85
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,020
Is that so?

86
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,310
- Then, I shall take my leave. 
 - Yes.

87
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,210
What? What?

88
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,390
Jung Eum.

89
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,840
Those who are alive have to survive. Hello!

90
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,160
We meet again. Are you doing a collaboration with this brand?

91
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,680
So some dolls are going to be wearing designer clothes? Wow.

92
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,560
By the way, did you take a look at the profiles?

93
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,240
You really have the Tin Man?

94
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,920
Of course, you saw the picture.

95
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,910
I don't know about other things, but you can't joke around with this.

96
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,880
Okay.

97
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,650
Then shall we go somewhere now that we have met—?

98
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,830
You don't have to catch me.

99
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,390
Don't you know how to say thank you?

100
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,430
Seriously, I don't fall easily.

101
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,220
I have a very good sense of balance.

102
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,300
See?

103
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,270
Let's meet in two hours in front of the chocolate store.

104
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,270
Chocolate store?

105
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,230
There's a chocolatier among the Zero Members.

106
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,360
Right. There is.

107
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,980
You looked at the profiles! In two hours then?

108
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:21,830
Could you drop me off at the subway station? We have two hours to kill anyway.

109
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,770
Yes? Can I get in?

110
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:28,860
Why aren't you answering? I'm getting in then.

111
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,690
♫  I'm falling in love with you forever  ♫

112
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,100
♫  I'm feeling like I'm feeling like this is love  ♫

113
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,020
What a piece of work!

114
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:47,320
♫  I feel the love, I'm feeling like I'm feeling this is love  ♫

115
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,670
Yes, Coach? Yes.

116
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,790

117
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,140
Your strength has improved a lot.

118
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,530
I think you'll be able to go this without the walker soon.

119
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:10,660
This goddamned thing... I don't want to be doing this. It's not like I'm training to become an athlete at this age.

120
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:15,280
No, you need to go through this process right now. Otherwise, it'll get more difficult for you later.

121
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,120
I'm kind of a busybody. I need to move around a lot.

122
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,610
If I don't, I go crazy.

123
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:27,470
But your son was so concerned that you would have trouble with rehabilitation that he even admitted you.

124
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:32,250
I don't care. I just want him to get married. He's already forty,

125
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,700
and he apparently wants to enjoy his life by himself.

126
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,890
He doesn't even socialize. All he does is look at his phone all day.

127
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,460
There are a lot of people who live on their own these days.

128
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,820
It's no longer something to be looked down upon.

129
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,610
I know that it's difficult to meet someone.

130
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,940
He must've been hurt by a lot of people.

131
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,100
He calls human relationships "hurtful relationships."

132
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,380
Even if you get hurt, you just get over it by seeing and living with each other.

133
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,000
That's what living is.

134
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:07,360
How about you? Are you married?

135
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,070
Pardon?

136
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:12,400
No, not yet.

137
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,920
Your whole life will pass by while you're smiling like a fool.

138
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,380
Let's get back to it. Try turning around.

139
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,750
It doesn't work.

140
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,130
Did someone order jjajangmyeon  (black bean noodles) ?

141
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,790
Over here!

142
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,820
I get free potstickers, right?

143
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,330
Yes, you're right.

144
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,360
Eleven thousand...

145
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,670
Here you go. Thank you.

146
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,900
- Enjoy!
 - Thanks.

147
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,220
Come have some.

148
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,860
Goddamn it!

149
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,030
Today is just not my day.

150
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:32,590
Anyway, how is it going with your Zero Members?

151
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,890
I haven't even started yet.

152
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:35,890
What have you been doing?

153
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:39,150
It turned out that it's not something that you can start that easily.

154
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,850
Why? What's the problem, exactly?

155
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,120
I know it's kind of mean to say this,

156
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,300
but they're not quite qualified.

157
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,100
I see.

158
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:54,740
I wanted to meet them and show them what it's like nowadays,

159
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,250
but I couldn't do it once I saw them trying hard to make a living.

160
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,910
Everyone's trying hard just to live happily

161
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:05,070
and I thought that, if I can't help them, the least I can do is not hurt them.

162
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,680
- What are you going to do?
 - That's why I found an expert who can help me.

163
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,350
A relationship expert.

164
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,890
- A relationship expert?
 - Yeah.

165
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:16,280
Apparently, other couple managers often collaborate with relationship coaches.

166
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,230
We can listen to their problems and give them advice as well.

167
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,070
I'm having a meeting with the expert later.

168
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,310
So there is such thing as a relationship coach.

169
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:29,840
What do you think? You're a coach, too.

170
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,560
Do you think you can coach a relationship?

171
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,670
I guess it's better than not coaching them at all.

172
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,560
I know, right?

173
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,650
Where did you find this expert anyway?

174
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,250
The world is so small.

175
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,830
The expert is Yook Ryong's cousin.

176
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:49,290
Apparently, he's a relationship columnist, and a famous one at that.

177
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:54,370
- Yook Ryong?
 - You know, the one who you thought was the love of your life.

178
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,450
 You're not sick or anything, right?

179
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,930
 I'll get going, since I got to see your face.

180
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,410
- Why did you have to bring him up?
 - Ah, my mistake.

181
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:24,660
You're a jerk. I was almost over it.

182
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,100
- Are you okay?
 - Give me some water.

183
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,470
- Where's water?
 - Water!

184
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,340
It's all because of you.

185
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,210
Are you okay?

186
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:09,790
♫  Lately I'm curious about you  ♫

187
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:14,580
♫  I want to know more  ♫

188
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,360
♫  oh slowly slowly  ♫

189
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,200
♫  Can I carefully  ♫

190
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,450
♫  knock on your heart?  ♫

191
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,120
♫  oh slowly slowly  ♫

192
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,200
♫  Can I convey  ♫

193
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,690
♫  my feelings so you won't be surprised?  ♫

194
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,870
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

195
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,320
I was eating potstickers with Coach at a billiard room

196
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,000
and she almost died from choking on a potsticker.

197
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,160
Don't sit down yet. Why don't you go buy some chocolates?

198
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,470
Pretend like you don't recognize her.

199
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,060
Don't you think I should say hello...?

200
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:18,530
No. Just get one of each kind of chocolate. I need to know.

201
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:21,270
Ah! Get coffee, too.

202
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,920
Okay.

203
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,560
Am I a servant or what?

204
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,260
Would you like to order?

205
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:35,080
I'll have two Americanos,

206
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,690
and one of each kind of chocolate, please.

207
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:40,150
Okay, I'll be right back.

208
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,270
She really doesn't recognize me.

209
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,930
Don't you think that the owner here is too unfriendly?

210
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:52,680
You know I come here all the time since I live in this neighborhood, but I've never even seen her smile.

211
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,940
Don't you think you have to act sweet if you work at a chocolate shop?

212
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,940
Thank you.

213
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:13,080
She really couldn't recognize me, even though we had a conversation and everything.

214
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,320
Don't you think you chose a difficult one as your first target?

215
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,360
- How much was it?
 - It's on me since it's our first day together.

216
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,230
It wasn't as expensive as you think.

217
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,460
Give me the receipt.

218
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,300
No, thanks.

219
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,230
Don't act excessively.

220
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:29,050
I just wanted to see the prices for the chocolates. Give it to me.

221
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,880
It's much cheaper than I expected.

222
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,170
Isn't it good that it's cheap?

223
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:45,310
It's so good. Try it.

224
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,040
It's all organic and there's a lot of cocoa in it, too.

225
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,480
She needs to charge a lot more for it.

226
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,810
We're not here to help out her business.

227
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:07,530
It doesn't matter how much she charges.

228
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:08,970
She doesn't have enough confidence.

229
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,040
What?

230
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,540
The customers here don't even know that she has face blindness.

231
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,310
They don't even care. But she's so worried about it, all by herself.

232
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,500
Just look at her now.

233
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,380
She's trying to avoid eye contact with her customers.

234
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,280
They're just trying to make eye contact out of politeness,

235
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,190
but she's worried that they might strike up a conversation.

236
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,710
She's worried about making mistakes.

237
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,370
I guess you're right.

238
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:41,120
I think that's a bigger problem than the face blindness.

239
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,220
The low self-esteem.

240
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,730
She'll get hurt no matter who she meets if she's like that.

241
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,050
Hello.

242
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,380
What would you like?

243
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,490
Can I have this one and one of today's coffee to go, please?

244
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,010
It'll be ₩4,500.

245
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,870
I'll be right back.

246
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,210
That guy is the owner of a bookstore around here.

247
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:39,960
Why is he always reading a book here and not at his store?

248
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,350
They sell coffee there, too.

249
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,740
Do they? Maybe he's here for chocolates.

250
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,660
 Is he obsessed with chocolates or something?

251
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,800
What is it?

252
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:58,190
Nothing. I think that this might be easier than we expected.

253
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,420
Let's take the rest of the chocolates to go.

254
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,270
Do you want to leave?

255
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,250
You can stay if you want.

256
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,740
We can't just leave like this.

257
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:24,030
I need you to tell me what you're planning to do.

258
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,160
Come see me at the gallery tomorrow.

259
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,410
The gallery?

260
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,870
Okay.

261
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:43,420
Unbelievable. What a d***!

262
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,240
What's your symptom?

263
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,690
I'm having trouble digesting my lunch. I had jjajangmyeon and a potsticker for lunch.

264
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:59,530
Oh... Did you have any alcohol?

265
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,430
I did yesterday.

266
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,060

267
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,190
It's ₩15,000.

268
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:12,370
- Can I have one of those as well?
 - Ah, yes.

269
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:18,130
Hey, hey, hey! Be careful. Be careful.

270
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:22,860
I have chocolates for you.

271
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,560
Don't run around too much, okay? You don't want to hurt yourself.

272
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,350
Bye!

273
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,240
Are they closing, too?

274
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,410

275
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,440
Yoo Jung Eum?

276
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,990
Oh, Choi Joon Soo. You're here, too?

277
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:02,120
I couldn't just pass by, knowing that they're closing.

278
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,850
I know, right? This was the "it spot" of the neighborhood.

279
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,890
♫  I need love  ♫

280
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:13,970
 - I'm going to win!
 - You're cheating.

281
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:17,170
 Stop cheating!

282
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,520
 Here I go!

283
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,630
 I'm going to win!

284
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,510
 No, I'm going to.

285
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,340
♫  You greet me good morning  ♫

286
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:34,200
♫  I don't know if I'll be excited from a sweet kiss  ♫ ♫

287
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,730

288
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:42,570
 (Retro toys)

289
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:46,670

290
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:50,450
Choi Joon Soo. Pick one. I'll buy it for you.

291
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,630
Really?

292
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:56,880
That one. Wasn't that your favorite?

293
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,310
Can't believe they still make these.

294
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,570
Give me one, too.

295
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,270
This is amazing.

296
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,780
- You were really bad at this. Remember? 
 - Hey!

297
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:07,310
I'm great at it, what are you talking about?

298
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,900
♫  I like this you  ♫

299
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,460
It's not easy. I used to be really good at it.

300
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,510
Want to switch with me?

301
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,220
No.

302
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:28,150
What the hell are you doing with that sparkly stuff in the middle of the night?

303
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:31,760
What are you, a child?

304
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:37,130
Joon Soo is even good at playing with the spinning top.

305
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:41,940
Smart people are good at everything.

306
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:45,710
What are you staring at? What are you good at anyway?

307
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:50,510
What am I going to do with that piece of work?

308
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:53,390
You don't even think about helping me with the laundry.

309
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,900
I'm good at spinning tops. Why am I so bad with the yo-yo?

310
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,340
You broke an earthenware jar with a yo-yo, remember?

311
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,560
If it was like back then, you would have gotten your yo-yo taken away from you.

312
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,920
How do you even remember all that?

313
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:07,000
I don't have a particularly good memory, but you have a bad memory.

314
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,530
Is that so?

315
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,600
- I try not to remember things too well, I guess.
 - Why?

316
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,620
There are some things I don't want to remember.

317
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:19,430
So I trained myself to forget and now I even forget the things that I need to remember.

318
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:23,840
Forget it, forget it. Hey Bang Shik, Bang Shin, come over here.

319
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:27,180
- That's right.
 - Here.

320
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,880
The spinning top.

321
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,200
Yay!

322
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,600
Check this out.

323
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,930
I've been waiting for this moment my whole life.

324
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:21,150
Take my laser attack!

325
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,920
Attack!

326
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,140
- Did you just get here? 
- You're early.

327
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,680
How's it going with the Zero Members?

328
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,560
The thing is...

329
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,760
Nothing yet...

330
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,680
Oh Door Ri wanted to see that guy you showed her the other day.

331
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:48,330
I can arrange that. Let me take care of a few other things first.

332
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,510
- Don't mess this up, okay?
 - Okay.

333
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,470
Guys! Go upstairs.

334
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,450
We don't have a lot of time to finish up the front yard, too.

335
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,930
I'm sorry, they won't listen.

336
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:42,400
Hey, kids, kids! Kids, you shouldn't be doing this here.

337
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,770
Kids? Kids!

338
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:53,640
Sister-in-Law dropped them off here for a second while she went to go take care of some things because she knew we were closed today.

339
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,400
You should've said no.

340
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,630
I told her that she couldn't

341
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:00,640
because we need to start setting up the new exhibition, but...

342
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,600
Jesus Christ.

343
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,770
Kang San, Kang Deul!

344
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:23,250
Oh, aigoo, aigoo! Babies, who made you cry?

345
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,760
Who was the bad person that did it?

346
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,430
What's your name?

347
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:36,240
- Sani
 - Deuri.

348
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,350
Sani, Deuri, wow, what pretty names!

349
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,270
Do you guys want to play outside with me?

350
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:45,110
I'm good at playing tag.

351
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,610
Come over here.

352
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,840
I'll go play with them, so do whatever you need to.

353
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,720
Let's go!

354
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,200
Yay!

355
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,990
Rock-paper-scissors!

356
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,280
Rock-paper-scissors!

357
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,920
- You're the tagger!
 - The loser is the tagger!

358
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,110
Freeze!

359
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,240
 You're too fast!

360
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,330
It hurts!

361
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,210
Are you okay?

362
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:31,420
I was joking!

363
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,910
Oh, right!

364
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,070
I have a spinning top!

365
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:50,240
Ta-da!

366
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,840
I'm going to play with it first!

367
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,390
Soldiers!

368
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,780
There's an order for who drinks rice water first. Follow the order, okay?

369
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,330
 Yes, sir!

370
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,760
 Private Kang San, come forward!

371
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,450
It's cold water, not rice water.

372
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:07,050
Have you done this before?

373
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,990
- I have.
 - Yeah?

374
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,910
 You wrap it like this.

375
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,900
And hold it like this, use your pinky finger.

376
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:18,240
Move, it's dangerous. We're going to throw now. Throw and grab. Okay?

377
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,720
One, two, three. Throw and pull!

378
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,510
♫  We were staying in Paris to get away from your parents and I thought "wow"  ♫

379
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:30,110
♫  If I could take this in a shot right now  ♫

380
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,080
That would be too much, right?

381
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,320
♫  I don't know if it's fair but I thought "How  ♫

382
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,420
♫  could I let you fall by yourself while I'm wasted with someone else?”  ♫

383
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,390
It's Deuri's turn!

384
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,470
- Yes, sir!
 - Here.

385
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,200
Throw!

386
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,140
Thow it, throw it.

387
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:20,840
Are you okay? Thank god.

388
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,930
Guys! Mom's on her way.

389
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:30,940
She's almost here...

390
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:41,800
♫  Oh love, I love you, Only U. I'm in big trouble   ♫

391
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,440
♫  I think about you all day  ♫

392
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:51,550
 Relationships are like dominos.

393
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:56,790
 They're hard to set it up, but it only takes a second for them to get knocked down.

394
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:02,190
 The fragments of emotions are only set up to collapse anyway.

395
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:05,460
 That's what relationships are.

396
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:13,010
♫  Oh love, I love you, Only U 
 I'm in big trouble   ♫

397
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:16,120
♫  I think about you all day  ♫

398
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:22,770
♫  My heart feels like it'll explode 
 I can't express it in words  ♫

399
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:27,130
♫  I'm falling in love with you forever  ♫

400
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,140
 - What's this?
 - It's a blank contract.

401
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,210
 I'll sign it.

402
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:34,310
 You can drink it in the car. It's just good manners to put the seat belt on for a woman.

403
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:36,400
 At least, we won't have to see her anymore, right?

404
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,520
 You'll see her a lot from now on.

405
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,300
 Have you been waiting here the whole time?

406
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,030
 You're late. Where do you live? I can drop you off.

407
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,940
 Kang Hoon Nam? You'd better be careful.

408
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:49,100
 - He's a player.
 - Women especially don't know how to kiss in their own way.

409
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,500
 Don't you think you have too much confidence?

410
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,440
 What are you going to do for me when we succeed?

411
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,840
 I'll give you my body first.
