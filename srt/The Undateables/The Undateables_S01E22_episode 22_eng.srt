1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:08,830

2
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,550
Let's start the consultation.

3
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,140
Yes, let's do that.

4
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,390
I met this woman recently

5
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,470
and she bought me a sandwich really early in the morning.

6
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:49,550
And I'm a man that lives alone.

7
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,340
Don't you think that she likes me?

8
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,610
No.

9
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,640
She probably would've felt embarrassed to visit someone's house empty-handed.

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,270
Is that it?

11
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,890
Then, the woman looked at me and kept smiling

12
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,150
and asked to eat ramen with her.

13
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,090
Don't you think she likes me?

14
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,840
Maybe she was hungry.

15
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,410
I see.

16
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,220
She kissed me on my cheek before going to work.

17
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,010
Don't you think she likes me?

18
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,710
No.

19
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:25,200
There are women who kiss others for no reason.

20
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,820
Actually, when we went to Kim So Eul's house, I had money.

21
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,510
What did you say?

22
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,010
  What are you doing? Why aren't you helping? ?

23
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,640
 It's doesn't seem like there's much.

24
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,030
 Hurry, plant them and then rest here.

25
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:02,900
♫  What words to begin with  ♫

26
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,050
  Do you have any money on you?

27
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:11,170
 I don't. I left it in the car.

28
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,740
I wanted to be with you, so I said I didn't have any on purpose.

29
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,980
I'd already started liking you then.

30
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,790
I came to the gallery afterward and Yook Ryeong

31
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,690
said that it didn't seem like you liked me at all and got me all riled up.

32
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:38,050
Anyway, that was the order, for your information.

33
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,910
What do I have to do now?

34
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:50,730
Manager Yoo Jung Eum, what should a person like this do?

35
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,180
Get introduced to another woman.

36
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:09,730
If the consultation is done, go home safely.

37
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:16,630
♫  I was young then  ♫

38
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:21,090
♫  That you were the one protecting me  ♫

39
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:29,380
♫  I understood now that it was because of you  ♫

40
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,290
Good morning.

41
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,420
Good morning.

42
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,960
Where are you trying to go today looking like that?

43
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,240
A relative's kid's first birthday party.

44
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,030
You can take that off, not that Oh Doo Ri has been taken care of.

45
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,400
You don't know until they walk down that aisle.

46
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:09,640
But, Jung Eum, you know that you are precious to me, right?

47
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,100
What are you trying to say now?

48
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,900
As I expected,

49
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:20,240
the top zero member of Geum Sang Chum Hwa, the one-hundred times rejected, mythical zero member has been assigned to us.

50
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:25,370
I mean, it's already like a war with the Zero Members I have already.

51
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,600
What can we do? If they tell us to do it, then we have to.

52
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,190
After getting Oh Doo Ri, we're barely clinging on.

53
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:39,680
Keep your head up. Think of this as an opportunity from heaven and figure it out.

54
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,180
This member's father's background could eat Oh Doo Ri's father's for breakfast.

55
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,560
If it's this hot already, how am I supposed to live during the summer?

56
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,910
  How did it go? I haven't heard from you.

57
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,690
 You're making me worry. Contact me when you see this.

58
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,950
Just ask me. It's unlike you to be on your toes.

59
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:26,150
I don't know. After that, I couldn't contact you.

60
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:30,230
I was thinking maybe I was being nosy. It was really sad.

61
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,530
Don't make me curious, hurry and tell me.

62
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,400
What happened?

63
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:45,220
It's over, completely.

64
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,670
Are you okay?

65
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:56,120
I'm too old now to be tricked by love.

66
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,510
I think I'm horrible, too.

67
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,150
I was tricked like that in the past, but I got tricked again.

68
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,700
To be honest, I ended it, too.

69
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,130
Huh?

70
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,190
It's been a month.

71
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:16,270
It's okay. I started it and ended it.

72
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,890
Maybe it's because I did all I could, but I feel carefree.

73
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,230
I have to live my life now.

74
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:29,500
But because of you, I was able to love deeply once in my forty years of life. Thank you.

75
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,430
Why are you thanking me? It was my fault.

76
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:37,210
It's okay. I have no regrets.

77
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,470
On a day like this, I should drink with you.

78
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:44,110
We can have a strong drink next time.

79
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,930
But, are you going somewhere? I wanted to ask before, but why are you wearing a business suit?

80
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,630
Oh, this?

81
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,720
Our kids are going to the competition. They passed.

82
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,140
- Really? 
 - Yes.

83
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,200
So, I have to go to women's swimming association.

84
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,050
I wasn't able to take care of the kids well these days. Aren't you proud?

85
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,440
I should pay more attention to them now.

86
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,440
That's great.

87
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,080
Our kids are better than me.

88
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,120
Right? You know that, too.

89
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,410
- Let's hurry and go. 
 - Okay.

90
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,730
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

91
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,330
Wow, you surprised me. Knock.

92
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,250
Okay.

93
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,560
This is good. I asked you to find a venue for an outdoor exhibition, how did that go?

94
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,260
Well, the Seoul arboretum is all booked.

95
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,660
- So, I'll be meeting with a few later in the afternoon. 
 - Arboretum?

96
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,150
I went to a place called "Starlight Celebration" recently.

97
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,440
 Catch me!

98
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,440
 Stop.

99
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,950
It was pretty. I thought it'd be nice to have the exhibition there.

100
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:35,900
Also, President, I found something weird.

101
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,640
What is it?

102
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,880

103
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,070
I told you not to touch anything on my desk!

104
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,620
I wasn't trying to look.

105
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,100
You keep leaving stuff lying around these days, which is so unlike you.

106
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,240
I picked it up and wanted to you about it.

107
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,340
This is good news, right?

108
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,970
Is the chairman okay?

109
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:21,620
I don't know. He's always asking when I'm bringing a man home.

110
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,510
But, Oppa, a membership to a marriage information company?

111
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,970
What is this for?

112
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,060
You don't need to know.

113
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,990
I have to know. I'm the woman you'll marry.

114
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,540
Do you want to keep doing this?

115
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,080
Anyway, what are you here for today?

116
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,640
Since I tossed that grenade out there last time, I came to detain you.

117
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,010
There's something I need to collect, too.

118
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,180
 I'm sorry.

119
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,890
 I was wrong.

120
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,750
 I was wrong.

121
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:07,180
 Actually, when we went to Kim So Eul's house, I had money.

122
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,910
 I wanted to be with you, so I said I didn't have any on purpose.

123
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,080
 I'd already started liking you then.

124
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:19,750
 Manager Yoo Jung Eum, what should I do now?

125
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,500
Thank you for the meal.

126
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,270
I look forward to working with you.

127
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,450
Bye.

00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,870
 You didn't get hurt?

144

 Yes. Thank you.

152
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,750
Jung Eum. Yoo Jung Eum. Our team must be really lucky.

153
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,990
What is it now?

154
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,090
The mythical member, the mythical member just called.

155
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,310
Really?

156
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:46,560
They want to go on a blind date!

157
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,510
- Really? 
 - Yes!

158
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:52,950
They want to meet to go over some last minute details, so you go.

159
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,410
Okay, where should I go?

160
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,030
Here's the address.

161
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,180
Make sure you really get what type of man they want.

162
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,670
She is a VVVIP, so take care of them well.

163
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,720
Don't worry.

164
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,690
Calmly.

165
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,450
I'll be back.

166
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:11,210
Okay, do well!

167
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,620
♫  I'm feeling sexy and free  ♫

168
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,360
The mythical member is here?

169
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,820
♫  Like glitters raining on me  ♫

170
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,790
♫  You're like a shot of pure gold  ♫

171
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:31,400
♫  I think I'm about to explode  ♫

172
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:35,730
♫  I can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air  ♫

173
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,810
♫  Now I'm breathing like   ♫

174
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,850
♫  I'm running cause you're taking me there ♫

175
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,600
♫  Don't you know   ♫

176
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,790
♫  you spin me out of control  ♫

177
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,160
I'll end it here.

178
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,880
You've worked hard.

179
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,390
Let me go check it again.

180
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,100
You're here?

181
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,180
We can talk while drinking tea.

182
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,190
I do this work, so I can eat and live.

183
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,950
I have just one qualification.

184
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,750
There's a Kang Hoon Nam among the members, right?

185
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,910
I'll pick him as the man.

186
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:43,510
Please prepare an official meeting with him.

187
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,840
If it was something like that, why didn't you talk to Team Leader directly?

188
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,020
Team Leader is a nice person.

189
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:00,180
She said you'd have to do it so that the credit goes to you.

190
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:04,460
Oh, right. I don't want Oppa to know until we meet.

191
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,820
Surprises are fun.

192
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,760
Look how black your blood is, you must've really had indigestion.

193
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,660
Are you okay?

194
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,220
I feel a little better than before.

195
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,380
Stay here. I'll bring the plums.

196
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,400
Plums are the best when you have indigestion.

197
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,160
Drink.

198
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,870
 Cheers!

199
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,020
 Congratulations.

200
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,100
What are you thinking about?

201
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:28,490
Just... this looks really mean if you look at it.

202
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,700
You bought this, saying it was cute.

203
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,620
I think, at that time, something was shielding my eyes. I don't know why I liked it.

204
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,870
Is it really hard?

205
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:43,110
No. Take this away.

206
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:51,990
Yoo Jung Eum has manners. She even knows how to calm the heart of the man who is in love with her.

207
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,210
- I'm touched. 
 - Be quiet.

208
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:01,260
You don't have to lie to me.

209
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:13,580
To tell you the truth, it's hard.

210
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:22,280
But... it will get better with time, right?

211
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,660

212
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,460

213
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,380

214
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,790

215
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:18,180

216
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,350

217
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:28,590

218
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:33,590

219
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,990
They have similar ranks. They match well.

220
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,590
He has nothing to do with me now so...

221
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,870

222
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,060
Hello.

223
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,230
Mr. Kang Hoon Nam?

224
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,800
Cracorn.

225
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,530
We've found a match for you.

226
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:40,190
I'll begin working on it as soon as you approve it.

227
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,990
I'll go on this blind date.

228
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,750
I'll pick a day and let you know.

229
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,570
Are you going on a blind date?

230
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,660
So, you want to use the jealousy strategy.

231
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:19,670
As expected. Respect!

232
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:47,260
♫  Just broken down as the rain kept steady pourin'  ♫

233
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,260
What did you say to Jung Eum?

234
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,980
This is what Manager Yoo Jung Eum planned.

235
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,460
What did you sa—?

236
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,000
Why are you like this, Oppa?

237
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:03,430
♫  Sometimes it's hard to understand
  ♫

238
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:07,510
♫   how fate can deal with such a heavy hand  ♫

239
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,620
 Yes?

240
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,210
Where are you now?

241
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:15,990
Aren't you supposed to join us for the first meeting?

242
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,650
 I'm sorry, I'm running a bit late.

243
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,060
I asked you where you are right now!

244
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,380
I'll be there soon.

245
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,900
Hello?

246
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,640
Hello? Yoo Jung Eum?

247
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,080
 The phone is turned off...

248
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,420
 Please leave a message at the beep...

249
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,850
 You'll be back soon, right?

250
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,790
 I'll hurry and come back.

251
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:15,130
 Mom will come back soon.

252
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:24,180
 Mom...

253
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,820
 Mom...!

254
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,600
 Mom!

255
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:28,670
♫  I call you, I call you  ♫ 
 ♫  I call you like this  ♫

♫  I'm even scared to sleep and dream  ♫ 
 ♫  In case we drift apart  ♫

259
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:44,290
You said that you were coming soon.

 She said she'd come back soon.

283

 Mom!

291
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:56,330
 I was too afraid of the word "love."

292
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:14,420
 I thought that if I told you that I loved you, you would disappear.

293
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:27,150
 I couldn't say it.
