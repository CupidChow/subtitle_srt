1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,440
Avocados.

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,240
It's curled mallow.

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:15,420

4
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,210
Wasn't your father doing all the housework?

5
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,460
I've been busy and coming home late a lot these days.

6
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,050
I want to go home early for once and do it myself.

7
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,860
Because you were busy?

8
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,040
Matching the Zero Members is no joke.

9
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,240
Zero Members? Please.

10
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,870
You must be busy dating.

11
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,730
What dating? My job is very busy.

12
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,680
Work is busy?

13
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,990
Why did you kiss then?

14
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,830
What kiss? What are you talking about?

15
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,010
What am I talking about? I saw everything, girl.

16
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,800
The second floor went crazy.

17
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:26,150
Well, you went crazy on the first floor.

18
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,890
As soon as you came into the gallery,

19
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,540
the two of you—

20
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,950
I saw everything.

21
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,830
I thought you said he was a relationship expert.

22
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:42,190
You knew and still fell for him when he seduced you?

23
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:46,240
What do you mean seduced? Isn't that too much?

24
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,000
Well, he is the relationship expert,

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,100
but after meeting him, he wasn't so bad.

26
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,450
Does a conman ever tell people that he's a conman?

27
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,770
I heard from Yook Ryong that he—

28
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,010
What?

29
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,050
Nothing.

30
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,900
Anyway, he's a real player. Hurry and end it.

31
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,490
What about that shady dude, Ryong?

32
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:16,200
Why are you meeting that womanizer?

33
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,290
Hey! He's just really pure.

34
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:25,400
He doesn't know women at all and suffered from it, but he's a pure person.

35
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,100
Don't compare Yook Ryong with the relationship expert.

36
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,360
Yook Ryong said he'd bring cake and champagne for my birthday.

37
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,000
He asked me to date him officially too.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,340
Do you believe that?

39
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,250
I warned you.

40
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,780
Aigoo! He did this with his hands.

41
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,140
He should've told me to print it for him. It's faster on a computer.

42
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,550
It's so my dad.

43
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,080
It was hard, getting your examination yesterday, right?

44
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,190
I made the curled mallow soup that you like.

45
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,850
Curled mallow is good for constipation, too.

46
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,890
Dad, you're having a hard time going to the bathroom these days.

47
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,890
It's hard to prepare curled mallow. Did you know what you were doing?

48
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:39,870
Of course! Everything is on the internet these days.

49
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,460
How is it?

50
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,130
You could get married.

51
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:55,680
That's okay. All I need is for you to like it.

52
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:04,420
Jung Eum, how is Joon Soo as a man?

53
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:08,070
Triple A. He's a premium member at our company.

54
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,240
No, no, not objectively.

55
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,950
More subjectively.

56
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,210
Subjectively?

57
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,940
He's a friend, what do you mean subjectively?

58
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,060
There's no friendship between a man and a woman.

59
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,370
You also had a woman who was close to you like a sister.

60
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,210
Because of her, you and Mom... I remember everything.

61
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,340
That's because your mom misunderstood.

62
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,760
Anyway, you had a woman like that.

63
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,430
Joon Soo is like that to me.

64
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,720
I'm back.

65
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,640
Did you have dinner?

66
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,810
I ate while drinking with the hospital staff.

67
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,580
Eat more.

68
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,800
Star Elementary School is close to here, right?

69
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,960
Yes, it's right over there.

70
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,170
Okay, thank you.

71
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,310

72
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,780

73
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,610

74
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,460
 Kang Hoon Nam, the gallery manager.

75
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,890
  He went out of town with your friend.

76
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,810
 They even stayed out overnight.

77
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,680
 I thought that you were with a guy.

78
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,900
 What guy?

79
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,680
 If my instincts are right, he might be dating.

80
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,910

81
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,980

82
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,300
 Are you sleeping?

83
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,300
What is this?

84
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:29,670
 It's so early. Just come over. Why are you messaging me?

85
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:33,370
 Let's talk face-to-face.

86
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,180
Is something happening?

87
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,770
Why are you setting this kind of mood?

88
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,660
It's nothing.

89
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,010
Looks like you're feeling the alcohol.

90
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,690
Is something wrong?

91
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,960
- Yoo Jung Eum.
 - Hmm?

92
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,160
Do you want to play a game?

93
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,370
Games go well with soju.

94
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,320
Never Have I Ever?

95
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,810
"Say it in Five Words." How's that?

96
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,880
Those things give me a headache. Let's just do something like play rock-paper-scissors

97
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,400
and whoever loses drinks.

98
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,490
This... is a punishment drink.

99
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,400
What? We've already started?

100
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,660
Asking because you don't know?

101
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,930
Okay then, let's start.

102
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,290
Why?

103
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,240
Why did you stay overnight?

104
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,580
Because I had to work.

105
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,640
Who were you working with?

106
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,600
Why did you want to know?

107
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,480
It is an important matter.

108
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:08,350
I lost. I'll drink and we can end the game here.

109
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,630
I am not done yet.

110
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,390
- What's wrong with you? 
 - If you don't answer,

111
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,490
I will end this relationship.

112
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,360
Hurry up and answer me.

113
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,690
I told you to stop.

114
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,370
I won't be your friend.

115
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,180
You're still joking around until the end.

116
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,150
It is not a joke.

117
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:40,550
I said, it's not a joke.

118
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:52,260
Choi Joon Soo, if we add a few more years, it's thirty years.

119
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,760
Do you know how many bowls of rice and bottles of alcohol we've had?

120
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,180
You think that thirty years is a joke?

121
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,790
You want to break off our thirty years of friendship?

122
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:10,400
Yeah, let's end it and stop being friends.

123
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,010
From now on,

124
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,320
I want to be your man, not friend.

125
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,300
Joon Soo, I...

126
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,100
There's someone I like.

127
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,600
I know.

128
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,900
Who that someone is...

129
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,080
I'm saying I already know.

130
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,840
I...

131
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:33,280
You know that I care a lot about you, right?

132
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,630
That expression...

133
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,000
Was it supposed to be this sad?

134
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,900
Okay, starting it means I'm already halfway there.

135
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,400
I'll chase after you hard.

136
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:21,760
I may have a late start, but we don't know the results yet.

137
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,100
Be nervous, Yoo Jung Eum.

138
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,300

139
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,570
I'll go to the bathroom.

140
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,900
Hello?

141
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,000
Where are you?

142
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:00,100
I'm at the beef entrails restaurant near my house.

143
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:03,280
I'm drinking with a friend.

144
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,900
Choi Soo Ok?

145
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,600
A little.

146
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,700
Then, do you want to come here?

147
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,900
Where are you?

148
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,600
I'm at a hotel.

149
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,900
I called you purposely to let you know that I moved into a hotel

150
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,100
so you won't misunderstand and think that I'm with Soo Ji at the gallery.

151
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,500
Isn't a hotel uncomfortable?

152
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,100
It's very uncomfortable. You could tell Joon Soo to leave and give me the room.

153
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,900
What a cold-hearted person you are.

154
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,900
 It's late. I'll let you go.

155
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,000
You don't miss me?

156
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,200
Well, a little.

157
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,800
Ah...

158
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,840
Auntie, here's the bill.

159
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,800
So, I heard that you two are friends?

160
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,870
Why are you always together if you're just friends? People will misunderstand.

161
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,980
We're not going to be friends anymore.

162
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,100
Have you met with Na Ga Young?

163
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,100
I'm too busy to see him.

164
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,300
In my opinion, if he's like that, he won't be able to date at all.

165
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,400
Then let's grab some dates with the matching programs.

166
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,700
He won't even sit through the date for five minutes and will just walk out.

167
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,900
Just send him anyway.

168
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,100
Okay, I'll try that.

169
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,400
But, you're very businesslike.

170
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,500
I'm not businesslike.

171
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,000
If you miss me that much,

172
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,900
perhaps you can drop by in my dream, honey.

173
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,100
Ah! Ah!

174
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,500
I thought I was going to lose my hands and feet from cringing.

175
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,500
 Is this really you?

176
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,000
Sleep well and dream about me.

177
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,900
Okay, bye.

178
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,500
Why are you out here?

179
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,300
I wanted to sober up from the drinking.

180
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,100
I drank too fast and started feeling buzzed.

181
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,100
Ah, then...

182
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,520
get on my back.

183
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,900
I can just walk.

184
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:10,900
♫  Even if I try to hide it  ♫

185
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:17,300
♫  It shows   ♫
	♫  I can't hide my heart  ♫

186
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:23,900
♫  Am I the only one in love?  ♫

187
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:31,500
♫  Truthfully, I'm afraid you aren't  ♫

188
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,500
 Hey, hey.

189
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,300
♫  Why did I realize only now  ♫

190
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,500
 When you're drunk, just sleep outside.

191
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,300
 Don't you even have a man?

192
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,700
 I'm not drunk.

193
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,200
 I'm fine.

194
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:53,300
 But why are there two moons?

195
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,700
 Why!?

196
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,500
 It must be this! There is no Earth.

197
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,200
 Here we go again.

198
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,400
 Choi Joon Soo.

199
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,500
 Stop it.

200
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,100
 Choi—Joon—Soo!

201
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,700
 Stop it!

202
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,900
 Let's go to outer space!

203
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,100
 It's outer space!

204
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,200
 It's exciting!

205
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,500
 You're not a friend, you're an enemy.

206
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,700
 When you drink, go sleep outside.

207
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,100
 Don't you have a woman?

208
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,500
 I'm sensitive, so I can't sleep on just any pillow.

209
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,400
 Okay, okay. Don't talk. The plastic bag is going to fall off.

210
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,500
 Hey, I don't throw up.

211
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,900
 The right side.

212
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,000
 The left side.

213
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,430
 Please, rub my back.

214
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,600
 Like this?

215
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:08,300
 Jung Eum, I think this is it for me.

216
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:13,100
 - When I die, you keep my dryer.
 - Ugh, seriously...

217
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,500
 You're the worst.

218
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,900
 Clockwise.

219
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,700
What are you doing?

220
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,680
Hurry, let's go.

221
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,670
Okay.

222
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,800
Do you want to run?

223
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,900
Let's go together!

224
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,900
Do you want me to take you?

225
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,400
No.

226
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,700
- Jung Eum, today— 
 - I'm late.

227
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,700
I'll be back.

228
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,200
Someone is coming into the room, so be home early!

229
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,000
Why is she so difficult?

230
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,100
Father, you're renting out that room?

231
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:46,100
There's a new person coming, so come home early if you can.

232
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,400
Okay.

233
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,600
I'm not sure if Jung Eum heard or not.

234
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,300
It's going to be his first day and he'll be unfamiliar with this place. We should greet him together.

235
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,200
Don't you think so?

236
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,600
I don't know who he is, but whoever is coming

237
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,700
is really blessed because you're the landlord.

238
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,100
He's well mannered and clean.

239
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,700
Have a good day at work.

240
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:13,900
This is enough for the yard. I should wash the rag and clean the floor.

241
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,000
You're going to wear out the floor.

242
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,100
 Joon Soo, I...

243
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,500
 There's someone I like.

244
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,500
 Get on my back.

245
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,800
 I can just walk.

246
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,500
She might not even come home.

247
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,600
This is one day?

248
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,500
I dissected Na Ga Young's daily activities.

249
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,800
This is a lot. You've worked hard.

250
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,960
I saw.

251
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,280
I saw you two kissing.

252
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,820
How did you seduce her so quickly?

253
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,510
Mr. Art, respect.

254
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,040
Now you just have to dump her.

255
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,520
Go get the second-by-second footage of this.

256
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,160
Second?

257
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,440
 Choi Joon Soo! Let's go together!

258
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:22,850

259
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:26,390
It must've been hard putting every single one up by himself.

260
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:30,220
Well, at least it got rented quickly.

261
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,690
It's a good thing, right?

262
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:39,320
It's going to be hard to remove all of these now.

263
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,440
Hyung! Don't.

264
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,960
You can't take that off.

265
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,150
You're eating ice cream for breakfast again?

266
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:54,250
You'll probably get in trouble with Mr. Yoo if you take that down.

267
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:58,330
You'll get in more trouble for eating ice cream every day.

268
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,700
I'm out.

269
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,380
Hyung Kook.

270
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,970
You know Jung Eum noona, right?

271
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,460
What happened to the character business you talked about before?

272
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,720
It's on hold because I can't find a writer.

273
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,690
I thought you weren't interested. Why?

274
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:20,290
Okay, I'm leaving now.

275
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:24,410
Why are you doing this? I'm interested. Me.

276
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:28,160
If you insist, I'll think about it.

277
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:32,300
Hoon Nam, thank you so much.

278
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:36,080
I sent you an e-mail with the conditions I want.

279
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,690
You sent...?

280
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,720
Look over it well.

281
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,700
I was fooled.

282
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:47,680
You think I will just continue to rely on only you, right?

283
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,900
I now have Choi Joon Soo.

284
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,430
Who?

285
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:57,090
"The Wanted Man." Choi Joon Soo.

286
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:00,220
He is a hundred times, a thousand times, more thoughtful than you

287
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,540
and kind of amazing.

288
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:07,490
Okay then, you take it.

289
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,880
Hmm?

290
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,610
Fighting.

291
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,680
I'm going to start the project right away then!

292
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,960
Ah, you scared me!

293
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,990
Hoon Nam just walked out. You didn't see him?

294
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,750
No, I didn't see him.

295
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:39,110
There's no way that you wouldn't have run into him.

296
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,320
What the? Did he avoid me?

297
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,410
Let's go, I made reservations.

298
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,080
Let's go.

299
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:52,070
Your shoulder is really twisted and you have an infection.

300
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,190
You probably have a hard time doing daily activities.

301
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,980
Well, so-so.

302
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,890
We only did a simple remedial treatment.

303
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:00,520
You will need to receive treatments periodically.

304
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,920
Okay, I understand.

305
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,480
If you're done with the treatment, do you want to have dinner with us?

306
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,920
I have something at home today. Let's have dinner next time.

307
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,490
Okay, thank you for today.

308
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:14,710
Of course.

309
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,270
Thank you.

310
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:33,250

311
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,480
Avoiding him isn't the answer.

312
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,430
Yes, Dad?

313
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:42,650
It's me. There's a welcoming party, so come home early.

314
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,700
- I can't—
  - I'm hanging up.

315
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:07,530
He's so old-fashioned. Why is he doing a welcoming party?

316
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,250
What do I do with Choi Joon Soo?

317
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,660
I can't really go home early.

318
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,770
Noona.

319
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,590
This.

320
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,450
Hyung Kook.

321
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,680
 If you received this note...

322
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,270
- Hey, Jung Eum! 
 - Oh, yes.

323
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,520
Are you coming home from work now?

324
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,200
Here.

325
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,050

326
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:03,800
 You're probably passing by the hair salon, right?

327
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,260
Hey, Jung Eum.

328
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,760
Hello.

329
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,570
Here.

330
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,490
Thank you.

331
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:14,610
♫  For us to meet  ♫

332
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:17,860
 You're hungry, right?

Jung Eum!

349
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,520
 Don't avoid me.

350
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,920
 The feelings that I expressed to you

351
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:41,040
 are giving you a hard time, so I'm really sorry.

352
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:48,840
 I'm not asking you to receive my feelings right away.

353
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:54,250
 But... this is how I feel.

354
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:58,230
 I just want you to know that.

355
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,580
 If you avoid me again,

356
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:11,920
 I will assume that you are accepting my confession.

357

363

You're thirsty, right?

Hello.

366
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,330
I'm Kang Hoon Nam, who will be living here, starting today.

367
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:46,860

368
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,790
 It's clear and pretty but

369
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:55,490
 if you lower your guard for a even moment, it can easily break from a small mistake.

370
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:59,330
 Dating is like glass.

♫  I think about you all day  ♫

374
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,190

 You're surprised, right?

378
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,060
 How did this happen?

379
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:20,830
 You're cute.

380
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,820
 Go out, I'll take care of this here.
