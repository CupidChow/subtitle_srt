1
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,370
Are you... Kang Hoon Nam?

2
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,320
Are you the relationship expert Yook Ryong was talking about?

3
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,180
You're the one who said it's okay to date many women at the same time— What, what?!

4
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,330
Hey! Buy some time!

5
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,180
- Aunt!
 - Madam!

6
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,930
Charles, what are you doing here?

7
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,100
And you, Yook Ryong, why are you still at work?

8
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,300
- The thing is...
 - The thing is... Uh...

9
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,150
- Where is Hoon Nam? 
 - Aunt!

10
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,380
That's why— You know there is— I mean ...

11
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,970
That's how... Because...

12
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,470
Over there! There's a firefly!

13
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,320
A firefly? Where?

14
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,920
- There! 
- There!

15
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,140
- Where? 
 - There!

16
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,530
- There! There! 
 - Oh, there! 
- But... where?

17
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,560
There are so many!

18
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,450
Ouch! Ouch!

19
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,500
It hurts, it hurts! Let me go!

20
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:49,690

21
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,680
Are you okay?

22
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,690
You're not hurt anywhere?

23
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:05,230
Don't move and wait right here. Take your shoes off, though.

24
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:14,010
♫  Lately I'm curious about you  ♫

25
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,340
Oh! What is this?

26
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,290
♫  In my head I become your other half  ♫

27
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:28,160
♫  I hastily imagine it  ♫

28
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:33,790
♫  Slowly, slowly  ♫

29
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,910
♫  May I knock on your door  ♫

30
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:45,400
♫  oh slowly slowly  ♫

31
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,610
It's too dry. It doesn't feel like a person lives here.

32
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,870
What is all this?

33
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,960
What are you two scheming, anyway? There are no fireflies!

34
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,100
Where is Hoon Nam?

35
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,480
 You came?

36
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,150
- Oh, yes, were you inside? 
 - Yes.

37
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,700
You two, be careful.

38
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,460
Let's go inside.

39
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,780
Be careful.

40
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,250
How is it?

41
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,580
It's just how I like it.

42
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,390
Don't be so smooth all the time.

43
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:29,970
I can't help it when I see a cool woman.

44
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,960
You're silly.

45
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,460
Since you're busy, I'll get to the point.

46
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,830
- You have CCTV, right? 
 - What?

47
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:49,320
I know that Kang Jung Do and that woman were hiding here.

48
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,850
- Mother.
 - I want a divorce.

49
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:57,220
If a man and a woman have spent over thirty years together,

50
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,180
it's about time to end it.

51
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:05,480
We'll get divorced as soon as the campaign ends. Keep that in mind.

52
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,940
It's not like this is his first time doing something like this, so why are you like this?

53
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,120
It doesn't have to do with this incident.

54
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,820
It's something I've been planning for a long time.

55
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,340
It just so happens that now is the right time.

56
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,520
What will happen will happen.

57
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,560
And you have to know when to let it happen.

58
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,550
I have no regrets.

59
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,270
That's all for today. I'll get going.

60
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,300
Go back inside.

61
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,290
I'll go inside after I see you off.

62
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,850
It's quiet at night, since we're not in the city.

63
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,820
It would've been nice if there had actually been fireflies.

64
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,960
I'll get going.

65
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,080
Why are you guys being treated so special?

66
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,200
Oh! I have the Tin Man doll from this set.

67
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,420
But the Tin Man is the only one missing here.

68
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,700
Hey, you guys are awesome!

69
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:50,180
Toys naturally get thrown out once the owner grows up.

70
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,430
You'll cry a lot, but the toy fairy will be called up your tears

71
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,540
to turn you into real humans.

72
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,330
They're already real to me. Stop talking to them.

73
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,890
Did you already forget about the Han River incident? I thought we agreed for you to not show up in front of me ever again.

74
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,790
I didn't agree that you could talk informally to me.

75
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,650
I learned that you're much younger than me at the police department.

76
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:25,070
If you don't like my informal way of talking, you shouldn't have appeared in front of me, as per our agreement.

77
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:30,370
But the fact that you're the real columnist behind Hoon Nam Jung Eum changes everything.

78
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,830
What are you talking about?

79
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:36,640
Yook Ryong, who was the cause of the Han River incident

80
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,410
told me the hidden person who's the real cause of the incident has the the identity of the writer of Hoon Nam Jung Eum.

81
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,230
Why? Why is the columnist writing the column secretly? It's very suspicious.

82
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,410
About that... Charlie had a situation—

83
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,920
So you didn't have a situation?

84
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,500
After attempting to murder me, are you trying to threaten me as well?

85
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,310
No, I'm not saying I did anything great but

86
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,530
I'm not saying that I'm threatening you.

87
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,270
I would just like your cooperation.

88
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,050
Cooperation? What can I help you with?

89
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,640
The thing is...

90
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,920
Tell me.

91
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,610
Actually, I am a couple manager. You know what a couple manager is?

92
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,500
Continue.

93
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:25,100
But Yook Ryong kind of made a mess of things. You know, the Han River incident?

94
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:25,820
I know.

95
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:31,690
Because of that, I've been demoted and am now in charge of a group of undateable members, legendary for

96
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,330
their inability to ever get a date, called the "Zero Members."

97
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,220
- So?
 - I need to find someone,

98
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,100
an expert who can help the Zero Members. And Yook Ryong said

99
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,280
that his cousin is the real columnist behind Hoon Nam Jung Eum and a relationship expert.

100
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,400
He also said that he is the result of the work of that relationship expert.

101
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,400
Okay. Let me try to process what you just said.

102
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,370
We both unintentionally hurt each other.

103
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,490
Right.

104
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:10,050
And we both know that there's no end to this battle because we both have legitimate claims against each other.

105
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,630
Right.

106
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,590
That's why we can't report or threaten each other.

107
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,330
Right.

108
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:20,820
That means that the only option you have left is for me to cooperate with you.

109
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,050
Right again!

110
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:26,380
But I'm not interested in helping you at all.

111
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,710
Leave.

112
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,580
Don't be like that!

113
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:44,880
Mr. Expert, could you reconsider your decision at all?

114
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,640
What are the odds? Is this just some coincidence? Don't you think we met each other again because it was meant to be?

115
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,990
I don't want to hear more of your ridiculous theory. Please leave.

116
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm not asking for your help in exchange for nothing.

117
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,380
If you like, I can give you a 50% discount on a membership.

118
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,860
- I'm too tired for this, I want to rest. 
 - Whoa!

119
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:12,490
Or I can even let you go out on twice as many dates!

120
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:16,140
Could you think about it more carefully!?

121
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,320
Is it really that big of a deal to help me a little bit!?

122
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:25,360
I... told you that I want to rest.

123
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,450
Whether you're here or not,

124
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:35,980
I'm going to take a shower, and... and... rest.

125
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,310
I said I'm going to rest.

126
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,480
I'm going to rest.

127
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,400
Oh! I got it, I got it!

128
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,850
I'll leave. You can rest. Let me just grab my shoes.

129
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,320
Rest now. Bye!

130
00:11:55,610 --> 00:12:00,850
What a strange woman.

131
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:05,390
He's not that easy.

132
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:10,140
But... did I just volunteer to leave? What?

133
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,600
You're pretty good.

134
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,290
"I will be back"?

135
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,530
My aunt will flip out if she finds out that he has a woman.

136
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:37,600
She's particularly sensitive about that kind of issue.

137
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,060
Why is she so sensitive, by the way?

138
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,950
Hoon Nam's family is known for womanizing.

139
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:49,280
There's at least one cheater in each generation and that's my uncle.

140
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:54,960
I have three grandmothers. After my grandfather died, they started living together as if they were sisters.

141
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,730
I thought I was watching a movie or something.

142
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:02,850
And the son who inherited that quality was born a relationship expert.

143
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,660
That's Hoon Nam, right?

144
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,600
Yeah.

145
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,800
I'm really jealous, but I don't think he likes the fact that he's like that. He doesn't date at all.

146
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,840
I guess he's kind of like a vampire who refuses to drink blood.

147
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:21,290
By the way, when did you notice that he has this sort of talent?

148
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:24,020
He doesn't normally show it.

149
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,000
When we were in the army together.

150
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,260
In the army?

151
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:34,860
You know how the army is filled with the brokenhearted? Hoon Nam saved a lot of them.

152
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,740
This is getting too hard.

153
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,360
Hey, until when are we going to keep us dating a secret?

154
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,870
I'll tell him today. I have to.

155
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,550
Poor Cho Sung. What can you do, though?

156
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,050
Tae Hee! Min Sang!

157
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,060
- Cho Sung! 
 - Cho Sung.

158
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,940
Sir!

159
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,050
My girlfriend and best friend came to visit me.

160
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,560
Sir!

161
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,100
Thanks for coming all the way here.

162
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,960
It wasn't that difficult, because we drove in Min Sang's car.

163
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,660
Min Sang, really, thank you so much.

164
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:30,030
It's so nice of you to drive her here all the time. Thanks to you, I can rest easy.

165
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:33,570
It's a sports car. It's pretty fast.

166
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:39,170
What should we do with poor Cho Sung?

167
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:45,390
It's such a long drive here, it's hard to bring things like food, right?

168
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:49,100
It's likely to go bad on the way here. Hold on just a second.

169
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:08,760
I know that Tae Hee loves dumplings. These are amazing. You can't get these anywhere else.

170
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,370
I'm on a diet these days.

171
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:20,220
What for? You already look so good. Min Sang, do you want some?

172
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,770
I only drink sparkling water.

173
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,370
Doesn't that girl look totally different from her pictures?

174
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,300
I know, she doesn't look so good in person.

175
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,600
All the other guys' girlfriends are so beautiful.

176
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,720
I'd find it kind of embarrassing to drive a sports car with her in it.

177
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:45,390
Oh, I forgot. I have a memorial service to attend today.

178
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:49,980
Tae Hee, why don't you take a bus at Gangneung Station? I'll get going now.

179
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,670
Min Sang, Min Sang!

180
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:04,670
Sergeant Kang, Sergeant Park, I thought you were good people. I'm disappointed.

181
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,520
You look down on people for their looks.

182
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,800
- Do you call this a mutiny?
 - Mhm.

183
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,920
Do you want to go to the brig?

184
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,110
To me, my Tae Hee is way prettier than Kim Tae Hee!

185
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:17,600
You bastard, go play with Tae Hee before you get your a** kicked, okay?

186
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,310
Go play.

187
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,880
Do you like the dumplings?

188
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:41,350
 He sacrificed himself to make his subordinate look good.

189
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,290
 Another time,

190
00:16:55,030 --> 00:17:01,760
- What's wrong with him?
 - His girlfriend married some other guy last week. He's still not over her.

191
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,420
Guys! Sergeant Kang is treating you to fried chicken today!

192
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:18,340
 Thank you!

193
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,500
Eat it.

194
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,160
Open your mouth.

195
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,260
What are you doing right now?

196
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:32,300
Can't you tell that he's heartbroken? Why would he want to eat anything right now?

197
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,540
You're cruel, aren't you?

198
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,950
After spring,

199
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,260
there's a hotter summer waiting for you.

200
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,290
Forgetting is also loving.

201
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:24,810
 That day, I came to the realization

202
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,630
 that he had the talent of a devil.

203
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,300
How nice!

204
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,390
Where did Jung Eum go this late at night?

205
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,670
She's trying to persuade a relationship expert.

206
00:18:54,670 --> 00:19:00,240
A relationship expert? That's a real job?

207
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,650
You can set people up, but afterwards, whether they date or not

208
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,240
is not something that can be solved by someone butting in.

209
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,300
Is that so?

210
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:12,050
Of course! It's a waste of time!

211
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,600
- Tell Jung Eum to just lay the groundwork and then to step out of it.
 - Yes.

212
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,000
What kind of nonsense...

213
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,400
Sir, by the way...

214
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,300
Why? Do you want to eat some more?

215
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,200
No, this is plenty already.

216
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,280
The thing is...

217
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,200
Where are you going to go if you have to move?

218
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,000
I don't know.

219
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,600
I took out all the loans already.

220
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,800
If I'm compensated, I could probably move to some suburb near Seoul.

221
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,340
I just don't want to leave this house.

222
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,600
I'll stay as long as I can, then maybe I'll move back home.

223
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,700
I'm worried about Jung Eum, too.

224
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,600
Don't worry about Jung Eum—

225
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,700
I'm thirsty.

226
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,400
What do you need if you want to negotiate something?

227
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,400
- Leads? 
 - What?

228
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,000
Bait.

229
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,300
You're so smart!

230
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,400
Why is she acting like a puppy that needs to poop?

231
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,200
Bait. Bait.

232
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,800
What kind of bait would work on him?

233
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,400
Money? I don't have any...

234
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,200
A woman?

235
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,400
No, I'm sure he already has many.

236
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,200
Money, women...

237
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,900
and... what else?

238
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,000
 Jung Eum! Go get some makgeolli!

239
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,600
 No, I'll go get some.

240
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,800
 You're a doctor. Jung Eum! Go get some makgeolli!

241
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,000
What does being a doctor have to do with it?

242
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,800
 I have the Tin Man doll from this set!

243
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,500
 But the Tin Man is the only one missing here.

244
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,400
It must be somewhere around here. I remember seeing it when I was putting the winter clothes away.

245
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,200
I found it!

246
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,100
But... would this work?

247
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,400
I'll throw it in for now.

248
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,600
 A town that was submerged underwater after a dam was created due to extreme draught

249
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,800
 is revealing itself again after twenty-five years.

250
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,800
 In 1992, a dam was created in order to supply water to the surrounding area,

251
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,800
 and the town where hundreds of former residents lived disappeared under the water.

252
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,200
 The construction was disrupted a few times due to complaints from the residents,

253
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,000
 but the government forced...

254
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,200
 I'll give you one limb every time we match a couple together.

255
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,200
They say that the belly button is bigger than the belly.

256
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,400
How many hamburgers did you order just to get a doll?

257
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,200
- It's because we won't be able get them anymore when we move. 
 - That's not true.

258
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,400
That neighborhood also sells the same stuff.

259
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,200
- Really?
 - Of course. Let's go have a look sometime.

260
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,700
- Does that sound good?
 - Mhm.

261
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,600
It's almost time.

262
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,300
Let's take the rest of these with us. Don't forget your dolls.

263
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
What should I do?

264
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,600
Give them to me, I'll put them in my bag.

265
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,500
No.

266
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,800
I'll give them back to you later. You can't even carry all of them on your own.

267
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,000
I'll just give you one then.

268
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,800
Don't forget to give it back to me.

269
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,400
- Okay?
 - Okay.

270
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,600
Dorothy and Toto are the main characters.

271
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,700
Not the wizard or the witch...

272
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:56,000
The lion, scarecrow, and the tin man.

273
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,100
I can't choose. Which one should I give mom?

274
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,000
I'm just carrying it for you. What are you so worried about?

275
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,600
Go on then, give me one.

276
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,200
Then you choose. I can't.

277
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,800
Let's see. The lion?

278
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,600
Not the lion. He's the brave one.

279
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,000
Then.. how about the Scarecrow?

280
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,400
Not the Scarecrow. He's the smart one.

281
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,400
Seriously?

282
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,000
How about the Tin Man then?

283
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,900
Not the Tin Man either.

284
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,900
He's...

285
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,400
He's the heart. What does the heart do?

286
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:36,800
Think about that later. Give it to me, please.

287
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,600
You have to keep it safe and give it back to me later, okay?

288
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,900
Don't worry. Let's go. We'll be late.

289
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,600
 They say that if you're supposed to meet someone, you'll meet them eventually.

290
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:59,000
 And whatever will happen, will happen as well.

291
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,800
 If neither life nor love can't escape their destiny...

292
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,800
 Send me the profile information of the Zero Members.

293
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,100
He took the bait!

294
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,200
 ...coincidence might be the only chance

295
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,800
 that allows you stray away from destiny.

296
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,000

297
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,400
 Yoo Jung Eum. 105B.

298
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,900
 Fighting!

299
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,200
 Go Jung Eum!

300
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,200
 Mom is watching you, too!

301
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,300
 Just do it the way you normally do!

302
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,400
Yes, Team Leader.

303
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,800
 Where are you? Did you forget about the wedding today?

304
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:54,380
No way. I'll be right there!

305
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,200
♫  I need love  ♫

306
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,200
♫  I can't lose you, oh no  ♫

307
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,600
You scared me!

308
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,300
I'll just take this and quietly leave, okay?

309
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:20,200
Sleep tight, Joon Soo! Go back to sleep.

310
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,800
♫  When the sound of morning comes  ♫

311
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,600
♫  You greet me good morning  ♫

312
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,200
♫  I don't know if I'll be excited  ♫

313
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,800
♫  from a sweet kiss  ♫

314
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,800
♫  By chance  ♫

315
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,300
Are you leaving? Do you have your phone with you?

316
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:50,600
♫  I want to tell someone
