1
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,020
Hold on.

2
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,930
What do you mean Soo Ji is at your place?

3
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,600
You're also at Jung Eum's place, too.

4
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,740
I've been renting a room at her place for a long time.

5
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,710
She's also someone I've known for a long time.

6
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,420
Even if you've known her for a long time, you don't let just anyone stay at your house.

7
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,310
Even a friend renting a room isn't this nosy.

8
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,940
Kang Hoon Nam.

9
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,280
Let's...

10
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,550
break up.

11
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,080
I'll be leaving first.

12
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,800

13
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,540
Jung Eum.

14
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,130
- Why are you doing this?
 - Isn't this a bet?

15
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,400
Isn't dating me a bet?

16
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,570
You came to my house to seduce me.

17
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,760
Is it true?

18
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,540
Am I right?

19
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,980
It is true.

20
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,560
So...

21
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,160
that's why you asked me out.

22
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,750
You've seduced me,

23
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,020
so is dumping me what's left?

24
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,880
Jung Eum, that's not it—

25
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,980
I didn't know.

26
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,650
I...

27
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,400
I... I really liked you.

28
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,960
- It was a good meal. 
 - I brought you here, so it's my treat.

29
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,490
I thought you'd chase after them right away.

30
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,130
I think it should be a conversation between the two of them.

31
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,140
I felt like this before, but you're a cool person.

32
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,870
I felt it before, but you know how to read a person.

33
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,570
Reading a person...

34
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,070
Someone I know needs that ability, too.

35
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,090
You're a cool and nice guy, but

36
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,430
even after you hear this, will you stay a nice guy?

37
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,820
It was a bet.

38
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,390
Those two that just walked out... everything from going out to breaking up,

39
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,630
it was all a bet Hoon Nam had made with his cousin.

40
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,890
 Really? I decided to go out with Jung Eum yesterday.

41
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,670
 Jung Eum is more innocent than she looks. She's also gullible.

42
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,920
 That's something you should say to a person who is determined to deceive her.

43
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,660
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,360
Was this really

45
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,290
just a bet?

46
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,960
Tell me that it's not. Please, just tell me that it's not.

47
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,090
I'll fall for it. Just lie to me, okay?

48
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,340
 You want to make a bet? I'll seduce her and then break up with her.

49
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,620
 I'll give you a blank contract.

50
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,580
 A blank contract?

51
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,830
It was a bet.

52
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,080
I've done wrong.

53
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:39,520
Jung Eum, but what happened was—

54
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,960
I told you to enjoy your thrills somewhere else, right?

55
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:53,090
I told you that she's gullible and cries easily. I told you to leave this innocent girl alone.

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,030
Don't ever

57
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,760
appear in front of Jung Eum again.

58
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,130
Joon Soo.

59
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,050
Joon Soo!

60
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,730
Let's go.

61
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:44,040
♫  Even if I try to hide it  ♫

62
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:50,550
♫  It shows   ♫ 
 ♫  I can't hide my heart  ♫

63
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:57,100
♫  Am I the only one in love?  ♫

64
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:07,080
♫  Truthfully, I'm afraid you aren't  ♫

65
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:14,220
♫  Why did I realize only now?  ♫

66
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:21,200
♫  I really believed that I wasn't  ♫

67
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:28,010
♫  I thought I wouldn't ever say I'm in love  ♫

68
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:35,400
♫  I was confident, but why am I like this  ♫

69
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:41,350
♫  A day flies by when I think of you  ♫

70
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:51,030
♫  I can't make any excuses  ♫ 
 ♫  I always miss you  ♫

71
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:59,320
♫  I can't do anything anymore  ♫ 
 ♫  Without you  ♫

72
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:06,800
♫  Those words I've never said  ♫ 
 ♫  The words I can't say without you  ♫

73
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:14,080
♫  I love you more than me  ♫

74
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:21,130
♫  With what words should I love you more  ♫

75
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:28,240
♫  I can't express it more, a fool like me  ♫

76
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:36,940
♫  Since it's the first time, I'm clumsy and awkward  ♫

77
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:48,270
♫  Nothing else has meaning to me  ♫ 
 ♫  If not you  ♫

78
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:25,330
 I won't avoid this by saying that I'm sorry.

79
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:30,820
 The start was wrong, but my final destination is you.

80
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,670
 I'm going back to the starting line,

81
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:38,800
 but I'll be sure to come back and the promise I made to see the plums...

82
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,520
 I'll keep that promise for sure.

83
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,090
Will you be late today?

84
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:02,200
I'm not sure, I have to see. Why?

85
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,400
Just asking. Let's eat something delicious.

86
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,990
I'm leaving.

87
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,440
Don't be hurt.

88
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:37,700
♫  Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain  ♫

89
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,230
You came?

90
00:09:53,930 --> 00:10:00,690
♫  Sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet   ♫

91
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,200

92
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,140
A blank contract...

93
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,690
But, President, this...

94
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,760
Wasn't this a bet you were winning?

95
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,830
I lost.

96
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:24,570
You're dead if you use this recklessly. Be sure to get my approval beforehand.

97
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,530
Why did he give it to me if he wants me to get his approval?

98
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,270
Does he like her?

99
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,290
Yes, I know. Yes. Yes, yes...

100
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,910
But, CEO...

101
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:19,250
Yoo Jung Eum is an employee that has been with us through all of our hardships at this company.

102
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,390
The time limit you promised hasn't even passed yet

103
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,520
What about monitoring her for a little longer?

104
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,410
She works herself to the ground trying to figure out the Zero Members—

105
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:39,570
I don't want to be a team leader who can't even take care of an employee who's been working hard for this company.

106
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,660
I will take responsibility for her.

107
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,740
Oh, god! You surprised me.

108
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,160
It's because of me, right?

109
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:07,600
Oh! Of course not.

110
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,650
It's not because of you.

111
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,750
I heard everything.

112
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,200
How many do you need?

113
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:19,840
The Zero Members... how many of them do I need to take care of

114
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,860
so that you don't have to take responsibility in my place?

115
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,680
Oh Doo Ri is the most important case, right?

116
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,380
Hey.

117
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,670
Don't get stressed, okay?

118
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,900
It's over once we quit.

119
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,480
I want to rest now, too.

120
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,110
What do you mean rest? Huh? You said you had to make money.

121
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,770
I'll take care of it.

122
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,420
Just endure a little longer.

123
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,910
Well, I'll make sure the Zero Members get resolved any way I can.

124
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:57,630
And I'll find Kim So Eul and make Oh Doo Ri's case work out.

125
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:02,550
Even if we have to quit, we should be able to quit with our heads up confidently.

126
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:06,940
That leopard patterned jacket... you should be able to throw it down confidently.

127
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,400
I'll make sure they work out. I will.

128
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,480
Oh, Jo Seok, where are you right now?

129
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,160
Ulleungdo?

130
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,180
You lost him again?

131
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,750
Okay, call me when you find him.

132
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,010
Okay.

133
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:53,330
 Cracorn, did you get to work okay? What should we do about Na Ga Young?

134
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:24,140
- Yook Ryong!
 -  Yes?

135
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,720
Yes, CEO.

136
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,450
Come, sit here.

137
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,010
Did you find Kim So Eul?

138
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,590
Well, not yet...

139
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,330
I want to see him so can you please hurry and find him?

140
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,140
Kim So Eul?

141
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,450
Yes.

142
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,550
I'm going crazy because I want to see him.

143
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,300
Hurry and find him.

144
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,710
 Happy birthday... to you...

145
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:39,060
♪  Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you  ♪

146
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,090

147
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,670
 - Oppa, what are you doing? 
 - Why don't you come?

148
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:47,090
 Oppa, let's go see the performance. Let's go.

149
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,930
 - Wait. 
 - Who's this ahjumma?

150
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,990
Yang Sun Hee...

151
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,260
What's with you?

152
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:20,570
 Leave tonight free. There's something important I want to say.

153
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:24,540
What important thing does she want to say?

154
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,150
The girls took the time to pick out a pretty one for me.

155
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,540
I won't even have a reason to wear it.

156
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,240

157
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,260
Okay.

158
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:29,050
Let me be the one to start and end it.

159
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,000

160
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,970

161
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,870
Am I disturbing you?

162
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,250
What brings you here?

163
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,860
Can we drink a cup of coffee?

164
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,280
I heard that you left that house.

165
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,590
- Who told you that? 
 - Is it important who told me?

166
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,150
It's important that you left.

167
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,190
I'll be returning.

168
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:00,590
Don't do that, I went home.

169
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,720
You can come here.

170
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,990
I saw your note.

171
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,480
How does it feel to be dumped for the first time in your life?

172
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,840
This must be your first time ever.

173
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,810
This is just a period of time for us to think.

174
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:21,240
The longer that period of time for thinking becomes,

175
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,620
the bigger the empty space becomes.

176
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,500
Some couples become stronger when that period of time is longer.

177
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,980
For example, what kind of a couple?

178
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:36,470
That couple... they seemed pretty strong.

179
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:46,560
 Don't you ever appear in front of Jung Eum again!

180
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,050
 Let's go.

181
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:55,600
Why drag him into this to complicate things?

182
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,890
It's not like you.

183
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,820
Is this some kind of a line from an old drama?

184
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:05,430
Anyway, I changed my personality to something that isn't me.

185
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:11,440
My dad... is sick.

186
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,220
Severely?

187
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,920
I think so.

188
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:22,600
I was nervous because my dad was so quiet for a while.

189
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,410
I went home and saw that he was really sick and I didn't know about it.

190
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:31,370
When I saw my dad, who used to be angry all the time, just lying down,

191
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,690
I felt really bad.

192
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,380
But he grabbed my hand

193
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,570
and said that he's accomplished everything

194
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,230
except for one thing.

195
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,070
That's right, you still have to get married.

196
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,870
So, I've decided to.

197
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,470
That's great.

198
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:55,140
But if I'm getting married, I want to marry someone who I want.

199
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,830
Let's get married.

200
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,440
Me?

201
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,420
Yes.

202
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:07,870
It's tough to find someone who matches my background, looks, and level.

203
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:12,280
How about matching in feelings? There's a huge difference there.

204
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,750
That difference, we can lessen it.

205
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,830
When all other conditions match,

206
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,330
it's too soon to give up just because one of them doesn't align.

207
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,530
Stop messing around.

208
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,810
I'm being serious.

209
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,210
Uh, President...

210
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,200
I have something important to report to you.

211
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,500
I'll end it here for today.

212
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,010
I think I've declared war officially.

213
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:49,820
Don't take it any further tomorrow. I'll ignore your declaration of war.

214
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,220
I'm fine, as long as you heard me.

215
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,150
See you tomorrow.

216
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,030
What?

217
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:11,720
Can I be off...?

218
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,930
Did you ever go home with my permission before?

219
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:16,700
What I want to report to you is...

220
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,040
Whoa...

221
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:55,590
Actually, I really wanted to come here at least once.

222
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:59,320
♫  How you would think  ♫

223
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,900
With you.

224
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,790
Like this.

225
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,420
Of course.

226
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:11,170
Noona, let's do whatever you want today. Everything.

227
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:16,260
Okay. Let's do that.

228
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,780
Catch me if you can!

229
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,410
Hey!

230
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,440
You'll fall down!

231
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,540
Seriously!

232
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:33,030
♫  Because I had to find you  ♫

233
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,920
Are you okay? Does it hurt a lot?

234
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,490
You should be careful!

235
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,740
Oh, seriously!

236
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,150
What are you doing? Stop playing around.

237
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,510
Such a rascal...

238
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,980
Here.

239
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,060
Thanks.

240
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,520
I'll take a photo.

241
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,760
What the heck?

242
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:13,390
♫  To make you incomparably happy  ♫

243
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:20,550
♫  I have to protect you like that  ♫

244
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,610
♫  I thought I was protecting you  ♫

245
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:28,460
♫  I thought I was protecting you  ♫

246
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,070
♫  I was young then  ♫

247
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:36,580
♫  That you were the one protecting me  ♫

248
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:45,200
♫  I understand now that it was because of you  ♫

249
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,870
Oh? Why are you getting out?

250
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,650
Not tonight.

251
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,670
When we were having fun at the gallery...

252
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:09,190
I don't know how President found out—

253
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,670
Thanks for everything until now.

254
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:27,220
It's been exactly a month for us.

255
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,150
Now...

256
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,050
let's end it.

257
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,960
I don't have to be too cautious anymore.

258
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:33,490
I can meet Kyung Seon and Sun Ah...

259
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,650
What's wrong with me?

260
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,720
Real-time tip...

261
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,090

262
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,440

263
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,680

264
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,800
No one can. Right...

265
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,120
No one can resist cuteness, indeed.

266
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:28,700
Where did you get that karaoke machine?

267
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,290
That? Your father.

268
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:34,760
I guess he's doing a lot of stuff with elders at the city hall because it's election season.

269
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,880
He rented it awhile ago, but he said there's more time on the rental and brought it here.

270
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,770
Are you okay?

271
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:08,750
Did Jook go somewhere?

272
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,680
I was cleaning and noticed that his things were gone.

273
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,220
Ah, he went on a business trip.  A long-term business trip.

274
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,190
I guess you didn't hear about that.

275
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:20,480
So, he took all his things.

276
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,950
You got his rent, right?

277
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,260
Yeah, he's tidy with things like that.

278
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,630
That's good, then.

279
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,680
Father, should we sing another song?

280
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,960
Again? It's okay.

281
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,050
Jung Eum, sing a song.

282
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:36,730
Sing another song? No...

283
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:41,100
Hey, that's a rental. We have to get our money's worth. Sing a song.

284
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:45,940
Really? If so, I'll have to sing another one.

285
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,146
Oh... Yoo Jung Eum's go-to song.

286
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,970
I've been in love.

287
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,230
That son of a b*tch.
