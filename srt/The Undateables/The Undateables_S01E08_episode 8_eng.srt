1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:11,540

2
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,040
Welcome.

3
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,160
Yes, I'm looking for the novel the movie "Face Blind" was based on.

4
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,190
"Face Blind"?

5
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:34,140
Yes, I heard that the movie originated from a novel.

6
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,080
Just a moment.

7
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,850
I don't see the title "Face Blind."

8
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,920
Let me look it up on the internet.

9
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,420
Okay.

10
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,980
It's a story of facial recognition disorder.

11
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,110
Yes, that's right.

12
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,990
But I don't think there's an original novel.

13
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,610
Really? Then is there a book that's similar to that?

14
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:06,080
I know someone who has facial recognition disorder.

15
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,060
Really?

16
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,640
Wait a bit.

17
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:15,640
What do you think of this book?

18
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,400
It's a love story of a man who suffers from facial recognition disorder.

19
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,280
That looks good. I'll take that one.

20
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,520
Okay. Just a moment.

21
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,150
Okay.

22
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,770
It's ₩5,000.

23
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,310
It must be tough to have facial recognition disorder.

24
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,710
Yes, I know.

25
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,370
I met with her to request some of her artwork.

26
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,600
I was wondering if the book would help me understand her, so I want to read it.

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,190
Request artwork? Is she an artist?

28
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,080
She's a chocolatier.

29
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,710
It's a woman who runs a chocolate cafe in this area.

30
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,420
A chocolate cafe in the area...?

31
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,460
Yes, on this street over that way.

32
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,520
That lady suffers from facial recognition disorder?

33
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,120
Yes.

34
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:05,020
I see... that's why she's been acting that way.

35
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,400
She never makes eye contact and never says hello.

36
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,940
Do you know her?

37
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,510
Yes. Actually...

38
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,570
I had no idea and I was very hurt.

39
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:32,580
I wished she'd make eye contact in recognition, but she never did that, not even once.

40
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,180
You must've been very disappointed.

41
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,580
But it's okay now that I know her story.

42
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,500
I'm actually happy about it.

43
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,630
If it's not because she doesn't like me, that means I can work on helping her remember me.

44
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,710
That's enough for me. Thank you.

45
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,730
I'm sure she has her own way of remembering.

46
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,290
Yes.

47
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,960
I don't think I'm the one who needs this book.

48
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,900

49
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,530
Thank you.

50
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,530
I'll send you an invitation to my exhibition.

51
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:15,180
You'll come see Ahn In Jeong's work, right?

52
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,760
Did I work too hard this morning?

53
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,270
Grandma, please give me a basketful of fiddleheads.

54
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,700
Bean sprouts, too.

55
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,620
How much is it?

56
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,860
₩5,000, ₩2,000, ₩3,000...

57
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,740

58
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,510
Here. I wish you good business today!

59
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,170
- Enjoy! 
 - Thank you.

60
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:13,230
Hello, Mr. Expert, what is this out of the blue? You're calling me?

61
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,920
I met with Ahn In Jeong this morning.

62
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,710
Seriously?

63
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:19,650
I asked her for a chocolate artwork to display at the opening party for the exhibition.

64
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,650
I spoke with Charlie and asked him to interview her for a special article for the exhibit.

65
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,880
Even an interview article?

66
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,840
 I thought it would help Ahn In Jeong's self esteem.

67
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,600
Ms. Ahn In Jeong is going to be so happy.

68
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,000
I met with the bookstore owner, too, and our conversation went over well. I even invited him to the opening, so the groundwork has all been laid.

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,940
Well, we just have to watch.

70
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,030
Not just the groundwork, you spread a carpet on the floor already.

71
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:42,850
Where are you?

72
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,180
Near my house.

73
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:49,840
Great. Then, let's eat together. I'll go to your area. If you're hungry...

74
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,360
 But I have something important to do today.

75
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,710
I thought I'd be hungry, but why do I have a stomachache?

76
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,230
Sorry, ow, ow..! Sorry, I'm hanging up.

77
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,830
What the heck?

78
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:09,270
How cruel. Why am I so hungry?

79
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,020

80
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,850
Ahjussi, hello.

81
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,340
Hi. Did you go grocery shopping?

82
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,930
Yes. Ahjussi, where are the old-fashioned caramels?

83
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,800
Those? Wait.

84
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,860
I don't come by these often these days, so I keep them separate.

85
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,690
I see.

86
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:48,010
What do we do? I think they're going to discontinue them.

87
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,620
I'm sure they'll be somewhere, if I look.

88
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,610
How much?

89
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,260
Let's bow.

90
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,200
Oh, yeah.

91
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,150
♫  I may think of you someday  ♫

92
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,070
♫  It was cold love  ♫

93
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,890
Your mom

94
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,090
liked it so much, like a kid.

95
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,430
♫  Such a loving memory...  ♫

96
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,760
Let's bow.

97
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,310
♫  The memory...  ♫

98
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,970
♫  I'll never be able to forget  ♫

99
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,590
Mom.

100
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,450
 Mom.

101
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:51,870
 My daughter, where were you?

102
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:55,140
 Mom, what's wrong? Are you sick?

103
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,580
 Dad! What's going on?

104
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,560
 What's wrong with Mom all of a sudden?

105
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,420
 Your mom's been sick for a while.

106
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,280
 Jung Eum...

107
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,780
 Mom. Tell me, Mom...

108
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,030
 I'm sorry...

109
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,660
 Mom, Mom...

110
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,990
 When I'm gone...

111
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,390
 don't get sick.

112
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,820
 Mom, what are you saying?

113
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,190
 Be strong...

114
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,090
 Mom.

115
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,860
 Live your life looking straight ahead.

116
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:43,440
 Mom... What's wrong with Mom? Huh?

117
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,300
 Mom...

118
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,410
 Mom.

119
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,880
 Jung Eum's Mom. Jung Eum's Mom!

120
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,850
 Mom, Mom! What to do? Mom!

121
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:01,780
 Mom. Mom! Dad! What do  we do...?

122
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,380
 Mom! What do we do? Mom!

123
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:09,550
 Mom. I'm sorry, Mom. I'm sorry, Mom...

124
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,280
 Mom!

125
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,560
Don't get sick and be strong.

126
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,230
Look straight ahead...

127
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,200
Coffee tastes better when I steal it.

128
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,620
She hogs all these. They're not even good for you.

129
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,530
Team Leader!

130
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,340
Just ask me to buy you some. I'll buy you coffee.

131
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:20,630
What a bluff. She doesn't even have any money. You just eat less!

132
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,140
Hey, what's going on with Oh Doo Ri?

133
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:33,510
Who's the male member that Oh Doo Ri is looking for? She keeps looking for him.

134
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,680
About that...

135
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,830
Actually, it's member Kim So Eul.

136
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,980
Kim So Eul?

137
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,730
Kim So Eul, the bald man who went out to the countryside to farm?

138
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,000
Yes.

139
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,650
Oh Doo Ri likes that type?

140
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,560
I mean... what happened was—

141
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,380
That can happen. That can happen.

142
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:57,730
Oh Doo Ri used to fall for tacky Korean language teachers in the past.

143
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,830
That teacher's nickname was Sweet Potato.

144
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:04,610
Gosh, she used to be the only one who thought he looked like Chow Yun Fat or whatever.

145
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:09,280
Anyway, her taste was unique, even back then.

146
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,570
Yoo Jung Eum.

147
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,720
Hm?

148
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,070
You're not dead yet, huh? You've got some life in you! Some life!

149
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,500
Opening party?

150
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,230
- A party? 
 - Ms. Oh Doo Ri is having an exhibit.

151
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,840
Look at you! You should tell me about things like this first.

152
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,670
I'm not just attending, I'm going for a Zero Member.

153
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:36,330
What do you mean? I'm going to take Kim So Eul with me, too.

154
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,570
Kim So Eul?

155
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,310
Work.

156
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,420
I don't think Kim So Eul is the party type.

157
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,970
 Let's go get some vegetable pancakes.

158
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:58,560
If you want to win over others, you must know the pain that others feel!

159
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,200
The one who want to live tomorrow will get killed by the one who want to survive today!

160
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,920
Run as if you're going to die!

161
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,600
Let's go! Think of people you don't like!

162
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,340
Last lap!

163
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:19,200
One, two, one, two! It's the last lap! Stay strong! One, two!

164
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,180
 Good job.

165
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,510
 Thank you!

166
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:25,340
- You, too. Wear different a pair next time ! 
 - Yes!

167
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,390
Jung Eum! When did you come?

168
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:32,200
Just now. You're still the same. Running with them to the end.

169
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,050
Gosh, it's not what it used to be. It's harder today.

170
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,680
Faking it.

171
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,610
Let's go. Let's have some vegetable pancakes with rice wine.

172
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,420
Oh! So hungry!

173
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,010
How long has it been?

174
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,940
I know.

175
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,500
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

176
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,690
There, oh...

177
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:08,520
- Do you remember? You sold vegetable pancakes every year at the yearly school festival and were such a hit.
 - Did I?

178
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,990
You used to buy air pump running shoes for Hoo Bin with the money you made from vegetable pancakes.

179
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,930
That moron. I don't know why I liked him enough to give him so much.

180
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,210
I know.

181
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:24,460
But I still had fun. I ran out of ingredients one time, so I took some grass from the lawn...

182
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,100
You crazy b****!

183
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,990
You said you were going to open up a vegetable pancake place.

184
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,490
- I did? 
 - That's right!

185
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,440
You only remember what's good for you.

186
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,530
People are all like that. If not, we'd be computers.

187
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,280
You can't live remembering everything because it would cause so much agony.

188
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:45,670
The memory fades over time and changes at times so that you can live well. Only the things that are meant to remain stay.

189
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:49,870
Aigoo, here's a philosopher.

190
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:54,790
Right. You're right. Let's forget everything and drink up.

191
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,430
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

192
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,020
So, are things going well with that expert?

193
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:08,950
Well, I'm trying to work with him. He's not as much of a lowlife as I thought he'd be.

194
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:14,120
- A lowlife? 
 - There was something that was twisted between us before.

195
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,610
- You know about it, too, Coach. 
 - I do?

196
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:21,400
You know, the man you rescued from the Han River.

197
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,660
Oh, my... it's meant to be.

198
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,740
It's not like that.

199
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,300
The one who I rescued is Yook Ryong's cousin?

200
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,750
As expected, Yook Ryong and I are meant to be.

201
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,490
Jung Eum, while we're at it...

202
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,850
This.

203
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,300
For me? Why did you do this?

204
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,790
Give this to Yook Ryong.

205
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,640
He didn't look too good last time I saw him.

206
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,240
Could you give it to him in my place?

207
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,540
I don't want to.

208
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,680
- You don't want to? 
 - Just give it to him yourself.

209
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,690
Hey, girl! Why would I ask you if I could do that myself?

210
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,000
In a short while,

211
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,170
there's going to be a gallery opening party. Go with me then.

212
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,160
Party?

213
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,570
So, give it to him in person, acting as if you're bumping into him.

214
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:17,150
Jung Eum... thanks.

215
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,150
Don't mention it. It's all my fault.

216
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,800
- But... 
 - Now what?

217
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,440
What should I wear?

218
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,890
I only own track suits. I can't go looking shabby when I'm going to see Yook Ryong.

219
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:32,230
Hey, have you ever been to a party?

220
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,470
What about makeup? Hair? Shoes? Hey!

221
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:41,570
I got fat, huh? Did I gain too much weight? I shouldn't have drunk so much at night. I had no idea I'd get to see him out of the blue.

222
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:47,810
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Just a moment. I think there's a fashionable person I can ask for help.

223
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,550
- There is? 
 - There is, but

224
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,250
I don't think he'll help.

225
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:57,530
Ask him for help! Please! Just this once. Yoo Jung Eum.

226
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,640
Alright, alright!

227
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:04,980
I will ask, but... don't expect anything.

228
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,000
Got it.

229
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,660
Right. C'mon.

230
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:14,330
Come on, you gotta go for it! Luca! Luca!

231
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,160
What's going on?

232
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,140
Hey, Yoo Jung Eum,

233
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,540
you always call me when I'm playing, never when I'm working.

234
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,660
Must you interrupt my precious play time?

235
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,240
Party?

236
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,060
What? Is it a game?

237
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,540
A real party?

238
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:38,030
Why would you go to a place like that?

239
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:42,210
Yeah. I see. No. I don't want to.

240
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,000
Don't want to, don't want to, don't want to! Why would I?

241
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,580
 Because you're my friend. It's not like I have that many friends. If your friend asks you for a favor, you should at least think about it.

242
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,200
All right.

243
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,470
Great.

244
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:02,550
You're doing great. Naturally, like that, like you're on a cloud.

245
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:06,620
I'm a bird. I'm flying, flying. I'm in the sky...

246
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,460
Let's go!

247
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:20,030
Joon Soo. What's going on? You're calling me?

248
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,720
Party?

249
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,290
That's not hard.

250
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:33,300
I'll let you know the salon that my company uses all the time. Tell her to stop by there before she goes to the party.

251
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,120
If she says Charlie told her to go there,

252
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,920
they'll set her up from head to toe. Tell her not to worry about it at all.

253
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:47,380
But you must come, too, Joon Soo. That's my condition.

254
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,630
Night... night duty?

255
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:56,420
Come after. We'll go all night.

256
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:01,750
Let's go! Fight time!

257
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:08,310
♫  Oh love, I love you, Only U, I'm in big trouble   ♫

258
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:11,510
♫  I think about you all day  ♫

259
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:14,790
♫  My heart feels like it'll explode  ♫

260
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:18,090
Congratulations.
 ♫  I can't express it in words  ♫

261
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:21,280
Congratulations.

262
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:27,770
I think that is probably the best way.

263
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:32,990
♫  Maybe in the future, something this good will end?  ♫

264
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,410
♫  Your love, baby, it lets me breathe  ♫

265
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:39,290
♫  It's like a sea breeze for my blocked heart  ♫

266
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:42,410
♫  It's like a sea breeze for my blocked heart  ♫

267
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,850
♫  Your love, could it be this good?  ♫

268
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,580
Hey, how do I look?

269
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:53,000
Let's go.

270
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,780
Let's go.

271
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,810
Oh.

272
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:01,160
Let's go.

273
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,910
♫  I think about you all day, my heart  ♫

274
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:10,740
Thank you for inviting me to the party.

275
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:15,690
♫  I'm falling in love with you forever  ♫

276
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:24,590
It's a totally amazing atmosphere.

277
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:31,020
It's Ahn In Jeong's first time doing an interview, so she'll feel very uncomfortable. Please make her feel at ease.

278
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:35,300
Don't worry about it, sir.

279
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:41,950
Ms. Ahn's artwork is very unusual. I think she's going to become famous very soon.

280
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,990
You have to get control of her right now.

281
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,340
That's why I gave you the interview. So do a good job.

282
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,410
Yes, I'll do a good job.

283
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:55,770
When is Joon Soo coming?

284
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:04,030
- Joon Soo? 
 - Don't you remember?  "The man you want to have JR.com"

285
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:07,840
 Nice to meet you. I'm Choi Joon Soo.

286
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,200
That guy is coming?

287
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,700
Yeah. I invited him.

288
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:22,760
But he did say he'll be running late because he's working the night shift... Yoon Jung!

289
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,620
Your collection for this season was to die for!

290
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:31,220
 I really love it. I'd like to order ten pieces...

291
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:35,200
Oh, hi! Over here!

292
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,540
Wow, this is amazing!

293
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:48,480
I've been to one-hundred-day parties for children, but I've never been to these kinds of parties. It's amazing.

294
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,320
There really is a culture like this that I've only read about in magazines.

295
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,420
You look cute.

296
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,360
I'm kind of a cutie.

297
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,170
Your outfit.

298
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:10,090
- You don't seem like the type of person who'd buy an outfit like this.
 - Wow!

299
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,060
You're psychic.

300
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,030
I'm borrowing this.

301
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,690
Where is Ahn In Jeong?

302
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,980
Over there.

303
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:32,560
This is chocolate. How could she have thought of making this out of chocolate?

304
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,610
It's amazing.

305
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,890
Tae Hee, look at this!

306
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,950
- It's pretty. 
 - Hey.

307
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,990
Doesn't it melt though?

308
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:45,370
I think it would melt.

309
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:13,370
Do you... remember me?

310
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,970
Eucalyptus.

311
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,380
I smell eucalyptus scent,

312
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,380
whenever you come by.

313
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:30,760
You're the one who comes to our store and reads a book every day, right?

314
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,830
Yes.

315
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,650
I'm sorry for saying hello to you so late. I'm Ahn In Jeong.

316
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm Kang Ji Seong.

317
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,470
They're doing a puppet show.

318
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:01,090
Should we go watch it together?

319
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,810
Yes.

320
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:26,440
How could she not recognize such a handsome face?

321
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,260
I'm sure that's why he was attracted to Ahn In Jeong.

322
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,950
She doesn't judge him by his looks like other people do.

323
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:37,280
But still, you helped her remember him in a short amount of time.

324
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:42,080
It may look like it took little time on the surface, but it's something that's been building up gradually.

325
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,460
Just like sedimentary layers.

326
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:47,710
Those two people... I wish them happiness.

327
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:52,500
I think we've done our work here. Shall we get some fresh air?

328
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:05,310
♫  Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on  ♫

329
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:09,380
♫  You got that healing that I want  ♫

330
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,300
- Hi! 
 - Hi!

331
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,410
You look great! I knew it was yours.

332
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:17,360
Thanks. You look pretty, too.

333
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,550
But... what about him?

334
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,950
He's looking around the artwork.

335
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,120
He'll be here soon.

336
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,460
I'm nervous!

337
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:30,960
Oh, my gosh, Hey, he's coming. Coming.

338
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:45,340
Oh Doo Ri.

339
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,260
Hello, I'm Oh Doo Ri.

340
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:06,380
Alright then, have a nice time, you two.

341
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:12,320
I'm farmer Kim So Eul.

342
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,990
Nice to meet you.

343
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,230
Excuse me.

344
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:32,030
How can you be so rude in front of my face?

345
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:36,330
♫  I'm just a sucker  ♫

346
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:39,520
Why is your hand so cold?

347
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,470
You were about to say that your heart is warm, huh?

348
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,040
Just a sec.

349
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,670
It's me.

350
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,050
Sun Hee?

351
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:05,780
That's right. Sun Hee.

352
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,660
Hello.

353
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,810
In actuality, everything in here...

354
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,360
Wait.

355
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,300
I'm late, aren't I? I had to work late.

356
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,950
This is just the beginning. I'll introduce you.

357
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:33,590
Just a moment. I have to go to the restroom. I'll be right back.

358
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,800
Jung Eum will be so surprised when she sees that I'm here.

359
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,350
Shall we talk about us?

360
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:52,580
What will you give me for bringing my first couple together successfully? Which of the body parts?

361
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:56,350
We haven't succeeded for sure yet.

362
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:09,500
It's Ahn In Jeong.

363
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:13,760
She says she's sorry, but that she's cancelling her membership.

364
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,000
I'll give you torso first

365
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,150
so that it will be easier to plug in the arms, legs, and head.

366
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:29,020
Fine. Then, be sure to bring it with you next time we meet.

367
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:33,650
Okay. I'll be sure to give you the torso next time.

368
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,960
But I thought you'd give a more specific tip or something.

369
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,290
For example, right before you kiss

370
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,700
you should use a mouth wash or something.

371
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:54,450
Who wants to smell mouthwash while kissing?

372
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:59,300
But still, isn't it better than a food smell?

373
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:06,330
In the prehistoric days, kissing was used when a man would go out to hunt and come back to check if the woman had eaten the food.

374
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,910
It's an act where he checked her mouth using his tongue.

375
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:18,180
Kissing is like a lie detector that's great for detecting the relationship between a man and woman.

376
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:22,790
- A kiss is? 
 - Yeah.

377
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:26,700
If she really loves me or is she's just doing it out of duty,

378
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,560
or is she seeing another man?

379
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:35,900
You can even find out about the men she used to date before.

380
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:40,850
You can find out a woman's past by kissing her, something like that?

381
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:45,900
People usually can't escape from the boundary of their past.

382
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:51,640
Most of the time, the traces of past relationships can be found when you kiss someone.

383
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,250
Women are especially very passive about the act of kissing.

384
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:00,400
They usually don't know how to kiss in their own way.

385
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:06,230
Don't you think you're too confident?

386
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,920
Not all kisses have to be done that way, but

387
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:17,340
it's a great skill for finding out the other person's ability to be in a relationship, if you want to know.

388
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,280
Aren't you looking down on women too much?

389
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:24,920
Don't look down on men too much, especially a man like me.

390
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:35,560
Then, how is my past experience in dating?

391
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:13,560
♫  I call you, I call you  ♫

392
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:19,770
♫  I call you like this  ♫

393
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:29,030
♫  I'm even scared to sleep and dream  ♫

394
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,160

395
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:36,000
 Dating is a roller-coaster.

396
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:41,590
 You go up and down, turn round and round.

397
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,980
 If you can't stop in the middle...

398
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:53,790
♫  I call you, I call you  ♫

399
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:56,460
 then just enjoy the thrill.

400
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,490
♫  I call you like this  ♫

401
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:06,030
♫  I call you like this  ♫

402
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:14,300
♫  I'm even scared to sleep and dream  ♫

403
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,210

Preview

404
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:18,300
 Yoo Jung Eum, you weren't alone?

405
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,030
 You're the man she wanted to have, right?

406
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,490
 Am I an uninvited guest by any chance?

407
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:25,060
 You kissed, huh?

408
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:30,590
 Please hand that rose to the woman you're going to be with tonight.

409
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,390
 How can I face him?

410
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,860
 I've been waiting for you since this morning. Why did you come so late?

411
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,200
