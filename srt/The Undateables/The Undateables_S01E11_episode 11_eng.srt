1
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,810
 - This is the end of my generosity as a human being.  
- Huh?

2
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,560
It seems that our relationship has come to an end.

3
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,700
Please return now.

4
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,420
♫  I need love, I can't lose you  ♫

5
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,410
♫  Oh no, please don't tell me no  ♫

6
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,780
How can you not know how to ride a bike?

7
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,880
What did you do when you were young?

8
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,540
I'll teach you. You'll learn right away.

9
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,450
You can't let go.

10
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,310
Don't you trust me?

11
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,430
Oh Doo Ri? Where is she going?

12
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,830
Oh Doo Ri! Oh Doo Ri!

13
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,230
Go quickly!

14
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:24,120
♫  When I see you  ♫

15
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,460
Try calling her.

16
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,720
Ah! There's no more battery.

17
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,240
Let's think about it while we drive back to Seoul.

18
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,070
Oh? I don't have my car keys.

19
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,830
Look for them properly!

20
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:42,900
I definitely put them into my pants pocket, but at the potato field earlier...

21
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,910
 - What?
 - It felt different.

22
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:58,030
 Like a big beetle.

23
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,290
Perhaps earlier, that...

24
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,600
That beetle was actually...

25
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,400
- The car keys? 
 - The car keys?

26
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:11,800

27
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,240
- Do you see anything? 
 - No, I don't.

28
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,880
Then sit down and try looking for it or something.

29
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,450
I'm looking with my hawk eyes right now.

30
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,570
It's not going to work. I'm going back to Kim So Eul's house.

31
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:29,810
What? Hawk eyes? You've got to be kidding me.

32
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,100
Is he sleeping?

33
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,530
Already?

34
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,500
We've come.

35
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,460
So Eul. So Eul.

36
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,630
What is this?

37
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,300
 There is no connection worth having.

38
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,410
 I'll need to leave the world temporarily.

39
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,310
 Don't look for me.

40
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,300
Where else could he have gone?

41
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,730
Why did he suddenly...?

42
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,150
I think this was my mistake.

43
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,080
I didn't think about it from his perspective.

44
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,180
I only thought about Oh Doo Ri's perspective.

45
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,530
That's true. You should have thought about it from both sides.

46
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,580
Let's look for something for the time being, whether it be something to eat or a charger.

47
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,190
Okay.

48
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,910
Did you find anything?

49
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,040
There's really nowhere to search.

50
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,800
This is all there is in the kitchen, too.

51
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,950
He really lived as if he was getting rid of everything.

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,550
We're all doing this to eat.

53
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,430
Do you have any money on you?

54
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,300
I don't. I left it in the car.

55
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,980
They abandoned you and they abandoned me!

56
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,610
Starving yourself for one meal won't kill you.

57
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,360
Unlike somebody, I worked very hard, so I'm hungry.

58
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,110
Your body doesn't control the mind. Your mind controls the body.

59
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,460
If you think that you're not hungry, you won't feel hungry.

60
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,080
I have gastroenteritis.

61
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,780
Ah, I'm not hungry!

62
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,260
Ah, I want to eat black bean noodles.

63
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,320
I want spicy seafood noodle soup.

64
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,480
How about spicy cold noodles?

65
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,360
Cold noodles are good of course, but I prefer them to not be spicy.

66
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,040
How about marinated chicken?

67
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,590
I prefer fried.

68
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,680
Pork belly and soju would be the best thing right now.

69
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,070
Steak and wine would be the best.

70
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,350
Ah, I want to eat red spicy rice cakes!

71
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,990
I want black bean rice cakes.

72
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,630
Rice cakes are all about chili paste.

73
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:44,000
You say that because you don't know better. Rice cakes are all about the soy sauce.

74
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,790
 Rice cakes! Rice cakes! Black bean rice cakes!

75
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:57,650
I'm going crazy. You guys are giving me such a hard time. Just eat something.

76
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,660
Where on earth did your mom go at this time?

77
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,800
A mother in the middle of the night...

78
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,700
Wait a minute. Alright, it's done.

79
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,710
- Alright, I'm coming. 
 - Rice cakes! 
 - Rice cakes!

80
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,880
It's here!

81
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,650
Here it is. Eat.

82
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:27,270
As expected, your rice cakes are the best!

83
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:31,540
There's some spicy rice cakes in the freezer that you can take out and eat.

84
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:36,090
I divided them up and froze them. When you want to eat one, tell your mom, okay?

85
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,630
It's delicious when you make it.

86
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:44,880
That's right. Your rice cakes are the best!

87
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,200
What you guys like is all written here in this notebook.

88
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,970
Stir fried glass noodles, stir-fried tofu...

89
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:58,560
Quail eggs, fried rice... it's all here.

90
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,150
If you follow this, the taste will be the same, so tell your mom and dad to make

91
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,070
it if you want to eat it.

92
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,900
- When you make pork— 
 - Not anymore.

93
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,630
Why? Why?

94
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,560
Chanie, Deulie, you guys have grown a lot

95
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,490
and you can read well. You will descend.

96
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,140
- Descend? 
 - Descend?

97
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:22,860
When your dad was your age, he was going to descend, too.

98
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,020
But his ability was weak, so he didn't.

99
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,860
- Ability? 
 - Ability?

100
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,210
Something like that. Studying with your heart.

101
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:40,940
I... like girls who can make good soy sauce rice cakes.

102
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,450
You have unique taste.

103
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:46,600
Don't you have something unique about your taste in men?

104
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:54,530
I... like a man who can kick a shuttlecock* well.  
 (a weighted feather objected kicked around for sport)

105
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,150
Shuttlecock?

106
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:01,180
When I was young, I thought that men who kicked shuttlecocks well looked really cool.

107
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,700
I can't believe something like that looked cool.

108
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,260
How about now?

109
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:15,890
Now... a man who can drive in reverse well.

110
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,190
Reverse?

111
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:23,650
When a man holds the steering wheel with one hand and turns his body towards me when he drives in reverse,

112
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,910
that looks really sexy to me.

113
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:34,160
So you like that kind of stuff, in the car...

114
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,320
That kind of stuff.

115
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,090
You didn't know?

116
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,420
I like that, so I want to try it in the car.

117
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,340
I'll definitely try it in the car.

118
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,440
The sun just rising.

119
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,700
I got it, so you should definitely make that wish come true.

120
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,420
I'll just go straight.

121
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,710
Just you try to reverse.

122
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,440
Ah, I want to eat that at least.

123
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,790
No matter how hungry you are, how can you eat that nice cow?

124
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,910
The straw, not the cow.

125
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,820
You can eat the straw.

126
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,070
Let's go.

127
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,560
Where? To do what?

128
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,670
- I'm hungry! 
- Huh?

129
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,590
You're saying we should dig this up and eat it?

130
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:44,270
I'm about to die, so what else are we supposed to do?

131
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,970
Don't stay still, turn on the light.

132
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,550
What light?

133
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,470
Do you think we brought this bike just for the heck of it? Light!

134
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,790
Light?

135
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,900
Oh? Pedal it!

136
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:21,090
♫  Oh love, I love you, Only U 
I'm in big trouble  ♫

137
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,700
♫  I think about you all day  ♫

138
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,160
Don't just search recklessly.

139
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,820
Search well for the car keys.

140
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,740
Just pedal well. The light keeps going in different directions.

141
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,130
Ah, this angle isn't right though.

142
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:38,140
♫  I didn't know love would come to me, too  ♫

143
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:43,040
♫  I didn't believe in things like that 
 I thought it was only a story in a TV drama  ♫

144
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,290
♫  But you appear in front of me, why?  ♫

145
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,230
But you never know, so just look for the car keys, okay?

146
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,630
Look, it's going somewhere else again!

147
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:54,700
You can't pedal properly, huh? If you keep doing that, you won't get potatoes.

148
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,710
♫  Oh love, I love you, Only U  ♫

149
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:03,700
♫  I'm in big trouble  ♫

150
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,250
Oh? I see it!

151
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,610
I see it well! To the right a little! Just a little!

152
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,590
A little more!

153
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,840
Oh!

154
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,200
Stay strong for just a little longer!

155
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,380
- But it's too hard! 
- What kind of man finds something like this hard?

156
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,960
I don't think I can endure any longer! Quickly, dig it up!

157
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,270
Let me dig a little more.

158
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,680
A little more, a little more.

159
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,490
Don't just shake them. Look and see if the car key is in there.

160
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,550
It really isn't there!

161
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,920
Really? Are you sure? Seriously? Did you look properly?

162
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,140
Stop obsessing and just quickly start a fire.

163
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,590
I got it.

164
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,980
You looked, right?

165
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,660
This girl, look at the time...

166
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,080
- Father! 
 - Huh?

167
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,550
Oh, you're only coming now? You're late.

168
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:41,030
It's Sunday tomorrow. But why are you outside?

169
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,100
You waited for me, huh?

170
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,400
No, Jung Eum hasn't come back yet.

171
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,310
Jung Eum hasn't?

172
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,660
Yeah. I wonder if she's drunk somewhere. Her phone is off, too.

173
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,500
You know how dangerous it can be nowadays.

174
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,090
Hey, Jung Eum isn't a child.

175
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:59,330
Don't worry and go in, I'll go check the bus stop.

176
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,850
No, no. You go in and rest.

177
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,750
I ate too many side dishes, so I'm really full now.

178
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,100
I'll go out to digest, so quickly go inside.

179
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,850
Would you, then? I'll ask this as a favor of you.

180
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,730
When the sun sets, even all the animals go into their homes. This girl...

181
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,530
She must be thinking about guys.

182
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,920
She's crazy! This girl, look at the time!

183
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,960
Where is she and what is she doing?

184
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,040
♫  Lately I'm curious about you  ♫

185
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:55,660
 The power is off. You've been connected to voicemail. After the beep—

186
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:59,980
♫  In my head, I become your other half  ♫

187
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,660
♫  I hastily imagine it  ♫

188
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,380
♫  Oh slowly, slowly  ♫

189
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:12,070
♫  Even if I'm slow, I'll give you  ♫

190
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,910
♫  my deepening love  ♫

191
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,330
I'm fine. You eat.

192
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,880
♫  Oh slowly, slowly  ♫

193
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,660
♫  Even if I'm slow, I'll give you  ♫
♫  my deepening love  ♫

194
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,900
Ah, but won't your family worry about you?

195
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,800
We're not that close, so not really.

196
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,990
What about your mom?

197
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,710
My mom's busy.

198
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,430
She works?

199
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,930
She's pretty busy and impatient,

200
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,240
so she quickly went far away.

201
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:01,010
I also know one person who's really impatient, too.

202
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,220
If someone is worried, it's probably Joon Soo.

203
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,420
Ah, that... "Most Wanted Man"?

204
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,000
Yeah. We live together.

205
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,200
You two live together!?

206
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:32,190
Ah, really. This is Yoo Jung Eum's specialty.

207
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,680
Is it this?

208
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,100
 You really are clumsy.

209
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,120
 What's so hard about this?

210
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,060
 You checked if it's double wired right? You have to be careful.

211
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,830
 If you keep doing that, I'm gonna take off the rubber gloves.

212
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,240
 If you keep fooling around, at this rate you'll—

213
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,570
 Joon Soo!

214
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:07,270
 You're... suffocating me!

215
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,560
 Hey, are you okay? Didn't you get hurt?

216
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,800
 Why are you so surprised?

217
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,780
 Your nostrils are really big.

218
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:23,020
 - Hey, my nostrils are standard! 
 - Your nostrils are really big!

219
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:26,060
 They're average! Hey, I told you not to fool around, you almost got hurt!

220
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,850
 King Nostril.

221
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:31,550
 Hey, really. My nostrils have really good proportions!

222
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,070
 Hey! If you look from the side...

223
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,400
He lives in my house.

224
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,160
Or is it that we live in his house?

225
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,390
We?

226
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,270
My dad and I.

227
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,440
Oh.

228
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,120
You said you weren't going to eat.

229
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,930
Humans are fickle animals.

230
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,170
To be honest, usually for these kinds of things, I really—

231
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:06,180
I know, I know. You don't really like them.

232
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,780
I really like them.

233
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,300
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

234
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,660
You didn't know? I'm Northern European style.

235
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:17,130
In Scandinavia, boiled potatoes are their main dish.

236
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,040
Oh, that thing that's hot these days, Scandiavina?

237
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,020
Scandi navia.

238
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,480
Scanvia or Scanvina, I don't know which one.

239
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,870
- Potatoes are, of course... sugar! 
 - Salt.

240
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,920
Why?

241
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:13,460
I have to watch these kinds of things with a man I like though.

242
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,010
You have that kind of man?

243
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,790
Then do you?

244
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,260
Do you have a girl who makes soy sauce rice cakes well?

245
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:36,230
Well, you're an expert.

246
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,010
I'm sleepy.

247
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:40,960
Are you not going to wash up?

248
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,250
- You wash up first. 
 - Okay.

249
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:51,030
Give me... some potatoes.

250
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,930
They're good.

251
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,940
It went in, it went in!

252
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,230
Is it like this?

253
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,000
The lights turned on.

254
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:47,120
If there are any clothes in there, can you give them to me?

255
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,160
Here.

256
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,030
You want me to wear this?

257
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:59,830
It's the only thing, and there's only one of it, too.

258
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,580
- Still, how can I wear this? 
 - If you don't want to, I'll wear it.

259
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,330
No...

260
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:11,330
In exchange, you can use the blanket. I usually don't use one.

261
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,910
Then, take that at least. How are you going to sleep so uncomfortably?

262
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:16,830
The mind controls the body, the body doesn't control the mind.

263
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:20,480
If I think that I'm comfortable, I'll feel comfortable. Go to sleep.

264
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,750
Okay.

265
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,200
What a distraction.

266
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,140
It's getting on my nerves when I'm trying to sleep.

267
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:07,020
Don't come, don't come! Don't come!

268
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:29,410
- You just woke up? 
 - Ah!

269
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,390
You scared me!

270
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,060
What are you doing over there right now?

271
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:36,180
Ta-da! I got something.

272
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,250
What in the world, this was stuck on the tree branches!

273
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,880
Like a leaf!

274
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,610
Are you an acorn or something?

275
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:51,380
It must be a squirrel.

276
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,730
Same thing.

277
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,580
I've climbed trees since I was young.

278
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,130
I liked climbing and jumping off of things, too.

279
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,260
Do you think I did diving just because?

280
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,830
Well, I guess that's true.

281
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,440
Let's go!

282
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,290
Where?

283
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,810
- The city town. 
- The city town?

284
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,460
What are you going to buy with a dollar?

285
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,600
There's surprisingly a lot that I could buy at the convenience store.

286
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,980
Then, what are you going to ride to the town?

287
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,350
The bike? Ah, right.

288
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:19,340
You don't know how, huh? Then ride behind me.

289
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,620
I don't want to!

290
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,700
Then just stay here alone. I'll be right back.

291
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,240
I don't want to! I'll go too.

292
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,520
Then what do you want to do?

293
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,960
Acorn, get on behind me.

294
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,080
What did you say?

295
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,720
I can master riding this bike really quickly with my athletic skills.

296
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,850
I didn't ride it properly yesterday.

297
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:44,340
I... am a man who's skilled at sports.

298
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,390
Ready?

299
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,950
Left. Right.

300
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:01,370
Straight. Brake! Wow!

301
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,760
Great!

302
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,840
See. I said I had good sports skills.

303
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,860
Then let's step on the pedal.

304
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,320
So suddenly?

305
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,480
You're starting again. I'll just hold it from the back.

306
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,420
Hold it?

307
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,370
Yesterday, you said you'd never let go but you did!

308
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,470
That was because the situation was urgent so I did...

309
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,870
Forget it. I can't trust you.

310
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,870
How can I trust an acorn like you?

311
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:29,050
Just trust me!

312
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:31,690
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

313
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,590
Alright! Go!

314
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:41,590
I'm going. I'm going!

315
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:43,280
- I'm going. 
 - You're going!

316
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,340
- I'm going! 
 - Whoa, you're going!

317
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,560
- Are you okay? 
 - Hey!

318
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,010
Hey!

319
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,940
You acorn!

320
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,010
I see that you're fine.

321
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:00,230
Forget it. It's my fault for trusting you.

322
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:03,700
But what kind of man doesn't have athletic skills?

323
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:08,180
My athletic skills aren't the problem; your bad heart is the problem!

324
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,290
The real problem is...

325
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:13,180
- What?  
 - Trying not to fall down.

326
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,360
No.

327
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,050
I told you, it's fine once you fall down three times!

328
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:19,590
Since you've fallen down twice already, we only have one more time left!

329
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:22,650
You try falling three times in a row, you  cracorn.

330
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:25,390
- "Cracorn"? 
 - Crazy acorn!

331
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:28,610
No! Quickly! I'm hungry!

332
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:32,630
This time, I seriously won't let go!

333
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,160
I don't believe you.

334
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,810
Then I'll go by myself.

335
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,520
What do you want me to do!?

336
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,430
You... If you trick me one more time, you won't even have soup.

337
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:45,300
I got it, I got it. Quickly!

338
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,430
Alright...

339
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,450
Don't let go.

340
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:51,920
How do you start?

341
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,180
Pedal with force!

342
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,730
Alright, you're off, go!

343
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,310
Tighten your hands and keep pedaling.

344
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:03,880
I'll hold tight from the back.

345
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:10,690
That's right! Aigoo, you're doing well!

346
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:13,930
Hey, hey!

347
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,790
You crazy acorn!

348
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:19,120
Look forward.

349
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,630
♫  Because I liked you so much  ♫

350
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:26,720
♫ I just wanted to hide you away  ♫

351
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,990
Oh, you're doing well!

352
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:33,510
Can you see? Can you see me riding a bicycle?

353
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,810
You can do it! Just a little bit more!

354
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:39,130
Don't be scared! Throw away your fears!

355
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,200
♫  I like this you  ♫

356
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,880
Just a little more!

357
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,620
Are you okay?

358
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,660
I'm hurt to death!

359
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:58,800
You're such a kid.

360
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,950
Where do you get your physicality from?

361
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:05,900
Welcome.

362
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,080
Hello.

363
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,120
It's buy one, get one!

364
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,880
Pay.

365
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,590
You want to put that in who's mouth?

366
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,800
- You mean nose. 
 - Whether it's a nose or mouth,

367
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,390
put it back while I'm being nice!

368
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:29,420
Ring this up, please.

369
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,560
No! Do these.

370
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,020
I don't eat that sort of thing.

371
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,550
- Ring this up, please. 
 - It's ₩1.10.

372
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,430
Kang Hoon Nam, you can't.

373
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,260
You can't.

374
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,990
Put it down!

375
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,340
Then what on earth are we going to buy to eat!?

376
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,200
Ring this up, please.

377
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,560
₩1.00, please.

378
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,240
Here you go.

379
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:36,780
