1
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,040
San, Deul! Your mom is coming back.

2
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,300
She's almost here...!

3
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:47,600

4
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,960
Go inside now.

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,340
You really have to make mistakes every day, don't you?

6
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,190
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,910
- For now, go inside.
 - But first...

8
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,680
Stop interfering and go back inside!

9
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,590
The damage isn't too bad overall, but the legs got broken. You might need to order new ones.

10
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,300
Okay, I'll put in a new order.

11
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,950
Thank god they were imitations, even though you still need to replace them.

12
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,830
I have insurance for them. It'll all be taken care of.

13
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:56,740
When did you get insurance? You're always ahead of things.

14
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,760
It's nothing, really. Could you take care of this?

15
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,160
I... because of that lady...

16
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,940
Please don't worry about it. Go  on ahead.

17
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,620
Yes, go now.

18
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,840
- Please take this.
- Okay.

19
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,230
Thank you for your hard work.

20
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,020
I have no right to have any coffee, so don't give me anything to drink.

21
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,930
You're random, nosy, and assume things. What else have you got?

22
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,520
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,680
Do you know anything about the Bear Bear you broke?

24
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,770
There are only three of them in the whole world.

25
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:54,810
The artist doesn't participate in competitions, so I had to meet them personally agian and again to persuade them

26
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,220
and barely managed to bring it to the gallery. It's not something that can be bought

27
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,900
with money.

28
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,610
Then... what are you going to do?

29
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,490
The only thing you can do is to meet the artist in person and apologize.

30
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,540
Then... I can certainly do that.

31
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,900
- If you just tell me where I can meet them—
 - São Tomé and Príncipe.

32
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,800
It's an island nation near Southeast Africa.

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,580
Even if you decide to go there,

34
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,550
- he won't talk to anyone else but me. He's very eccentric. 
 - What to do?

35
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,190
I guess there's no other way.

36
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,300
I need to apologize to him for you. That's the only thing we can do.

37
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,910
Oh, I'm sorry. I made another mistake.

38
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,920
Is there something I can do? How could I apologize to him properly?

39
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,170
I'll do whatever you tell me to do, Mr. Expert.

40
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,330
Mr. Expert? What kind of weird name is that?

41
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,040
Then... how should I address you?

42
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,440
Should I officially call you CEO of the Arts?

43
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,580
That's too long. Why don't you just call me Mr. Art?

44
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,850
Yes, Mr. Art.

45
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,740
What is this?

46
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,020
It's a blank contract.

47
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,530
A blank contract?

48
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,390
I can write whatever I want on it, just like a blank check,

49
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:38,120
and you're agreeing that you'll follow what I write no matter what.

50
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,900
Do what you want to do. You can either sign it as a gesture of an apology,

51
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,490
or just say that you're sorry and do nothing.

52
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,220
I'll sign it.

53
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,470
I know that this is not enough to make up for the mistake,

54
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,870
but if this is only thing I can do, then I'll do it.

55
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,920
But just one thing...

56
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:17,190
please promise me that you won't give up on the Zero Members.

57
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,110
Okay.

58
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,880

59
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,900

60
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,250
You can leave first. I'll be right behind you.

61
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,550
I ordered the Bear Bears.

62
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:10,650
They'll get shipped tomorrow. By the way, San told me

63
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,610
that they were the ones who did it.

64
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,970
Apparently, she was trying to help them when they almost got injured while playing.

65
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,630
Sister-in-Law wanted me to tell her thank you,

66
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:24,170
but you made her sign the blank contract.

67
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,210
Boss, respect!

68
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,540
That's enough. Just go get me two coffees.

69
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,170
Two of them!

70
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,690
Drink this as you go.

71
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,500
I didn't do anything well. I'll enjoy it.

72
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,720
You didn't have to.

73
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,820
Fastening a lady's seatbelt is basic manners for men.

74
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:32,210
Oh, right. You're the relationship expert.

75
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:44,640
♫  oh slowly slowly  ♫

76
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,710
♫  Can I carefully  ♫
	♫  knock on your heart?  ♫

77
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:54,420
♫  oh slowly slowly  ♫

78
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,650
♫  Can I convey  ♫
	♫  my feelings so you won't be surprised?  ♫

79
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:03,570
♫  My clusminess  ♫

80
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:08,330
♫  Even if it's frustrating and disappointing  ♫

81
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:14,080
♫  oh slowly slowly  ♫

82
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,560
♫  Even if I'm slow, I'll give you  ♫	♫  my love that's deepening  ♫

83
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,360
Didn't you say you were a diving athlete?

84
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,360
Excuse me? Ah, yes.

85
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,570
Then why are you afraid of water? You were like that during the incident at the Han River.

86
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:38,250
It just ended up happening and because of it, I gave up diving.

87
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:43,480
Then, what about couple management? Did you just happen to become a couple manager, too?

88
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,690
It just happened by accident.

89
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,230
I want to hear the story behind it if you don't mind telling it.

90
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,330
The thing is...

91
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,290
I didn't have a job for a few years after I quit diving.

92
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:10,020
I don't have any other skills besides being athletic. It was hard to get a job.

93
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:14,860
My dad then signed me up at a matchmaking company, saying that I should just get married.

94
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,460
But I didn't want to go on any dates,

95
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,840
so I checked out their profiles and sent whoever I thought would be the best fit in my stead.

96
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,870
But like they say, "The net of the sleeper catches a bug." They all ended up being successful.

97
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,760
That's how I got hired. Isn't that funny?

98
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,250
It's pretty unusual.

99
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,970
Even though it happened by accident, I decided to

100
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,800
think of it as destiny and do my best.

101
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,510
But I made a mistake and ended up with the Zero Members.

102
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:45,150
That made me lose my confidence and I kept on making more mistakes,

103
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:49,370
and that problem kept on repeating.

104
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:53,800
I guess the thoughts in my head became less confident.

105
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,010
They are all mixed up and won't come out like they should.

106
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,300
And your words are mixed up, too?

107
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,400
What? How did you know?

108
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,320
You just said, "The net of the sleeper catches a bug."

109
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,300
I mixed up "bug" and "fish" as well.

110
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,930
But it's a relief.

111
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,210
What?

112
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:14,930
You just need to get your confidence back. Take care of the Zero Members

113
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,520
and try to fix your words as well.

114
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,270
That would be nice.

115
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,530
Don't you think the way we met was kind of funny, too?

116
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,480
It's almost too funny.

117
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,550
Then perhaps...

118
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,140
Then perhaps what?

119
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,740
Isn't this fate?

120
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,650
Not everything is fate.

121
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:52,080
Why not?

122
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,130
No matter how much you're joking, don't talk of fate so easily.

123
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,920
They say, "Every word has its magic."

124
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,290
You mean "power."

125
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,520
Yeah, power.

126
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,500
- Yeah, power.
 - Power.

127
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,660
- You just said, "Every word has its magic."
 - Did I?

128
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:27,570

129
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,170
Yes, yes, yes.

130
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:37,890
Let's take a group picture. Strike a pose, please.

131
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:41,170
Okay, one, two, three.

132
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,580
Thank you.

133
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,050
Grandfather.

134
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:51,150
- Thanks for all the hard work.
 - Thank you!

135
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,570
Thank you so much.

136
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,800
You have to head over to the Blue House for the dinner party.

137
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,850
Other congressmen are already gone, you're the last one left.

138
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,920
Grandfather, enjoy this water.

139
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,180
- Thank you. Thank you.
 - It's nothing at all.

140
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,880
Thank you.

141
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,210
How is he Jesus and Casanova at the same time?

142
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,980
 Go Eun Nim's bucket list.

143
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,390
 Go bungee jumping.

144
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:57,980
Table, I'll fix your leg once I learn how to do woodwork.

145
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,700
 Learn woodworking.

146
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,700
 Master a third foreign language.

147
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,720
 Go on a train trip by myself.

148
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,420
 Work for an international NGO.

149
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:22,630
 Get a house just for myself. Make clothes.

150
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,330
It seems like we've been here for over an hour. Are we going to keep waiting?

151
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:43,220
I need to know what to do so that I can be helpful, right?

152
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,790
Are you listening to me?

153
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,090
He's here.

154
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,560
Can I have this and one of today's coffee?

155
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,090
That'll be ₩4,500.

156
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,870
The man who just came in, do you know who he is?

157
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,520
He was here yesterday, too. Isn't he the owner of a bookstore?

158
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,220
- You remembered well.
 - But that wasn't even difficult.

159
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,350
But it's difficult for Ms. Ahn In Jeong.

160
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,960
Ah, that's right.

161
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,500
But, what about him?

162
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,780
- Isn't it a little strange?
 - What?

163
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:36,550
Why is he here all the time even though he has his own store?

164
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,710
Because he likes chocolate?

165
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,420
Would someone who like chocolate order just that one small piece?

166
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,410
No, that's probably not enough.

167
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:46,600
Then why does he drink coffee here all the time,

168
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:53,570
and sit right in front of the counter when he could sit next to the window right there?

169
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,960
Because of Ms. Ahn In Jeong?

170
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,790
Bingo.

171
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,650
He likes her?

172
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,680
How did you figure that out in two days? Amazing!

173
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,180
Then, what should we do next?

174
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,950
We'll introduce that guy to her formally.

175
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,070
- Wrong.
 - No?

176
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:28,840
Do you think it'll work even if we fix them up?

177
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,810
Then, what should we do?

178
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:34,800
We need to make her recognize him by herself.

179
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,990
She said she can't even recognize her close friends if they don't say their names.

180
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,740
That's why we need to do it.

181
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,110
But how?

182
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:45,960
Try to find a solution here, since the solution is going to be in this place.

183
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,760
Excuse me?

184
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,810
I have a meeting, so I'll be going now.

185
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:53,610
Me, too. I don't have a meeting, but—

186
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,000
- Would you like to order?
 - What's the most popular thing on the menu?

187
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,680
- It's milk tea.
 - One, two, three. Here you go.

188
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,800
Oh... Thank you.

189
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,900

190
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,350
How in the world is the answer in this place?

191
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,510
Excuse me, we're about to close.

192
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:26,180
It's already late. I'm sorry.

193
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,440
- Perhaps...
 - Yes?

194
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,670
- Are you Manager Yoo Jung Eum?
 - Yes!

195
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:38,270
- Yes, I'm Yoo Jung Eum.
 - Ah, I was right.

196
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:42,510
But, how did you know? I didn't introduce myself.

197
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,930
Because that lip balm's fragrance is so unique.

198
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:49,580
- What? This lip balm?
 - Yes.

199
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,790
The last time I saw you, you used that lip balm.

200
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,530
The fragrance was unique.

201
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:59,030
My dad is passionate about preserving nature,

202
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,540
so he makes his own soaps and cosmetics.

203
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,600
My dad also made this lip balm.

204
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,350
Ah! So it was homemade.

205
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,940
In any case, I thought the fragrance was interesting

206
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,780
so it remained in my memory.

207
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,900
In that case, can you tell the difference between fragrances?

208
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,530
People who suffer from face blindness like me

209
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:23,510
recognize people by their body language or different characteristics like facial hair.

210
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:28,080
But I'm worse than other people, so I can't even recognize different speech styles.

211
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,050
Fragrances help me a lot.

212
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,580
I would've given you something if I had recognized you earlier, but we're all sold out now.

213
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:42,180
Oh, no need! I'm so full, I wouldn't be able to eat it.

214
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:46,710
Please head home safely. I'll give you a call later.

215
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,910
Yes. You too, go home safely.

216
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,700
Yes.

217
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,690
She remembers people through fragrances.

218
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:05,060
Dad's lip balm solved one for me.

219
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,520
Were you waiting for me here?

220
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,450
There you go again, getting ahead of yourself. I just got here.

221
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,030
It's late.

222
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,380
Get in. Let's talk on the way.

223
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,010
Yes.

224
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,940
Where's your house?

225
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,970
It's near Gildong Elementary School.

226
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:45,970
 You're en route to Gildong Elementary School.

227
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,060
Were you there this whole time?

228
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,700
You said the solution was in that place.

229
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,730
So, did you find a solution?

230
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,460
Yes, I think I found one.

231
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,370
Really?

232
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,410
Fragrance.

233
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:04,670
Member  Ahn In Jeong remembers people by their fragrances rather than their faces, ways of speech, or body language.

234
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,080
I use this homemade lip balm.

235
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:12,740
She said she remembered me because of its unique fragrance. I don't even use it that often. It's crazy!

236
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,130
What's this?

237
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,780
Take a look.

238
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,530

239
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,540
You read all this?

240
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,060
Then, you already knew about the fragrance.

241
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,560
"If you know the enemy and know yourself." It's pretty basic.

242
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,590
Let's cancel her membership.

243
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,250
What?

244
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:49,280
I read about the cancelation policy in the terms and conditions.

245
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,390
Cancellation policy?

246
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,510
"Your membership will be canceled if you find someone outside of our service."

247
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,150
That's right. It is there.

248
00:20:55,150 --> 00:21:00,220
Except, it's written in fine print on the back of the terms and conditions booklet.

249
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,520
Why do you want to have her cancel it?

250
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,890
If she volunteers to leave, she's no longer a Zero Member.

251
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:11,140
You're right.

252
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,430
I haven't even thought about that.

253
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,500
There was that kind of solution!

254
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:20,080
Let's not force her to meet people when she's already uncomfortable with it.

255
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,840
We can hook her up with the bookstore guy casually

256
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,130
so she'll cancel her membership herself.

257
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:30,270
Okay. I think that's the right way to do it.

258
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,730
I'll meet the bookstore guy then.

259
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,290
Okay.

260
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,960
I think we're here.

261
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,410
You can go straight and turn right.

262
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,800
 You've reached the destination.

263
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,530
 Thank you. You can drop me off right there.

264
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:58,110
It's too dark. Where's your house? I can drop you off there.

265
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,520
It's not that far. I can walk from here.

266
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,690
Can I just go straight here?

267
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,770
Thank you! Mr. Art—

268
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:23,000
He's such an a**hole sometimes.

269
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,890
You scared me!

270
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,240
- Are you going back home?
 - Yeah.

271
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,820
Who was that? Mr. Art?

272
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,120
Wasn't he Charlie's doctor?

273
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:38,990
Kang Hoon Nam?

274
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:43,680
You know, he's the real writer behind Hoon Nam Jung Eum, the one you found out for me.

275
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,220
 - This is...
 - I'm Kang Hoon Nam.

276
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,730
 Nice to meet you. I'm Choi Joon Soo.

277
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:54,050
So she knows him?

278
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,730
So he was that guy?

279
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,820
You want to go eat?

280
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,760
Yeah, I could eat.

281
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,230
Let's go eat then!

282
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,150
So you starved all day?

283
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:17,640
Let me just eat.

284
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,920
You're so silly.

285
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,860
You know how I have to get things done once I set my mind to it.

286
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,230
It's too salty.

287
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,980
You really are simple.

288
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,120
So, any progress?

289
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,570
Yeah, I think so.

290
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,030
- Really?
 - He's definitely

291
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:38,340
perceptive about dating and human psychology. He's good at reading people.

292
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,740
I think that he could be helpful to the Zero Members.

293
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,380
- That's good.
 - Yeah.

294
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,670
You still have to be careful. Whatever he is, he's still a player.

295
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,620
I know.

296
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,230
But thanks to your recommendation,

297
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:56,730
I feel hopeful about the Zero Members.

298
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:08,100
Seriously. Can't you eat slowly?

299
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:18,350
♫  No way to say that it's the end  ♫

300
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,980
♫  And so win or lose  ♫

301
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:29,560
♫  I'm forced to choose  ♫

302
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,320
What? You haven't left yet?

303
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,490
I did and came back.

304
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,380
Did someone blow you off?

305
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,890
No, it's not like that.

306
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:45,910
It's because I felt bad. You got involved with that woman because of me.

307
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:54,660
♫  Opened up your heart to me that you ever invited me in  ♫

308
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:59,540
I saw the Zero Members list. You're not working with her on that, are you?

309
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:05,520
I wasn't trying to look. I just took a glance at it since it was on the cafe table.

310
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,920
It was on my desk in the office.

311
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,250
No, that's not true.

312
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:13,650
I came back because I got blown off, and I saw it right here on the cafe table...

313
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:16,500
Anyway, I honestly

314
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,390
thought you could get rid of her easily.

315
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,220
But it seems like you're involved with her somehow.

316
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:33,380
I know you're capable of getting rid of people like that easily,

317
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,140
but I don't understand why you're letting her in...

318
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:40,230
I can't understand.

319
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:43,990
Charlie was worried that since she found out about you, everyone might have as well.

320
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,470
Is it okay that you know it, too?

321
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,860
Charlie told me that he trusts me.

322
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:51,150
He said that she's a public enemy and we can't be divided.

323
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:56,680
I didn't know that it woud be worse for you guys to get along than to bicker with each other.

324
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,780
Anyway, my aunt told you not to bring women to work.

325
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:17,390
I guess I won't see her at the gallery at least, right?

326
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:20,210
Actually, she'll be here often.

327
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:25,860
I'm going to talk to her at the gallery cafe a lot. Very often.

328
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:30,390
Why? Aren't you afraid of the consequences?

329
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:32,330
It's okay, because I don't see her as a woman.

330
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,310
How about me then?

331
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,270
Haven't you thought about how she terrorized me?

332
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:39,470
Yeah, that's why I'm doing this.

333
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:46,750
I see. I'm dead now.

334
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:51,630
I'm Kang Hoon Nam from the gallery that called you earlier.

335
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:55,610
But, why does someone who works at a gallery want to see me?

336
00:26:55,610 --> 00:27:00,020
We're doing a toy exhibition called "Childlike Mind and Nostalgic Fantasy"

337
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:04,070
and I wanted to acquire your chocolate art work for the exhibition.

338
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:06,320
I'm just a person who sells chocolates.

339
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:12,240
I heard that you won the President's Award at the Seoul Confectionary Festival a while ago.

340
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,530
We did some research to find new artists.

341
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:19,700
That was a long time ago when I was still an imprudent student.

342
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,670
That's exactly what we're looking for.

343
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:25,530
I want you to make something with your pure heart.

344
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:30,000

345
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,650
I'll give it a try.

346
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:38,300
Okay.

347
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:43,930
This explains the concept of the exhibition and has some references we found.

348
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:47,180
It'll be useful to help you get some ideas.

349
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:54,050
I'll contact you through the curator for more details.

350
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,360
Thank you.

351
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,180
It was nice meeting you.

352
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,870
I'll do my best.

353
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:02,900
Okay.
