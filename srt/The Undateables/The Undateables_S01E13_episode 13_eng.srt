1
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,430

2
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,680
Here it is.

3
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:46,300
Let's see what he wrote in this issue.

4
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,510

5
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:53,390
Choi Joon Soo totally studied this.

6
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,960
 Even if you try this, that, and everything else, breaking up only takes a moment.

7
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,430
 Even if you make up excuses and come up with reasons, you can't change the end result.

8
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:06,870
 Rather than desperately clinging onto an outcome that you can't change, you might as well cast a spell.

9
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,260
 I want to say this to the woman from five years ago who was the worst case I ever saw.

10
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,760
 Obliviate.

11
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,750
"Obliviate"?

12
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,830
Hey, Yoo Jung Eum, you—

13
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,700
You're a woman. Do you want to keep going in and out of a man's room?

14
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,230
What man?

15
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,330
That...

16
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,230
Socks... Do you have some socks?

17
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,870
What socks? Wow, now you're going to take my socks?

18
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,200
I don't have any for myself either.

19
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,020
So childish!

20
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,650
Hey, Yoo Jung Eum.

21
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,210
Are you mad?

22
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,900
No.

23
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:56,640

24
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,490
You'll waste electricity.

25
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,750
Seriously, why am I like this?

26
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,800
I'll be back!

27
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,100
Jung Eum, about setting up Grandma Bok Ja's granddaughter—

28
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,830
Later!

29
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,680
Why is she in such a hurry?

30
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,200
She's still working there without quitting though.

31
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,830
Did you bring the curtain from the welfare center?

32
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,830
Yeah, I thought it was time to wash it.

33
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,830
- Are you leaving? 
- For tasks like this, please call me.

34
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,490
I'll make some delicious soybean paste stew for dinner, so come and eat if you don't have any plans.

35
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,760
If something doesn't come up, I will.

36
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,480
- I'll be back. 
- Okay.

37
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,460
Ah, Father! You haven't forgotten about the check-up tomorrow, right?

38
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,760
- It's tomorrow? 
- Yes.

39
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,740
You have to fast starting from 8 o'clock today! You can't drink like last time.

40
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,200
Then we'll have to eat cheonggukjang*  (fermented soybean paste)  next time.

41
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,280
I'm really leaving this time.

42
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,490
Okay, take care.

43
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,030
Why am I feeling like this?

44
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,060
 Why are you clinging onto that girl?

45
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,100
 Do you like her?

46
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,430
I like her?

47
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,230
♫  Lately I'm curious about you  ♫

48
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,410
No way.

49
00:03:54,410 --> 00:04:00,100
♫  I want to know more  ♫

50
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,230
♫  In my head I become your other half  ♫

51
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:08,790
♫  I hastily imagine it  ♫

52
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,950
 Do you want to bet?

53
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,470
 - Bet?
 - I'll seduce that woman and then reject her.

54
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,980
 I'll bet my blank contract.

55
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,940
 Your blank contract?

56
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,150
 I'll give her a taste of how scary the world is.

57
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:22,070
♫  oh slowly slowly  ♫

58
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:26,540
Ah, seriously, I got involved in this for no reason. It's not like I can go back on my word.

59
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,260
Alright. Well, is dating a big deal?

60
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,230
I can just make her like me.

61
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,460
Yes, that's right.

62
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,090
Ah, that scared me. Why am I so good-looking?

63
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,940
Good morning.

64
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,360
Say hello.

65
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,670
This is our new recruit, Ma Cho Seong.

66
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,290
I'm the new recruit, Ma Cho Seong.

67
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,120
Starting today, he'll be working on our team.

68
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,040
- Nice to meet you. 
- Yes, nice to meet you.

69
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,400
Cho Seong, please go to my office.

70
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,750
You picked a new recruit? When?

71
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,690
I don't think you should be that welcoming right now.

72
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,930
- Why? 
 - Oh Doo Ri took the membership with Noble.

73
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:42,730
Excuse me?

74
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,390
When you were about to get fired for making a mess last time,

75
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,300
I was barely blocking them from firing you by having you take care of the Zero Members.

76
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,510
Unless we make things work out for Oh Doo Ri, seeing how a new hire was picked for our team...

77
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,560
I don't know.

78
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,370
You're checking the humidity well, right?

79
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,450
Of course.

80
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,240
Raise it by one percent.

81
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,480
- Just one?
 - Yes.

82
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,890
Ah, but, President, about the bet we made yesterday.

83
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,850
I weighed the pros and cons and it looks like I'll kill three birds with one stone.

84
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:26,110
It's more comfortable to move around this way...

85
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,260
First,

86
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,590
I can properly watch you flirt with a girl.

87
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,380
Second, if you succeed,

88
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:41,300
I can see that girl being completely played with my own two eyes.

89
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,540
Third, if you fail, your blank contract will come into my hands.

90
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,610
This is a situation where I have nothing to lose.

91
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:54,030
Fourth, if you lose, you'll clean everything up and only date one girl. Okay?

92
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:59,690
How did this day when I get to say these words to you come about?

93
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,070
Yook Ryong, you said you have a friend who works at CIS, right?

94
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,390
Yes. One of my classmates from KAIST...

95
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,680
I do. Why do you ask?

96
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm here.

97
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,100
Hi.

98
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,970
Hello.

99
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,390
Geez, why do you carry so much in your bag?

100
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,730
Give it to me.

101
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,600
It's heavy.

102
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,760
You want coffee?

103
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,710
That'd be great.

104
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,390
Sit.

105
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,170
Why do you look so down?

106
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,620
You look like you have no strength. It worries me.

107
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:32,140
Oh Doo Ri registered with another matchmaking company.

108
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,670
If we don't set her up with Kim So Eul quick, we might lose her.

109
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,730
Ah, so that's what happened.

110
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:43,340
What do I do? Where can I find Mr. Kim So Eul, who has departed from the world?

111
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,200
I'll find him, so don't worry about it too much.

112
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,560
In this month's column it mentioned "Obliviate."

113
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,420
It's a spell that makes all the bad memories disappear and only leaves the good ones. Right?

114
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,350
Yeah. You saw it, so why are you asking?

115
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,970
I only saw a quick peek when I stole it from Joon Soo's room so I couldn't see it properly.

116
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:11,530
I'll send it to you every month, so don't do that from now on. Okay?

117
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:15,360
Really? Then I'd be grateful.

118
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,610
But, who is that woman who was the worst case?

119
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,540
 Let go!

120
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,270
 I said, let me go!

121
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,620
 What is this?

122
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:45,420
If you two live together, your friend's girlfriend probably doesn't like that.

123
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,870
Ah, Choi Joon Soo?

124
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,490
He doesn't have a girlfriend.

125
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,450
- He doesn't?
 - No.

126
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:56,290
He's a doctor and he's handsome like his name says, so why not?
  (T/N: Joon Soo means handsome in Korean).

127
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,730
He can't date because he's got eyes in the back of his head.

128
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,230
He's probably the most difficult case among the members that I oversee.

129
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,340
He's a member as well?

130
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,760
Yes. My first member.

131
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,740
Ah, that's right.

132
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,410
Didn't you say one part per couple that I bring together?

133
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,400
You suffered a lot.

134
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,790
Better get going.

135
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,130
Ah... already?

136
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:47,440
I just came make the delivery. I have to get back to work now.

137
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,040
Hold on.

138
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,370
Yes?

139
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,960
Let's go find Kim So Eul together tomorrow.

140
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,540
You found him already?

141
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,690
Well, in any case, I will have him found.

142
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,400
Skilled as expected.

143
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,420
Come quickly tomorrow.

144
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,290
So that we can have lunch together.

145
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,340
You don't have to see me off.

146
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,280
I came to take a walk.

147
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
Put it on if it gets cold on your way back.

148
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,970
It's fine.

149
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,260
It's kind of a good deed, like manners that a man should have, you know?

150
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,200
What manners? I lose things like this so easily.

151
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,830
It's fine.

152
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,440
It's cheap.

153
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,280
Yoo Jung Eum!

154
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,860
Coming home from work?

155
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,630
Yeah. Did you have dinner yet?

156
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,480
Yes, since a new employee joined today.

157
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,000
Really? Then let's go eat dinner.

158
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,800
If you drink water, you'll get indigestion.

159
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:05,590
The problem with this place is that the radish kimchi tastes better than the soup.

160
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,630
By the way, when was your last?

161
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,610
Last what?

162
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,710
Kiss.

163
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,020
Hey, why are you suddenly interested in someone else's kissing?

164
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,330
There's no way that the forehead kiss you had with me is the last one, right?

165
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:32,070
What? Unbelievable! Hey, would I really—?

166
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:35,360
Then, why are you eating dinner with me right now?

167
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,130
- Well, that—
 - Be honest.

168
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,880
How many times did you go on blind dates?

169
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,560
Two times? Three times?

170
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,030
Is it possible that you haven't gone on any yet?

171
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,910
Because I didn't like any of them.

172
00:13:53,910 --> 00:14:01,090
Joon Soo, every time I go to work, I get thrown into chaos because of the Zero Members. That's me, every day.

173
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,750
But an amazing member of mine

174
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,830
has rejected a hundred blind dates.

175
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:07,950
Really?

176
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:12,970
You're an A-class member and even have special premium membership.

177
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:16,890
Make it work and help me with my job performance.

178
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:21,910
To be honest, if you meet a good woman through me, that'd be way better for you.

179
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:25,590
So just go on the dates, Choi Joon Soo, okay?

180
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,820
If I don't like them, how can I go?

181
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,780
That's not being polite towards the other person.

182
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,180
What's that thing?

183
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,130
That? A scarf.

184
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,300
Isn't that a man's scarf?

185
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,780
Correct. It is.

186
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,390
Give me.

187
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,400
Why?

188
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:58,320
Hey. Do you even know that it's your father's check-up tomorrow?

189
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,160
That's tomorrow? What time is it right now?

190
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,070
Ah! What if he drank again? He's supposed to fast.

191
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,700
I begged him not to this morning, so don't worry.

192
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,710
You did?

193
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:14,390
Our hospital is a rehabilitation hospital anyway, so I'll go.

194
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,730
Thank you, Choi Joon Soo.

195
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:20,950
Then... give me that.

196
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,990
 If you're cold on the way, wear this.

197
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,700
  I lose things like this so easily.

198
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:33,180
 It's okay. It's cheap.

199
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,330
It's probably fine.

200
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,740
Oh, this is definitely my style.

201
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,170
Do you wear it like this?

202
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,620
How does it look? Does it look good?

203
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,370
I don't know.

204
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:08,600

205
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,310
 Wow!

206
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,200
What's this? This wasn't how it tasted.

207
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,590
This is the same ramen.

208
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:01,170
Oh, it's because I'm not eating it with Cracorn...

209
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,740
No, I don't think that's it.

210
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,760
It's because I didn't eat it after riding a bicycle. That's it.

211
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,610
 I'll teach you. You'll learn how to ride a bicycle right away. Here.

212
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,140
  Oh, you're doing well!

213
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,560
  Do you see me? I'm riding a bike!

214
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,740
  You can do this! Just a bit more! Don't be afraid! Throw your fears away!

215
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,710
I rode a bike. Finally.

216
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,830
 That's mine.

217
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,900
 Do you want to ride it?

218
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:30,420
 Get on. I'll give you a ride.

219
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,840
 - Yoo Jung Eum, hurry up. We're late! 
- Okay.

220
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,170
 You're not getting on? Then, I'm going.

221
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,990
 Bye!

222
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,140
 Bye...

223
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:00,400
 Hoon Nam, did you wait a long time?

224
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,910
 No.

225
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,380
 Should I make soy sauce rice cakes for you?

226
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,860
 Yes.

227
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,780
 Let's go.

228
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,330
 Hey, there's no way this is a trick of the light. It's definitely someone's face.

229
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:35,090
 It's someone dangling upside down from a branch like it's a pull-up bar.

230
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,330
Right, it could be a person.

231
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,270
But who is it?

232
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,990
  You're awake?

233
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,410
 What are you doing right now?

234
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:49,410
 Ta-da! I got something.

235
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,940
Someone like Cracorn is here, too.

236
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,390
You're late?

237
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:11,660
I'm working offsite today. I have to go meet Mr. Art.

238
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,790
"Mr. Art"?

239
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,910
Hold on!

240
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,780
I'll take you there.

241
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,400
Aren't you going to work?

242
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,680
I have an afternoon patient today.

243
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,050
You hate driving though.

244
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:27,410
Not at all, I absolutely love driving!

245
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:30,970
Aigoo...

246
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,790
I'm going to faint from hunger because I'm fasting.

247
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,820
You still have to. You must!

248
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,570
Dad, can't you just take a break from class today?

249
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:43,150
All my students are older than me. What excuse can I give them for taking a day off?

250
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,060
Joon Soo, I'll see you at the hospital later.

251
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,440
- Okay!
 - I'm going.

252
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,380
Go safely.

253
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,940
I'll take you. Got it?

254
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,690
Wait a minute.

255
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:58,810
Wow, really. Why is he being so friendly?

256
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,360
I got your clothes.

257
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,870
Hmm, they came?

258
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,790
Should I... put this in the dressing room?

259
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,440
Give it to me.

260
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:18,590
But, where did you find this kind of clothing?

261
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,440
- What happened with what I told you to look for? 
 - Ah! Well...

262
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,390
I asked my friend who works at CIS.

263
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,440
He barely found it.

264
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,010
They found it?

265
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,720
I think it was a fishing spot in Gyeonggi-do?

266
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,880
Kim So Eul was captured on a CCTV there.

267
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,420
This one.

268
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:44,170
They used a program that is normally used to find terrorists.

269
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,340
They're not supposed to just use them however they want...

270
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,660
I'm here.

271
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,630
You came?

272
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,960
Noona!

273
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,760
Hello.

274
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:09,840
Yes, hello.

275
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,120
Why did you two show up together?

276
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,340
Ah! We were at home  together.

277
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:22,310
While I was driving Jung Eum here, I thought I'd come check out the workplace.

278
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:25,820
Oh, by the way, I'm enjoying Hoon Nam Jung Eum.

279
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,590
So you do this kind of work.

280
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,970
I was curious.

281
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,310
Ah, then, well done.

282
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:37,900
Thank you for bringing her here. As I heard, you're a genuine friend.

283
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:45,180
Ah, well, since you're here,

284
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,820
let's eat together. There's a good sushi place nearby.

285
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,370
Sushi?

286
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,910
I'll bring my car keys.

287
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:55,010
You said it's nearby.

288
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,020
Let's walk there.

289
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,230
Should we? You want to walk?

290
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,790
That would be good.

291
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,630
Right?

292
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,200
Let's go!

293
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,130
Why does he keep answering? Hm?

294
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,610
Let's go together!

295
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:23,080

296
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,700

297
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,990
Jung Eum doesn't eat abalone.

298
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,280
You don't eat abalone?

299
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:48,400
I'll eat it, then.

300
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,550
Let's see... for Jung Eum...

301
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:55,640
Oh! It's coming! She likes this.

302
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,120
Oh. Nice! Nice!

303
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:04,820
She eats egg rolls at a sushi place...

304
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,920
Tuna belly is a bit...

305
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,930
- Why don't you eat it?
 - It's greasy.

306
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:23,530
Jung Eum dislikes tuna belly, too, because it's greasy.

307
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,130
I'll eat it.

308
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:30,500
Hey, halibut!

309
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,230
As expected, sushi is all about the halibut, of course!

310
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,980
Right.

311
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:45,130
That—that, you know about that scarf?

312
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,250
Ah, this?

313
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,930
Jung Eum gave this to me.

314
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,620
It's mine.

315
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,310
Oh! It's okay.

316
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:58,170
He's right. Give it back to him. Quickly!

317
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,150
It's mine.

318
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:04,820
If that's how it was, you should have told me.

319
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,090
Yes, yes.

320
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:15,750
Ah, I felt empty without this.

321
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:20,240
Ah, but your tastes must be similar to mine.

322
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,010
I really liked that.

323
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:29,950
Even with the scarf and the type of sushi we like... you and I are really alike.

324
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,910
Ah, really?

325
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:38,060
Yes, even when I read your column, Hoon Nam Jung Eum, I feel like you and I really have a lot in common.

326
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:42,850
Let's see each other often. Even without Jung Eum, it'd be nice to hang out.

327
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:47,390
Yes, well... then... let's do that... then.

328
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:51,240
To be honest, I tried what was written there.

329
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,040
I even tried some techniques on Jung Eum.

330
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,920
By techniques, what do you mean?

331
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,060
You know, like the one-two-three forehead kiss.

332
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,120
- I tried that on Jung Eum and succeeded.
 - Wow!

333
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,870
Sorry, the wasabi at this place is so strong.

334
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,190
Ah, drink some water.

335
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:14,180
Thanks.

336
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,960
You two must be really close.

337
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,250
We've been friends since we were young.

338
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,820
People say there are no friendships between men and women—

339
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,920
There are.

340
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,690
Why aren't there? Of course there are.

341
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,780
Really?

342
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,790
Yes. Of course.

343
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:41,330
Oh, but we should slowly get a move on.

344
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:44,590
Already? I didn't eat that much though.

345
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,700
Thank you for the food.

346
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,970
Ah, don't mention it. I had a good meal thanks to you.

347
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,830
- Are you going home?
 - Yeah.

348
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,890
Take care of Dad, please.

349
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:09,490
Don't worry.

350
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,390
Work hard.

351
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,150
Please take her home later.

352
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:21,450
Yes, well... don't worry. It's not hard anyway.

353
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,900
Let's go, Cracorn.

354
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,440
Go!

355
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:31,280
"Cracorn"?

356
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:41,640
Is it because I don't have the scarf? I feel empty.

357
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,150

358
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:45,930
You found Kim So Eul? Where is he?

359
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,630
He's nearby.

360
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:50,120
Then, let's go now! Okay?

361
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,960
Don't give this to another guy.

362
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,950
It's mine.
