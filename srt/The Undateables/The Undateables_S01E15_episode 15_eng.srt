00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,200
Who are you?

3
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,440
- Me?
 - Yes.

4
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,830
I'm the woman Hoon Nam used to live with. Who are you?

5
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:39,400
You— Wear more clothes. Okay?

6
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,060
 I'm the woman Hoon Nam used to live with.

7
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:10,250
♫  After your everything covers me up  ♫

♫  I call you, I call you  ♫

♫  I call you like this  ♫

15
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:11,050

 ♫  And that I'll be alone again  ♫

17
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:22,800
 Ahjusshi! Hurry up! Hurry up and go!

18
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,250
 What are you doing!? Why aren't you moving the car!?

21

 Move! Get out of the way!

22
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,790
What are you doing on the road?

23
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,270
Hey! Are you shooting a movie or something?

24
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,360
 If you're dating, do it on your own!

25
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,840
 Hey, miss! Hurry up and get in the car!

26
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,170
 Why aren't you going? What are you doing?

27
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,960
 Wow! Really?

28

♫  I call you like this  ♫

29
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:22,680
♫  Like sunlight shining through when opening your eyes  ♫

00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:33,520
♫  Stay by my side  ♫
 ♫  I hope you'll be my love  ♫

31
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,020
At least come up with an excuse.

32
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,220
Can't you at least do that?

33
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:17,240
I guess I'm just going overboard when we're not even officially dating.

34
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,280
Still, can't you at least pretend to be sorry?

35
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,040
Oh, you think that I wouldn't know it's a lie and instead believe it's real and stick to you,

36
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:36,070
all while not knowing it was just empty words and believing you and not letting you go?

37
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,740
So that's what it is.

38
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,670
You're the dating expert. I forgot.

39
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:49,930
I'm someone you can just play with for a bit and throw away. I guess that's me.

40
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,790
Just because we kissed once, I waited for you since early this morning like an idiot,

41
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,520
not knowing that you were with some other woman.

42
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,880
Whichever type of flowers those were, they were very pretty.

43
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,140
Just drop me off anywhere.

44
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,680
Go out with me.

45
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:20,360
♫  Why did I realize only now?  ♫

46

52
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,830
Are you awake now?

53
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,920
Hello.

54
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,520
I believe he had vasovagal syncope* that was caused by stress. 
 (sudden drop in heart rate/blood pressure leading to fainting)

55
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,170
Are you stressed out a lot these days?

56
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,790
Long time, no see, Seung Ryeol.

57
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,950
 You got the wrong person.

58
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,700
Nothing much, but my stomach hurts a lot.

59
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,720
That can be due to stress, too.

60
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,410
But with your age, you never know. Would you like to give him a closer examination?

61
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,210
He got a physical yesterday.

62
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,600
We can check when the results are in then.

63
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,660
He can go home today and rest for now.

64
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,470
Please try to refrain from drinking or smoking.

65
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,030
Thank you.

66
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:09,940
Father, you heard, right? You can't drink for now.

67
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,040
Did you remember me saying that I think a man who can drive in reverse is cool?

68
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,020
I'm really good at playing with jacks, too.

69
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,410
Why did you tell me to drop you off here?

70
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:38,250
I have to buy something here.

71
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:50,080
That younger woman you said you lived with in Australia...

72
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,660
Oh, the friend that's a girl that I lived with in the same house.

73
00:09:54,660 --> 00:10:00,860
To me, that's same as you living in the same house with a man named Joon Soo.

74
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:05,150
The younger woman you said you lived with in Australia...

75
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:09,390
Will she continue to stay with you at the gallery?

76
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,030
She came to me all of a sudden, so I didn't get to talk to her very long.

77
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,860
Seeing how she came to the gallery, I think so.

78
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,420
So she's someone who can just come and see you without calling, huh?

79
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,880
My phone was turned off because of Yook Ryong.

80
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,190
Well, anyway...

81
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,900
Anyway...

82
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,970
She helped me a lot while I was in Australia.

83
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:39,290
So I told her I'd provide her with housing whenever she came to Korea.

84
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,640
Hmm, well,

85
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,940
if you say so.

86
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,250
When you are done with work, what do you want to do?

87
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,350
When I'm done?

88
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,250
We should go on a date.

89
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,300
Today won't work, but tomorrow will.

90
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,600
- Tomorrow?
 - I have to be home early today.

91
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,340
To tell you the truth, my dad got his physical yesterday and I didn't really get to check in on him.

92
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,870
Fine, then let's go on a date tomorrow.

93
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,080
See you tomorrow.

94
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,170
You're going?

95
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,430
I have to.

96
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,720
Just like that?

97
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,430
- Call me.
 - Drive safely.

98
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,760
Welcome.

99
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,060
Hello.

100
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,810
One seaweed soup bento box, please.

101
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,300
Yes.

102
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,030
Here.

103
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,690
Have a rest.

104
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:03,290
Joon Soo, today's incident is to be kept a secret from Jung Eum.

105
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:07,880
If she hears it, she'll nag so much.

106
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,140
Then...

107
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:14,040
Promise that you won't drink or smoke, then I'll think about it.

108
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:19,180
To cut out the drinks is...

109
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,990
I'll just drink a bit.

110
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:25,060
In return, I'll help you, too.

111
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,920
I'll help you out with Jung Eum.

112
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,260
- Deal.
 - Deal.

113
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,860
It's Team Leader Bong's day off today.

114
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,210
Oh, really?

115
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:54,440
I'll keep your tardiness today a secret from her.

116
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,990
Secret? I don't think so.

117
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,240
Does it

118
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,320
make sense that I have to be called in while preparing a table for my ancestors when it's my day off?

119
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,460
No, it doesn't, but I don't think that outfit works either.

120
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,740
I wouldn't have to do this if only you had Oh Doo Ri's case worked out.

121
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,250
They either don't know how to date or don't date.

122
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,660
Why are you all like this?

123
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,970
As if rejecting a hundred dates wasn't enough, now we have ghost members.

124
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,200
Ghost members?

125
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,640
The parents forced them to sign up,

126
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,140
so we can't see the actual members.

127
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,150
No manager has ever seen what they look like.

128
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,020
So what do we do?

129
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,240
What do you mean? You have to take care of all of them.

130
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,520
After all, it's all because of you!

131
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,420
Oh, my goodness.

132
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,650
Preparing an ancestral memorial ceremony table on my birthday...

133
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:12,750
I wonder if my so-called husband knows it or not.

134
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,990
What are you doing?

135
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,690
Just get to work.

136
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,660
 Team Leader...

137
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,510
 Happy Birthday.

138
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,790
 They say that a tiger never eats greens, even if they're about to starve to death.

139
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,590
 I made it with beef.

140
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:06,290
 I'm on my way to catch Mr. Na Ga Young.

141
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,760
She's having a hard time, too.

142
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,660
- You just came back?
 - Yeah.

143
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,570
I found avocado in the fridge, so I made some salad.

144
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,340
Coffee?

145
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,660
I'm good with this.

146
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,890
A sandwich?

147
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,090
Wouldn't it have been nice to call in advance?

148
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,690
Whose phone was turned off?

149
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:17,010
Not a day before, but way in advance.

150
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,630
Why are you asking for such an excessive favor all of a sudden?

151
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,560
You rejected my salad.

152
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,650
Can't you tell by looking?

153
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,870
Date!

154
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,920
You're dating!

155
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,630
From earlier...

156
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,510
That sandwich?

157
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,260
Kang Hoon Nam is dating?

158
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:58,870
You're an unresponsive man who didn't even blink an eye with a sexy woman like me next to you. How did it happen?

159
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:02,250
To do what? Why?

160
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,760
Oh? Why?

161
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,130
Because he made a bet with me to date and dump her.

162
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,260
The person who's never late wasn't coming down, so

163
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,490
I was worried.

164
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,460
Hello there.

165
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,500
I'm Yook Ryong.

166
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,530
- Welcome to—!
 - Go away.

167
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,550
Go!

168
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,140
Ah! So it was a bet?

169
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:54,940
Since you've succeeded in dating her, is dumping her the only thing left to do?

170
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,250
It's not a bet.

171
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,060
Then, what is it?

172
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,710
I'm serious about her.

173
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,670
While you're in Korea,

174
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:08,440
use the place comfortably. I can go in and out of the hotel.

175
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,900
No, no, no.

176
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,010
I will leave.

177
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,080
It's even scarier than telling me to leave.

178
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,260
You said if you stay at a hotel, your dad will track you down.

179
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:20,940
You probably don't have any other place to go because you don't have any friends.

180
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,940
That's true, but

181
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,430
I can probably find an elementary school friend somewhere.

182
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:29,110
Use this place until you find that elementary school friend, then.

183
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,430
There must be a reason why you couldn't go home and came here.

184
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,330
You sense everything so fast.

185
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,880
So with that,

186
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,440
hold this for a moment.

187
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,990
You take care of the cleaning yourself.

188
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:45,860
Don't feel burdened, since I'm the one who offered housing if you ever came to Korea.

189
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,670
Ah!

190
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,710
Don't clean over there.

191
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,890
Yes, yes.

192
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,020
I won't touch it.

193
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,310
Should I have come back earlier?

194
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,730
This is Yoo Jung Eum from Geum Sang Chum Hwa.

195
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:25,270
What? I will come right away!

196
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,720
Hello. Could we have a talk somewhere?

197
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,100
I'm sorry, but I don't have much time. Can we talk in the elevator?

198
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,470
Get on. Hurry!

199
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,480
Mr. Na Ga Yong!

200
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,270
Mr. Na Ga Yong!

201
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:04,310
I'm sorry, but I have to go out quickly. Talk to me on the way.

202
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,540
Yes?

203
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,140
I just need a minute over there so I can find out what type of women you are looking for.

204
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:23,490
I'm sorry, but I have a meeting with buyers here. Afterward, we can talk.

205
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm truly sorry.

206
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,530
He's very passionate.

207
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,130
He is awesome.

208
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,500
 My meeting was moved up five minutes out of the blue.

209
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,040
 I'm leaving first, sorry.

210
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,550
How can he say that he'll date if he acts like this?

211
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:17,960
Why did he even sign up for the membership?

212
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,950
I'm getting hungry all of a sudden.

213
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:27,240
- Grandpa, we're hungry! Give us food! 
 - Grandpa, we're hungry! Give us food!

214
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,950
Okay.

215
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,950
Hey, kids, since it's just us three at home today, should we eat black bean noodles?

216
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:40,250
- Yes, we like that so much! 
- Yes, we like that so much!

217
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,190
 Someone who has abandoned their principles, could they work in politics well?

218
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:45,780
Enjoy!

219
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,160
 This saying exists.

220
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,280
 A home must be at peace...

221
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,960
It's Grandpa!

222
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,760
  He can't even take care of his own family

223
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,620
 so how can we leave the nation to him?

224
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,070
 Assemblyman Kang, resign!

225
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,910
 Long time, no see?

226
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,880
 You couldn't even protect your family, yet you want to get involved in politics?

227
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,450
 Stop making promises you can't keep.

228
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:13,250
 Get away from our neighborhood, you scum.

229
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,560
Grandpa, what does "opinion" mean?

230
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,170
Grandpa, you can't keep something?

231
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,890
No, no, no. I keep things well.

232
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,180
- Why are you turning it off when you're on it? 
 - Why are you turning it off when you're on it?

233
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:31,560
Let's be quiet! Hush!

234
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,090
Shall we play the piano after we finish eating?

235
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,920
Should we sing the song Grandma likes?

236
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,950
- Yes! 
 - Yes!

237
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:43,290

238
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:54,160
♫  No, I'm not color blind
I know the world is black and white  ♫

239

♫  Stop this train...  ♫

241
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:17,450
Yook Ryong, could you send me a text?

242
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:23,640
Huh?

243
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,080
It's getting through?

244
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,070

245
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:34,370
I sent you a text saying you were an idiot, but why aren't you saying anything?

246
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:41,420
I could be... an idiot in love?

247
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,990

248
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:58,950
I told her to contact me, but why isn't she?

249
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,950
What's wrong? He's scaring me.

250
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,170
  Go out with me.

251

00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,140

♫  oh slowly slowly  ♫

255
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:51,620
Want to go out? Let's date.

258

It must be Cracorn!

259
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,430
 You didn't forget about meeting tomorrow, right?

260
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,960
♫  Can I convey  ♫

261
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,650
What the heck! It's not Cracorn!

262
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,590
Not you, Chul Soo!

263
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,840
Give me a text from her, you cell phone!

264
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,860
Say, "It's Cracorn, it's Cracorn!"

265
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,970
Good, good.

266
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:23,860
The ocean. The mermaid is swimming in the ocean.

267
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,350
Wait! Wait a minute.

268
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:30,040
What did I say before? Wave, slightly.

269
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:36,120
Did I just see a ghost or what?

270
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,910
Okay, then! We'll wrap it up here.

271
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,990
Go eat.

272
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,230
Come here.

273
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,040
You should've told me that you were here. When did you get here?

274
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,800
Last night.

275
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,170
If you had told me earlier, I would've gone to the airport.

276
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,030
Then we would've met early.

277
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:02,260
I guess. Should I have called you beforehand?

278
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,580
Where did you leave your luggage?

279
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,590
- Hoon Nam's gallery?
 - Yes.

280
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:10,420
That's the best place to hide when I come to Korea.

281
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,930
Did you come here in secret again?

282
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:15,200
You know what happens if I get summoned by my dad.

283
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,550
Your dad still hasn't given up on you yet?

284
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:21,370
He probably never will.

285
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:24,680
Don't regret it later. Just make his wish come true.

286
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,020
Isn't meeting someone you love and getting married nice, too?

287
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:32,360
Lovey-dovey. It makes me jealous.

288
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,310
When I know for sure that I won't regret it, then I'll do it.

289
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:39,560
So, why did you come to Korea out of the blue?

290
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,950
Can you introduce me to this guy?

291
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,020

292
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:57,420
Raise your shoulder up.

293
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,810
Is there pain?

294
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,030
Yes, it hurts.

295
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,060
I think it's a rotator cuff issue.

296
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:05,410
Relax. Breathe.

297
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:09,600
Just a moment. Relax and breathe.

298
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,670
You can't exercise for a while.

299
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,640
Definitely no bench pressing and things like that.

300
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,110
Okay, I understand.

301
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,970
Rotate your shoulder slowly.

302
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:24,030
That feels much better.

303
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,910
That's a relief.

304
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:32,550
Ta-da! Le Chic.

305
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,330
This is about it.

306
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,710
That's why you came here.

307
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,930
Going to the hospital overseas is a pain.

308
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:47,680
I got my shoulder treatment in Australia, but I want to get physical therapy in Korea.

309
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,130
How aggressively were you surfing?

310
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:52,660
The wave was so nice.

311
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:56,250
They told me not to go in, but I still did and fell off.

312
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,690
And a rock just happened to be there.

313
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:01,160
Anyway, how are his skills?

314
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,190
What more can I say about the "Wanted Man"?

315
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:10,930
You'll want to have him as soon as you see him, but you can't have Joon Soo. Don't even look at him.

316
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:13,050
I already have a man that I want.

317
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:16,000
- Have you ever seen me not get the guy that I picked? 
 - Geez!

318
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,600
You temptress who wants to own everything!

319
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:26,700
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

320
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,790
- You're working so hard. 
 - Don't mention it.

321
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:33,510
Let's put this one here.

322
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,030

323
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,580

324
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,990

325
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,560
How can I fall?

326
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,840
Thank you, I fell.

327
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,490
It's nothing.

328
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:07,220
Pick up the ones on that side and I'll pick up the ones here.

329
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,020
Your voice doesn't seem like someone from our neighborhood.

330
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,000
How can you know just by my voice?

331
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,820
I'm kind of like the head of this neighborhood.

332
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,320
Oh, I see.

333
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,170
I lived here for a bit a long time ago.

334
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,470
Oh, really? I've lived here for a long time, too.

335
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,450
We may have passed by each other at least once.

336
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:28,690
I guess that could've happened.

337
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:31,060
Right.

338
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,820
Thank you.

339
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:36,270
I noticed that there's a cultural seminar here.

340
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:39,140
Is that only for the people in this neighborhood?

341
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:44,090
No, anyone who signs up for it can join.

342
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:48,390
Is that so? I've always been interested in sewing.

343
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,400
Huh?

344
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,960
You have a lot of interest? I see.

345
00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:00,260
You must teach traditional arts and crafts. Could I learn, too?

346
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:05,150
Huh? Oh, yes. Come when you have time.

347
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:10,820
Okay, I will do that. I'm moving out and looking for a place to live.

348
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,470
Excuse me?

349
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:15,760
Nothing. I'll come for your class.

350
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,220
Thank you.

351
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,790
Move out?

352
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:35,900
