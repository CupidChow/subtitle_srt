00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:39,690

2
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,460
♫  After your everything  ♫

3
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,250
♫  covers me up  ♫

4
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,900
♫  I can't move, not even a step  ♫

5
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,830
♫  Like that star  ♫

6
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,100
♫  in the night sky  ♫

7
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,280
Don't leave, Jung Eum.

8
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,390
Why?

9
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:42,160
♫  My greed  ♫

10
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,820
♫  keeps growing  ♫

11
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,330
Why

12
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,500
are you telling me not to go?

13
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,370
Tell me

14
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,880
why I shouldn't go.

15
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,370
I...

16
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,860
♫  It forms on your lips and finds you  ♫

17
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,160
Because I love you.

18
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,420
♫  I call you  ♫

19
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,750
♫  I call you  ♫

20
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,720
♫  I call you like this  ♫

21
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,440
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,210
♫  I'm even scared to sleep and dream  ♫

23
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,030
Even if you leave, I can't do anything.

24
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,580
I love you.

25
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,470
♫  And that I'll be alone  ♫

26
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,190
♫  again  ♫

27
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,880
I love you, Jung Eum.

28
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:59,600
♫  I call you, I call you  ♫

29
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,410
Thank you.

30
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,970
You didn't run away

31
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,480
and you gathered your courage to come to me.

32
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,330
♫  Like sunlight shining through when opening your eyes  ♫

33
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,960
♫  Stay by my side  ♫

34
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:26,320
♫  I hope you'll be my love  ♫

35
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,230
Should I tell you something that happened in the past?

36
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,280
Something in the past?

37
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,810
A long time ago,

38
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,460
there was a man.

39
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:02,700
That man loved a woman so much,

40
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,600
But the two of them

41
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,760
had to break up.

42
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:16,860
Later, when they met after a long time passed,

43
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,770
that man

44
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,370
was already married.

45
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:31,530
Those two made the wrong choices while exhausted from missing each other.

46
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:36,400
As a result, two women suffered.

47
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,290
Two women?

48
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,200
My mother.

49
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,540
My real mother

50
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,330
and my current mother.

51
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,060
I...

52
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,490
am the child born from a mistake two people made.

53
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:15,230
I thought I would never tell someone that I love them.

54
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:19,680
If love means hurting someone else,

55
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,110
I was determined never to love.

56
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,050
 Son.

57
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,200
 I love you.

58
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,810
 Mom!

59
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,740
 Your father came too late again.

60
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,030
 I waited for so long.

61
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,840
 Are you Hoon Nam?

62
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:57,710
Should I tell you something, too?

63
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,040
There was once a diving athlete...

64
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,320
 - Jung Eum, do well. 
 - Jung Eum, fighting!

65
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,020
 Mom and Joon Soo are here!

66
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:11,790
 In front of her sick mom who had come to see her,

67
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,980
 she gave up on the competition and ran off.

68
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,160
 Mom! Mom! What to do? Mom!

69
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,930
 - Mom!  
 - That was

70
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,330
me.

71
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,960
My mother passed away. When I stopped diving,

72
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,360
there was a time when my father and I didn't even make eye contact,

73
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,520
because we would tear up every time we did.

74
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,400
How my mother became like that...

75
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,730
felt like my fault.

76
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:06,230
 My Jung Eum has no energy.

77
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:16,160
 She must think that it is her fault. She doesn't even cry.

78
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:22,090
 The kid that always smiled is now always lying down.

79
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:29,600
 Jung Eum's Mom, it must be so hard.

80
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,140
 She is unable to do what she liked so much.

81
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,690
 She can't dive anymore.

82
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,230
 What is all this?

83
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,440
 Sit down.

84
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,990
 Okay.

85
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:30,650
 Dad. I'll cheer up.

86
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,670
 So, Dad, you too.

87
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:39,930
 So, we should...

88
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,680
 Have strength.

89
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,630
It's likely that, at that time,

90
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:21,230
if the people who love me had not been around

91
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,210
there would be no me now.

92
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:31,190
From now on, I'll be by your side.

93
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:35,410
I will

94
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,000
love you

95
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,620
a lot.

96
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,980

97
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,580
♫  Lately I'm curious about you  ♫

98
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:32,170
♫  I want to know more  ♫

99
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:36,310
♫  In my head I become your other half  ♫

100
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:41,250
♫  I hastily imagine it  ♫

101
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:46,970
♫  oh slowly slowly  ♫
	♫  Can I convey  ♫

102
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:51,640
♫  my feelings so you won't be surprised?  ♫

103
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,650
Where are you going?

104
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,870
You're awake?

105
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,040
Why aren't you sleeping?

106
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,030
Don't look at me, don't look at me! My face is a mess right now!

107
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,640
When is it not?

108
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,420
What?

109
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,500
You were pretty, you are pretty, and you will be pretty.

110
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,180
- What do you mean I will be pretty? 
 - I promise you will be.

111
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,970
What if you break that promise?

112
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,940
I can't. It's my standard.

113
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,240
What are you saying?

114
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,580
Where are you going?

115
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,530
I really have to go. My father will scold me. I also have to go to work.

116
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,710
You said that you wouldn't leave.

117
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,560
What are you doing? So childish!

118
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,990
You can't get out, you can't leave.

119
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,490
- Let go. 
 - No.

120
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,640
Wait, let go.

121
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,800
Ah! Then, how about you use your vacation days?

122
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,700
What vacation?

123
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:59,780
I have Zero Members, the Ghost Member, and the member who's rejected a hundred dates, it's no joke.

124
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,470
It won't be enough, even with overtime.

125
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:06,690
Oh, then, together with this relationship expert,

126
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,550
why don't we have a three-night, four-day meeting?

127
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:15,480
What relationship expert? I'm leaving.

128
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,220
Did you forget something?

129
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,860
- Did you just get back? 
 - Yeah.

130
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,860
From where? With whom?

131
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,380
I have to go to work. Let's talk later.

132
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:03,990
By any chance... were you with Kang Hoon Nam until now?

133
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:11,120
You idiot. After he lied to you, you still don't know? Are you a fool?

134
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,810
That's right, I'm a fool.

135
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:20,390
Once I like someone, I fall for them without seeing anything, like an idiot. Are you satisfied?

136
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:39,700

137
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,650
It's sunny outside, why the raincoat?

138
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:53,500
It's still not completely dry yet, so it's to prevent any water damage.

139
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:58,170
If I ever get showered with money, I'll make sure to get you an outfit.

140
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,080
Why don't I get showered with money before you?

141
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,380
How is it going with the VVIP clients' meeting? Why is there no report?

142
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,620
Why? Was there a claim from Lee Soo Ji?

143
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,720
Of course not, especially since the other person was Kang Hoon Nam.

144
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,700
It's just that there was no report on how they were doing.

145
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,560
I'll tell you about that in a bit.

146
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,360
Okay.

147
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,550
Ah! Team Leader.

148
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:30,700
Just in case, if I were to request a vacation...

149
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,890
A vacation? Yoo Jung Eum, are you crazy?

150
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:36,260
Do you know what is happening these days? A vacation?

151
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:40,930
I don't even remember the last time I had a vacation. Just because you've been doing well you're looking for vacation.

152
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,630
The Zero members, the Ghost member, the one-hundred rejections member.

153
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:47,400
Staying up all night three nights and four days wouldn't be enough to deal with them all!

154
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:52,740
Staying up all night? Then, this time, should I hold a big meeting

155
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,310
and stay with that dating expert?

156
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,790
With the dating expert?

157
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:01,150
Yes. There is a dating expert that coaches the zero clients.

158
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:05,980
That person keeps saying that we should hold an emergency meeting.

159
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,400
Can you trust that person?

160
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:12,980
You saw it. Clients Ahn In Jeong, Kim So Eul, and Oh Doo Ri were handled by him.

161
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,700
Really?

162
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,450
Then go ahead.

163
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,910
I'll pay you for overtime. Fighting.

164
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,100
Thank you!

165
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,450
Oh, I can't believe it.

166
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,230
Oh my.

167
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,630
President!

168
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,740
Ah, you scared me. When did you come?

169
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,140
It's been exactly three minutes and forty-seven seconds.

170
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,910
In other words, since you started the one-man show.

171
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:17,770
One-man show? Have I not tortured you enough lately?

172
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,150
If you're going to be like this, I will use up the blank contract right now.

173
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,880
I said that you have to get my permission before you use it. What is it?

174
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,080
This person you told me to check.

175
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,280
The woman who works in a related industry to Na Ga Young, that's her schedule.

176
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:37,410
This is where we went to investigate last time. This is a condition report.

177
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,610
Your face, not now, but before.

178
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:48,520
Your face is blooming. Did something good happen?

179
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:54,280
No, it's just... The world is beautiful.

180
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,600
Oh! You're back. Joon Soo has the night shift today.

181
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,450
Is that so?

182
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,160
I don't know if he even has underwear. Hurry and go change.

183
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,700
Pickled plums are delicious.

184
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,390
 So, I made a promise with a plum.

185
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,720
 Promise?

186
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,040
 To meet after a month.

187
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,940
I wonder if Jook is doing well.

188
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:48,050
Dad, you remember Jook?

189
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:52,170
Of course, his face isn't easily forgotten. He is as good looking as Joon Soo.

190
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:57,220
He paid the deposit and the rent on time, too.

191
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,160
What do you think of a person like that?

192
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,640
Why? Were you interested?

193
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,410
No. No, no, no. Just asking.

194
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,340
Well, he's as good as Joon Soo, I guess. He seems nice and he says he's a gallery manager, too.

195
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,140
When I asked, his family was good, too. But...

196
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,490
But?

197
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,540
He seems strangely familiar, he looks like

198
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:26,130
a despicable man I know of.

199
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,550
You have someone you hate?

200
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,380
Of course I do, I'm human.

201
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,660
Then, with that person...

202
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,860
If I met someone like him, what would you think?

203
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,500
You?

204
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,840
You're getting way ahead of yourself.

205
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,090
Do you know what "dare to dream" means?

206
00:18:55,090 --> 00:19:00,110
You are the only one who will get hurt by dating someone who is in a different class than you.

207
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:04,980
There isn't a difference in class. Don't you have any pride in your daughter?

208
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,060
You don't even scrub your skin. Don't say such nonsense and eat your dinner.

209
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,980
I packed socks for Joon Soo, so take them over to him.

210
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,590
Me?

211
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,420
Dad, can you go instead?

212
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,020
You won't even repay him with underwear?

213
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,580
When you work at night,

214
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,690
Joon Soo prepares not just your socks but even your innerwear, like underwear and bra—

215
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:28,040
I got it. I'll go.

216
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,800
Eat and then go take it to him.

217
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,390
It's not like I will live without seeing him.

218
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,580
  The guy you decided to date officially came to your house.

219
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,680
  Don't you think that you're not trying hard enough to push aside your male friend?

220
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,710
 Is that so?

221
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:58,290
 Yes. I was really hurt.

222
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,560
Well, let's deal with it after seeing him.

223
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:07,910
Dad! The pickled plums are upstairs, right?

224
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:14,100
You... where do you usually go on dates?

225
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,080
There's a lot you're curious about recently.

226
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:23,050
My dates are dynamic.

227
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:26,560
Then, what about a memorable date?

228
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,120
Memorable date?

229
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,840
There are good restaurant dates.

230
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:35,870
 Noona, why are you not eating?

231
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:38,810
 I'm also eating a lot.

232
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,700
 This is really delicious.

233
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,650
There is also a gallery date.

234
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,340
Famous site dates.

235
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,450
 Catch me if you can!

236
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,390
 Sun Hee.

237
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:07,880
 Yook Ryong.

238
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,800
Good restaurants, famous sites...

239
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,890
Don't go!

240
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,830
- Why are you getting mad? 
 - I'm sorry.

241
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:29,380
Especially a gallery date, never do it!

242
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,090
Why?

243
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:41,410
If you can't see her anymore, you can just stop going to those other places, but the gallery will become a daily hell...

244
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,220
It could happen.

245
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,920
That's only a problem if I can't see her anymore.

246
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,560
Aren't you too confident in yourself?

247
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,100
This isn't confidence. It's called being certain.

248
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,230
I'm here.

249
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,900
You're here!

250
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,460
What the heck?

251
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,000
What is this? Why are you carrying such a heavy thing?

252
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,650
You should've called me.

253
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:15,680
He's fallen too deep.

254
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:22,770
Mix it with chili paste and eat it, or you can mix it in water and drink it.

255
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:27,420
Then, should we eat it together.

256
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:31,450
I have to deliver socks today.

257
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:37,050
I'm not in the mood for you to deliver them, and I'm even less in a mood to hear you say it.

258
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:41,820
I thought it'd be good to make it clear with Joon Soo.

259
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,140
Can't you do it through a phone call?

260
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,880
I have to tell him face-to-face.

261
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,180
Okay. Go tell him face-to-face.

262
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,990
This is Choi Joon Soo.

263
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,890
Yes.

264
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:13,690
The night shift for tomorrow? I'll just do it again.

265
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,390
Yes. It's alright.

266
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:18,690
Yes, I understand.

267
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,110
Yes?

268
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,130
Why are you here?

269
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,020
Dad told me to bring this to you.

270
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,550
Are you really busy? Why are you not coming home?

271
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,300
I'm a little busy.

272
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:59,540
Even if you are busy, sleep at home. Dad worries.

273
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,920
Me too.

274
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,670
- Can we talk for a bit? 
- Can we talk for a bit?

275
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,580
This morning, I'm sorry that I lashed out at you.

276
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:27,100
It was because you kept asking me so many questions.

277
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:36,920
It's my fault for pressuring you. I'm sorry.

278
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:49,680
Joon Soo, is it not possible to be like before?

279
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,740
I'm not sure.

280
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,370
I... am going to believe in him again.

281
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,660
He is a person who even made a bet on you.

282
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:11,720
I know. I've thought about it a lot.

283
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,410
I'm really determined.

284
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:19,630
You know I don't know how to use my brain.

285
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:26,760
I've lived by working hard without looking around and only knowing how to go all-in.

286
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:35,420
Although I might get hurt again living like that, I want to follow my heart.

287
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:46,460
Even if you lose me because of him?

288
00:25:54,560 --> 00:26:02,980
Joon So, do you remember when you rejected me after I confessed to you in high school?

289
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:07,640
I was serious that time. I cried my eyes out for days.

290
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:16,080
Still, I didn't want to lose you, so I stayed by your side as a friend.

291
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:23,400
That's how we were able to stay as friends for over twenty years.

292
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,620
Let's do it that way again.

293
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:33,900
This time, you be the one to overcome this critical moment.

294
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:42,510
The choice will be yours, but I don't want to lose you.

295
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,560
Please, return to being my friend, Joon Soo.

296
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:21,670
