1
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:38,390

2
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,280
Hello. I'm Kang Hoon Nam, who's going to be living here, starting today.

3
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,400
- Are you okay? 
 - You didn't hurt yourself?

4
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,490
No, I'm not hurt.

5
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,580
You came?

6
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,620
You don't have a lot of stuff.

7
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,020
You see that over there?

8
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,370
Here's the Jook room. You can use that room.

9
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,050
Take him to the Jook room.

10
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,070
The Jook room?

11
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,790
Oh! Mae, Nan, Gook, Jook.

12
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,630
I'm in the Mae room. You're in the Nan room. Joon Soo is in the Gook room.

13
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,490
And he's in the Jook room.

14
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,940
Since there are three people renting here, we should have a system.

15
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,080
Oh, and take this to wipe his floor one more time.

16
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,590
No, no! We will do it today, so go and change.

17
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,360
We should have a small welcoming party for you.

18
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,240
Yes, thank you. I will go unload my luggage now.

19
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,170
Joon Soo, please clean this up. I'll prepare some food.

20
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,550
You were surprised, right?

21
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,920
How did this happen?

22
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,600
What do you mean, how did this happen? You're cute.

23
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,550
 Jung Eum, your dad is looking for you.

24
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,390
Why?

25
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:20,890
He can't find the bean paste.

26
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,560
Go ahead. I'll take care of things here.

27
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,180
Okay.

28
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,770
I didn't get to properly greet you before.

29
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,300
Welcome to our house.

30
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,980
Why shake hands like we don't know each other?

31
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,360
I'm also a part of "us" now.

32
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:54,650
I confessed to Jung Eum yesterday.

33
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,860
Really? Well, I decided to go out with Jung Eum yesterday.

34
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,310
Well, this is a classic case, but it;s why they say love is all about timing.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,510
You're going out with Jung Eum?

36
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,260
Yes, we're going out.

37
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,470
Is that so?

38
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,950
You're going out.

39
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:29,640
Well, you go out with every woman easily.

40
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,930
I didn't go out with her

41
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,720
because it was easy.

42
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,460
Jung Eum... is more innocent than she looks.

43
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,650
She is gullible, too.

44
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,760
You should tell this to someone who wants to deceive her.

45
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,680
I can't trust someone who says that dating is a roller coaster.

46
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,510
So you should enjoy your thrill somewhere else.

47
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,280
It's you who are enjoying the thrill, not me.

48
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,240
What is the reason you switched your path and jumped in the middle of our relationship all of a sudden?

49
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,360
It's not sudden.

50
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,140
Jung Eum and I have been together for a long time.

51
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:14,840
Don't confuse love with history.

52
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,050
 The table is set, so come out!

53
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,800

54
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,840

55
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,180
Meeting this way is fate.

56
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,690
It's embarrassing, but since there's a new family member, let's introduce ourselves.

57
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,120
What do you mean introduce ourselves?

58
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,730
- Yes. 
 - Let's do it.

59
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,220
Go ahead.

60
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,460
I'll start.

61
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,610
I... am Yoo Seung Ryeol.

62
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,820
You can say that I'm the son of Byul-dong.

63
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,900

64
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,040

65
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,000

66
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,480
Well, I'm...

67
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,620
I'm Kang Hoon Nam.

68
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,630

69
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,640

70
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,740

71
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,110

72
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,820
I'm Choi Joon Soo.

73
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,790

74
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,070

75
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,370

76
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:37,090

77
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,640
I'm Yoo Jung Eum.

78
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,580

79
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,490
Why are you just Yoo Jung Eum?

80
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:54,400
She's my daughter and was originally in the national diving team.

81
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,550
But these days, she won't even go to the bathhouse because she's scared of water.

82
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,630
Dad.

83
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:01,520
Not just that, she quit diving and was unemployed so I wanted her to get married.

84
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,010
I signed her up for a marriage service,

85
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,690
but she ran away at every blind date.

86
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,120
So she couldn't get married and

87
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,380
somehow she became an employee at a marriage service company instead,

88
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,060
but she doesn't bring home any money.

89
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,870
They are also our family members!

90
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,470
Bbang Soon and Bbang Shik.

91
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,760
Right, right.

92
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,360
If we're done with the introductions,

93
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,320
I will announce the rental rules.

94
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,770
Rental rules?

95
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,640
We had those at our house?

96
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,490
Now that we have new family members, I want to manage our household more systematically.

97
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,400
Number one,

98
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,380
bathroom use will be in order of whoever wakes up first.

99
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,850
Okay, number two, refer to the menu for meal times.

100
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:48,030
Number three, on Sunday mornings, we will have fried eggs.

101
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,370
Be sure to wake up and eat them.

102
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,860
Number four is important.

103
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,060
Use a small lamp after midnight.

104
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,340
I'm saying, turn off the light and go to sleep.

105
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,910
If you think you'll be coming home late, don't come in at all.

106
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,870
This means, sleep outside. Okay?

107
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,810
Any objections? No, right?

108
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,420
Pass.

109
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,560
We've passed it now.

110
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,280
The meat is being cooked, so let's eat.

111
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,190
Father, it's not much.

112
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,840
I couldn't come here empty-handed.

113
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,640
I've brought something small.

114
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,720
Just a little something...

115
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,780
It has glasses, too.

116
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,160
Please, take a glass.

117
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,460
- Here. 
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

118
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,280
Yes.

119
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,720
Jung Eum, you too.

120
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,730
Here. I'm sorry.

121
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,360
There are only three glasses.

122
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,630
Here. Please try some.

123
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,750
No, you can't.

124
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:01,170
Father, you promised that you wouldn't drink.

125
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,050
Promises are made to be broken.

126
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,600
And it seems like really good liquor.

127
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,890
You know, it's zero calories if I enjoy it.

128
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,730
Also, a drink becomes a nutritional drink if I enjoy it.

129
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,060
Don't you think so, Mr. Jook Room?

130
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,680
Of course, please take it.

131
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,690
No, you can't.

132
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,840
But it's his sincerity.

133
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,530
Dad, take one shot.

134
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:30,340
One shot of liquor is like medicine.

135
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,730
There's no bad person who likes liquor.

136
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,600
I'm off tomorrow, too.

137
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,480
Father, you have nothing to do with taking a day off.

138
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,550
Oh, right! Yoo Jung Eum when you stayed out that night...

139
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,900
Stayed out? What? What?

140
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,080
No, that night when you stayed out,

141
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,570
the pork belly I had with Father was so good.

142
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,400
But tonight's meat isn't as good.

143
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:01,080
Father, that night when Jung Eum stayed out—

144
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,580
Joon Soo, Joon Soo.

145
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,500
Have a drink.

146
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,900
I don't have a glass.

147
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,750
This is good, but very strong.

148
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:32,500
You sure have to drink expensive alcohol in a proper glass to appreciate the taste.

149
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:53,320
Father, so how did you meet Jook?

150
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,660
He came here with the poster, and the first impression he gave was good.

151
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:06,800
Our Jung Eum has to meet someone who leaves a good first impression, right?

152
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,170
This girl has no taste in men, she keeps dating tiger-like men.

153
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:17,680
She has to meet someone good like our Joon Soo.

154
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,660
Aigoo, Dad's glass is empty.

155
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,540
Please, have a drink.

156
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,500
Thank you, Jook.

157
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,750
Father, please speak comfortably since

158
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,940
we'll keep seeing each other from now on.

159
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,900
Should I?

160
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,770
Father! If...

161
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,080
That is, if

162
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,320
our Jung Eum stays out with another guy—

163
00:10:54,400 --> 00:11:01,400
Joon Soo. Eat while you talk, too.

164
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,610
Joon Soo, eat. Eat a lot.

165
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,170
So you're saying, if Jung Eum stayed out,

166
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:17,650
but that's not going to happen. However, if

167
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,870
she stayed out with some crazy guy

168
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,640
then...

169
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:29,900
I would catch him and Jung Eum

170
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,100
and break their legs.

171
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,820
Like this.

172
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,100

173
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:10,630
♫  Oh love, I love you, Only U  ♫
♫  I'm in big trouble  ♫

174
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,700
♫  I think about you all day  ♫

175
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:18,170
♫  My heart feels like it'll explode  ♫
♫  I can't express it in words  ♫

176
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:24,590
Aigoo. Why aren't you sleeping? Are you going somewhere?

177
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,610
I wanted to know how the air was outside.

178
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,290
What do I do?

179
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,300
♫  Your love, baby, it lets me breathe  ♫

180
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:54,540
♫  It's like a sea breeze for my blocked heart  ♫

181
00:12:54,540 --> 00:13:00,330
♫  Your love, could it be this good?  ♫

182
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:05,440
♫  Cuz you are a part of me, baby  ♫

183
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,740
Where are you going?

184
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:16,920
What a good daughter. Are you going to your dad?

185
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,240
No, I'm hot. All of a sudden, my temperature is rising.

186
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:27,390
Are you sick? Should I tell your dad?

187
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,270
Look at this guy. I let you off easy. Are you really going to be like this?

188
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,010
Are you a hall monitor or something? I'm not a kid.

189
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:36,380
Go! Go to your room.  You're not going? Not going?

190
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,200
Father—!

191
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,230
That little kid. How dare he call me "Jook" when I'm an adult...

192
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,910
Should I throw a punch at him?

193
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,780
I'm holding myself back because of Cracorn.

194
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,430
 Cracorn, don't fall asleep. Wait for me.

195
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,350
I was drawing a picture, why?

196
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,930
I wanted to see if you fell asleep with your light on.

197
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:40,420
Father is sensitive about the electric bill.

198
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,800

199
00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:01,150

200
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,400
I almost fell asleep.

201
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,850
Ah, that guy...

202
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,970
Oh! It's nice.

203
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:29,670
Cracorn, you came out because a guy told you to this late at night. Are you sure you're an innocent person?

204
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,300
Innocent? Who said that?

205
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:37,090
I'm a girl who eats ramen noodles well.

206
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:41,580
What I mean is, what woman over thirty says they're innocent?

207
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:45,130
The guy you decided to date officially came to your house.

208
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,550
Don't you think that you're not trying hard enough to push aside your male friend?

209
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,550
Did I do that?

210
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,080
You did. I was really hurt.

211
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,370
Really? I didn't know.

212
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:57,110
I didn't know you were hurt.

213
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,150
But how long will you let that guy stay at home?

214
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,280
Why?

215
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,470
Things have changed. I heard that he confessed.

216
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,350
He told you, huh?

217
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:23,170
Yes, he told me in a very challenging way.

218
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,330
Living with a guy in the same house who confessed to you

219
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,830
concerns me as a boyfriend.

220
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:46,650
I'm... in debt to Joon Soo.

221
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,840
Debt. How much?

222
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,990
This isn't something that someone else can pay back for me.

223
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,380
It's a debt from the heart.

224
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,870
A debt from the heart?

225
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:04,370
Well, it's also the actual deposit for the house.

226
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:11,130
He was there at the hardest times in my life

227
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:15,020
and has stayed by my side no matter what.

228
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:19,940
He's a precious friend, a teacher,

229
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:24,130
and like a sibling.

230
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:32,650
I see. He did those things in my place.

231
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,600
I'm thankful.

232
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:40,770
You can do that for me from now on.

233
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:44,240
I just want to be your manager.

234
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,210
But I know how you feel, too.

235
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,350
Give me a little time.

236
00:18:54,350 --> 00:19:00,220
Can you be respectful to Joon Soo,

237
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,710
who is a precious part of my memories?

238
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,280
I understand.

239
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,630
Thank you.

240
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:32,200

241
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:44,410
Whoa!

242
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,990
♫  Lately I'm curious about you  ♫

243
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:55,750
♫  I want to know more  ♫

244
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,950
♫  In my head I become your other half  ♫

245
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:04,100
♫  I hastily imagine it  ♫

246
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,400
♫  oh slowly slowly  ♫

247
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,400
♫  Can I carefully  ♫

248
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,500
♫  knock on your heart?  ♫

249
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,200
♫  oh slowly slowly  ♫

250
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,200
♫  Can I convey  ♫

251
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,900
♫  my feelings so you won't be surprised?  ♫

252
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:32,830
Right, this is her house.

253
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,300
 Please, eat.

254
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,190
Hurry and wash up so we can have breakfast.

255
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,600
It's self-serve.

256
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,200
Let's eat.

257
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,000
Let's eat.

258
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,800
Enjoy.

259
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,000
Thank you for the food.

260
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,600
Thank you for the food.

261
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,300
It turned out well.

262
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,800
Yes, thank you for the meal.

263
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,700
It's delicious.

264
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,000
Where's Father?

265
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I don't know. He went out after eating.

266
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,800
Father's not here?

267
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,100
Everyone, put on your clothes.

268
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,400
Why, why? Where are we going? Hmm?

269
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,000
You put on your clothes, too.

270
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,500
If we get caught, we'll be in big trouble.

271
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,900
What do you mean big trouble?

272
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,600
We're supposed to marinate plums today.

273
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,800

274
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,800

275
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,200

276
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,000
Who is going to eat all these plums? Is your father running a business?

277
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,400
Plums in the summer, kimchi in the winter.

278
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,300
We eat it and our neighbors eat it, too.

279
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,200
He gives them to people who live alone, too.

280
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,600
He does good deeds.

281
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,800
He's just nosy. Who eats plums these days?

282
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,400
He always gets sick, saying he's achy all over after doing this.

283
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,300
What? He's just like someone I know.

284
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,070
- Father! 
 - Father!

285
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:12,020
Did he go somewhere?

286
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,800
We did twice as much last year.

287
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,700
I guess I can eat less.

288
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,200
You all worked hard, I will buy you  makgeolli*  (rice wine) tonight.

289
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,000
I will.

290
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,300
When do we eat this?

291
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,000
You've never done this before, right?

292
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Why would I need to?

293
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,800
Jung Eum and I do this every year.

294
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,800
I didn't ask you.

295
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,400
We let it sit for about a month and then we can mix up the sugared ones with chili pepper paste.

296
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,800
Or we can put it in cold water and drink it. It's delicious.

297
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
Then, you made a promise with plums?

298
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,400
A promise?

299
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,600
To meet in a month.

300
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,400
Aren't you hungry?

301
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,800
You're not hungry? I'm hungry all of a sudden.

302
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,400
A challenging choice always develops a person.

303
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,200
A stable choice has a high probability of failing.

304
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,600
You're more traditional than I thought.

305
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,300
You're more sensitive towards trends than I thought.

306
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,400
So, is it  ddeokbokki*  (rice cakes) and  maekju* (beer)  or chicken and  maekju*  (beer)?

307
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,200
- Chicken and maekju. 
 - Ddeokbokki. 
 - Chicken—Chimaek.

308
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,000
What do you call it, then? Do you call it Ddeokmaek? Rice cakes and beer?

309
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,700
Oh, what an old person.

310
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,500

311
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,410
This is good, right?

312
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,800
I have to meet someone and will catch up to you.

313
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,600
Go ahead first.

314
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,990
I don't think he knows anyone in this neighborhood.

315
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,100
Should we try it? To digest our food and all that?

316
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,700
Deal!

317
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,800
What does Chief Yoo usually like?

318
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,400
Since you're here every day, you'd know well.

319
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,000
Since you're good looking, I'll tell you.

320
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,300
Come here.

321
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,800
This is organic juice.

322
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,600
If you give these to him, he will really like it.

323
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,990
Thanks for the good information.

324
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,800
- Crush it! 
 - Crush it!

325
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,600
Crush it! Crush it!  Crush it!

326
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,600
Hit, hit, hit.

327
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,400
Crush it!

328
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,200
- What are you doing? 
 - Do you want to play with us?

329
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,200
No, why would I do something I didn't even do as a kid?

330
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,700
This is a scam.

331
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,000
I'm Chun Li!

332
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,600
Crush it!

333
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,800
Take that!

334
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,400
- Crush it! 
 - Crush it!

335
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,300
- Crush it! 
 - I'm going into it now.

336
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,200
Hadou—Hadouken! 
 (T/N: a move from street fighter, lit. "surge fist.")

337
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,300
It's a shuttlecock.

338
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,810
Do you know how to kick a shuttlecock, Jook?

339
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 Do you have a unique quality you like in a man?

340
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,200
 Well, a man who's good at shuttlecock?

341
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,910
Did you just say shuttlecock?

342
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,200
Alright. Foot touching the ground or not?

343
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,800
- No. 
 - Yes.

344
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,800
So, without any rules, it's just whoever kicks it the most.

345
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,400
Ready! Start!

346
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,600
One, two, three.

347
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,400
♫  I'm in big trouble  ♫

348
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,400
♫  I think about you all day  ♫

349
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,700
♫  My heart feels like it'll explode  ♫

350
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,200
♫  I can't express it in words  ♫

351
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,800
♫  I'm falling in love with you forever  ♫

352
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,600
♫  I'm feeling like I'm feeling this is love  ♫

353
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,000
♫  I'm feeling good I'm feeling this is love  ♫

354
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,400
♫  I'm feeling like I'm feeling this is love  ♫

355
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,700
♫  I feel the love, do you feel the love?  ♫

356
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,000
Kang Hoon Nam wins.

357
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,800
Time out, time out, time out! It hit my ankle bone!

358
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,400
Let's do something else.
