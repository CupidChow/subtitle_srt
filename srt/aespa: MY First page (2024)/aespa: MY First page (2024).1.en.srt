1
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,542
Other!

2
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:33,082
Pray before starting:

3
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:36,542
"Let us feel proud at the end."

4
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,082
I don't like it when I'm not good.

5
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:47,124
When we leave anxiety behind, it is when we really enjoy it.

6
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:49,542
I was sure of myself.

7
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,083
Aespa's space.

8
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:08,167
Will it be filled?

9
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:20,042
We must go! There are 10 seconds!

10
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:22,833
The screams sound different.

11
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,083
At that time, I couldn't believe it.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,750
I was so nervous ... It was our first concert.

13
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:44,291
My heart is accelerated.

14
00:01:44,292 --> 00:01:48,041
It is time to show everything we have worked.

15
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:50,874
I hope this concert is a success.

16
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:53,208
I don't know what will happen.

17
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:59,625
I just want to have fun.

18
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:09,583
This is just the beginning.

19
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:22,957
I am nervous.

20
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:24,291
Let's meet the group!

21
00:02:24,292 --> 00:02:25,250
Hello!

22
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,542
They call us the group of metoverso girls.

23
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,916
Hello, we are Aespa.

24
00:02:34,917 --> 00:02:36,542
Welcome.

25
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,291
At first, only Winter and I were going to be the ones that would debut.

26
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:48,916
Karina and I learned that we were going to debut.

27
00:02:48,917 --> 00:02:52,124
Not only was we excited to debut,

28
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:56,999
We wondered if we could show on stage the same strength and trust

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,041
They have experienced singers.

30
00:03:01,042 --> 00:03:03,582
That was what worried me the most.

31
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,499
Then, none united us.

32
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,041
When we were only three, our concept was more innocent.

33
00:03:09,042 --> 00:03:12,749
{\ an8} Pre-Debut presentations

34
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,541
We tried to be pure,

35
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:18,167
But after Giselle arrived, we adopted our current concept.

36
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,457
It is not too intense or too weak.

37
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:25,999
Giselle achieved a good balance between us.

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,458
We are all grateful that the current members have gathered.

39
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:37,207
The AESPA Group, which SM Entertainment presented after 6 years,

40
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:40,332
{\ an8} reached 100 million views with his debut song "Black Mamba"

41
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,917
{\ an8} in record time among K-Pop groups.

42
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,416
We start successfully.

43
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:48,082
People liked our "metaverso" concept.

44
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,499
They thought he felt something new.

45
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,957
{\ an8} We were proud to have been recognized.

46
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,667
{\ an8} felt wonderful.

47
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,291
Our first smtown

48
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:14,708
fue Beyond LIVE.

49
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,582
We usually see it on the first day of the new year.

50
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:22,291
We all saw it that day as always, while we had breakfast.

51
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:23,874
But I was so sad

52
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,874
that we had to do our first smtown without physical presence.

53
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:29,166
We only record it.

54
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:31,957
It is an honor for me to be on the Smtown stage.

55
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,874
I feel sad because they can't be here.

56
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:39,124
Therefore, Aespa wants to offer better performances in the future.

57
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:43,166
We, Aespa, we send all our support

58
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:48,416
to those who are suffering from COVID-19.

59
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:50,792
Cheer up all!

60
00:07:51,792 --> 00:07:52,832
I was sad.

61
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:56,499
It was not as I imagined.

62
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,332
It was a big problem that we made the debut during the pandemic.

63
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,708
We couldn't see our fans.

64
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:05,166
Limited to 5000 people

65
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:07,291
Limited to 2000 people

66
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:13,957
Limited to 0 people

67
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:21,042
No audience

68
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,707
When we took the stage, there was no audience.

69
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,458
There were only cameras.

70
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,000
I was nervous.

71
00:08:43,707 --> 00:08:45,792
He felt empty. I felt something lacked.

72
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,250
I miss our fans a lot.

73
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,041
Without them, there is no audience.

74
00:08:56,042 --> 00:09:00,916
It is a pity because our fans would have sung with us.

75
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:05,082
That would have given us a lot of energy on stage.

76
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:10,541
We were on stage, but there was no public response.

77
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:12,457
That made him very exhausting.

78
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,791
Because we couldn't meet people,

79
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:19,457
We did not feel the love of our fans.

80
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,916
Of course, it was a pride to have achieved first place in the musical program.

81
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:25,624
But he didn't feel like a "wow."

82
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,291
It was more like a simple "Oh."

83
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:30,332
The feeling there was.

84
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,499
Who will be this week's winner?

85
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,791
Happiness to Aespa!

86
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:36,124
{\ an8} 1st place in a musical program.

87
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,666
{\ an8} We will make sure to send them this trophy.

88
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:41,208
- This week's winners are Aespa. - Congratulations!

89
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,291
To our dear My, thank you very much.

90
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:52,124
Our My, we love them. We miss them. Thank you.

91
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:56,667
We did not listen to their shouts of mood.

92
00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:59,541
They could only see us through the screen.

93
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:02,082
They could not feel that sense of reality.

94
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:05,541
Although we will give 100 %, the screen only reflects 70 %.

95
00:10:05,542 --> 00:10:08,374
So, we must give 130 % to show our 100 %.

96
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,166
We speak it even before our debut.

97
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:12,333
We made our debut during the pandemia.

98
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:16,166
We had to give an action that broke the screen

99
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:18,375
to be able to cause an impact on people.

100
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,000
Okay, cut.

101
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,457
This movement is slow.

102
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,417
And.

103
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,042
One more time.

104
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:52,166
We did not have many opportunities to interact with our fans,

105
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:54,082
since we debut during the pandemic.

106
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:57,249
We had to do it anyway, so we had to strive even more.

107
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,207
We had to do it.

108
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:03,291
I thought I would improve over time.

109
00:11:03,292 --> 00:11:06,624
We had to focus, trying not to worry too much.

110
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,625
Striving more.

111
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:28,207
They had just launched their new single "Next Level"

112
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,208
which reached 100 million views.

113
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:34,957
Many people met "Next Level".

114
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:39,166
Seeing that, I thought many people love us.

115
00:15:39,167 --> 00:15:42,207
Other experienced singers made a "Next Level" cover.

116
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:45,041
And "Next Level" was seen everywhere all the time.

117
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:47,416
He felt so wonderful.

118
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:50,874
I was surprised when they put the faces of the presidential candidates

119
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,041
In our video during the elections.

120
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:56,625
It was when I felt, "Oh, it was a great success."

121
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,291
I received many messages from my friends.

122
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,124
They said: "I am in a cafeteria and his song is playing."

123
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,291
Was it a success?

124
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:05,499
I felt little by little.

125
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:10,042
The Mama 2021 award for the best female artist is for ...

126
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:11,874
aespa.

127
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,041
Happiness.

128
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:14,417
Gracias.

129
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:17,207
aespa: "Next Level".

130
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,582
The presentation winners of the year ...

131
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,666
Since his debut, Aespa has launched successes like.

132
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:24,332
"Black Mamba", "Next Level", "Savage" and many more.

133
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:27,832
And this year they have left a great impression on the public

134
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:31,291
with his presence on the stage and unprecedented presentations.

135
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:33,041
He felt so wonderful.

136
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:35,707
I didn't know they would love us so much.

137
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:41,374
We have shown so far what Aespa's style is.

138
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,916
And now is when it really starts.

139
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:47,749
I am not satisfied yet.

140
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:51,957
We have not yet shown 100 %.

141
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,541
Making a debut is not the same as fulfilling our dreams.

142
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:57,792
The debut is only the beginning of our dream.

143
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,541
A long journey awaits us.

144
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:03,082
We must keep trying. It will be a long way.

145
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:06,415
Since we started, we have to reach the top.

146
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,583
There is no fun without challenges.

147
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,332
{\ an8} The AESPA group expanded to the United States market.

148
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,624
The K-pop group revelation of the year is ...

149
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,082
aespa!

150
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,624
The last sensation of the K-Pop, the Aespa girl group ...

151
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,707
The fastest debut to reach more than 100 million views

152
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,082
in the history of YouTube.

153
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,999
The United States is a large country.

154
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,124
And it was our first stage with the audience.

155
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:35,750
I wondered if we would have fans there.

156
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,499
Wow! Aespa! Aespa!

157
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,832
See them encourage us like this,

158
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:43,624
He made everything feel real.

159
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:47,124
{\ an8} Aespa is included in the list of leaders of the new generation of Time magazine.

160
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,291
{\ an8} only 2 years after your debut.

161
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:52,166
For the first time in the United States, a street is named

162
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:55,457
in honor of the Korean entertainment company.

163
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,957
The City Council appointed this crossing:

164
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:01,167
"SM Entertainment Square".

165
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,749
I couldn't believe it.

166
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:11,291
It was the first time we saw our photo on a wall in the US.

167
00:18:11,292 --> 00:18:13,749
I've been in Los Angeles.

168
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,457
It seemed, weird and beautiful

169
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:21,249
See my face on a wall in the city I had visited.

170
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:26,624
The Sm Square seemed somewhat unreal.

171
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,750
I feel proud.

172
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,707
Nothing like ice cream in this heat!

173
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,167
Oh yes! Frozen.

174
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:37,791
With this heat, ice cream knows even better.

175
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:40,374
- Aeri, help me here, please. - Eh?

176
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,666
I thought I would ask for something for me.

177
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:43,832
What would you like to eat?

178
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,374
The same one that Jimin asked.

179
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,916
- The same, cereal. - This?

180
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,749
You just had to show it.

181
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,707
Did anyone licked it?

182
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,125
I want to take a self.

183
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,208
My God, please!

184
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:02,082
Personally, I was very excited.

185
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:05,291
During our promotions, we hardly left.

186
00:19:05,292 --> 00:19:08,541
We had no opportunity to hear our song in stores.

187
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:10,000
It was wonderful.

188
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:15,582
Are you okay if I turn on the camera?

189
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,166
Please talk to the camera.

190
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:18,250
OK.

191
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,416
Hello.

192
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:24,249
Hello friends! I'm Emily Curl and I'm back in my virtual study.

193
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,582
And today we are hanging out with Aespa!

194
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,999
- Hello. - Hello girls.

195
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,916
We are very happy to have them here. Where are they calling us today?

196
00:19:30,917 --> 00:19:34,292
We are calling from the Warner building.

197
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:39,499
They are the first K-Pop group to sign with Warner Records.

198
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,416
It's amazing!

199
00:19:40,417 --> 00:19:44,166
It is an incredible experience and opportunity.

200
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:48,499
We are excited by the trip together with the Warner family

201
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,082
To share our music with fans around the world.

202
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:56,457
{\ an8} together with the concert in the US

203
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,291
making its way in the global market.

204
00:19:58,292 --> 00:20:00,082
{\ an8} AESPA signed a world association contract

205
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:03,792
{\ an8} with the giant Warner Records, pointing to the global market.

206
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:08,124
{\ an8} Aespa is the first K-pop group with which we work.

207
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,332
We see them as incredible partners.

208
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,624
And everything we see,

209
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,791
As for creativity and the originality of who they are,

210
00:20:14,792 --> 00:20:17,416
It shows us that they are the next superstars.

211
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,542
And that is the business in which we want to be.

212
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:37,542
They told us we would take a tour of the company before arriving there.

213
00:20:38,042 --> 00:20:44,499
I did not know that all employees would go welcome us.

214
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,874
This is Warner Records. We are his American family.

215
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,457
We want to welcome our offices.

216
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,124
Thanks for coming.

217
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,667
And, we all introduce you to Aespa.

218
00:20:57,667 --> 00:20:59,000
Do we greet them?

219
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:02,042
Hello, we are Aespa.

220
00:21:04,292 --> 00:21:05,791
SALUDENSE among all.

221
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:07,082
- Hello. - Hello.

222
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,082
Hello, I'm James. How are they?

223
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:13,332
Hello, I am in charge of commercial associations such as Apple and YouTube.

224
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,874
Streaming things and all that.

225
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,292
We are very excited.

226
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,624
We greet everyone as soon as we arrive,

227
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,792
They all welcomed us.

228
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:29,333
Talking to them gave us peace of mind.

229
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,832
Hello, I'm Ben. Enchanted to meet them.

230
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,166
- Are they having a good time? - Yeah.

231
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:38,332
Thank you very much for coming. Congratulations on everything.

232
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,124
You are amazing.

233
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,374
- It is a pleasure to meet them. - Thank you.

234
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:45,207
- The staff is very delivered. - Ah, of course.

235
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,416
{\ an8} are so great.

236
00:21:46,417 --> 00:21:50,708
{\ an8} gave us very positive comments.

237
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,417
Do you want a walk?

238
00:21:54,042 --> 00:21:55,207
Yes, we want.

239
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,457
Okay, let's do it.

240
00:21:56,458 --> 00:22:00,417
You have a wall, Dua Lipa has yours and signed it.

241
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:03,625
This is Saweetie's wall, he signed it.

242
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:06,917
Do you know Frank Sinatra?

243
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:11,624
I have heard many ancient songs.

244
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,124
¡Frank Sinatra!

245
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:16,082
When I saw his photo on the wall I thought ...

246
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:19,249
"Oh, he was in the same company, Warner."

247
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,207
Thought: "¡Oh!".

248
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,583
I felt very honest.

249
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:26,832
Do we have to do "Argh!" When do we remove the tape?

250
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:29,416
- Be aggressive. - Do we have to be aggressive? Alright.

251
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:32,458
One two three.

252
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:40,582
In the UN Political Forum for Sustainable Development,

253
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:41,832
The K-Pop Aespa group

254
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:44,041
He called for action.

255
00:22:44,042 --> 00:22:46,082
Today at the opening of the UN Political Forum,

256
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:50,124
{\ an8} aespa will offer a speech and a presentation.

257
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:53,416
My mother was surprised to see that news.

258
00:22:53,417 --> 00:23:00,000
We were rookies and invited us to such a big event, which was incredible.

259
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,957
{\ an8} I feel something like: "Hello, I'm an office employee."

260
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:07,749
You look different. Your postures are different.

261
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,874
I know.

262
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:10,292
I am nervous.

263
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:12,791
My God.

264
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:14,666
- Let's go. - Let's go!

265
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:16,083
See you.

266
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,500
Cheer up!

267
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:20,958
Cheer up!

268
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:28,291
It was rare to be there in the UN forum.

269
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:33,832
While I was sitting there, listening to the speeches of others,

270
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,833
I wondered if it was the right thing ...

271
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,457
That we were there.

272
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:41,749
I thought: "Why are we here, in front of you?"

273
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:46,875
And, instead of being nervous, I felt incredible.

274
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:53,167
I will invite the K-Pop Aespa group to the forum.

275
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:01,374
Hello, we are Aespa.

276
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:04,457
We are very honored to be here today.

277
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:05,874
Our AESPA group

278
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:09,791
It moves uniquely between the real and virtual world.

279
00:24:09,792 --> 00:24:12,707
We exist here in the real world

280
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:16,792
and four of our members Avatar exist in the virtual world.

281
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,541
Together, they often call us the "Group of Chicas del Metaverso".

282
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,582
Metaverso reflects reality.

283
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:25,082
If our own reality is not sustainable,

284
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:28,749
It would become difficult to maintain the possibility of the virtual world.

285
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:34,166
We gave a speech and made a presentation at the UN forum.

286
00:24:34,167 --> 00:24:38,541
Having that opportunity means that we have influence.

287
00:24:38,542 --> 00:24:44,832
Therefore, we must be more careful and strive more.

288
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:47,166
We feel some pressure, but ...

289
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:50,624
I wanted someone to inspire positively

290
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:55,791
Not only on stage, but also in many other aspects.

291
00:24:55,792 --> 00:24:59,207
We are taking it to the next level with Aespa.

292
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:01,292
Are you ready for us, USA?

293
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:08,791
Aespa will be presented with "Synk in la"

294
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:11,666
In the YouTube theater, next to its local fans.

295
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:17,582
{\ an8} Aespa will meet your local fans in the presentation "Synk in la".

296
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:18,541
Live.

297
00:25:18,542 --> 00:25:20,207
We were quite nervous.

298
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:22,582
Because it was our first presentation.

299
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:25,916
We had not yet had a presentation in Korea.

300
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:31,541
We had not done a concert only with our own fans.

301
00:25:31,542 --> 00:25:33,707
The presentation in Los Angeles was our first time.

302
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:36,792
That was what moved me the most.

303
00:25:39,792 --> 00:25:42,499
First exhausted date

304
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,416
Second date tickets for sale

305
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,499
A single concert was planned.

306
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,124
We listen that many of our fans will be there

307
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:53,749
And we decided to add one more date, which increased our concern.

308
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:58,375
We had to prepare for the album, rehearse and practice for the live show.

309
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,499
After recording, we went to the study

310
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,916
To rehearse the new choreography.

311
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:07,874
We reviewed and made the changes.

312
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:11,375
We had little time to rehearse, which made us anxious.

313
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:15,541
Should we sing in a lower tone to take care of our voice during the essay?

314
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:19,666
Let's start with "Aenergy", from the standing position.

315
00:26:19,667 --> 00:26:22,375
- Let's do it! - Ready.

316
00:26:33,042 --> 00:26:36,291
The presenter will cover them while preparing.

317
00:26:36,292 --> 00:26:40,374
To present them, they will say: "Here is Aespa!"

318
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:41,457
OK.

319
00:26:41,458 --> 00:26:43,457
First "Black Mamba", then we talk.

320
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:45,832
Who takes the microphone? Do we carry it?

321
00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:48,041
There will be a basket for microphones.

322
00:26:48,042 --> 00:26:50,583
Leave the microphones in the basket and return to their position.

323
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,749
- Why is it so confusing? - It's so confusing.

324
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,832
¿Sigue "Life’s Too Short"?

325
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:59,833
"Life's Too Short" is the most confusing.

326
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:12,208
We don't make this movement?

327
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:15,249
We usually talk a lot during the trials.

328
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,582
But when we prepared for the presentation,

329
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:21,375
We focus so much that we don't talk anything.

330
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:47,250
Are you okay if we finish here? Do you just say that?

331
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:49,874
It is better to finish here.

332
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:53,374
When we make "Next Level", we go to the front and then return.

333
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:55,000
Let's get closer.

334
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:57,458
- Do we do the training here? - Yeah.

335
00:27:58,208 --> 00:28:00,792
In the first chorus ...

336
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:04,332
- I think your foot should reach 2. - 2?

337
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:05,999
The external foot to 2.

338
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,041
Do we try again?

339
00:28:08,042 --> 00:28:09,333
Yes, let's do it.

340
00:28:14,583 --> 00:28:16,167
Okay, ready.

341
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:21,417
The ground here does not slide at all.

342
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,542
Let's finish the essay.

343
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:38,833
We should show ourselves by warming up in the cameras.

344
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:42,166
Do you remember the place where the public took photos?

345
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:44,667
There are 400 people there.

346
00:28:45,542 --> 00:28:47,249
Stop there?

347
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,791
- 400 people? - Yeah.

348
00:28:48,792 --> 00:28:51,207
Hey? Heavens!

349
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:52,249
Wait.

350
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,875
Oh my God. It feels so weird.

351
00:29:07,792 --> 00:29:10,124
More people arrived than I expected to see us.

352
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:11,874
Exactly, we were very surprised.

353
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,542
We love them, Aespa!

354
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:15,832
¡aespa!

355
00:29:15,833 --> 00:29:17,374
I love you!

356
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:18,541
Giselle, we love you!

357
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:19,541
Consider with me!

358
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:21,833
We love them, Aespa!

359
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:28,958
The dancers have something to tell them.

360
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:32,458
Three, two, one ... Come on!

361
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:35,500
- Cheer up! - Come on!

362
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:39,083
First presentation 10 minutes before.

363
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:42,000
Come on, girls!

364
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,458
See you.

365
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:57,375
I did not imagine that they would welcome us so great.

366
00:29:57,875 --> 00:29:58,958
- I'm afraid. - Cheer up!

367
00:30:00,542 --> 00:30:02,374
Wow, they really are facing us.

368
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:05,541
We can simply make visual contact.

369
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:10,207
It was the first time we saw our fans in a concert.

370
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:13,582
There were not many opportunities to meet our fans,

371
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:16,042
So we still couldn't believe it.

372
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:20,042
I can't, I can't.

373
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:21,833
I am nervous.

374
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,083
There are too many people.

375
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:31,667
I think I'm getting more nervous than I thought.

376
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:35,708
It feels weird.

377
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:37,666
The presentation.

378
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:39,874
Do I get nervous with people?

379
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:41,292
What is happening to me?

380
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:43,541
I'm afraid.

381
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:44,541
How was it?

382
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:47,999
"Aenergy", "Black Mamba", "Next Level".

383
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,542
"Next Level", "Savage", "Lucid Dream."

384
00:30:55,042 --> 00:30:58,416
{\ an8} change of costumes, "Life's Too Short".

385
00:30:58,417 --> 00:31:00,500
{\ an8} "illusion", fast change and "Life's Too Short."

386
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:16,083
Girls here.

387
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:18,833
Cheer up!

388
00:31:37,792 --> 00:31:38,958
Ning: ¡Vamos!

389
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,125
Karina: What will be screaming?

390
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:45,833
I am nervous.

391
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:50,958
Girls, prepare.

392
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:55,542
Cheer up!

393
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:07,999
I was really nervous.

394
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,624
But I kept telling myself:

395
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:13,167
I am a singer, I should not be nervous.

396
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:11,166
It was the first time we listened to the support of our fans.

397
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:14,457
The first thing I thought was: "Oh know our song."

398
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:16,999
I knew that, somewhere, there were our fans.

399
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,166
And I could see them there, singing with us.

400
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:23,999
I could see how they looked at us with emotion.

401
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,916
I could understand why those who have been singing for a long time

402
00:34:27,917 --> 00:34:31,124
They say fans make it real.

403
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:34,457
When we act in front of the cameras, we concentrate

404
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:38,707
in seeing us well and in giving a shocking show.

405
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:43,582
More than happiness, we felt that we had fulfilled a mission.

406
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:47,707
We used to spend our energy on stage, which was very exhausting.

407
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:49,957
But now, with the public there with us,

408
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:51,916
We could give and receive energy throughout the show.

409
00:34:51,917 --> 00:34:55,291
So, it should be balanced.

410
00:34:55,292 --> 00:34:58,999
With those good memories, it became something extra, which was great.

411
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,499
We said that our debut was not a real debut.

412
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,249
It was like recording a music video.

413
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:09,207
Even in the musical shows, he felt as if we were recording.

414
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:10,999
And now we feel like ...

415
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,249
Yes, this is a real scenario!

416
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,374
It was when we feel that really

417
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:18,374
We debut and become singers.

418
00:35:18,375 --> 00:35:20,166
It was the first time I felt that.

419
00:35:20,167 --> 00:35:24,207
I took one of my headphones

420
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:28,374
To check if the applause was real.

421
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:29,583
I wanted to listen to it.

422
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:37,625
Well, we mean hello to everyone.

423
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:42,833
Be my ae! Hi, we are Aespa!

424
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:45,916
You are the first Korean artists

425
00:35:45,917 --> 00:35:50,042
In this stage here in Los Angeles.

426
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Being the first is always significant and we are grateful.

427
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:06,875
But today it is special because we can spend time with our My.

428
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:13,541
It is the first time we have our own concert.

429
00:36:13,542 --> 00:36:17,541
We did not see each other until now, but we felt his love all the time.

430
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:18,583
I love you!

431
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:25,375
The first song we are going to interpret is "Next Level".

432
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:30,916
We will continue with ...

433
00:36:30,917 --> 00:36:34,500
The song "Savage", from our first mini-album,

434
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:37,750
They are going to support us, right?

435
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:50,707
It was the first time we made a quick change that day.

436
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:54,917
{\ an8} Yes, it usually takes time to do all that, but this time not.

437
00:36:57,292 --> 00:37:01,207
Not changing in time, it would be as if we were not at the concert.

438
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:05,500
I personally felt that pressure more than anyone.

439
00:37:09,667 --> 00:37:10,624
Change us fast.

440
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:12,624
Using my spank hairstyle.

441
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:13,791
Making changes.

442
00:37:13,792 --> 00:37:15,416
We were messy.

443
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:17,332
Wait, girls. Let me check something.

444
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:19,457
There are 10 seconds!

445
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:22,416
- Girls, after the last song ... - We must enter now.

446
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:24,041
They do not approach much to the edge.

447
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:25,957
- They could throw gifts. - Come on.

448
00:37:25,958 --> 00:37:27,667
It was challenging.

449
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,291
I cried a little at that time.

450
00:37:53,292 --> 00:37:56,708
I really hate crying in front of many people.

451
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,333
It is shameful.

452
00:37:58,792 --> 00:38:00,958
I feel that I am weak.

453
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,499
But after the presentation, I didn't know why.

454
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,332
Was it because I was proud?

455
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:11,832
Or was it because she was so grateful to our fans?

456
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:14,291
But I cried for the first time on stage.

457
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,332
That was something so memorable.

458
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:18,874
It was great to meet so many of our fans.

459
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:21,582
Despite speaking different languages,

460
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:27,042
They loved us regardless of anything, which was incredible.

461
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:30,124
I could feel it in their eyes.

462
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:33,957
I realized how important the energy of fans is.

463
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:37,374
See the auditorium full of our fans

464
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:42,707
He made me realize how much they love us.

465
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:44,957
All, thank you very much.

466
00:38:44,958 --> 00:38:46,332
Have a pretty night.

467
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:48,375
See you soon!

468
00:38:50,917 --> 00:38:54,250
This was Aespa!

469
00:38:56,667 --> 00:39:00,374
We have seen them so far, from their days as Trainees.

470
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:02,250
See this presentation

471
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,874
It made me feel that they are already real stars.

472
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:08,416
Seeing his first concert moved me a lot.

473
00:39:08,417 --> 00:39:10,917
I felt very proud, it was a very pleasant feeling.

474
00:39:15,167 --> 00:39:16,207
Gracias.

475
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:17,833
Thank you so much.

476
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:29,583
They made it incredible, congratulations.

477
00:39:30,042 --> 00:39:31,792
See you next!

478
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:34,292
Hopefully yes.

479
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:36,208
Gracias.

480
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:37,958
Bye bye.

481
00:39:39,292 --> 00:39:41,000
They are so adorable!

482
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:46,333
Good job.

483
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:49,667
- Good job. - Good job.

484
00:39:50,458 --> 00:39:52,624
We have just finished our first presentation.

485
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:55,792
He felt as if we had made a great concert.

486
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,624
I don't know why.

487
00:39:57,625 --> 00:39:59,417
But it happened very quickly.

488
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:02,041
- It's hot. - It was a lot of fun!

489
00:40:02,042 --> 00:40:04,707
- My have an incredible energy! - They are super passionate!

490
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:09,875
I had never heard such a strong cry.

491
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,374
- Then ... - The letter of none.

492
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:14,167
You did it.

493
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:18,416
The My surprised me a lot.

494
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:21,124
They have tremendous energy. Tremendous!

495
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:24,082
As was the first day, we had some mistakes.

496
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:25,832
Is there anyone behind me?

497
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:27,874
Last time I also did the same.

498
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:30,832
As was the first day, we made some mistakes.

499
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:33,333
But the second day we will do better.

500
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:35,667
Thanks for coming today!

501
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:37,792
Let's go!

502
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:44,332
- Hello. - They were incredible!

503
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:45,374
Good job.

504
00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:47,167
Good job, all!

505
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,958
They really did incredible.

506
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:55,416
Hello! Aespa broke it!

507
00:40:55,417 --> 00:40:58,082
Do you know what I mean? "Illusion" is my favorite song.

508
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:00,582
As soon as Beat fell, I stopped breathing.

509
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,249
My favorite is "Savage".

510
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:05,457
My heart stopped like five times, I almost died.

511
00:41:05,458 --> 00:41:07,749
I saved it, as always.

512
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:11,541
Aespa's presentation was incredible, I loved it.

513
00:41:11,542 --> 00:41:14,666
- Return next time. - I can't wait.

514
00:41:14,667 --> 00:41:17,166
I had a lot of fun, really.

515
00:41:17,167 --> 00:41:18,499
I really enjoyed the show.

516
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,041
It was amazing and they are beautiful.

517
00:41:21,042 --> 00:41:23,457
The show was great and I loved the new song.

518
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:27,874
I was looking forward to "Lucid Dream" so I loved seeing her live.

519
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:29,292
We spent an incredible time.

520
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:35,124
They were difficult times. They know! I'm going to strive more.

521
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:37,124
I love you, I love you!

522
00:41:37,125 --> 00:41:38,999
{\ an8} I'm in love. I want to know if you are.

523
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,708
{\ an8} Thanks my 100 %. I LOVE THEM.

524
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,542
We have already arrived in New York.

525
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:58,166
We had to wait a lot on the plane.

526
00:41:58,167 --> 00:42:00,332
After landing, we wait as an hour.

527
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:03,541
I had never seen a plane arrived so fast.

528
00:42:03,542 --> 00:42:04,582
It's true.

529
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:08,667
There was no air traffic.

530
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:16,207
Wow, it's amazing!

531
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:17,582
Wow.

532
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:18,500
It's crazy!

533
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:21,041
Did you see that red?

534
00:42:21,042 --> 00:42:22,792
It is impressive!

535
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,499
Anyway, we are already in New York.

536
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,332
We are going to do interviews and others.

537
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:30,666
Then we introduce ourselves at Good Morning America ...

538
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:33,708
And then we will return to Korea.

539
00:42:35,292 --> 00:42:36,666
Cheer up!

540
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:39,542
- Cheer up! - Cheer up!

541
00:42:48,208 --> 00:42:50,041
The most watched morning program ...

542
00:42:50,042 --> 00:42:53,416
The truth is, we don't have much experience in the US TV and ...

543
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:56,124
In GMA we present "Girls" for the first time.

544
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:58,207
When we show "Girls". It was like that ... pum!

545
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:01,874
We think: "Will they be waiting for us?"

546
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:04,832
And that makes us want to make it even better.

547
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:07,250
I feel that we are growing constantly.

548
00:43:10,292 --> 00:43:14,291
Good Morning America is like a news channel.

549
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:15,874
It was live.

550
00:43:15,875 --> 00:43:17,957
It was a total madness.

551
00:43:17,958 --> 00:43:18,999
Very good, everything ready.

552
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,832
We have trial at 7.

553
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:24,374
Our camera time moved at 8:38.

554
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:26,166
We climb in two minutes.

555
00:43:26,167 --> 00:43:27,666
Let's go!

556
00:43:27,667 --> 00:43:28,708
All in position!

557
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:36,332
Before recording, they made us a countdown: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ...

558
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:38,916
And the interview was completely live.

559
00:43:38,917 --> 00:43:40,999
15 seconds! Attentive!

560
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,708
Five, four, three ...

561
00:43:43,375 --> 00:43:44,833
Good morning, America!

562
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:48,082
As was live, we had to be very specific.

563
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,499
That was a bit complicated.

564
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,208
But at the same time, that pressure was fun.

565
00:43:55,167 --> 00:43:56,625
Let's receive Aespa! Hello!

566
00:43:59,042 --> 00:44:01,374
His new album "Girls", which they just launched,

567
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:02,541
su second mini album,

568
00:44:02,542 --> 00:44:03,624
Tell us about him.

569
00:44:03,625 --> 00:44:07,166
Yes, as you say, "Girls" is our second mini album.

570
00:44:07,167 --> 00:44:09,791
And today the music video was also released from "Girls".

571
00:44:09,792 --> 00:44:11,292
Do not miss it!

572
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,874
Yes, the video came out today.

573
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:26,707
Before, on the stage we had no fans present.

574
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:30,125
But this time we could present the song in front of them.

575
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:31,958
He felt incredible.

576
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:45,082
¡aespa, aespa!

577
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:46,874
¡aespa, aespa, aespa, aespa!

578
00:44:46,875 --> 00:44:52,041
It was the moment that impressed me the most in GMA.

579
00:44:52,042 --> 00:44:55,374
I wanted to introduce myself outdoors with the girls.

580
00:44:55,375 --> 00:44:58,416
I did not imagine that we would do it in the United States.

581
00:44:58,417 --> 00:45:03,749
It seemed that everything happened just as we wanted.

582
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:06,582
In the US, we crossed out our desire list.

583
00:45:06,583 --> 00:45:08,457
We start in the United States.

584
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:13,416
I hope we have more opportunities to meet fans around the world.

585
00:45:13,417 --> 00:45:15,541
I am excited.

586
00:45:15,542 --> 00:45:21,082
What attracts the millennial of Aespa is its authenticity.

587
00:45:21,083 --> 00:45:24,916
The deep friendship and brotherhood also influences each other.

588
00:45:24,917 --> 00:45:27,541
They debuted at a very particular moment in history,

589
00:45:27,542 --> 00:45:31,333
Just when people yearned for friendship and understanding.

590
00:45:31,833 --> 00:45:33,207
They represent what we all feel.

591
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:34,624
There is that sisters connection.

592
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:37,207
And that shows in your music and on stage.

593
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:38,457
They are incredible.

594
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:39,582
When I saw them live

595
00:45:39,583 --> 00:45:43,082
I felt that they had been pop stars all their lives.

596
00:45:43,083 --> 00:45:46,499
I told you: "You don't look like rookies, you are already superstar."

597
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,167
COREA

598
00:46:06,792 --> 00:46:08,166
Hello everyone. This is the ...

599
00:46:08,167 --> 00:46:11,041
- SMTOWN.
- SMTOWN.

600
00:46:11,042 --> 00:46:12,832
- The concert! - In the waiting room.

601
00:46:12,833 --> 00:46:14,249
We are in the place!

602
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:16,124
- We are here. - Yeah.

603
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:19,541
I'm going to take a tour.

604
00:46:19,542 --> 00:46:21,416
There is nothing here.

605
00:46:21,417 --> 00:46:23,041
There is no one.

606
00:46:23,042 --> 00:46:25,749
It is our second Smtown.

607
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:27,707
Although it is as if it were the first time.

608
00:46:27,708 --> 00:46:29,250
Last time ...

609
00:46:29,708 --> 00:46:31,749
It was just a recording.

610
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:33,957
- There was no one to see us. - Exact.

611
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:36,250
And neither were the veteran artists.

612
00:46:40,583 --> 00:46:44,666
So he didn't feel like the Smtown family.

613
00:46:44,667 --> 00:46:46,417
We still felt remote.

614
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,832
I love all the company's veteran artists.

615
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:53,707
When we participate in Smtown, we act with everyone else.

616
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:55,917
In "Hope", we share the stage with everyone.

617
00:46:57,042 --> 00:47:00,916
That is why the smtown in the city of Suwon

618
00:47:00,917 --> 00:47:03,667
It was the one that put me the most nervous.

619
00:47:09,042 --> 00:47:12,707
They did not seem simply greater or superior.

620
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:16,249
Rather, they seemed incredible artists.

621
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,582
So he didn't feel real.

622
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:20,916
It was a very rare sensation.

623
00:47:20,917 --> 00:47:23,332
I used to go to his concerts.

624
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:28,541
And I had already seen SMTown shows before. I even saw TVXQ!

625
00:47:28,542 --> 00:47:32,332
I remember how strong they shouted.

626
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:36,874
Everything was so great, noisy, vibrant ... I remember it well.

627
00:47:36,875 --> 00:47:38,916
"Will I be in such a stage?"

628
00:47:38,917 --> 00:47:42,000
It wasn't just nervousness.

629
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:45,792
I felt very ...

630
00:47:46,417 --> 00:47:47,458
restless

631
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,582
I had never seen so many people in the public.

632
00:47:53,583 --> 00:47:55,291
With the energy of the public,

633
00:47:55,292 --> 00:47:57,666
We encourage ourselves completely.

634
00:47:57,667 --> 00:48:01,082
That energy allowed me to enjoy more of the moment.

635
00:48:01,083 --> 00:48:02,333
Look down.

636
00:48:16,917 --> 00:48:18,041
Karina: Our Lightsicks!

637
00:48:18,042 --> 00:48:20,792
They are everywhere!

638
00:48:26,042 --> 00:48:27,375
Winter: Cheer up!

639
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,042
Be my ae! Hello, we are Aespa.

640
00:52:30,917 --> 00:52:33,332
Welcome to SMCU Express.

641
00:52:33,333 --> 00:52:35,125
Thank you so much!

642
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:42,416
He helped me realize how great and incredible all this was.

643
00:52:42,417 --> 00:52:44,624
- Hello! - Hello!

644
00:52:44,625 --> 00:52:47,416
Today we are going to present Zoo.

645
00:52:47,417 --> 00:52:48,832
ZOO y Step Back.

646
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:50,791
We prepare them with great desire.

647
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:53,457
I hope you enjoy them. Ah, and don't forget the final song.

648
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:55,791
The end! You know what it is, right?

649
00:52:55,792 --> 00:52:57,249
To the three.

650
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:59,208
"In business ..." Don't it sound to you?

651
00:53:07,292 --> 00:53:09,875
Today we finally sing it live in front of the public.

652
00:53:10,458 --> 00:53:11,582
It will be fun.

653
00:53:11,583 --> 00:53:15,124
We are excited, hopefully you are too.

654
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:16,667
- See you soon! - Bye bye!

655
00:53:25,667 --> 00:53:27,208
Super Junior waiting room

656
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,375
- Oh, have they just finished? - Yeah!

657
00:53:37,458 --> 00:53:40,041
- What is this? - It's a gift.

658
00:53:40,042 --> 00:53:42,166
Thank you so much. We will eat it with pleasure!

659
00:53:42,167 --> 00:53:43,957
Is it your first time in Smtown?

660
00:53:43,958 --> 00:53:46,166
Your first show with audiences, how was it?

661
00:53:46,167 --> 00:53:49,082
They definitely transmitted more energy.

662
00:53:49,083 --> 00:53:51,499
Listen to fans encourage us in person

663
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,166
It was very different.

664
00:53:53,167 --> 00:53:55,083
I saw them a while ago and they gave everything with "Savage".

665
00:53:58,458 --> 00:54:02,291
So are the youngest in Smtown?

666
00:54:02,292 --> 00:54:03,707
Yes, for now.

667
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:05,166
Do they have superiors to treat them well?

668
00:54:05,167 --> 00:54:06,708
None.

669
00:54:08,667 --> 00:54:11,417
Ah, no, I wouldn't mean that.

670
00:54:12,042 --> 00:54:13,957
- I still don't know them. - Clear...

671
00:54:13,958 --> 00:54:15,332
We are not close yet.

672
00:54:15,333 --> 00:54:17,749
- Over time. - Oh, no! I would not mean that.

673
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:20,666
Before, at the end of Smtown, we all got together,

674
00:54:20,667 --> 00:54:22,124
We played, we had fun.

675
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:26,458
In Smtown Japan we could use time to meet more.

676
00:54:27,375 --> 00:54:30,374
- They run to change and dry the sweat. - We have to sing "Hope" together.

677
00:54:30,375 --> 00:54:31,667
Cheer up!

678
00:54:32,167 --> 00:54:34,042
- Go and rest. - Thank you.

679
00:54:37,417 --> 00:54:40,458
- Congratulations on your 15 years. - Thank you.

680
00:54:41,083 --> 00:54:42,582
They are very beautiful.

681
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:45,416
They really seem out of an AI.

682
00:54:45,417 --> 00:54:49,791
We recorded a Tiktok and Karina seemed generated by AI

683
00:54:49,792 --> 00:54:52,082
Karina loves taking photos with Sooyoung.

684
00:54:52,083 --> 00:54:53,541
It fascinates me!

685
00:54:53,542 --> 00:54:56,292
What if we take a photo together?

686
00:54:57,417 --> 00:55:00,333
Fast, take the picture! You have to leave.

687
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:04,542
Digan “accompaniment”.

688
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:06,500
Come on!

689
00:55:10,792 --> 00:55:14,291
The last song was "Hope"

690
00:55:14,292 --> 00:55:16,416
Together with all artists.

691
00:55:16,417 --> 00:55:20,542
It is part of the family bond of SM.

692
00:55:31,167 --> 00:55:34,292
Since we sang "Next Level", I only thought of "Hope."

693
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:38,041
I imagined that the group closure

694
00:55:38,042 --> 00:55:40,416
I was going to feel like a real debut.

695
00:55:40,417 --> 00:55:46,166
It was shocking to share the stage with artists that we admire so much.

696
00:55:46,167 --> 00:55:47,749
It made me very happy.

697
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:49,000
¡Somos SMTOWN!

698
00:55:50,792 --> 00:55:53,624
I got on stage with nerves.

699
00:55:53,625 --> 00:55:55,750
But being up, it was a lot of fun.

700
00:55:56,417 --> 00:55:58,124
After the show we said:

701
00:55:58,125 --> 00:56:00,916
"What madness! We enjoy it very much!"

702
00:56:00,917 --> 00:56:02,499
We had a better time than we expected.

703
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,833
And had a special meaning.

704
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,333
And now, the youngest group of SM!

705
00:56:14,083 --> 00:56:15,625
¡aespa!

706
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:19,208
¡Gracias!

707
00:56:19,875 --> 00:56:21,666
Did they have fun? How did it go?

708
00:56:21,667 --> 00:56:24,708
- It was fun! - Now it feels real.

709
00:56:25,417 --> 00:56:27,166
We rehearse a lot for "Hope."

710
00:56:27,167 --> 00:56:29,041
What part did they do?

711
00:56:29,042 --> 00:56:30,916
We both did: "The business failed ...".

712
00:56:30,917 --> 00:56:32,625
Ah, rap?

713
00:56:33,667 --> 00:56:35,167
Good job.

714
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:37,375
See you in the next show.

715
00:56:38,958 --> 00:56:41,791
That's when I assimilated it.

716
00:56:41,792 --> 00:56:45,666
We are SM artists!

717
00:56:45,667 --> 00:56:48,416
I felt that we were already part of the family.

718
00:56:48,417 --> 00:56:49,999
I had a lot of fun.

719
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,500
Let's take a group photo.

720
00:56:57,125 --> 00:56:59,582
First meeting, first Smtown concert!

721
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:02,041
{\ an8} The stage with more fans so far!

722
00:57:02,042 --> 00:57:04,541
{\ an8} I feel very lucky.

723
00:57:04,542 --> 00:57:07,666
It felt how to complete our first stage.

724
00:57:07,667 --> 00:57:10,791
I think we have all matured a lot.

725
00:57:10,792 --> 00:57:13,707
We learned and felt many things.

726
00:57:13,708 --> 00:57:16,082
We find fans around the world.

727
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:18,582
If one day we do our own concert,

728
00:57:18,583 --> 00:57:20,999
We could show the special of each one.

729
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,916
It will be a great opportunity to show a new side.

730
00:57:24,917 --> 00:57:30,791
We have not yet shown everything we have.

731
00:57:30,792 --> 00:57:33,791
I am sure that the four can with everything.

732
00:57:33,792 --> 00:57:36,749
I am ready for whatever.

733
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:39,999
But for when this is released ...

734
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,041
We will have done the concert.

735
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:44,875
- Did we do the concert? - What happened to the end?

736
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:04,707
I'm going to start the meeting.

737
00:58:04,708 --> 00:58:05,957
Can we start?

738
00:58:05,958 --> 00:58:07,749
The purpose of this meeting

739
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:11,416
{\ an8} is to meet the team that will make the concert with us.

740
00:58:11,417 --> 00:58:13,207
{\ an8} is our initial joint.

741
00:58:13,208 --> 00:58:19,083
{\ an8} is fine to be able to speak in person about all this.

742
00:58:19,875 --> 00:58:23,124
At the beginning, Jaewon spoke with us separately.

743
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:25,207
We commented a lot about my tastes.

744
00:58:25,208 --> 00:58:26,874
What kind of music do I like.

745
00:58:26,875 --> 00:58:30,082
What dance style I prefer. If there was something I would like to do.

746
00:58:30,083 --> 00:58:33,791
I think I wanted to better understand the personality of each one.

747
00:58:33,792 --> 00:58:37,999
I first made a meeting in a group and then spoke with you alone,

748
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,291
I became an idea of ​​how the concert wants to be.

749
00:58:43,292 --> 00:58:46,082
I understood that they don't want to do any concert.

750
00:58:46,083 --> 00:58:49,499
So the theme of Aespa's first concert is ...

751
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,916
HYPER LINE.

752
00:58:50,917 --> 00:58:52,000
Sink.

753
00:58:53,125 --> 00:58:55,417
The Aespa Synk will refer to the concert.

754
00:58:57,167 --> 00:58:59,874
The sub -theme is Hyper Line.

755
00:58:59,875 --> 00:59:01,041
What it means is that

756
00:59:01,042 --> 00:59:03,499
You met æ when they synchronized.

757
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:05,999
{\ an8} But this time, through the Hyper Line

758
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,207
æ, My and Aespa will join in the same space.

759
00:59:09,208 --> 00:59:10,666
They will present together.

760
00:59:10,667 --> 00:59:13,291
That is the theme of the concert.

761
00:59:13,292 --> 00:59:15,541
They must feel the whole universe.

762
00:59:15,542 --> 00:59:18,374
For example, the public while waiting instead must feel something.

763
00:59:18,375 --> 00:59:20,707
Everything must reflect Aespa's style.

764
00:59:20,708 --> 00:59:22,957
We are still reviewing that.

765
00:59:22,958 --> 00:59:25,124
What worries me the most

766
00:59:25,125 --> 00:59:30,624
They have no experience making live visual contact with the public.

767
00:59:30,625 --> 00:59:32,124
Leaving your performance aside

768
00:59:32,125 --> 00:59:34,624
Maintain visual contact, move and breathe at the same time

769
00:59:34,625 --> 00:59:36,499
It costs more than just dance.

770
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:37,791
Controlling breathing is very difficult.

771
00:59:37,792 --> 00:59:39,832
It is something they must experience.

772
00:59:39,833 --> 00:59:42,707
This is where they have to master it.

773
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:45,166
Even with a lot of practice,

774
00:59:45,167 --> 00:59:49,166
Face the public's eyes on stage can paralyze them.

775
00:59:49,167 --> 00:59:52,792
The only way to overcome it is that the body automates it with practice.

776
00:59:54,375 --> 00:59:56,916
You have to stop thinking: "What follows?"

777
00:59:56,917 --> 01:00:00,542
Their bodies have to know for themselves.

778
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,916
Only then can they really enjoy it.

779
01:00:02,917 --> 01:00:06,207
While he heard what Jaewon said,

780
01:00:06,208 --> 01:00:08,375
I understood why he spoke to us like this.

781
01:00:09,167 --> 01:00:10,832
He is a very wise person.

782
01:00:10,833 --> 01:00:13,582
He knows how we can improve, that's why I leaned on him.

783
01:00:13,583 --> 01:00:16,541
Jaewon was also idol,

784
01:00:16,542 --> 01:00:19,041
So understand how we feel.

785
01:00:19,042 --> 01:00:25,041
He knows why we are going through difficult times or how to improve.

786
01:00:25,042 --> 01:00:27,291
Is anyone who can we trust?

787
01:00:27,292 --> 01:00:30,832
Working with him was incredible.

788
01:00:30,833 --> 01:00:35,582
You have to set up a good concert with what we have.

789
01:00:35,583 --> 01:00:38,832
Each one has to overcome individually.

790
01:00:38,833 --> 01:00:40,999
- Yes, let's improve. - We are going to improve.

791
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,541
Let's make a fun concert.

792
01:00:42,542 --> 01:00:43,624
Yeah!

793
01:00:43,625 --> 01:00:46,332
The important thing is to enjoy it. Let's do it well.

794
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:47,874
Let's do it!

795
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:50,375
Let's go!

796
01:01:00,042 --> 01:01:01,750
Are they recording now?

797
01:01:08,417 --> 01:01:10,082
- Are we starting? - Yeah.

798
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,582
Well, come on.

799
01:01:11,583 --> 01:01:13,082
Place your hand here.

800
01:01:13,083 --> 01:01:14,374
Start with the left foot.

801
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:17,166
You walk: one, two, three, four.

802
01:01:17,167 --> 01:01:20,999
Keep your hand and elbow firm in doing so.

803
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,292
Now we wave our arms. Perfect.

804
01:01:23,875 --> 01:01:29,832
You go down in one, two, three.

805
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:31,041
Exactly so...

806
01:01:31,042 --> 01:01:32,666
Marks one, two.

807
01:01:32,667 --> 01:01:36,166
First the elbow, then the arm. Then you get up.

808
01:01:36,167 --> 01:01:38,874
You get up without changing the posture.

809
01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:40,667
Pushed back. Let's try.

810
01:01:49,458 --> 01:01:51,832
The song is faster than I thought.

811
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:54,124
The album does not come out.

812
01:01:54,125 --> 01:01:56,666
We show the songs before taking out the album.

813
01:01:56,667 --> 01:02:01,374
I worried about being too much.

814
01:02:01,375 --> 01:02:04,624
There are many songs that we are revealing for the first time.

815
01:02:04,625 --> 01:02:07,916
We try to get involved in meetings

816
01:02:07,917 --> 01:02:10,332
and reveal many things in advance.

817
01:02:10,333 --> 01:02:14,917
Because the more they know, the more they can recognize what it is.

818
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:22,416
If they participate in the process, they will see things differently.

819
01:02:22,417 --> 01:02:25,999
These short videos will be published before the concert, right?

820
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,999
In my opinion, it would be good if we recorded some of our practices

821
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,041
and we would publish them little by short.

822
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:36,917
We will work well together.

823
01:02:39,792 --> 01:02:43,083
We are practicing for the concert.

824
01:02:54,292 --> 01:02:57,624
When we reveal "Thirst" from the trial room,

825
01:02:57,625 --> 01:03:00,333
Everything was planned, how they can imagine.

826
01:03:05,708 --> 01:03:07,291
Let's let people listen to the song

827
01:03:07,292 --> 01:03:09,416
And let's teach how to cheer up.

828
01:03:09,417 --> 01:03:11,957
We expected them to have more like that.

829
01:03:11,958 --> 01:03:13,624
So we told the company

830
01:03:13,625 --> 01:03:15,457
that we would reveal things like that.

831
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,458
And we really did.

832
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:21,124
Alright?

833
01:03:21,125 --> 01:03:23,166
- No. - Do we try again?

834
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:28,291
The truth, preparing the concert was quite hard.

835
01:03:28,292 --> 01:03:31,624
We learned a new choreography in the morning.

836
01:03:31,625 --> 01:03:34,374
We review the choreography we had learned before

837
01:03:34,375 --> 01:03:37,707
And we prepare the stage for him alone at night.

838
01:03:37,708 --> 01:03:39,082
During the general essay,

839
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:41,291
We review all sections.

840
01:03:41,292 --> 01:03:44,374
Who wanted to practice his alone, stayed longer.

841
01:03:44,375 --> 01:03:47,457
We didn't have time to rest

842
01:03:47,458 --> 01:03:50,542
practicing every day sweating without stopping.

843
01:04:02,042 --> 01:04:03,957
The public seats are very close.

844
01:04:03,958 --> 01:04:06,500
They are only 3 meters away.

845
01:04:07,125 --> 01:04:09,207
Will the top floor be filled?

846
01:04:09,208 --> 01:04:10,667
Yes of course.

847
01:04:11,125 --> 01:04:13,999
The public seats were too close,

848
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,291
What made it feel more real.

849
01:04:16,292 --> 01:04:19,166
I was getting more nervous.

850
01:04:19,167 --> 01:04:22,500
He does not feel so far from the public's seat.

851
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:25,166
From the stage, this place looks so small and distant.

852
01:04:25,167 --> 01:04:26,791
Yesterday I took the stage.

853
01:04:26,792 --> 01:04:28,207
The stage is too big.

854
01:04:28,208 --> 01:04:29,957
The public will be one step away from us.

855
01:04:29,958 --> 01:04:33,749
The closer we are from the fans, the more they will like it.

856
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:35,957
You can see the pores on our faces.

857
01:04:35,958 --> 01:04:36,957
It is very close.

858
01:04:36,958 --> 01:04:38,124
I could be sweating.

859
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:39,957
What if they hate us after this?

860
01:04:39,958 --> 01:04:41,582
If we are sweating completely ...

861
01:04:41,583 --> 01:04:44,500
We have to put "do not hate us" in the end.

862
01:04:45,208 --> 01:04:48,499
Mom, dad, my cousin and my aunt will come the first day.

863
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,417
¡Oh, no!

864
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:53,582
It is very uncomfortable to act in front of your family.

865
01:04:53,583 --> 01:04:54,999
Your family and friends!

866
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,667
It feels like a school work with your family seeing you.

867
01:04:59,667 --> 01:05:01,207
I'm very shame.

868
01:05:01,208 --> 01:05:03,874
It would be so funny that they looked at us.

869
01:05:03,875 --> 01:05:06,082
I'm always lying down, saying "Mom!"

870
01:05:06,083 --> 01:05:09,625
But on the stage I will say something like: "You will make me cry."

871
01:05:10,042 --> 01:05:12,332
"I'm corrupted."

872
01:05:12,333 --> 01:05:16,291
- I am ashamed to sing "Lucid Dream". - I can't interpret "Lucid Dream".

873
01:05:16,292 --> 01:05:19,666
I can't flirt in front of my family.

874
01:05:19,667 --> 01:05:22,625
"Yeppi Yeppi" is a bit more acceptable, although ...

875
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:26,749
Sometimes the family gets excited after seeing us.

876
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:29,749
That makes me more uncomfortable.

877
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:31,374
Do you know how it feels?

878
01:05:31,375 --> 01:05:33,832
They are like that, and that makes me feel ...

879
01:05:33,833 --> 01:05:37,708
Not that I am ashamed of my parents.

880
01:05:38,458 --> 01:05:40,124
I'm simply shy with them.

881
01:05:40,125 --> 01:05:42,541
It's like: "Don't cry. Cry when it's not here."

882
01:05:42,542 --> 01:05:46,166
At first I was very worried. It is our first concert.

883
01:05:46,167 --> 01:05:47,457
Are we going to have a concert?

884
01:05:47,458 --> 01:05:49,166
Hey? Us?

885
01:05:49,167 --> 01:05:50,707
Aespa's space.

886
01:05:50,708 --> 01:05:53,958
Our own concert! It is Aespa's concert!

887
01:05:54,625 --> 01:06:00,750
We must enjoy it so that our fans also enjoy it with that energy.

888
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:04,042
So, just have us fun.

889
01:06:07,833 --> 01:06:10,082
I'm going to see Aespa. I am so excited.

890
01:06:10,083 --> 01:06:12,166
I love you, Aespa!

891
01:06:12,167 --> 01:06:13,167
Let's go aespa!

892
01:06:15,375 --> 01:06:17,332
I am excited by new songs.

893
01:06:17,333 --> 01:06:18,291
I am excited.

894
01:06:18,292 --> 01:06:20,125
They are the best, Aespa!

895
01:06:28,875 --> 01:06:33,207
We are waiting. We have 40 minutes before leaving.

896
01:06:33,208 --> 01:06:35,375
Noning is practicing there.

897
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:37,957
Aeri is dressing.

898
01:06:37,958 --> 01:06:39,666
Minjeong is ...

899
01:06:39,667 --> 01:06:41,583
In the hairstyle and makeup.

900
01:06:48,208 --> 01:06:52,333
- It has been a long way. - This concert will exhaust all your energy.

901
01:06:52,833 --> 01:06:55,167
I am ready to run out of energy.

902
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:00,707
Noning, I came because you invited me.

903
01:07:00,708 --> 01:07:02,499
- Really? - I came from Japan.

904
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,332
I came just after the concert.

905
01:07:04,333 --> 01:07:05,624
I took the morning train.

906
01:07:05,625 --> 01:07:07,207
It is not a big thing, but ...

907
01:07:07,208 --> 01:07:09,582
It's your first concert, so ...

908
01:07:09,583 --> 01:07:13,417
I saw his interviews, they mentioned something about perfumes.

909
01:07:13,833 --> 01:07:15,416
Your gift was the most difficult.

910
01:07:15,417 --> 01:07:17,791
I could not find the aroma of those softeners.

911
01:07:17,792 --> 01:07:21,332
Anyway, there is also the return receipt.

912
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:23,332
- If you don't like it, just change it. - Thank you.

913
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:25,416
- Thank you. - They bring our names.

914
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:27,124
- Enjoy the concert. - Yeah!

915
01:07:27,125 --> 01:07:28,499
I already want to see it.

916
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,750
- Thank you. - You are welcome.

917
01:07:32,292 --> 01:07:34,750
- Hello. - Hello.

918
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:37,416
You are so pretty.

919
01:07:37,417 --> 01:07:38,792
I'm ashamed.

920
01:07:44,708 --> 01:07:47,291
Cheer up!

921
01:07:47,292 --> 01:07:51,541
Many superior singers came to support us.

922
01:07:51,542 --> 01:07:53,332
I felt a little quieter.

923
01:07:53,333 --> 01:07:55,749
They comforted us and supported us,

924
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:58,291
which gave us a lot of energy.

925
01:07:58,292 --> 01:08:04,750
They supported us saying: "This is just the beginning."

926
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:10,708
- Shouldn't they get on stage? - Yeah.

927
01:08:12,167 --> 01:08:13,791
Come on! We leave.

928
01:08:13,792 --> 01:08:15,500
Thank you. Cheer up!

929
01:08:16,082 --> 01:08:20,541
All pass.

930
01:08:20,542 --> 01:08:22,749
We don't have a shout of mind.

931
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:24,749
One two three.

932
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:26,625
Cheer up!

933
01:08:29,917 --> 01:08:32,292
¡Intellect, my mind!

934
01:08:33,125 --> 01:08:34,416
I am a little nervous.

935
01:08:34,417 --> 01:08:36,624
I wasn't nervous at all before.

936
01:08:36,625 --> 01:08:38,166
I think he has been scary.

937
01:08:38,167 --> 01:08:40,917
Do I want to make the cry between us?

938
01:08:42,957 --> 01:08:44,624
It is our secret.

939
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:46,707
This is something just about us.

940
01:08:47,625 --> 01:08:49,957
Let's go.

941
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,332
I am nervous.

942
01:09:00,417 --> 01:09:02,250
Cheer up!

943
01:09:08,625 --> 01:09:09,832
I am nervous.

944
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:23,167
Cheer up!

945
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,541
Pray before climbing.

946
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:34,625
"Please, let us end with pride."

947
01:09:39,957 --> 01:09:42,874
I had no great expectations. I was realistic.

948
01:09:42,875 --> 01:09:46,000
I just wanted it to be as good as we practice it.

949
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:08,957
My heart is accelerated.

950
01:10:08,958 --> 01:10:12,875
It is the time we can show everything we have prepared.

951
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:32,499
When I heard the applause and the stage opened,

952
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:35,207
I couldn't believe it. It was like watching a movie.

953
01:10:35,208 --> 01:10:37,291
It was like that scene in which the public

954
01:10:37,292 --> 01:10:39,457
Scream when the star takes the stage.

955
01:10:39,458 --> 01:10:41,458
It was something very rare and wonderful.

956
01:16:10,083 --> 01:16:11,624
It was as I had imagined.

957
01:16:11,625 --> 01:16:14,207
He was so close that he could see his faces.

958
01:16:14,208 --> 01:16:16,707
I felt that was the time.

959
01:16:16,708 --> 01:16:20,042
I felt we saw each other great.

960
01:16:20,583 --> 01:16:22,624
I thought: "We did it."

961
01:16:22,625 --> 01:16:25,499
What worried me most before the concert was ...

962
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,874
The guitar. That's all.

963
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:34,958
I dreamed of playing the electric guitar while sanging on stage.

964
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:38,708
But I did not imagine that I would do it with "Girls".

965
01:17:01,208 --> 01:17:05,000
I don't like it when something is not good for me.

966
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,707
If I am not good at that, I prefer not to do it.

967
01:17:07,708 --> 01:17:09,332
I have to do it well.

968
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:10,249
It is one of two.

969
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:13,999
But I had to play the guitar yes or yes.

970
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,541
And I had to go well.

971
01:17:15,542 --> 01:17:19,832
If a professional sees how I play and thinks that I do it wrong,

972
01:17:19,833 --> 01:17:21,541
That would not support him.

973
01:17:21,542 --> 01:17:25,749
So I kept practicing, even if it were only with my fingers.

974
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:29,749
If I keep playing, the fingers bleed me.

975
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:32,458
But bleeding was not the problem.

976
01:17:33,792 --> 01:17:35,457
I can't use the stage alone.

977
01:17:35,458 --> 01:17:39,249
Singing and dancing is my job. It is what is supposed to highlight.

978
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:42,207
But it was my first time playing the guitar on stage,

979
01:17:42,208 --> 01:17:43,499
And it was a lot of pressure.

980
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,041
I worried me,

981
01:17:45,042 --> 01:17:47,541
But in the end it went well.

982
01:17:47,542 --> 01:17:49,833
So I don't feel ashamed of myself.

983
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,457
I first participated in composing a song.

984
01:18:20,458 --> 01:18:21,708
A applause!

985
01:18:22,833 --> 01:18:27,832
Before I had sent lyrics for secondary songs,

986
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:29,999
But they had never officially used until now.

987
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,541
Therefore, I felt more connected to that song.

988
01:18:32,542 --> 01:18:34,457
And the truth, I felt very proud.

989
01:18:34,458 --> 01:18:36,749
I didn't plan to get on stage alone.

990
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:38,499
I don't know if I had already mentioned it,

991
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:40,291
But I am schedule.

992
01:18:40,292 --> 01:18:42,166
I'm afraid to be alone on stage.

993
01:18:42,167 --> 01:18:44,374
I entered this company because they recruited me,

994
01:18:44,375 --> 01:18:47,666
And here I started from scratch to learn everything.

995
01:18:47,667 --> 01:18:51,749
So I think I am someone who has achieved everything based on effort.

996
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:55,791
Therefore, when they tell me to do something alone, I feel a lot of pressure.

997
01:18:55,792 --> 01:18:58,124
I always ask: "Can I really do it?"

998
01:18:58,125 --> 01:19:02,832
When I told this trauma to Jaewon,

999
01:19:02,833 --> 01:19:04,541
He stayed thinking about that,

1000
01:19:04,542 --> 01:19:06,832
He wanted to help me overcome it.

1001
01:19:06,833 --> 01:19:10,624
So he decided to include a solo scenario for each one.

1002
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:13,625
One two three...

1003
01:19:14,167 --> 01:19:16,332
Gira, spin.

1004
01:19:16,333 --> 01:19:17,250
Correct.

1005
01:19:21,083 --> 01:19:22,291
How was it?

1006
01:19:22,292 --> 01:19:24,083
How was it again?

1007
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,375
This part is complicated.

1008
01:19:33,208 --> 01:19:34,624
The difficult thing was:

1009
01:19:34,625 --> 01:19:37,667
"Can I introduce myself alone on stage?"

1010
01:19:39,042 --> 01:19:40,042
Will I be silly?

1011
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:43,125
I practiced a lot.

1012
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:46,082
I also rehearsed a lot with the dancers.

1013
01:19:46,083 --> 01:19:48,499
I did a lot of mental training. He told me:

1014
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:51,457
"That this presentation does not leave me ridiculous."

1015
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:53,625
And "seriously practice."

1016
01:23:37,708 --> 01:23:39,999
I can't with this song.

1017
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,666
- Because? - This type of song.

1018
01:23:41,667 --> 01:23:45,041
This type of song fits with my image,

1019
01:23:45,042 --> 01:23:47,374
- But I have never sung something like that. - Oh really?

1020
01:23:47,375 --> 01:23:50,874
You will be a lot on stage. Try it at least once.

1021
01:23:50,875 --> 01:23:53,166
Yes, but it is very difficult.

1022
01:23:53,167 --> 01:23:54,291
Yes, it can be.

1023
01:23:54,292 --> 01:23:56,125
But you have to try.

1024
01:23:56,708 --> 01:24:01,457
When you try, you will discover fun things in other songs.

1025
01:24:01,458 --> 01:24:04,624
My solo song is a ballad.

1026
01:24:04,625 --> 01:24:06,332
It may sound unexpected, but ...

1027
01:24:06,333 --> 01:24:08,499
It is just the genre that is worse.

1028
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:09,457
Really.

1029
01:24:09,458 --> 01:24:13,332
Aespa's songs are quite intense.

1030
01:24:13,333 --> 01:24:16,791
I don't feel emotionally pressed,

1031
01:24:16,792 --> 01:24:18,916
But ballads are soft and calm,

1032
01:24:18,917 --> 01:24:20,916
And that makes my voice stand out more.

1033
01:24:20,917 --> 01:24:23,167
I am ashamed to sing ballads.

1034
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:28,333
That's why I felt so pressured with my alone.

1035
01:28:44,250 --> 01:28:49,083
I think that at that time I was going through a kind of personal downturn.

1036
01:28:52,208 --> 01:28:54,167
Aeri, let's try this.

1037
01:28:55,583 --> 01:28:57,291
When you get to this part ...

1038
01:28:57,292 --> 01:28:59,250
I think you can make such a sweep.

1039
01:29:01,667 --> 01:29:03,457
And this part, like that. Or so.

1040
01:29:03,458 --> 01:29:05,667
Even if you do this, do not release the other step.

1041
01:29:07,292 --> 01:29:09,792
Start it a little and then move.

1042
01:29:10,375 --> 01:29:13,333
- I have it. - OK.

1043
01:29:14,875 --> 01:29:18,541
Since the end of 2022 I have been sick frequently.

1044
01:29:18,542 --> 01:29:21,666
So I started taking care of my energy more than necessary.

1045
01:29:21,667 --> 01:29:23,332
But if I don't, fall.

1046
01:29:23,333 --> 01:29:24,999
But the same, I had to practice.

1047
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,666
That generated a lot of stress and became ill again.

1048
01:29:27,667 --> 01:29:29,249
It was a vicious circle.

1049
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:31,624
Prepare in that state ...

1050
01:29:31,625 --> 01:29:34,041
It was very difficult.

1051
01:29:34,042 --> 01:29:36,832
I guess we all pass at times like that.

1052
01:29:36,833 --> 01:29:40,124
I also had to continue learning new things in full crisis.

1053
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:43,457
I think the most difficult thing was to cope the personal.

1054
01:29:43,458 --> 01:29:45,207
Let's try once.

1055
01:29:45,208 --> 01:29:48,208
Can I go out before my part?

1056
01:29:49,375 --> 01:29:51,083
I feel that I am very fair.

1057
01:29:55,167 --> 01:29:58,624
During this practice, Giselle had a bad time.

1058
01:29:58,625 --> 01:30:01,207
It cost him physically and emotionally.

1059
01:30:01,208 --> 01:30:03,166
It really was sad to see her.

1060
01:30:03,167 --> 01:30:05,499
I was sick, but still had to practice.

1061
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:07,582
I guess our work is like that.

1062
01:30:07,583 --> 01:30:13,499
We have to hide on stage, even if we are wrong.

1063
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:16,375
I imagine it was very hard for her.

1064
01:30:21,208 --> 01:30:23,582
As was going through a difficult time,

1065
01:30:23,583 --> 01:30:26,707
I even began to read books.

1066
01:30:26,708 --> 01:30:30,582
The others noticed how I felt and encouraged me.

1067
01:30:30,583 --> 01:30:32,666
And I told them: "Yes, I'm a little bad."

1068
01:30:32,667 --> 01:30:35,249
But it was something that I had to overcome for myself.

1069
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:37,958
I thought: "I have to get ahead!"

1070
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,125
Let's go!

1071
01:30:40,792 --> 01:30:42,874
Ok, come on.

1072
01:30:42,875 --> 01:30:44,500
¡Giselle, you turn!

1073
01:30:46,625 --> 01:30:48,292
Let's go!

1074
01:30:49,917 --> 01:30:55,249
There are those who keep it and exploit suddenly.

1075
01:30:55,250 --> 01:30:58,207
But she was telling us how she felt.

1076
01:30:58,208 --> 01:31:00,249
I was very sad to see her like that.

1077
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:02,457
But he did so well that he was proud.

1078
01:31:02,458 --> 01:31:04,292
It is incredible.

1079
01:33:58,375 --> 01:33:59,457
¿Shining?

1080
01:33:59,458 --> 01:34:04,082
As you know, the fans of any,

1081
01:34:04,083 --> 01:34:07,624
She usually has more vocal lines in our songs.

1082
01:34:07,625 --> 01:34:13,416
But in reality, because of her personality and tastes, she is more of the hip-hop style.

1083
01:34:13,417 --> 01:34:16,874
He has his own style with a lot of attitude.

1084
01:34:16,875 --> 01:34:20,207
I would like any to have a hip-hop style scenario,

1085
01:34:20,208 --> 01:34:22,374
Full of dancers, singing and dancing at the same time.

1086
01:34:22,375 --> 01:34:27,457
A stage with pop touches.

1087
01:34:27,458 --> 01:34:29,707
I am deciding between those two options.

1088
01:34:29,708 --> 01:34:33,624
One is to show the most vocal side that fans expect from me.

1089
01:34:33,625 --> 01:34:36,582
And the other is to show me as a complete artist:

1090
01:34:36,583 --> 01:34:39,457
singing, dancing and with attitude.

1091
01:34:39,458 --> 01:34:41,124
A mixture of the two?

1092
01:34:41,125 --> 01:34:43,250
I'm still thinking about it.

1093
01:34:48,833 --> 01:34:54,208
Here I can do well with some gestures, right?

1094
01:34:55,792 --> 01:34:58,542
Tell me if you have a problem with some part.

1095
01:35:00,667 --> 01:35:03,749
Yesterday we wondered if this would seem good.

1096
01:35:03,750 --> 01:35:05,500
Quiet, I'll be fine.

1097
01:35:07,625 --> 01:35:09,458
Are you going to be fine with this?

1098
01:35:10,542 --> 01:35:11,957
Try it.

1099
01:35:11,958 --> 01:35:13,291
I think so.

1100
01:35:13,292 --> 01:35:14,582
Failure is not an option.

1101
01:35:14,583 --> 01:35:15,999
I can do it, although ...

1102
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,832
Come on, no new!

1103
01:35:17,833 --> 01:35:18,917
Cheer up!

1104
01:35:30,458 --> 01:35:34,082
I feel that this song looks great for me.

1105
01:35:34,083 --> 01:35:35,707
Just sing a song?

1106
01:35:35,708 --> 01:35:38,041
It is very simple. It is not funny.

1107
01:35:38,042 --> 01:35:42,041
I want to show different sides of me.

1108
01:35:42,042 --> 01:35:45,291
I rode a new show, something I had never done,

1109
01:35:45,292 --> 01:35:48,708
And I loved doing it, it was a lot of fun.

1110
01:35:52,875 --> 01:35:55,416
- Do we leave it here? - Yes, very well.

1111
01:35:55,417 --> 01:35:58,582
- We are going to pause. - No, I can continue.

1112
01:35:58,583 --> 01:35:59,875
- Really? - Yeah.

1113
01:36:00,542 --> 01:36:01,582
Did you finish?

1114
01:36:01,583 --> 01:36:04,375
No, noning continues to rehearse his alone.

1115
01:36:06,583 --> 01:36:08,541
What are you thinking now?

1116
01:36:08,542 --> 01:36:10,125
Nothing, really.

1117
01:36:11,167 --> 01:36:14,457
I love learning choreographies,

1118
01:36:14,458 --> 01:36:15,749
So I had a good time.

1119
01:36:15,750 --> 01:36:17,749
Although I had to learn a lot of things.

1120
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:19,041
Just before the show,

1121
01:36:19,042 --> 01:36:21,666
I was wrong in a part that always went well.

1122
01:36:21,667 --> 01:36:24,332
I got so angry with me that I ended up crying.

1123
01:36:24,333 --> 01:36:27,291
I started rehearsing in my room. I was afraid of making mistakes.

1124
01:36:27,292 --> 01:36:30,000
Girls, let's do it well, yes?

1125
01:36:31,792 --> 01:36:32,958
List.

1126
01:39:42,958 --> 01:39:44,374
All,

1127
01:39:44,375 --> 01:39:45,708
How was it?

1128
01:39:48,417 --> 01:39:49,750
I see you ...

1129
01:39:50,833 --> 01:39:55,166
A spark of emotion in your eyes.

1130
01:39:55,167 --> 01:39:56,083
I see you ...

1131
01:39:57,667 --> 01:39:58,667
I see you ...

1132
01:40:00,292 --> 01:40:03,833
Even in the undecided nights for small fears.

1133
01:40:04,667 --> 01:40:05,833
I see you ...

1134
01:40:06,958 --> 01:40:11,457
He could hear Jaewon's voice in the headphones.

1135
01:40:11,458 --> 01:40:15,499
We were talking when Jaewon said:

1136
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:17,957
"Hey, listen."

1137
01:40:17,958 --> 01:40:20,166
We stay: "What happens?"

1138
01:40:20,167 --> 01:40:23,166
The fans were singing our song.

1139
01:40:23,167 --> 01:40:25,999
I was very surprised. I didn't expect it at all.

1140
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:31,874
The lyrics reached us to the heart.

1141
01:40:31,875 --> 01:40:34,792
I felt that they were giving us all their love.

1142
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:53,791
I remembered how hard these two months were.

1143
01:40:53,792 --> 01:40:56,916
I had come to mind that we had not been able to see fans.

1144
01:40:56,917 --> 01:41:01,833
It was full of emotions. I felt bad with them, for everything.

1145
01:41:02,792 --> 01:41:04,708
That's why I didn't endure and cried.

1146
01:41:09,125 --> 01:41:11,542
We almost never cry.

1147
01:41:12,042 --> 01:41:13,375
We are very moved.

1148
01:41:15,208 --> 01:41:17,166
We almost never cry.

1149
01:41:17,167 --> 01:41:19,917
But in our first concert, we do cry.

1150
01:41:20,917 --> 01:41:24,999
At that time, he felt like a dream come true.

1151
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,749
It was as if Aespa and the My

1152
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:33,000
We would have created this together.

1153
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:55,666
We finally had our first concert. We wanted our own concert.

1154
01:41:55,667 --> 01:41:59,332
We are going to share hundreds, thousands of concerts with you.

1155
01:41:59,333 --> 01:42:02,374
And we will show you how much we have grown.

1156
01:42:02,375 --> 01:42:03,292
We love them.

1157
01:42:05,958 --> 01:42:11,333
I hope we can have fun much more often with the My.

1158
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:15,957
Thanks for accompanying us.

1159
01:42:15,958 --> 01:42:19,124
It was as if Aespa and the My had created this together.

1160
01:42:19,125 --> 01:42:23,374
The truth ... I want to be with you forever.

1161
01:42:23,375 --> 01:42:26,541
Anside what Aespa will do in the future.

1162
01:42:26,542 --> 01:42:30,707
We, Aespa, we will strive to show more great performances.

1163
01:42:30,708 --> 01:42:32,958
Thank you so much. We love them.

1164
01:42:35,667 --> 01:42:39,208
I feel that we have improved a lot through this concert.

1165
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:44,749
We did not have many opportunities to interact with our fans.

1166
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:48,457
But we could interact with our fans during this concert.

1167
01:42:48,458 --> 01:42:52,624
I thought: "Wow, it would be so beautiful to see our fans here!"

1168
01:42:52,625 --> 01:42:56,124
It would be so beautiful.

1169
01:42:56,125 --> 01:42:59,041
It was so beautiful to see them from the stage.

1170
01:42:59,042 --> 01:43:01,374
So that was the most memorable moment.

1171
01:43:01,375 --> 01:43:06,999
The people who love us gathered in one place.

1172
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:10,541
We find ourselves and we make a show for them.

1173
01:43:10,542 --> 01:43:12,166
I felt we get closer.

1174
01:43:12,167 --> 01:43:14,292
And we feel more connected?

1175
01:43:16,167 --> 01:43:18,250
Thank you, everyone!

1176
01:43:19,167 --> 01:43:23,250
- You are so pretty. You are so adorable. - We are going down.

1177
01:43:23,833 --> 01:43:26,999
Finally, we love them very much, My.

1178
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,249
One two three.

1179
01:43:28,250 --> 01:43:29,958
Thank you so much!

1180
01:43:33,917 --> 01:43:35,666
- They go home carefully. - Bye bye.

1181
01:43:35,667 --> 01:43:37,292
Rest. No!

1182
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,833
Bye bye.

1183
01:43:43,708 --> 01:43:45,707
Gracias.

1184
01:43:45,708 --> 01:43:47,916
Oh, it ended! It ended!

1185
01:43:47,917 --> 01:43:49,500
Good job.

1186
01:44:15,792 --> 01:44:17,166
He was amazing.

1187
01:44:17,167 --> 01:44:18,374
Thank you so much.

1188
01:44:18,375 --> 01:44:19,292
Good job.

1189
01:44:21,708 --> 01:44:22,792
Go rest.

1190
01:44:27,167 --> 01:44:29,958
Our first concert is over!

1191
01:44:30,958 --> 01:44:32,874
He feels sad when he ends.

1192
01:44:32,875 --> 01:44:36,707
We struggled a lot and went very well.

1193
01:44:36,708 --> 01:44:39,249
Next time we will try more.

1194
01:44:39,250 --> 01:44:42,000
- Let's eat something delicious. - We work hard.

1195
01:44:44,583 --> 01:44:45,917
It's enough.

1196
01:44:46,583 --> 01:44:48,458
I think I've grown a little.

1197
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:55,124
I wondered if I could debut.

1198
01:44:55,125 --> 01:45:00,500
I didn't know they would love us so much, so I'm more grateful.

1199
01:45:01,042 --> 01:45:06,707
Now I am sure of many things.

1200
01:45:06,708 --> 01:45:12,666
Just after our debut, we were not sure of our future.

1201
01:45:12,667 --> 01:45:14,749
But it is becoming clearer.

1202
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:17,041
- I think they should show who they are. - What are we?

1203
01:45:17,042 --> 01:45:19,167
- I think this is you. - OK.

1204
01:45:19,750 --> 01:45:24,916
We are Aespa please take care of us!

1205
01:45:24,917 --> 01:45:31,082
I hope we shine with our own color.

1206
01:45:31,083 --> 01:45:33,750
People will think: "Aespa had great success."

1207
01:45:34,917 --> 01:45:40,082
But we think we still have a lot to go.

1208
01:45:40,083 --> 01:45:41,749
We have so many things we want to show and do.

1209
01:45:41,750 --> 01:45:45,707
I am curious about our future.

1210
01:45:45,708 --> 01:45:48,916
We have discovered our own style.

1211
01:45:48,917 --> 01:45:50,249
Since we know who we are,

1212
01:45:50,250 --> 01:45:56,417
We will reflect more characteristics in the musical and visual.

1213
01:45:57,125 --> 01:45:58,666
We can do it.

1214
01:45:58,667 --> 01:46:00,000
Good job.

1215
01:46:01,542 --> 01:46:02,542
I love you.

1216
01:46:03,083 --> 01:46:04,207
I love you!

1217
01:46:04,208 --> 01:46:06,249
Cheer up, Aespa!

1218
01:46:06,250 --> 01:46:08,292
- One two three! - Cheer up!

1219
01:46:52,917 --> 01:46:55,457
We are always together, talking about silly things.

1220
01:46:55,458 --> 01:46:58,291
We simply laugh at the sheets rolling.

1221
01:46:58,292 --> 01:47:00,791
We laugh and shout all the time.

1222
01:47:00,792 --> 01:47:05,125
That improves the mood of the group.

1223
01:47:07,750 --> 01:47:10,083
Part of the family of giraffes.

1224
01:47:11,083 --> 01:47:12,125
Is it seriously?

1225
01:47:13,167 --> 01:47:15,916
It is very fun to be together all the time.

1226
01:47:15,917 --> 01:47:21,082
If someone is having a bad time, we expect silent, which we appreciate.

1227
01:47:21,083 --> 01:47:23,999
I think our connection as a team was forged

1228
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:29,750
fighting and reconciling for years.

1229
01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:44,957
We come from different countries and we have different cultures,

1230
01:47:44,958 --> 01:47:49,999
But we get along so well among us, which is so wonderful.

1231
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,292
It is destiny!

1232
01:47:51,792 --> 01:47:57,124
It will not be easy for a group of singers to become a true family.

1233
01:47:57,125 --> 01:48:02,083
In that sense, we are very lucky.

1234
01:48:06,625 --> 01:48:07,625
Did you eat yet?

1235
01:48:10,792 --> 01:48:12,833
Was it fun to film us?

1236
01:48:15,083 --> 01:48:16,083
Dudada.

1237
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,917
We are grateful for everything.

1238
01:48:20,458 --> 01:48:22,582
What was the hardest moment for you?

1239
01:48:22,583 --> 01:48:23,667
I'm fine.

1240
01:48:25,708 --> 01:48:28,041
- Do not show your emotions. - I know.

1241
01:48:28,042 --> 01:48:29,832
You are a professional.

1242
01:48:29,833 --> 01:48:30,874
How annoying.

1243
01:48:30,875 --> 01:48:33,624
- We should learn that. - I did it while nobody looked.

1244
01:48:33,625 --> 01:48:34,707
We are grateful.

1245
01:48:34,708 --> 01:48:36,541
It costs us a lot to follow our schedule,

1246
01:48:36,542 --> 01:48:39,041
But for staff it must be more difficult.

1247
01:48:39,042 --> 01:48:43,124
Not only do they follow our schedule, they also handle and do other things.

1248
01:48:43,125 --> 01:48:49,500
If it weren't for the staff, we would not have achieved the same.

1249
01:48:50,458 --> 01:48:52,874
We all work very hard.

1250
01:48:52,875 --> 01:48:54,542
Good job!

1251
01:48:55,917 --> 01:48:57,042
Good job!

1252
01:48:57,583 --> 01:48:58,583
Health!

1253
01:49:00,458 --> 01:49:03,832
It will be fun to see this documentary.

1254
01:49:03,833 --> 01:49:04,874
Of course.

1255
01:49:04,875 --> 01:49:07,207
We could remember these moments.

1256
01:49:07,208 --> 01:49:09,707
I think here you will see Aespa's true self.

1257
01:49:09,708 --> 01:49:11,707
It feels like a time capsule.

1258
01:49:11,708 --> 01:49:13,374
I think we are lucky.

1259
01:49:13,375 --> 01:49:17,416
Normally, people would not have the opportunity to record something like that.

1260
01:49:17,417 --> 01:49:18,707
Hello.

1261
01:49:18,708 --> 01:49:20,791
We are on the plane.

1262
01:49:20,792 --> 01:49:23,874
I think we will sleep after filming this.

1263
01:49:23,875 --> 01:49:25,541
Yeah.

1264
01:49:25,542 --> 01:49:28,375
I love creating a good memory filming this.

1265
01:49:30,875 --> 01:49:35,291
It would be fun if the documentary ended after we said "cut."

1266
01:49:35,292 --> 01:49:36,582
One two three...

1267
01:49:36,583 --> 01:49:37,792
Court!
