1
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,080
(Adapted:I'm the Most Beautiful Count in Siam,
standing at Tha Phra chewing on a pen.)

2
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,760
Worradej, what are you doing?

3
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,880
I’ll use science to create miracles.

4
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,200
At the Fire Crossing Ritual,
when I step into the flames,

5
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,280
you begin the operation right away.

6
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,039
Who are you?

7
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,520
Which side are you on?

8
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,640
The mission is complete.

9
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,920
I’ll be back on stage for my concert soon.

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,360
Worradej, take me home now.

11
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,360
I need to get back for my concert.

12
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,680
No way.

13
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,120
You’re having nightmares
so bad you’re sleep-talking, Worradej?

14
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,640
A nightmare, yeah.

15
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,840
But I’m not sleep-talking.

16
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,479
And my name’s not Worradej.

17
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,000
I’m going home.

18
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,360
Where are you going?

19
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,480
I’m going home too.

20
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,880
But…

21
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,000
I don’t even know how to get back

22
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,760
or where to go.

23
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,880
Life’s already hard enough
being a trans woman.

24
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,960
And now I gotta deal
with all this too.

25
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,600
You don’t have a home
to return to now.

26
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,240
Lord Singhanakhon’s ship

27
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,000
was dismantled to use the wood
for building the pier.

28
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,720
All the treasures were sold off
and given to the villagers.

29
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,320
In fact, you as the Count’s child

30
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,640
were sentenced to forced labor.

31
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,040
But it was me who brought you here.

32
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,040
Kosol.

33
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,000
Tell me honestly.

34
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,000
Your mission with Banjong,

35
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,560
what else are you planning?

36
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,360
Can you tell me, please?

37
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,600
Tell me, please. Tell me.

38
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,840
Didn’t you hear
what King Chaiyached said?

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,520
That our next mission
is to storm the capital

40
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,440
and take down Somdet Saenyakorn,
who’s seized power.

41
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,160
And if we succeed,

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,440
we’ll be able to change the law.

43
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,760
And you

44
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,600
must stay and help me.

45
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,840
I…

46
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,160
help you

47
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,760
change the law?

48
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,920
I’m an idol, you know.

49
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,880
I’m not some kind of revolutionary.

50
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,760
You’re talking nonsense again.

51
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,560
Come here.

52
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,920
Last night, you really hit the spot for me.

53
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,920
Let’s go another round.

54
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,000
Wait, wait, hold on, Kosol.

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,520
Talk about this revolution first.

56
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,560
What else are you planning?
Tell me right now.

57
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,840
We’ll talk later.

58
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,400
Don’t… talk… talk…

59
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,040
Talk. Talk.

60
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,520
Talk first.

61
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,760
(Royal Palace of Thanapura)

62
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,400
Now,

63
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,480
Lord Singhanakhon has been stripped
of his rank and position as governor.

64
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,560
The city of Singhanakhon is under
Lord Kosol and the Revolutionary Council.

65
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,760
King Chaiyached

66
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,240
is also under our custody.

67
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,160
Let Somdet Saenyakorn,

68
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,640
Lord Kalahom,

69
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,760
step down from power that
was never his in the first place.

70
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,160
So there’ll be no bloodshed.

71
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,880
Ready the troops.

72
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,240
We’ll go to war soon.

73
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,840
Yes, My Lord.

74
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,840
Law.

75
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,600
Law is the set of rules
established by the state

76
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,200
or those in power,

77
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,000
used as a tool

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,680
to enforce actions

79
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,080
that fulfill society’s goals.

80
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,880
Alright then, hello.

81
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,320
Naiyapinyapat,

82
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,880
you do realize,

83
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,680
if the police were here,
you’d already be arrested.

84
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,600
What, just for dozing off in class?

85
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,640
That’s enough to get arrested, Teacher?

86
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,440
Isn’t that a bit cruel?

87
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,200
It’s not about sleeping.

88
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,600
It’s about how you act
against your birth gender.

89
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,960
You’re a man.

90
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,000
You can’t be exclaiming
ka, kha like that.

91
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,760
Yes, Teacher.

92
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,840
Then I’ll be careful from now on.

93
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,760
Naiyapinyapat.

94
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,720
What now, Teacher?

95
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,200
That hairclip, take it off too.

96
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,720
This law,

97
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,600
this very law was enacted
in the Thanapura Kingdom

98
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,640
by Somdet Saenyakorn

99
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,200
and has been enforced ever since.

100
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,920
Nong Phin, we heard that today

101
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,240
you have something important
to announce to your fans?

102
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,240
Yes, it’s…

103
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,640
something that’s been weighing
on me for a long time,

104
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,120
ever since I entered
the idol industry.

105
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,360
And today I feel like

106
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,480
I don’t need to hide this any longer.

107
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,920
I’m going to announce
to everyone that…

108
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,200
I…

109
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,120
am a trans woman.

110
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,040
And from now on,

111
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,840
let’s make it clear, I’m Prince.

112
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:43,600
Say it together, Prince.

113
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,240
Prince.

114
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,320
I’ll stop lying to myself
and to everyone.

115
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,560
I’ll shine and show the world

116
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,800
the most fabulous version of me.

117
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,400
Nong Phin, don’t. Please don’t.

118
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,600
You’ll get in trouble.

119
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,280
Then let me face it.

120
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,960
If our country still has
laws like these,

121
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,400
even if it’s a court order
or an arrest warrant,

122
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,280
I’ll gladly take it.

123
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,280
Better than losing my true self.

124
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,600
All of us…

125
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,880
We all have the right
to be ourselves.

126
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:24,080
And everyone has the right
to be beautiful.

127
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,240
He’s the first to spark
a revolution in the idol scene.

128
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,400
The first LGBTQ+ idol
in the nation of Saenya.

129
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,600
Give it up for Prince
and his fearless courage.

130
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,600
Come to think of it,

131
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,640
I guess I’ve got a streak
of rebellion in me too.

132
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,520
If today we could take down
Somdet Saenyakorn,

133
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,160
we’d abolish the anti-trans law
from this country right away.

134
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,200
So trans women won’t keep suffering
under it for hundreds of years.

135
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,200
Including me, in the future.

136
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,280
That would be so fabulous.

137
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,000
Mumu.

138
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,480
Papa, where are you going?

139
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,600
Well, Mama

140
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,400
just needs to have a little talk with Papa.

141
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,400
Just a bit.

142
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,120
Silent.

143
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,120
Such an unfriendly look.

144
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,160
So this is

145
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,680
what they call

146
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,360
braving the tiger with a kind heart.

147
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,400
Mumu, my child.

148
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,000
Mama

149
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,720
brought some tasty meat for you.

150
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,920
Fresh.

151
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,880
Eat up, sweetie.

152
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,120
Yummy, go on.

153
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,560
I’ll feed you.

154
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,680
Let me feed you.

155
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
Eat.

156
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,480
Eat.

157
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,080
Good job.

158
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,120
One more piece.

159
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,960
Yummy, good boy.

160
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,400
Good boy, yummy.

161
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,000
Yummy, good boy.

162
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,040
Good boy, so clever.

163
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,080
We’re friends now.

164
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,720
Friends.

165
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,080
Don’t eat me, okay, Mumu?

166
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,640
Brother Banjong.

167
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,640
Brother Kosol has already
toppled the Count.

168
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,440
Why are you still so tense?

169
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,720
This overthrow,

170
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,520
besides the Count

171
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,960
and the soldiers loyal to him,

172
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,440
dragged others into prison too.

173
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,080
That includes the servants
in the household.

174
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,400
They knew nothing at all.

175
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,840
They had nothing to do
with the Count’s rebellion.

176
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,040
Yet they had to suffer too.

177
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,120
Are you worried about the servants,
or about Worradej?

178
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,040
Don’t forget, Worradej is
the Count’s own flesh and blood.

179
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,680
Worradej is with Kosol.

180
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
I’m not worried.

181
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,960
Kosol.

182
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,920
What?

183
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,640
What are you doing here?

184
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,880
If the officials see you,
they’ll send you to dig canals.

185
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,040
I’ve been stuck in my room
for three days. It reeks.

186
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,160
But the reason I came here

187
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,000
is because I have something
important to tell you.

188
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,160
I promise

189
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,960
you’ll be glad to hear it.

190
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,840
You’re here to confess
your love to me?

191
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,920
Oh, no. Of course not.

192
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,720
The reason I came here

193
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,920
is because

194
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,920
after thinking it over and over,

195
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,040
if we want to make the world
a better place,

196
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,120
we should start taking action from today.

197
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,560
So I’ve decided

198
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,280
that I’ll fight alongside you.

199
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,040
But on one condition.

200
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,280
You have to promise me first,

201
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,120
once you bring down
Somdet Saenyakorn,

202
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,800
you’ll abolish the law
that punishes same-sex love.

203
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,720
Of course.

204
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,600
That very law

205
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,960
was the reason I was removed
as Regent,

206
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,200
kept from being King,

207
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,440
and thrown into prison for years.

208
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,720
Fabulous.

209
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,560
We’re on the same page.

210
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,400
Shake on it.

211
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,560
And I’ll propose another new law.

212
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,240
What law?

213
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,600
Legalizing same-sex marriage.

214
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,000
And who will you marry then?

215
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,880
Isn’t it obvious?

216
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,640
There’s only one person.

217
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,800
You.

218
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,320
So, Your Majesty, here you are.

219
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,160
Well, this toy is convenient,
isn’t it, My Lord?

220
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,720
No need to call out and tire yourself.

221
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,600
You’ve been with my brother
for three days.

222
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,160
You look exhausted.

223
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,560
Seems my brother really wore you out.

224
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,720
Please don’t tease me like that, My Lord.

225
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,080
I’m still a man, My Lord.
This is embarrassing.

226
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,800
But at the Fire Crossing Ritual,

227
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,120
you kissed Kosol in front of everyone.

228
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,240
Now all of Singhanakhon knows

229
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,000
you two are lovers.

230
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,520
Still embarrassed?

231
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,840
We’re not lovers, My Lord.

232
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,240
What I did,

233
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,440
I only wanted to prove

234
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,280
Kosol didn’t force me into anything.

235
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,600
I don’t have feelings
beyond that, My Lord.

236
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,200
Please don’t read too much into it, My Lord.

237
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,240
Oh, come on.

238
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,760
I thought I’d finally
get you as a sister-in-law.

239
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,960
Your Majesty…

240
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,440
By the way, where’s Jade?

241
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,480
Why isn’t he with you?

242
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,320
Jade didn’t come with me, My Lord.

243
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,560
Isn’t Jade here with Your Majesty?

244
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,600
No, he isn’t.

245
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,760
Ever since the Fire Ritual,

246
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,280
I haven’t seen him at all.

247
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,960
I thought he’d gone with you.

248
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,720
Chit, do you know

249
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,080
where Jade disappeared to?

250
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,840
I haven’t seen him for three days.

251
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I heard

252
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,880
the servants of captured nobles

253
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,520
were punished along with their masters.

254
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,560
I believe Jade

255
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,280
might be forced into hard labor

256
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,840
somewhere, Your Majesty.

257
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,280
Worradej, come search
for Jade with me.

258
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,000
Wait, Your Majesty.

259
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,760
I don’t think this is right, My Lord.

260
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,280
You’re the King.

261
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,400
If you free the wrong person,

262
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,160
people will criticize you, My Lord.

263
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,280
Let me handle this instead, My Lord.

264
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,560
Once I know something, I’ll send word.

265
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,400
I’ll take my leave, My Lord.

266
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,840
- Move it.
- Put your back into it.

267
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,840
Hurry up, over there.

268
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,960
Don’t slack off, damn it.

269
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,240
Here too, hurry.

270
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,600
- Go, go, faster.
- Come on, load it up.

271
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,840
Come.

272
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,720
A father helps his son.
I’ll help you.

273
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,800
Let’s go.

274
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,080
Can you manage, Dad?

275
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,440
Yeah, yeah, come on.

276
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,200
Move it, move it.

277
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,720
How are you, son?
How are you feeling?

278
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,160
Hey, you slacking off?

279
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,800
Want me to whip you?

280
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,960
My boy’s not well.

281
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,800
Let him rest a bit, Master.

282
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,040
No way.

283
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,400
If others see him resting,
they’ll rest too.

284
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,000
When will the work get done?

285
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,000
Then I’ll get chewed out by the boss.

286
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,359
- Keep loading.
- How are you, son?

287
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,520
Enough, enough.

288
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,000
Don’t, don’t.

289
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,040
Get up.

290
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,800
- How do we help him?
- If he can’t, let him die.

291
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,400
If the soldiers find us,
we’ll be dragged in too.

292
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,000
- Forced into labor for sure.
- Enough, enough.

293
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,720
Don’t, don’t hit him.

294
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,880
Dad.

295
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,880
Hey, you.

296
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
Here are the extra questions they sent.

297
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,200
For today’s interview.
Read them.

298
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,080
Yes, Manager.

299
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,440
Good job.

300
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,880
- P’Man, hello.
- Hi.

301
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,040
Every time we’re on set, you look tense.

302
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,560
We all know why.

303
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,560
That big-shot host, right?

304
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,400
Just avoid him if you can.

305
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,680
How could I?
I have to hand him the interview script.

306
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,080
These are the questions
for today’s interview.

307
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,880
Hey.

308
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,760
What font size is this?

309
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,240
Fourteen.

310
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,080
Don’t you know that’s too small?
I can’t read it.

311
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,960
For me, it has to be twenty.

312
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,680
Sorry, I’ll go print a new copy right away.

313
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,720
Don’t bother.

314
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,920
You’ve got five minutes.
Write it out for me.

315
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,800
And make sure I can read it.

316
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,280
Go.

317
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,920
Don’t mess with him.

318
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,360
He’s a host with serious pull.

319
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,880
If he doesn’t like you,

320
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,040
you’ll be finished overnight.

321
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,240
I’m sorry. I write very slowly.

322
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,000
And my handwriting isn’t neat either.

323
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,920
I’ll just go print a new copy.

324
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,240
You dare defy my orders?

325
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Come.

326
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,280
Master, Master.

327
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,960
Father.

328
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,520
Enough, stop.

329
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,720
Father.

330
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,080
- I’m scared.
- Hey!

331
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,760
Stop right now.

332
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,440
Can’t you see he can’t take it?

333
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,960
What if he dies?

334
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,720
Master, don’t help me.
I can still go on.

335
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,040
Run away.

336
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,080
Oh…

337
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,080
So the Count is here.

338
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,720
I’ve been searching for you.

339
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,120
Do you realize you share
your father’s crimes?

340
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,840
Hey, men. Seize him.

341
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,640
- Stop, let go.
- Don’t.

342
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,920
Don’t hurt Master.

343
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,520
- Let go.
- Release him.

344
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,640
I’ll take him to work
on documents at my manor.

345
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,800
Yes, Count.

346
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,000
Count.

347
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,920
You’re the new governor
of Singhanakhon.

348
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,600
Hurry and thank the Count.

349
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,160
Thank you, Banjong.

350
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,000
Banjong, please help Jade. He’s…

351
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,240
Jade can’t take it anymore.

352
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,760
If he keeps going, he’ll die for sure.

353
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,480
Please, Banjong, save him.

354
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,200
I’ll take Jade instead.

355
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,720
Yes, Count.

356
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,160
- Go, Jade.
- Go, Jade, hurry.

357
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,160
Don’t worry about me.
Just go.

358
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,360
- Please, don’t worry.
- Jade!

359
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,640
Help me, please.

360
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,920
- Help me, please.
- Help me, please.

361
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,160
Please, help me.

362
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,000
- Help me, please.
- Help me, please.

363
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,040
Help me, please.

364
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,640
- You lot, back to work.
- Help me, please.

365
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,720
- Get moving.
- Please, help.

366
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,240
Help me, please.

367
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,720
Please, help me.

368
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,520
- Help me, please.
- Help me, please.

369
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,920
- Get up. Work.
- Help me, please.

370
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,080
- Get up.
- Help me, please.

371
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,800
Rest for now.

372
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,840
Luckily, Count Banjong saved
the two of you in time.

373
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,840
But Jade’s father and the others

374
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,160
are still forced to work there, My Lord.

375
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,720
I don’t exactly feel good, My Lord,

376
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,000
being the only one granted privilege.

377
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,680
We can’t pull them out one by one.

378
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,440
If we really want to help,

379
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,720
we must change the palace law itself.

380
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,120
But soon enough,

381
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,000
once we seize power
from Somdet Saenyakorn,

382
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,480
we’ll rewrite all the laws together.

383
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,920
Including…

384
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,600
the very existence of the monarchy?

385
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

386
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
Brothers and sisters, listen.

387
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,160
Whoever wishes to be a soldier,

388
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,520
come and enlist here.

389
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,880
If we want to change this land,

390
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,640
to give everyone a better life,

391
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,200
we must sacrifice now,

392
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,560
and take the front line.

393
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,520
Join us in battle,

394
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,680
to fight against injustice.

395
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,320
Whoever wishes to fight alongside us,

396
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,760
step forward and enlist here.

397
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,720
I’ll take everyone, no exceptions.

398
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,880
All I ask is the heart of a fighter.

399
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,160
Not me. I’d rather die old.

400
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
Are you willing
to fight with me?

401
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,560
No. Go on, son.

402
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,120
And you? Interested?

403
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,360
I accept women too.

404
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,320
Are you crazy? I’m a lady.
You expect me to fight?

405
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,400
My husband already died
on the battlefield.

406
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,080
What’s wrong
with all of you?

407
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,560
Don’t you want to
fight for yourself, your

408
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,760
family, your children,
the ones you love?

409
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,960
Enough, my Lord.

410
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,800
We’ve been recruiting for three days now,

411
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,600
and not a single person
has joined.

412
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,880
It’s a waste of time.

413
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,240
Why is everyone so cowardly,
selfish, and blind?

414
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,640
Only caring
about themselves.

415
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,960
I think we need
another way.

416
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,840
Worradej.

417
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,200
From now on,
we’ll fight together.

418
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,520
So I want to confess

419
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,080
what’s been weighing
on my heart.

420
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,760
Otherwise…

421
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,080
I won’t be at peace.

422
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,040
Is this about you
rejecting my love?

423
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,080
That… I don’t mind anymore.

424
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,400
Put your heart at ease.

425
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,040
No, not that.

426
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,840
What I need to confess is…

427
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,440
Didn’t I tell you already?

428
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,800
Get out of our group.

429
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,600
But Banjong never said
a word against me.

430
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,320
What right do you have
to drive me out?

431
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,320
Banjong may be
the founder of this group,

432
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,400
but we all share
equal rights here.

433
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,440
And we’ve already decided

434
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,600
we don’t welcome you.

435
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,880
Go.

436
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,800
I said get out.

437
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,720
Are you deaf
or just stupid?

438
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,280
Freak.

439
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,280
- Get out.
- Go.

440
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,080
- Get out.
- Go.

441
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,120
- Get out, out.
- I said get out.

442
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,720
- Out.
- Out.

443
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,360
- I said get out, freak.
- Out.

444
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,640
- Drop dead.
- I said get out.

445
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,720
- Go, get out.
- Out, pervert.

446
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,120
- Go.
- Out.

447
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,840
- Go.
- Out.

448
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,400
- Get out.
- Can’t you hear?

449
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,520
- Out.
- Scum.

450
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,000
- Out.
- Just go.

451
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,920
- Go.
- I told you to get out.

452
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,160
Freak.

453
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,800
You… you killed Vichai.

454
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,640
- Vichai.
- Vichai.

455
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,520
Vichai!

456
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,640
Vichai.

457
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,000
- Vichai.
- Vichai.

458
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,440
If you want to live here
with dignity, you must fight.

459
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,160
Kosol was the one
who taught me that.

460
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,000
He killed our man.

461
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,480
You can’t keep him
in the group anymore.

462
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,160
I was the one
who killed him.

463
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,320
I’ll take all the blame.

464
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,560
Drink some water.

465
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,240
I’m sorry, Worradej.

466
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,000
I regret having
to do this.

467
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,680
It’s the only way
to stop you from hurting us more.

468
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,360
Banjong.

469
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,600
I love you.

470
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,680
Carry on our mission.

471
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,160
And the one who shot you
at the palace wall…

472
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,760
was me.

473
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,160
Totally shook.

474
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,640
But now I understand.

475
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,040
You weren’t a traitor.
You never betrayed us.

476
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,120
I was wrong all along.

477
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,200
So today I’ve come
to apologize.

478
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,480
Can you forgive me?

479
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,320
It’s… kind of strange,

480
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,360
to forgive someone who tried
to kill me twice that easily.

481
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,200
If you can’t forgive me,

482
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,080
I’ll understand.

483
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,480
I deserve your anger
and your hate.

484
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,720
I’ll accept it humbly.

485
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,520
But I forgive you.

486
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,080
Really?

487
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,520
Really.

488
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,920
I understand why you did it,

489
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,560
out of love for the group
and for the cause.

490
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,520
And you were twisted
by those who despised me.

491
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,880
Let’s just leave the past
where it belongs.

492
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,640
We still have a mission
to fight together.

493
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,000
If we stay hung up on this,

494
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,160
we won’t get anything done,
right?

495
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,280
Thank you, Worradej.

496
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,680
Let me hug you.

497
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,280
Let’s start over.

498
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,400
Worradej.

499
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,960
Till the end of skies,

500
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,000
earth and stars
shall meet.

501
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,840
If our love…

502
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,960
Never ending, never fading.

503
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,000
Through the years,
through endless time.

504
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,200
May our love always return,
never torn apart.

505
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,360
It’s not over yet.

506
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,000
Ugh, I’m going crazy.

507
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,160
Ugh.

508
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,480
If you can’t raise an army,

509
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,120
then find a way to defeat
Somdet Saenyakorn without force.

510
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,040
That way no blood
needs to be shed.

511
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,640
Oh, child.

512
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,880
You think if I kneel and beg
him to step down,

513
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,600
he’ll just give up power?

514
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,680
Dream on.

515
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,080
Who said anything
about kneeling?

516
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,160
I meant a way
without violence.

517
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,440
Using brains.

518
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,960
Do you even have one,
big brother?

519
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,760
Why you…

520
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,880
As if you’re so clever yourself.

521
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,240
If you are,

522
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,560
then show me right now.

523
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,000
How would you handle
that Somdet?

524
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,280
I haven’t figured it out yet.

525
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,000
I was only suggesting
an option.

526
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,960
I thought you’d be the one
to come up with it.

527
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,720
If you’ve got no idea,
then don’t speak.

528
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,280
You asked me for advice,
so I had to say something.

529
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,240
If you don’t want my words,
then don’t come next time.

530
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,480
I thought you’d grown up,

531
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,720
and might have better ideas
than before.

532
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,960
Are you calling me thick?

533
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,880
Then I’ll wait and see
your master plan.

534
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,520
Let’s see how brilliant
it really is.

535
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,560
But first, get an army
before you brag.

536
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,800
And if I do find one,
what then?

537
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,880
Then I’ll do whatever you ask of me.

538
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,800
I won’t say no.

539
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,239
Oh my god, what now?

540
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,360
Come back with me.

541
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,760
No way, I’m not going.

542
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,080
With you around I can barely
get any sleep.

543
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,280
I promise I’ll bother you less.

544
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,280
From now on, if you want
or don’t want something,

545
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,400
just tell me.

546
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,280
I’ll give in to you in everything.

547
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,920
Just come back with me now.

548
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,239
Wait a sec,

549
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,320
this is weird. What’s going on?

550
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,320
There’s something I want to discuss.

551
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,679
I need your help to figure it out.

552
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,520
About what?

553
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,880
Help me gather troops for battle.

554
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,960
Me? Find soldiers for your fight?

555
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,360
That’s right.

556
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,040
Wait, wait, wait.

557
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,760
You seriously want a kathoey
to recruit an army?

558
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,680
I’m better off gathering dancers for a parade.

559
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,840
Because I know you’ve got brains and wit.

560
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,320
You can think outside the box,

561
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,160
beyond anything I can predict.

562
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,560
I believe this task isn’t beyond you.

563
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,560
Flattering me like that, I’m blushing.

564
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,960
Well…

565
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,800
I…

566
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,280
might…

567
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,360
just think of something.

568
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,160
If I get some tasty food
in my belly first.

569
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,240
Here you go.

570
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,320
Thanks, Auntie.

571
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,880
Oh no, don’t thank me.

572
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,040
I made it as an offering
for the goddess.

573
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,880
What goddess, Auntie?

574
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,680
I’m just an ordinary person like you.

575
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,160
Ordinary people don’t just
walk through fire like that.

576
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,720
Goddess, no need to hide your true self.

577
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,320
The whole town saw
your miracle already.

578
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,640
You’re the goddess.

579
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,440
Let me bow to you too.

580
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,240
That’s what real divinity is like.

581
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,080
Never revealing itself.

582
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,200
One blessing from you
will bring me luck.

583
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,520
Touch my head, Goddess.

584
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,240
Bless me with your hand.

585
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,880
Touch my head, Goddess.

586
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,080
- Goddess!
- Bless me, please!

587
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,120
Touch my head.

588
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,240
Alright, everyone, gather here!

589
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,200
Come listen, quick!

590
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,120
Brothers and sisters,
gather around!

591
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,320
Listen up, everyone!

592
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,640
Goddess Worradej

593
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,440
will perform a miracle

594
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,840
at the firewalk ground.

595
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,160
If you wish to witness her glory,
come see for yourselves!

596
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,040
- Let’s go!
- Let’s check it out!

597
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,480
At the firewalk ground!

598
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,360
Hurry up!

599
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,280
Truth is, I don’t really like
showing off miracles.

600
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,200
It’s not something I want
everyone to see.

601
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,880
But ever since I walked through
the fire the other day…

602
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,360
But people kept begging me
to show them something.

603
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,400
So I just gave them a little taste,
nothing much.

604
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,920
That should be enough.

605
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,840
But today,

606
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,480
someone’s going to perform with me.

607
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,680
Lord Kosol.

608
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,080
Me?

609
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,720
Yes, you.

610
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,480
But if people know me,

611
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,600
they’ll think we planned this.

612
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,760
You’re still the best choice.

613
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,080
You’re known to be straightforward.

614
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,160
The villagers will believe you
no matter what.

615
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,560
They know you wouldn’t trick them.

616
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,280
No. I won’t do it.

617
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,840
Then just tell me quickly,

618
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,120
what do I have to do?

619
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,240
Not telling.

620
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,280
First you have to promise me

621
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,560
that you’ll work with me

622
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,280
and do everything I say.

623
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,520
If it really brings us more troops,

624
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,040
then I’ll do whatever you say.

625
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,600
Fine.

626
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,000
I’ll do it.

627
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,560
What do you want me to do?

628
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,680
I… will summon a deity

629
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,560
to descend and inhabit Lord Kosol’s body.

630
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,680
And once

631
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,760
the deity has taken residence in Lord Kosol,

632
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,040
he’ll speak in the divine tongue.

633
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,960
I’ll translate for everyone to understand.

634
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,080
Divine tongue? I don’t speak that.

635
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,960
You won’t be the one speaking.

636
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,800
The deity will speak.

637
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,840
I just need to borrow your body.
Just stay still.

638
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,880
Everyone, are you ready?

639
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,840
- I’m not ready, Worradej.
- Ready.

640
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,800
Om… masikala, mutela, matelu…

641
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,960
Muteli…

642
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,560
Muteli…

643
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,480
Muteli…

644
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,040
The deity has descended.

645
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,000
O Divine One,

646
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,240
I have heard

647
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,240
that you have words to share with the villagers.

648
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,600
Please speak,

649
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,280
I will translate for them to hear.

650
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,240
The deity says that from heaven above,

651
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,760
He has looked down and seen,

652
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,200
the suffering and hardship
of all the villagers.

653
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,560
Living their lives in misery,

654
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,440
with no freedom of their own,

655
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,600
treated as property of lords and nobles.

656
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,440
So the deity has come down

657
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,240
to reveal the way

658
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,520
for you all to be free,

659
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,760
to live your lives in liberty.

660
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,400
Do you want to know what this way is?

661
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,240
- Yes!
- We want to know!

662
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,920
The deity says

663
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,240
we must rise and fight,

664
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,720
fight against the power

665
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,840
that oppresses us.

666
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,280
Don’t hope for anyone else
to fight for us.

667
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,560
We must fight for our children,

668
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,000
for our parents and kin,

669
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:10,200
for the families and generations to come.

670
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,360
Who here agrees

671
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,280
and will fight by my side?

672
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,760
Raise your voices now!

673
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,920
- Me! Me!
- Me!

674
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Me!

675
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,240
And those of you who agree with me,

676
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,840
please step this way and sign your names!

677
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,120
Come, come, right this way!

678
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,560
Oh, Kosol.

679
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,400
Where’ve you been? Out exercising?

680
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,840
No.

681
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,760
I went to deal with Chaiyached,

682
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,240
for daring to insult me.

683
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,080
And now, it’s your turn.

684
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,480
Wait, hold it, stop, stop, stop!

685
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,200
Why are you acting out like this?

686
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,400
I went through all that trouble
to get you soldiers,

687
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,280
and you’re still coming at me?

688
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,240
Because you made me do
weird things without asking first!

689
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,920
Do you know how humiliated I felt?

690
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,560
Talking nonsense like that
in front of everyone.

691
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,120
If I’d told you beforehand,
you wouldn’t have done it.

692
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,240
So forcing your hand
was the best method.

693
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,000
And anyway, my method

694
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,520
got you soldiers in the end, didn’t it?

695
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,280
Fine. Then consider your merit

696
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,000
enough to cancel your fault.

697
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,240
Oh, Māsakra…

698
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,960
What are you even saying?

699
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,720
Are you mocking me right now?

700
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,800
Merciful deity, please don’t do anything!

701
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,480
Oh divine one, ahhh!

702
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,400
Kosol.

703
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,880
What is it?

704
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,800
The villagers who enlisted yesterday,

705
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,080
there aren’t enough. Some are sick,

706
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,240
some have children.

707
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,000
After the screening, barely any remain.

708
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,720
We’ll need many more.

709
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,280
Otherwise, there’s no way
we can defeat His Majesty’s army.

710
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,440
You’ve got it wrong, we’re here to work,

711
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,480
not to play around.

712
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,520
Banjong.

713
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,320
- Where are you going?
- To sit with Worradej.

714
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,440
That poem, why did you write it for me?

715
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,200
Because I wanted to make amends.

716
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,200
What’s with all this chatter? I need sleep.

717
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,880
Even if we’ve secured allies
from other cities,

718
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,240
I still don’t think it’s enough.

719
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,840
Right now, we’re here.

720
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,600
And we’re heading to
the mountain-foot village, which is here.

721
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,920
- Everyone, get down!
- Ahh!

722
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,560
We must get out of this area fast.

723
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,520
Stay close together, follow me.

724
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,840
Muteli.

725
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,640
(The deity has descended)
The deity has descended.

726
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,920
(Maybe he just wants a good shot)
Perhaps the heavens above

727
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,680
(Maybe he just wants a good shot)
Maybe he wants it

728
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,280
with rain falling in this scene.

729
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,040
Don’t you understand plain speech?

730
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,560
You filthy queer.

731
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,880
(Feel the pain for the Count)

732
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,640
(Smack, right on target)

733
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,680
(Go easy on him, please)

734
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,600
That’s enough, sir.

735
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,200
He’s already got wounds in plenty of places.

736
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,280
Hsss...

737
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,440
Everyone, eyes over here.

738
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,040
(Burns straight to the heart)

739
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:19,120
(Adapted:I'm the Most Beautiful Count in Siam,
standing at Tha Phra chewing on a pen.)
