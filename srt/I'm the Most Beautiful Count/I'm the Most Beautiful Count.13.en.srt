1
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,280
Once our mission is complete,

2
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,560
there shall be no more

3
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,560
bloodshed and struggle for power.

4
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,680
The order where men once ruled supreme

5
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,039
will be replaced by equality.

6
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,920
Everyone will live freely,

7
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,759
serving no one but themselves.

8
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,720
Hey, that’s a guy in drag!

9
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,200
Take him and behead him!

10
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,320
Worradej, wake up!

11
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,720
Waradej… I can’t live without you.

12
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,560
If your wish truly comes to pass,

13
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,560
will we finally return home?

14
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,240
Banjong.

15
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,880
Take him away, lock him up.

16
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,160
Chet!

17
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,800
Will you release me now, huh?

18
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,000
Will you let me go yet?

19
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,000
Don’t,

20
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,960
Why stop me?

21
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,480
I must save my brother!

22
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,320
Think carefully, my lord.

23
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,680
To reach this day,

24
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,720
we have endured so much.

25
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,800
We have lost so very much.

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,560
Just a little more.

27
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,480
Your desire to change the realm

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,480
shall then be fulfilled.

29
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,720
Would you make everything fall?

30
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,960
All for the sake of your brother alone?

31
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,640
Look him in the face.

32
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,800
He is the only brother you have left.

33
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,760
Will you let him die?

34
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,200
When you could save his very life?

35
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,560
If so,

36
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,840
then you shall be known as,

37
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,840
the vilest brother in all the world.

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,280
Kosol!

39
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,120
Chaiyachet’s life,

40
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,320
matters greatly to you, does it not?

41
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,880
What say you?

42
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,200
Will you let your only brother die?

43
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,360
Who says

44
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,320
that this one is my beloved brother?

45
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,160
He is the trouble in my life instead.

46
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,120
If you kill him this very moment,

47
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,040
you would rid my life of a burden.

48
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,240
Do it.

49
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,880
Shoot him.

50
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,360
Kosol, please think it over.

51
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,880
Consider it carefully first.

52
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,400
- My lord...
- Brother speaks true.

53
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,600
The welfare of the people

54
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,760
matters more than my single life.

55
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,960
If you would slay me,

56
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,720
then strike the blow.

57
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,720
What shall we do, Your Highness?

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,880
You cannot leave Chet thus.

59
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,320
Kosol, you must help Chet, Kosol.

60
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,920
Do whatever you must.

61
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,200
For I have no weak brother,

62
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,640
nor one who easily yields.

63
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,520
Who waits always for another’s aid.

64
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,040
Elder Kosol,

65
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,840
help me.

66
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,440
Do not interfere.

67
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,160
We are merely playing hostage-takers.

68
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,520
We do no harm.

69
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,680
Do as you will, then.

70
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,040
I do not have a weak, cowardly brother

71
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,120
who always waits for others' aid.

72
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,600
Chet!

73
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,120
Chet!

74
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,720
Chet!

75
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,280
Chet.

76
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,200
Chet.

77
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,480
Chet.

78
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,600
Hmm, I’m jealous.

79
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,320
I’d love a microwave brother like him.

80
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,480
I’d fawn over him morning, noon,
and night.

81
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,360
I’d dote without stopping.

82
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,320
Chet will wake soon.

83
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,040
Kosol , Chet has awakened.

84
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,840
You’re awake, then?

85
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,760
I thought you were gone.

86
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,640
You two,

87
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,880
fetch rice and fish for my brother.

88
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,480
I must attend to business first.

89
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,880
What on earth is his problem?

90
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,240
Easy does it, Your Highness.

91
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,560
Chet, please,

92
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,000
don’t mind him, okay?

93
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,480
He’s always stubborn like this.

94
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,800
All show, full of airs.

95
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,880
He is my brother.

96
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,360
I know him well.

97
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,600
And...

98
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,800
who put medicine in my mouth?

99
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,280
Who else would it be?

100
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,840
The one who just stormed out with a huff.

101
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,440
He wiped you down and changed your clothes.

102
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,919
Tended your wounds,

103
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,600
and wouldn’t let anyone else help.

104
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,280
Said he’d do it himself,
afraid others might hurt you.

105
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,960
Truly, Your Highness, even just now,

106
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,840
I was about to fart,
and he told me to hold it in!

107
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,720
He feared it might wake you.
Right, Banjong?

108
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

109
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,560
And what of Jet, Your Majesty?

110
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,080
Jet... he...

111
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,240
My lord, flee now!

112
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,400
I will deal with him myself!

113
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,080
No. I’ll never abandon you.

114
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,480
We’ll fight together till the end.

115
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,400
Jet...

116
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,160
Farewell, Jet.

117
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,600
You’ll always be my friend.

118
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,800
Your Majesty.

119
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,200
Are you man or spirit, Your Majesty?

120
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,760
I feared if you knew it was all staged,

121
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,320
you wouldn’t feel sorrow.

122
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,800
- We had to deceive you, my lord.
- Your Majesty...

123
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,280
Please, never do such a thing again, sire.

124
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,880
You will always remain in my heart.

125
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,200
And if one day,

126
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,200
I am no longer king,

127
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,280
will we be closer then?

128
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,400
Now I’m just a common man, same as you.

129
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,840
You can stop being so stiff.

130
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,480
As you wish, my lord.

131
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,400
Thank you, my dear friend.

132
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,960
Brother Chet, isn’t Jet handsome?

133
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,760
I told you before, you’re my friend.

134
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,600
Friends should share everything equally.

135
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,920
Don’t worry, Jet.

136
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,520
I’ll take good care of myself.

137
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,080
Farewell, Jet.

138
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,960
Why don’t you rest?

139
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,200
Your body hasn’t fully recovered yet.

140
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,760
Why come up here again?

141
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,280
Well, back then,

142
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,640
you’re the one who brought
me up here, aren’t you?

143
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,200
You said it was the first test of courage.

144
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,920
But when I saw the beautiful sky above,

145
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,640
I stopped being afraid.

146
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,280
That was ages ago.

147
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,640
You still remember?

148
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,120
I remember everything,

149
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,760
every moment I spent with you.

150
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,040
Including the time
I was bullied by others,

151
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,680
and you didn’t help me.

152
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,760
You even said you had
no weak brother like me.

153
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,280
Thank you.

154
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,440
I didn’t help you at all.

155
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,120
Why thank me?

156
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,480
Who says you didn’t?

157
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,080
You gave me the strength to stand and fight.

158
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,480
To fight them off.

159
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,800
Nonsense.

160
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,520
That’s all in your head.

161
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,880
I know better.

162
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,160
That’s just your way of teaching me.

163
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,960
Stop pretending, brother.

164
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,680
I said it’s nonsense!

165
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,720
All right, nonsense it is.

166
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,480
I, King Chaiyached,

167
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,520
former ruler of Thanapura,

168
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,480
hereby renounce the royal throne.

169
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,800
From this day forth, no ruler

170
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,600
nor noble shall inherit power
by bloodline again.

171
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,880
Then who shall rule us?

172
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,240
Somdet Saenyakorn

173
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,280
and all his ministers have lost their power.

174
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,960
The slave system that once oppressed you all,

175
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,240
has been abolished entirely.

176
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,800
- Good! Good!
- Excellent!

177
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,160
From this moment,

178
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,200
you are free men and women.

179
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,560
You no longer have to serve anyone,

180
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,000
nor belong to anyone ever again.

181
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,240
And let me also announce,

182
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,520
those laws that invade

183
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,320
your freedom and privacy,

184
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,560
like forbidding who you can love or desire,

185
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,120
forcing you to be this or that,

186
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,840
are now gone.

187
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,840
Be whoever you want to be.

188
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,120
This new system of governance

189
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,360
shall be called a republic.

190
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,280
Everyone shall have a voice

191
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,720
in shaping the nation’s future,

192
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,240
including electing our head of state.

193
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,000
Do not be alarmed, everyone.

194
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,480
Everything will progress step by step.

195
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,160
You’ll come to understand in time.

196
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,720
Worradej.

197
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,040
Worradej! Worradej!

198
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,120
Worradej! Worradej!

199
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,040
Worradej!

200
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,680
What’s wrong, Worradej?

201
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,280
Worradej!

202
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,480
That same dream again?

203
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,760
Well, long time no see, darling.

204
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,080
Hey,

205
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,640
why are you here?

206
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,200
I’m in the middle of explaining the new
government system to the villagers.

207
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,040
Let’s talk about this later, okay?

208
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,960
Just wake me up first.

209
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,160
I didn’t make you fall asleep.

210
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,080
It’s simply time.

211
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,200
Time?

212
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,680
Time for what?

213
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,680
Thank you so much,

214
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,720
for making my wish finally come true.

215
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,880
No need for thanks, really.

216
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,480
Your wish,

217
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,880
was the same as mine.

218
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,080
The mission is complete.

219
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,280
It’s time for you to go home.

220
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,560
Oh!

221
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,880
That’s right!

222
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,440
Hey, we’ve got a concert to perform!

223
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,720
Wait, Worradej!

224
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,040
The past has already changed.

225
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,840
The future I came from,

226
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,920
what does it look like now?

227
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,960
Do you know? Tell me.

228
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,880
Since Somdet Saenyakorn was imprisoned,

229
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,920
and you all declared the change of regime,

230
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,800
the future has shifted.

231
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,920
This land will be ruled under a republic,

232
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,000
where the people live freely for generations.

233
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,840
Really? And then...

234
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,520
will I still be an idol?

235
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,880
What will my songs be about?

236
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,720
Will there still be haters who despise queers?

237
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,800
Ahh, I’m so excited, Worradej!

238
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,000
What’s it going to be like? Tell me!

239
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,720
Don’t ask too much.

240
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,160
You’ll see it yourself once you return.

241
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,240
Is that the path back to the future?

242
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,400
Yes.

243
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,120
Step into it.

244
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,560
Worradej, wake up!

245
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,480
Do you know what’s wrong with Worradej?

246
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,280
Did you notice anything strange this morning?

247
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,800
None at all.

248
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,680
He seemed perfectly fine.

249
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,040
Worradej!

250
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,599
Worradej, wake up!

251
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,200
You promised you’d never leave me alone!

252
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,599
Kosol, Worradej once told me,

253
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,000
if he ever fainted again,

254
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,319
you must kiss him, and he’ll wake.

255
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,680
Worradej!

256
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,960
Why isn’t it working?

257
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,480
Worradej!

258
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,720
You said you’d never leave me alone!

259
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,080
Hey, Worradej!

260
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,560
Why has he suddenly gone cold?

261
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,880
Hey, Worradej!

262
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,200
Worradej!

263
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,760
You’re right, his pulse is fading.

264
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,680
Don’t hesitate any longer.

265
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,880
It’s time for you to go.

266
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,800
Step forward.

267
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,360
Worradej...

268
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,120
Please wake up.

269
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,560
Worradej!

270
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,000
Worradej!

271
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,800
Worradej! I won’t let you die!

272
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,400
Please, come back to me!

273
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,880
Hey, Worradej!

274
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,400
Worradej!

275
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,760
I’ll always be by your side.

276
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,720
No matter where you are, or when.

277
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,360
How lucky I am,

278
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,760
that in this world,

279
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,440
someone truly loves me for who I am.

280
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,720
And I love him for who he is.

281
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,080
Kosol...

282
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,200
I love you.

283
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,000
I promise,

284
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,160
every time I survive and return,

285
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,320
I’ll always come back to you.

286
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,120
Kosol! Kosol!

287
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,920
Leave me alone, will you?

288
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,200
Can’t you see I’m grieving?

289
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,640
My lord, please, look at Worradej first.

290
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,400
No need.

291
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,240
Worradej’s face has long
been etched in my heart.

292
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,600
Kosol...

293
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,400
I said don’t call me!

294
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,000
I’m grieving!

295
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,520
Ugh, I’m not dead yet, okay?

296
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,600
Focus!

297
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,680
Worradej!

298
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,560
Am I seeing things?

299
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,760
You’re really not dead, are you?

300
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,960
Yes, nothing’s more real than this.

301
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,280
I’m truly happy, Worradej,

302
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,640
that you didn’t leave me behind.

303
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,920
I came back to you, didn’t I?

304
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,160
Don’t ever leave me again.

305
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,520
If Jade were here,

306
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,200
he’d be lounging in a hammock by now.

307
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,480
I tied it up for you, sir.

308
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,760
Are we missing him so much
we’re hearing things?

309
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,200
Your Majesty Chet!

310
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,440
It’s me, Jade, Your Majesty!

311
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,280
Jade...

312
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,760
Are you human or ghost?

313
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,000
Your Majesty Chet!

314
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,640
I’m flesh and blood, sir.

315
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,240
I’m human, not a ghost.

316
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,480
Here, look.

317
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,480
You can touch me.

318
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,080
See? You can touch me.

319
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,120
Jade

320
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,840
Jade, you’re alive!

321
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,040
You’re still alive!

322
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,400
You’re alive!

323
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,920
Yes, I’m here, sir.

324
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,000
You’re alive!

325
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,920
Chet! What’s all the noise about?

326
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,280
Hey, Jade!

327
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,320
Jade!

328
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,880
Wait, you’re not dead?

329
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,280
Didn’t you get stabbed
straight through the heart?

330
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,640
That’s right, sir.

331
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,760
I was stabbed in the left chest.

332
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,240
But... my heart’s on the right side.

333
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,920
Unlike most people.

334
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,720
Luckily, someone helped me in time.

335
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,280
So I didn’t die, sir.

336
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,120
Wait, there’s really such a thing?
A heart on the right side?

337
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,560
There is.

338
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,000
I once read a medical text,

339
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,720
it said one in ten thousand people

340
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,600
have their heart on the right.

341
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,680
Extremely rare, indeed.

342
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,160
Well, that’s good then.

343
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,360
You can help me campaign for votes.

344
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,760
Campaign for what, sir?

345
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,680
Did Your Lordship lose your voice?
Is that why you need to find it?

346
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,800
What campaign, sir? Are you unwell?

347
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,920
Not that kind of campaign!

348
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,200
I mean for the election!

349
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,720
The what now, sir?

350
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,800
By now, your son,

351
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,080
and that Kosol fellow must’ve...

352
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,920
seized power and made
themselves rulers of the realm.

353
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,320
You,

354
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,160
what kind of father are you?

355
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,600
How could you not see
your son’s lust for power?

356
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,280
His ambitions grew that far.

357
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,320
Back then, my son was a quiet man.

358
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,360
But later on...

359
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,880
he joined forces with those rebels.

360
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,800
Still, I never thought he’d be so ungrateful,

361
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,680
as to throw his own father into prison.

362
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,680
He hasn’t even come to visit once.

363
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,600
As if I’m not his father at all.

364
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,600
If only you,

365
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,360
had been stricter with him,

366
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,000
and put him in his place sooner,

367
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,080
we wouldn’t be rotting
in this cell together now!

368
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,280
What?

369
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,440
How dare you blame me alone!

370
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,760
All the power was in your hands.

371
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,120
You were the one who made all the plans.

372
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,000
You commanded the entire army!

373
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,120
How could you possibly have lost to him?

374
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,880
You’re the one who failed!

375
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,360
Hey, hey.

376
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,440
You dare insult me like this?

377
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,280
Of course I do.

378
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,280
We're both in prison,
no one's above anyone here.

379
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,080
- Damn it, hey!
- What?

380
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,920
- What?
- Stop, please!

381
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,280
Stop, please. Stop fighting already!

382
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,400
So you came, you ungrateful son.

383
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,840
I thought you'd let your father rot in prison.

384
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,880
Release me this instant!

385
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,360
Well...

386
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,480
Calm down, Father.

387
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,760
The reason I came today

388
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,480
is to discuss your release.

389
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,640
And not just yours, Father.

390
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,920
Uncle Saen’s as well.

391
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,360
You wouldn’t be so kind

392
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,440
as to free us both that easily.

393
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,360
If there are conditions, speak them now.

394
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,360
Do not drag this out.

395
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,440
Then listen carefully.

396
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,600
Right now, both of you

397
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,120
are merely prisoners.

398
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,120
You no longer hold any power.

399
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,480
Indeed.

400
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,360
You’ve seized it all anyway.

401
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,520
Not quite.

402
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,200
The power is not ours.

403
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,960
It has already been returned to the people.

404
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,120
The only way you can regain your power

405
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,440
is if the people grant it to you.

406
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,080
You mean to say...

407
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,840
a system where power belongs to the people?

408
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,080
Wow, Uncle Saen actually knows the term?

409
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,240
That’s right.

410
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,800
You’ll have to run for election,

411
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,280
propose policies, and campaign.

412
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,080
If people like you enough,

413
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,360
you may have the right and chance
to rule the country once again.

414
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,960
Interested?

415
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,920
If not...

416
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,000
you can rot and die in this prison then.

417
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,280
Step right up, everyone!
Come gather in the front!

418
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,600
(Stage rally)

419
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,040
All right, everyone!

420
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,560
This will be the very first time

421
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,680
we’ll get to choose who takes care

422
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,480
of our joys and sorrows by ourselves.

423
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,560
And now, please welcome the first party,

424
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,800
Candidate Number One!

425
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:14,120
The Freedom Rainbow Party!

426
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,520
Greetings, everyone.

427
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,200
Just as a rainbow has many colors,

428
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,440
so too does humanity come in many shades.

429
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,640
Our party’s policy focus

430
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,120
is on freedom and liberty,

431
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,840
the right to live freely.

432
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,480
Whatever career one wishes to pursue,

433
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,720
whatever one loves or excels at,

434
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,360
everyone shall be free to follow their heart.

435
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,120
And most importantly...

436
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,840
we shall have the right to love whom we love,

437
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,480
and the right to marry any gender,

438
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,480
equally and with pride.

439
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,680
All our lives,

440
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,080
we have been oppressed by nobles and lords,

441
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,400
forced to do what we never wished to do.

442
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,600
Those days of suffering will end.

443
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,200
All it takes, my friends,

444
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,920
is your vote for the Freedom Rainbow Party,

445
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:23,360
Candidate Number One!

446
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,520
(Number Two)

447
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,480
Only real men,

448
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,280
strong and righteous,

449
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,640
are fit to lead and govern this nation!

450
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,600
Every able-bodied man shall be drafted
to serve the nation.

451
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,440
Children must be taught the doctrines
we have firmly established.

452
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,000
All for the order and peace of our land.

453
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,320
God

454
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,680
created mankind in only two sexes.

455
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,680
Anyone who deviates from that

456
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,840
shall be punished accordingly,

457
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,560
to align with the ideals of our nation.

458
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,800
- Correct! Correct!
- Indeed!

459
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,800
When that happens,

460
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,320
our nation shall know only peace and harmony.

461
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,680
Strong and united forever.

462
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
All of you here,

463
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,120
must vote for Number Two!

464
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,360
The Real Men’s Power Party!

465
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,600
- Number Two! Number Two!
- Number Two!

466
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,800
- Number Two!
- Number Two!

467
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,880
Number Two!

468
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,440
- Number Two!
- Remember, vote only for Number Two!

469
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,240
- Number Two!
- Number Two!

470
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,080
Number Two!

471
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,200
You’ve now heard the policies
of both parties.

472
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,760
Whoever you love, whichever you support,

473
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,480
on the eleventh waning day
of the tenth month,

474
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,840
don’t forget to cast your vote!

475
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,320
at the polling stations, everyone!

476
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,560
(Stage rally)
Which number will you choose?

477
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,960
On the eleventh waning day
of the tenth month,

478
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,800
don’t forget to vote, everyone!

479
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,400
The eleventh waning day
of the tenth month,

480
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,320
vote for Number One!

481
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,520
- Number One!
- Number Two!

482
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,800
- Number One!
- Number Two!

483
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,120
Vote for Number One!

484
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,160
- Number Two!
- Number One!

485
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,280
Number One!

486
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,200
Number One!

487
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,840
- Number One!
- Number One!

488
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,680
I would like to thank everyone
for your votes.

489
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,480
For choosing me to serve
the people of this nation.

490
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,720
The word “I” sounds...

491
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,520
a bit too harsh, doesn’t it?

492
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,080
Maybe I should...

493
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,720
just start using the word “dichan.”

494
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,920
Dichan would like to thank everyone
for your votes.

495
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:05,160
For choosing dichan to serve
the people of this nation.

496
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,000
This works better.

497
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,480
What are you doing?

498
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,800
Today is election day.

499
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,680
Why haven’t you gone to vote yet?

500
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,160
I’m just... excited.

501
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,200
I mean...

502
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,600
if our party actually wins

503
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,800
and I end up getting a position,

504
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,520
I need to practice my speech first, right?

505
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,760
I don’t want to embarrass myself
by saying something wrong later.

506
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,080
Are you sure we’ll win?

507
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,920
Somdet’s been bribing villagers

508
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,560
to make them vote for him.

509
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,280
And those villagers are so naive,

510
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,000
once they get the money, they’ll vote.

511
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,760
But our intention

512
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,360
is for the people to truly choose
whom they want.

513
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,600
Otherwise, we’ll never reach our goal.

514
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,840
Even if this system still has flaws,

515
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,400
at least it prevents the villagers

516
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,640
from killing each other over power, right?

517
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,800
It may not be the best way,

518
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,120
but it’s not the worst either.

519
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,720
Still, you shouldn’t have let your father
and Somdet join the election.

520
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,120
If their allies win,

521
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,360
everything will just return to the old ways.

522
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,920
All that we’ve worked for will be wasted.

523
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,960
Oh, come on! But honestly,

524
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,120
people should have the freedom
to choose from more options.

525
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,800
There might be some people

526
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,640
who actually prefer Somdet’s ways.

527
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,720
And if they really win the election,

528
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,880
then we’ll have to accept it.

529
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,240
The villagers too must accept the outcome.

530
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,200
When that time comes,

531
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,720
we may have to keep fighting
for a long while, Kosol.

532
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,160
Well, I never knew

533
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,960
you had such a deep knowledge of politics.

534
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,680
Almost as if you...

535
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,320
had lived through countless
revolutions yourself.

536
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,560
Well...

537
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,960
I did study some history, you know.

538
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,840
Events in this world just keep spinning
in the same cycles.

539
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,040
We just need to...

540
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,240
learn from them and move forward.

541
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,480
Oh my,

542
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,000
Why do your thoughts

543
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,120
sound nothing like a man of this century?

544
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,640
You know,

545
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,120
ever since I met you,

546
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,280
I’ve wanted to become a better man each day,

547
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,440
to keep growing for the better.

548
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,720
For now, though,

549
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,280
don’t you dare carry me before I consent.

550
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,680
Then I’d say you’ve evolved
to the next level.

551
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,120
So... may I hold you now?

552
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,480
You’re crazy...

553
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,000
Hold me, what are you talking about?

554
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,800
Aren’t we supposed to go vote?

555
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,600
Forget voting for a moment.

556
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,800
Something of mine just stood up.

557
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,200
You pervert.

558
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,880
Do you like it, though?

559
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,440
I do.

560
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,880
Then let me carry you.

561
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,760
Mm.

562
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,320
Gently... carry me gently.

563
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,440
Hm?

564
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,080
I can’t hold you like this anymore.

565
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,960
Hey...

566
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,719
This position’s too hard to hold.

567
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,080
Then... try another one.

568
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,480
(Election booth)

569
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,920
(Government ballot)

570
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,360
I’ve checked around.

571
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,680
Most of the villagers voted for Worradej.

572
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,080
Ugh, how utterly disgusting.

573
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,160
And what about those peasants
we bribed?

574
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,520
It’s Banjong, of course.

575
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,960
He told the villagers they could
take the money but didn’t have to vote.

576
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,120
Because we’d cheat our way in
to get our money back anyway.

577
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,040
If this keeps up,

578
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,800
we’ll definitely lose the election.

579
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,280
Then what will you do, sir?

580
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,640
The election’s already
halfway through the day.

581
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,760
All of you, follow me!

582
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,920
Hey, stop, stop right there!

583
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,280
I...

584
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,920
as your former ruler,

585
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,920
believe the time has not yet come

586
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,400
for you to choose your own leaders.

587
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,080
Granting you that right today

588
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,200
is premature and reckless.

589
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,280
I and my comrades,

590
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,720
born of noble blood above you,

591
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,880
more learned and capable than you all,

592
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,160
shall make the sacrifice

593
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,280
to rule over you once more.

594
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,560
As of this day,

595
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,000
the election is hereby suspended!

596
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,320
Close the booths!

597
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,240
Close them, no one shall vote again!

598
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,240
- Close the booths!
- Hey!

599
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,480
- That’s enough!
- They’re closed! Move out!

600
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,360
Hey! Stop!

601
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,920
Stop! Get out of the way!

602
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,400
Hey,

603
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,960
I can’t take it anymore, my lord.

604
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,120
One round and I’m about to pass out.

605
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,800
If there’s... a second round,

606
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,280
I won’t make it!
What on earth did you eat?

607
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,200
If we’re late and the ballot boxes close,

608
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,640
we’ll be humiliated!

609
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,000
Master! Master, open the door, please!

610
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,960
Something terrible has happened!

611
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,200
Master, please!

612
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,880
What is it, Jade?

613
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,280
Somdet and the Count gathered men
to block the polling booths!

614
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,200
They won’t let the villagers vote, sir!

615
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,400
What?!

616
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,480
Where is it, Jade?

617
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,520
Everything seems fine now, doesn’t it?

618
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,560
Yes, sir.

619
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,800
But just a moment ago,
I swear a fight was about to break out!

620
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,720
Nisa.

621
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,960
Jade said there was chaos here.

622
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,160
Did Somdet and the Count really try
to block the villagers from voting?

623
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,520
Yes, but they failed.

624
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,520
Stop right there!

625
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,560
Stop right now!
I said stop this instant!

626
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,040
What do you think you’re doing?

627
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,920
You’d better think carefully.

628
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,120
Take a look around you!

629
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,720
How many of us are there?

630
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,960
How many hands?

631
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,920
How many feet?

632
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,920
You dare to stand against the people’s will?

633
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,400
How can the people ever be greater than me?!

634
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,720
Huh?! Charge!

635
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,320
Charge! Charge!

636
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,520
- Attack!
- Hey!

637
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,040
You’ll pay for this with your life!

638
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,200
Worradej, what’s wrong with you?

639
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,520
I’m just overwhelmed,

640
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,920
seeing the villagers

641
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,000
cherish and defend their rights like this.

642
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,840
I believe from now on,

643
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,760
Somdet and his men won’t dare
try anything like this again.

644
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,280
Of course not.

645
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,520
If they do,

646
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,320
they’ll be beaten to a pulp for sure.

647
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,680
Come on, let’s go cast our votes.

648
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,680
Have you two voted yet?

649
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,920
Yes, sir. We voted for
the Freedom Rainbow Party.

650
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,160
I voted early this morning.

651
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,600
But you two, where have you been?

652
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,480
Why are you showing up just now?

653
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,920
Well, we...

654
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,760
No need to explain everything.

655
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,040
Then, we’ll just...

656
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,200
go cast our votes right away.

657
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,960
Let’s go, then.

658
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,040
- Jade.
- Yes, sir?

659
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,480
Do you know where those two went?

660
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,200
No idea, sir.

661
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,120
But when I went to their room,

662
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,040
neither of them were wearing any clothes, sir.

663
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,560
Naked?

664
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,880
Oh my!

665
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,080
Good heavens.

666
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,440
And now, the election results
of the Saenya people

667
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,280
are officially in my hands.

668
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,080
Candidate Number One,

669
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,840
the Freedom Rainbow Party,

670
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,280
has received...

671
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,960
has received...

672
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,720
2,415 votes!

673
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,080
And Candidate Number Two,

674
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,680
the Real Men’s Power Party,

675
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,040
has received...

676
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,920
has received...

677
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,480
one vote.

678
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,280
What?!

679
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,000
None of you voted for me?!

680
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,200
Well, I sensed things were going south,
so I sided with Worradej.

681
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,600
You’re not mad, right? Right?

682
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,800
Worradej!

683
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,520
Oh, my boy, congratulations, son!
I’m so proud of you!

684
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,520
You’ve done wonderfully! So proud!

685
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,080
Thank you, Father.

686
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,440
- Hooray! Hooray!
- Hooray! Hooray!

687
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,200
- Hooray! Hooray!
- Hooray! Hooray!

688
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,800
- Hooray! Hooray!
- And so,

689
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,320
the party forming the government

690
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,600
is the Freedom Rainbow Party!

691
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,560
And our very first head of state is...

692
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,480
Worradej!

693
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,640
- Hooray! Hooray!
- Hooray! Hooray!

694
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,960
- Hooray! Hooray!
- Hooray! Hooray!

695
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,200
- Hooray! Hooray!
- Hooray! Hooray!

696
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,720
- Hooray! Hooray!
- Hooray! Hooray!

697
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,520
- Hooray! Hooray!
- Hooray! Hooray!

698
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,800
I would like to thank everyone

699
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,120
for choosing me.

700
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,600
to assume this honourable office.

701
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,080
I pledge,

702
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,960
to serve you all

703
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,320
with my whole heart.

704
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,640
This royal palace

705
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,080
will become the seat of government,

706
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,880
ready to welcome every one of you.

707
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,360
And I thank you once again

708
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,760
for all of you

709
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,760
who cherish your own freedoms,

710
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,800
who respect the freedoms of others,

711
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,160
and who have fulfilled
your civic duties

712
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,080
to the fullest.

713
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,400
And now, as we begin anew,

714
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,840
I hereby rename our country

715
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,040
from Saenya

716
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,240
to the Thoeyland.

717
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,120
For we are all Thoey people.

718
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,080
“Thoey” means...

719
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,160
freedom.

720
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,120
Ugh. What is this?

721
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,280
I will inaugurate

722
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,640
my spouse and I as the first married couple
of the Thoeyland,

723
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,280
to show everyone that

724
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,160
we all have the right to love.

725
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,800
Loving.

726
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,240
And I dedicate this song

727
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,080
to be the national song of our Thoeyland.

728
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,600
Music.

729
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,360
Cut. And then,

730
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,080
(Still puzzled)
What did I just get hit by?

731
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,240
A mosquito.

732
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,440
It crawls in the ear, bites the face,

733
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,120
then it nips the leg.

734
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,080
(The lock’s too tight.)
It hurts, feels like being chained.

735
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,080
Stripped of the viceroy title.

736
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,000
Sent to prison for ten years.

737
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Ten years later, I’ll get revenge.

738
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,880
