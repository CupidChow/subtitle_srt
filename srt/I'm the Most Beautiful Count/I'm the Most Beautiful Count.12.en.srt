1
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,440
Stop calling me King Chaiyached.

2
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,680
And stop using royal language with me.

3
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,360
The king once known as King Chaiyached
has left this world.

4
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,920
Only the commoner named Jade remains.

5
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,240
As expected.

6
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,200
Somdet Saenyakorn seeks
to crown himself king.

7
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,440
You intend to storm the Grand Palace?

8
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,720
If you need my help, just say so.

9
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,200
I must ask Lady Nisa

10
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,160
to deceive Somdet first
so he suspects another plan.

11
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,680
Then we’ll march like the Natasha troops.

12
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,759
Slip in quietly and take down
the mastermind alone.

13
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,640
Hey, Worradej.

14
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,320
Once we step into the Grand Palace,

15
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,520
we can’t keep bickering like this.

16
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,160
Walls have ears, doors have eyes.

17
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,480
Every step we take is dangerous.

18
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,400
Do you realize that?

19
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,360
Mm.

20
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,000
I know.

21
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,320
Hey, Kosol.

22
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,640
You’ve been away from the palace so long.

23
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,560
Aren’t you excited to go home?

24
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,120
A home filled only with hatred among kin.

25
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,040
It’s like living in a blaze.
I don’t wish to return.

26
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,480
Once our mission is complete,

27
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,320
there will be no more of it,

28
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,800
no more killing or fighting for power.

29
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,560
It’s drawing near, Worradej.

30
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,120
What is?

31
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,160
My wish,

32
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,760
the one you once asked me about.

33
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,480
It’s about to come true.

34
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,920
Really?

35
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,040
Then when that wish of yours comes true,

36
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,480
we’ll finally go home, won’t we?

37
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,280
I wonder how things are back there now.

38
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,960
This is quite an unusual case.

39
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,600
All of the patient’s body indexes
are perfectly normal,

40
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,480
yet we still can’t find the cause

41
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,960
of why the patient hasn’t woken up.

42
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,720
It’s as if they simply fell asleep.

43
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,440
Is there any way to wake him up?

44
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,680
Any method at all,
I'll pay whatever it takes.

45
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,760
Doctors from several departments

46
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,320
are currently discussing this case.

47
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,480
By the way,

48
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,000
have you reached
the patient’s parents yet, Nat?

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,760
Because if surgery becomes necessary,

50
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,280
The parents must sign
a consent form first.

51
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,200
Prince’s parents live abroad.

52
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,320
And more importantly,

53
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,000
they’ve already cut ties with him.

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,360
They couldn’t accept who he truly is.

55
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,480
Ah, I see. I understand.

56
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,600
In that case,

57
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,760
our team will look into
alternative treatments

58
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,160
that don’t require surgery.

59
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,280
Okay.

60
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,120
Alright then, I’ll take my leave now.

61
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,399
- Sure.
- Yes, doctor.

62
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,360
Prince.

63
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,200
Wake up, man.

64
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,440
Where the hell did you go party off to?

65
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,600
Ugh!

66
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,760
I’m really worried here.

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,680
Ta-da!

68
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,440
- Ta-da!
- Ta-da!

69
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,600
The outfits are here!

70
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,920
What kind of outfit is that?

71
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,680
The ones we’ll use to sneak
into the Grand Palace.

72
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,080
Have you gone mad?

73
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,120
That’s the cloth women use
as a shawl, isn’t it?

74
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,520
Exactly!

75
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,440
We’ll disguise ourselves as royal maids.

76
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,760
And sneak into the palace dressed as women.

77
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,120
- Dressed as women?
- Dressed as women?!

78
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,600
- No way.
- Nope.

79
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,480
No refusing.

80
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,640
To get into the Grand Palace,

81
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,200
and reach the royal inner court,

82
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,320
we have no choice but to go in as women.

83
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,680
Or would you rather

84
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,800
turn into flies and buzz your way inside?

85
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,480
That’s actually true.

86
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,600
If you refuse to dress up, then stay.

87
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,960
I’ll go alone.

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,680
I’ve always wanted to try once,

89
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,000
see what it’s like dressing as a woman.

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,520
You? Absolutely not.

91
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,760
Fine, whatever.

92
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,440
For the kingdom and the nation.

93
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,040
I’ll cross-dress this once in my life.

94
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,240
Fabulous!

95
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,680
You’re the cutest, my darling.

96
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,480
I bet when you’re in women’s clothes,

97
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,480
you’ll totally pull off
that fierce-lady vibe.

98
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,040
One hundred percent.

99
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,080
But once we wear these shawls...

100
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,960
Will people really believe
we’re women?

101
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,360
Our hair isn’t even long enough.

102
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,480
I’ve got just the thing, sir.

103
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,600
Here it is.

104
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,320
I bought it from a Japanese
wig craftsman.

105
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,280
He said it’s made
from real human hair.

106
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,600
Made from real hair, you say?

107
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,800
Yes, sir.

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,120
Magnificent.

109
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,120
Lift.

110
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,600
Swing.

111
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,120
Now walk.

112
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,080
Left.

113
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,600
Right.

114
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,040
Hips.

115
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,560
Hips.

116
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,159
Hips.

117
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,680
Hips.

118
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,960
Hips.

119
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,520
Hips!

120
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,280
I told you, use your hips!

121
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,520
Swing them with a little sass!

122
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,360
Move like true palace ladies,
graceful and elegant!

123
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,159
I am using them!

124
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:01,360
Come on, keep walking!

125
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,080
Left, right.

126
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,800
Left, hips.

127
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,280
Hips.

128
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,800
Hips ,  Banjong, fabulous!

129
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,920
Fabulous!

130
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,720
Flick your wrist, Banjong.
Flick your wrist!

131
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,320
Yes, make it graceful ,  hips!

132
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,440
Hips.

133
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,680
Use your hands.

134
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,880
Hands, come on.

135
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,280
Hips, hips.

136
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,160
Hips ,  swing your arms, Banjong.

137
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,480
Hips...

138
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,240
Hey, Banjong.

139
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,080
Come play sepak takraw with me.

140
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,960
I’ve been itching to move for ages.

141
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,080
Yeah, I wanna kick
till my legs give out.

142
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,000
Break them if I have to!

143
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,360
- Chit, you coming too?
- Yeah!

144
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,920
Alright, back to rehearsal.

145
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,840
Full turn ,  spin back, come on!

146
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,920
Then left, right.

147
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,440
Left, right.

148
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,240
Hips, hips.

149
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,680
Hips.

150
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,960
Hips.

151
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,400
Hips.

152
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,800
Hips.

153
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,240
Hips.

154
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,960
Hips ,  come on, hips!

155
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,840
That’s it. Now listen.

156
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,040
If some old pervert tries to flirt,

157
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,320
what are we supposed to do?

158
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,480
Grab his collar and punch him!

159
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,640
No, no!

160
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,159
You must glance shyly.

161
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,679
Then act all modest like this.

162
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,039
You can’t just punch him!

163
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,679
Now try it ,  quick!

164
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,720
A bit more flutter in those eyes.

165
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,080
How’s that?

166
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,640
Perfect!

167
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,840
Now try tucking your hair
behind your ear.

168
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,200
Go on, tuck it.

169
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,520
Oh my!

170
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,200
So sweet.

171
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,520
Sweet enough to give me diabetes!

172
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,800
Hey, Kosol.

173
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,920
Why aren’t you doing it?
Just sitting there watching.

174
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,320
Come on, your turn!

175
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,440
Don’t tell me you...

176
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,000
You’ve fallen for Banjong.

177
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,480
You must not fall for him.

178
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,840
I’ll pinch you. I will not agree.

179
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,880
- Don’t.
- I’ll pinch!

180
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,480
Ouch

181
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,640
You want me to like Banjong?
I’d rather love dogs and cats.

182
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,200
I only look at Banjong.

183
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,920
And it echoes in my heart.

184
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,080
That even gentle-faced Banjong

185
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,280
still looks so out of place.

186
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,440
If someone rough like me tried it,

187
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,840
would it not be even more bizarre?

188
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,480
I will not do it.

189
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,000
You cannot refuse. You must do it.

190
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,280
Because earlier,

191
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,840
you forced me to train with sword and gun
even though I did not want to.

192
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,480
Now the time has come.

193
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,600
for you to do what you do not wish to do.

194
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,600
And if you fail...

195
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,080
If you dress as a woman and fail
to be demure and get caught,

196
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,280
our mission will fail.

197
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,320
And who decides

198
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,000
that women must act this way, Worradej?

199
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,680
Women have varied manners.

200
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,320
No need to train everyone the same.

201
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,800
I do not despise gentle women.

202
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,640
But I do not want to.

203
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,400
Because it forces me.

204
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,960
If I had been born a woman,

205
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,480
I might not be so demure.

206
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,600
You should understand us well.

207
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,280
You were forced by your father too.

208
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,080
To act more manly,

209
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,360
even though that was not you.

210
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,760
Ah.

211
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,160
Then forget all that, alright?

212
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,800
Now choose what kind of woman
you want to be.

213
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,680
It’s up to you.

214
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,720
Really?

215
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,360
Don’t... don’t hug too long.

216
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,680
Stay here. Don’t be naughty.

217
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,600
Just keep to your room.

218
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,040
That shouldn’t be too hard for you, right?

219
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,160
I know.

220
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,040
You may order me about like a child.

221
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,480
Deal with Somdet quickly.
Do not keep me waiting.

222
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,760
And importantly, do not get hurt.

223
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,200
Then there’ll be no one left to argue with.

224
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,760
I’m bored.

225
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,320
Chatterbox.

226
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,760
I’m off.

227
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,040
Hey, Jade.

228
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,720
Take good care of little Chaiyached.

229
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,200
If I find anything pretty on the way
I’ll bring it back for you.

230
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,840
As long as you return safe,

231
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,840
I will be glad, truly.

232
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,120
Hey, stop crying now.

233
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,280
Come here, quick.

234
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,280
We’re not going to die, you know.

235
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,760
These girls don’t die that easily.

236
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,440
Worradej.

237
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,520
Let us go, or we’ll be late.

238
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,120
Good luck.

239
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,840
Take care of yourselves.

240
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,400
I await good news.

241
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,320
I’m off now.

242
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,640
Enough crying now.

243
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,680
I’m going.

244
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,360
Bye.

245
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,240
Once our mission is complete,

246
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,200
there will be no more of it.

247
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,360
The killing and the struggle for power.

248
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,160
It is about to come true.

249
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,080
And when your wish is fulfilled, what then?

250
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,480
We will finally go home, won’t we

251
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,640
You have traveled many days.

252
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,720
Was the journey smooth?

253
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,000
Very smooth.

254
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,400
Why are you in such a state?

255
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,080
Hold on tight, Worradej.

256
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,200
Hold on tight, Worradej.

257
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,480
Keep holding.

258
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,520
Hold here.

259
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,840
Hold the boat tight.

260
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,560
There’s a whirlpool ahead.

261
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,000
Worradej.

262
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,640
Storms were not enough ,  now a whirlpool too?

263
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,240
Hold on tight.

264
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,040
Hold on tight, Worradej.

265
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,440
Worradej, hold on tight.

266
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,960
Since the journey went well,

267
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,000
that means

268
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,560
our mission will succeed.

269
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,800
Are you ready?

270
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,280
If you are ready,

271
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,760
I will take you into the Grand Palace.

272
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,280
Has His Majesty called an urgent meeting?

273
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,920
Do you know what it is about?

274
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,720
I heard it concerns war
with the four corner lords.

275
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,960
They dare defy us?

276
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,600
Looks like this will be a great war.

277
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,120
Who are these people, Lady Nisa?

278
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,760
These people will serve as my guards.

279
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,520
Why do you question me?

280
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,520
Are these supposed to be women?

281
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,080
Why are they so tall and bulky
like ogres?

282
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,320
Hideous indeed.

283
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,640
And what of it? Who does it hurt?

284
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,280
They’re fine with themselves,

285
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,240
so others shouldn’t,

286
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,319
butt in.

287
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,079
or act offended for them.

288
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,480
Palace guards

289
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,000
must maintain order in the inner court.

290
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,440
That’s why I chose strong,
tall women like them.

291
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,160
Why must you question me?

292
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:25,000
Let them through at once.

293
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,920
We’ve entered the inner court.

294
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,960
You may all relax now.

295
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,120
Everyone here is on our side.

296
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,640
Splendid.

297
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,880
I was so tense, I swear,

298
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,400
walked so stiff I almost cramped up.

299
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,040
I overheard those
two ministers talking earlier.

300
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,000
By now, they must’ve heard the news.

301
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,800
That our provincial forces

302
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,000
are marching toward the In River delta.

303
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,280
Lady Nisa.

304
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,920
Please gather all the royal attendants.

305
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,800
We shall discuss the battle plan.

306
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,920
Understood.

307
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,960
Im.

308
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,040
- Go fetch everyone.
- Yes, my lady.

309
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,520
Worradej.

310
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,960
May I change out of this gown first?

311
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,240
I just don’t feel confident wearing it.

312
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,200
Me neither.

313
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,240
Why is that?

314
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,880
You two look lovely in them.

315
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,720
Quite graceful, I’d say.

316
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,080
If I were a man,
I’d be courting you already.

317
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,760
Hey, Worradej.

318
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,240
So who would you court, me or Banjong?

319
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,600
I’d court Banjong.

320
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,720
Hey, Worradej!

321
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,640
You dare cheat on me?

322
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,920
Didn’t you swear you’d love only me?

323
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,320
Oh, come on.

324
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,320
You’re jealous over nothing again.

325
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,200
I said, were I a man,
(which cannot be).

326
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,680
Which is impossible, of course.

327
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,680
Sigh. Very well then.

328
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,440
If you wish to change your gown,
then change it.

329
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,680
So then...

330
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,880
Follow me, please.

331
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,080
- Quite lovely, is it not
- It is lovely

332
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,360
Our scouts report that

333
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,000
all the provincial powers

334
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,600
have set themselves against

335
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,040
our Saenya Dynasty at this hour.

336
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,840
At present,

337
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,480
they have marshalled their forces

338
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,400
at the mouth of the In River.

339
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,920
Let every regiment of ours

340
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,760
mass fully to oppose them with all strength.

341
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,680
Allow not one assault upon our capital.

342
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,280
Now all our field armies

343
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,400
are departing from the royal court,

344
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,480
leaving but a scant garrison
within these walls.

345
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,520
We attendants now outnumber them here.

346
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,480
If we quell every hostile province,

347
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,800
we shall expand our realm,

348
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,840
swallowing each province into Saenya.

349
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,480
Thus shall we proclaim our might to them,

350
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,680
They are mistaken.

351
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,800
For daring to challenge us.

352
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,080
If we succeed in this mission

353
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,080
we shall not be oppressed again.

354
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,000
The order where men once ruled

355
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,840
will become equal for all.

356
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,880
Everyone shall live in freedom.

357
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,880
No one shall serve another.

358
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,400
At this hour.

359
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,960
Kosol has departed Singhanakhon.

360
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,560
Likely en route to join the provinces.

361
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,520
Give the orders.

362
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,400
Whoever beheads him

363
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,080
I will promote you to general at once.

364
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,400
- We accept with all due honor
- We accept with all due honor

365
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,360
And why we have gathered today

366
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,520
is because we have a brilliant plan

367
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,680
which needs each of you to assist.

368
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,360
So it may succeed.

369
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,280
Are you ready to join us?

370
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,800
I stand ready.

371
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,880
Are we ready?

372
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,760
Ready, my lady.

373
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,840
Splendid.

374
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,120
Then I will tell the plan to everyone.

375
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,480
Kosol.

376
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,360
I am afraid.

377
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,000
You have me right here beside you.

378
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,080
What is there left to fear?

379
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,000
I fear I may fail tomorrow.

380
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,040
That our plan may not succeed.

381
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,120
I fear something may happen to you.

382
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,920
And if that were to come true,

383
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,920
our nation...

384
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,400
it would surely fall into ruin.

385
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,480
I am so afraid, Kosol...

386
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,120
Remember my words.

387
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,560
Never utter the word “fear.”

388
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,360
Even when your heart trembles within.

389
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,840
Do not let anyone see the fear you hold.

390
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,880
Not even yourself.

391
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,840
This kiss shall be your strength.

392
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,280
From brave as you already are,

393
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,320
you will be a hundred,
a thousand times braver.

394
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,120
Ready for battle.

395
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,680
To face every enemy head-on.

396
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,560
This kiss will remind you.

397
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,600
That I will always be by your side.

398
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,240
Wherever or whenever you may be.

399
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,760
I wonder how Lord Kosol fares now.

400
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,080
Have you dealt with Somdet yet?

401
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,080
I want the turmoil in my life to end.

402
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,080
The root of my life's chaos began then.

403
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,360
It began the day Lord Kosol

404
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,360
was stripped of the viceroyalty.

405
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,560
For being caught consorting
with a young nobleman.

406
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,640
The crown then fell to me.

407
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,560
At that time...

408
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,800
I was too naive to know what it was.

409
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,640
I only knew that

410
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,600
I did not want it.

411
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,320
Somdet Kosol,

412
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,160
behaved contrary to his birth sex.

413
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,200
He engaged in relations with men.

414
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,280
This was a grave offense.

415
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,920
He must be stripped of rank,

416
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,800
reduced to commoner status,

417
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,960
and sentenced to ten years’ prison.

418
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,800
In the city of Singhanakhon.

419
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,880
And my first act upon accession

420
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,520
was to strip my brother of title,

421
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,680
and send him to prison in another town.

422
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,040
Brother...

423
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,120
I did not want to do it.

424
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,960
But Somdet forced my hand.

425
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,800
I was right.

426
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,480
To have come to Singhanakhon.

427
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,480
Because I found my brother again.

428
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,560
Though he pouts at me.

429
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,760
I know he still loves me.

430
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,360
And he still worries for me always.

431
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,400
Indeed, my lord.

432
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,480
In all my life I have never seen

433
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,600
a brother love his younger
as Kosol loves Chaiyached.

434
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,120
- Hey
- My lord

435
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,440
They hide here; I will not find them.

436
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,800
Put down your sword.

437
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,800
I want Chaiyached, and him only.

438
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,200
If you go with us willingly,

439
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,000
you will not need to fight.

440
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,080
Put it down.

441
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,680
My lord, flee at once.

442
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,880
I will deal with him myself.

443
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,520
No. I will never abandon you.

444
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,000
Stay and fight with me.

445
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,880
An Arabian dance.

446
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,360
I arranged this specially for Your Majesty.

447
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,600
Is she a beauty, my lady?

448
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,600
Hmm.

449
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,120
I will have her serve close to Your Majesty.

450
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,880
When you get close to Somdet,

451
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,560
find an opening to press
a dagger to his throat.

452
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:12,080
Then Banjong and I, hidden,
will come out and finish him.

453
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,200
Hey, she’s a kathoey!

454
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,760
Cut its head off.

455
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,560
Everyone.

456
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,160
Everyone, seize him now.

457
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,400
Mob him.

458
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,520
Somdet has fled.

459
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,520
Surround him, hold him fast.

460
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,680
Do not let him escape.

461
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,320
Stop.

462
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,440
You cannot rip my wig
and run off like that.

463
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,200
Three things I hate most:

464
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,480
being defeated.

465
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,520
Being deceived.

466
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,320
And kathoey.

467
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,080
All of which you embody.

468
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,920
Die, you damned pervert.

469
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,560
Prince.

470
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,960
You’re awake?

471
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,360
Wait ,  am I dreaming?

472
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,600
You’re awake.

473
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,200
Oh, I’m so glad.

474
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,560
Nisa.

475
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,760
What happened here?

476
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,200
Who is that, Nisa?

477
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,200
It’s Nat, your friend!

478
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,120
You don’t remember me?

479
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,880
- Nat?
- Yeah.

480
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,920
Wait...

481
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,240
Did I come back
to the present day?

482
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,520
Present day? What do you mean?

483
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,280
What? Huh?

484
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,440
You’ve been lying here like a veggie, girl.

485
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,160
How are you feeling now?

486
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,800
Like I got hit in the head.

487
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,440
But whatever.

488
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,680
Hey, tell me what happened.
I’m so confused.

489
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,800
Well, that day,

490
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,040
when you told me to get a guy
to entertain you,

491
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,880
there was this kid.

492
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,440
Total homophobe.

493
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,200
He poisoned your drink.

494
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,880
And you’ve been out cold
ever since that day.

495
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,880
Out cold?

496
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,200
How long was I out?

497
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,400
Seven days.

498
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,560
Only seven days?

499
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,640
Why...

500
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:43,280
Where I went, it felt like
seven whole months.

501
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,400
Seven months? What are you on about?

502
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,480
You didn’t go anywhere.
You were lying here,

503
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,000
like a total vegetable.

504
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,400
Wait… oh, did you dream?

505
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,960
Was it a dream?

506
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,280
No, Nat.

507
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,040
It felt so real.

508
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,680
It was like I actually went,

509
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,800
I was living as Count Worradej.

510
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,760
And I had a husband named Lord Kosol.

511
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,400
Oh, stop it already.

512
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,320
You’re totally delirious now.

513
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,920
- Nat, I,
- Just lie down and rest.

514
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,400
I’ll go get the doctor.

515
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,760
Still, I’m just glad you woke up.
I’ll call the nurse.

516
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Yes.

517
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,320
Prince is awake now.

518
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,560
Uh, could you call the doctor, please?

519
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,200
Okay, sure.

520
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,560
The doctor will be here
to check on you soon.

521
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,440
How are you feeling?

522
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,720
I’m just really happy
you woke up, honestly.

523
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,760
How do you feel? Thirsty?
I’ll get you some water.

524
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,080
Okay?

525
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,360
You’re awake.
I’m so glad.

526
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,400
This kiss will remind you.

527
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,400
That I will always be by your side.

528
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,240
Wherever or whenever you may be.

529
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,640
Kosol.

530
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,440
Nat, Nat.

531
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,920
- Nat
- What

532
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,760
I am not dreaming.

533
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,120
I am not dreaming, Nat.

534
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,520
What I said is true.

535
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,720
I’m not dreaming.
I must go back.

536
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,960
I must go back now.
I have to return to the past.

537
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,560
Take me back, Nat.

538
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,320
Take me back, Nat.
I’m not dreaming ,  please believe me.

539
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,760
- I’m not dreaming, Nat
- What are you on about

540
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,320
- Nat
- Hey?

541
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,960
- Nat
- Doctor!

542
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,080
Please check on him.

543
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,800
Something’s wrong with my friend.

544
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,000
Doctor, I’m telling the truth.

545
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,160
Doctor, please take me back to the past.

546
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,120
I have to hurry back to help my friend.

547
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,760
I must go help Banjong.
I must find Kosol.

548
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,160
I must go defeat Somdet Saenyakorn.
Doctor, please.

549
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,920
Doctor, please take me back.

550
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,280
- Prince
- Doctor

551
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,760
I’m serious, Doctor. Please believe me.

552
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,120
- You have to send me back, Doctor.
- Alright, calm down.

553
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,560
- Nat, I mean it!
- Prince.

554
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,120
- Prince.
- I’m telling the truth!

555
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,320
Listen to me first. It’s me, your doctor.

556
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,520
Try to focus.

557
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,240
Take a deep breath in.

558
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,800
And exhale slowly.

559
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,280
Follow my voice.

560
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,920
Breathe in.

561
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,920
Good, breathe in.

562
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,639
Exhale. That’s it.

563
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,480
Keep going. You’re doing great.

564
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,880
- Prince.
- You’re alright.

565
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,880
Prince! Prince!

566
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,080
Prince!

567
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,400
Wake up!

568
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,920
- Prince.
- Don’t fall asleep, Prince!

569
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,320
Prince, wake up!

570
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,159
Stay with us. Keep your eyes open!

571
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,040
Worradej...

572
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:33,159
Worradej, can you hear me?

573
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,360
Worradej...

574
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,719
Worradej.

575
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,320
Can you hear me, Worradej?

576
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,960
Worradej, do you hear me?

577
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,400
Worradej...

578
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,600
Wake up, Worradej.

579
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,000
You must wake up, Worradej!

580
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,080
Prince, open your eyes!

581
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,840
Open your eyes, Prince!

582
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,199
Prince, please, open your eyes!

583
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,639
Worradej...

584
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,920
Worradej!

585
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,200
Come back to me, Worradej.

586
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,160
My life cannot go on without you, Worradej.

587
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,320
Worradej...

588
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,080
You’ve come back to me!

589
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,920
Don’t ever leave me again.

590
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,880
I’ve returned.

591
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,280
You’re back.

592
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,480
Banjong...

593
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,920
Take care of Worradej for me.

594
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,480
I’ll go after Somdet.

595
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,840
Kosol...

596
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,600
Be careful out there.

597
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,360
Can you stand?

598
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,960
Easy now.

599
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,080
Doctor, what’s wrong with my friend?

600
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,640
At this point, I can’t say for sure.

601
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,560
But when a patient describes
events that never happened,

602
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,080
it’s best we consult a psychiatrist.

603
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,560
As for the poison Prince was exposed to,

604
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,240
I don’t think it could have caused

605
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,640
these kinds of psychological symptoms.

606
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,080
So, are you saying,

607
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,840
my friend was telling the truth?

608
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,280
Here’s the thing.

609
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,640
It could’ve been a dream,

610
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,520
so vivid that it felt real,

611
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,600
to the point he can’t tell

612
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,120
what’s real and what’s not.

613
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,520
Then...

614
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,480
will he ever be the same again?

615
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,240
He’s got so much work waiting,

616
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,120
concerts, fan meets, and everything.

617
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,680
Is there any chance he’ll recover?

618
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,280
I can’t give you a clear answer yet.

619
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,160
We’ll have to wait until he wakes up again.

620
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,840
Wake up, Prince. Come on!

621
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,360
- Open your eyes, Prince!
- Miss Nat, please!

622
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,280
- Miss Nat, that’s enough.
- Wake up, Prince!

623
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,080
You’ll only hurt him more.

624
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,280
Doctor...

625
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,880
Is there any chance he will wake up?

626
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,560
Stop it now, you worm.

627
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,640
Who are you calling a worm?

628
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,600
Act like you are in charge.

629
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,280
Have you forgotten your own name?

630
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,320
You insolent wretch.

631
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,760
You are getting far too arrogant.

632
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,520
How dare you call me by my old name.

633
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,400
Aren't you afraid your head will fall off?

634
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,080
That blunt stick in your hand.

635
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,200
Cannot sever anyone's head.

636
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,280
Right now.

637
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,320
You have no soldiers.
Or nobles protecting you now.

638
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,480
You are just a power-mad old man.

639
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,480
I will smash that mouth of yours.

640
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,560
Hey, hey.

641
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,000
Hey, what is this?

642
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,280
Hey.

643
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,320
You have oppressed us for long enough.

644
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,720
Today we take our revenge.

645
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,880
How dare you?

646
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,320
- Ow.
- Is that enough to satisfy you, ma'am?

647
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,960
Here you are.

648
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,440
- Well done, Im.
- What are you going to do, huh?

649
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,240
People like you deserve this.

650
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,400
Ow, ow.
Wait, wait.

651
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,400
Hold on.
Hold on.

652
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,760
Up until now...

653
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,480
I have done many wrongs to you.

654
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,160
Please forgive me.

655
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,800
I beg your pardon.

656
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,720
What if we do this.
What if we do this.

657
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,120
If you join me,

658
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,400
become my allies,

659
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,480
I will grant you rewards,
promotions, titles.

660
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,280
Will you accept that, hmm?

661
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,480
It is too late now, ma'am.

662
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,320
- Ow, ow.
- Mob.

663
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,320
- Do not stop.
- Ow.

664
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,160
- Keep hitting.
- Good.

665
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,800
Well done, everyone.

666
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,800
Ow, ow.

667
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,320
- Good. Beat him to death.
- Ow.

668
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,720
Ow.

669
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,800
Funny, isn't it.

670
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,520
When you were stabbed,

671
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,600
I was the one who dressed your wound.

672
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,680
Now that I am struck on the head,

673
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,680
you come to dress my wound.

674
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,080
So we call it even.

675
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,480
But next time,

676
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,720
let no one have to heal another again.

677
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,720
Agreed.

678
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,360
And then...

679
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,360
you were struck pretty hard.

680
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,640
How do you feel now?

681
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,680
Still a little dizzy, I guess.

682
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,760
But what scared me more

683
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,080
was when I passed out.

684
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,520
I dreamed.

685
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,200
A dream?

686
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,120
What did you dream of?

687
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,240
Was it that terrifying?

688
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,280
Well...

689
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,160
I dreamed that

690
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,000
I was in a place far, far away.

691
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,480
And I would never see you all again.

692
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,480
In that dream, I was terrified.

693
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,400
I didn’t know what to do.

694
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,040
Then suddenly, I woke up.

695
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,880
Because Kosol kissed you.

696
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,360
That’s why you woke up.

697
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,280
Then...

698
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,280
if I faint again,

699
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,920
make sure Kosol kisses me again.

700
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,160
Mmm.

701
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,200
Let us hurry to the royal hall.

702
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,840
I wonder if Kosol
has captured Somdet yet.

703
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,960
Come on.

704
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,200
Kosol.

705
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,200
You did not capture Somdet?

706
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,960
I was not the one who caught him.

707
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,520
Others helped to seize him.

708
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,600
Oh!

709
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,360
Hmm, what a state.

710
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,240
Has the poison worn off?

711
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,520
Then I...

712
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,000
will be the first to settle the score.

713
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,200
Was it the one
who struck you with a stick?

714
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,520
No.

715
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,080
It was the one who ripped off
my wig from my head.

716
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,360
Mark my words.

717
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,520
Next time,

718
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,360
never pull a transvestite’s wig off again.

719
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,680
If you intend to kill me,

720
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,200
then do it quickly.

721
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:33,000
Do not let this perverted person
demean me like this.

722
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,800
I will not stand for it.

723
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,160
Take his beard right off.

724
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,120
We have already discussed this.

725
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,680
We will spill as little blood as possible.

726
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,120
Worradej begged me to spare his life.

727
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,680
Imprison him instead.

728
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,640
So perhaps one day he may repent.

729
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,520
Then he may return to serve the state again.

730
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,400
For he does possess certain talents.

731
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,000
Me, approve of you lot?

732
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,360
Grant freedom to serfs and slaves?

733
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,520
That would only breed chaos.

734
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,920
Give rights and voice to the gullible,

735
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,200
and the realm will descend into ruin.

736
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,520
Worse still,

737
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,120
to let those perverts

738
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,760
parade about like they own the place.

739
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,520
I would rather die.

740
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,960
What a monstrous old man.

741
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,640
Such a foul mouth.

742
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,320
All his logic is rotten.

743
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,440
Good that he’s jailed.

744
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,280
So we need not suffer for it.

745
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,840
His warped mindset will no longer harm us.

746
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,440
This is for the best.

747
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,520
Others will be spared the trouble.

748
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,040
For such corrupted thinking

749
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,240
is not admirable.

750
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,400
Banjong.

751
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,040
Take him and lock him up.

752
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,280
Ched.

753
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,480
Strain it carefully.

754
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,800
Just a little more.

755
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,320
Your desire to change the realm

756
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,400
will come to pass.

757
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,200
You cannot leave Ched like this.

758
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,080
Kosol, you must help Ched, Kosol.

759
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,880
You must stand for election.

760
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,480
Present your policies and campaign.

761
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,920
Interested?

762
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,360
Are you certain we can win?

763
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,320
Somdet bribed the villagers

764
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,800
to vote for him.

765
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,400
Somdet and the Count led men
to block the polling booths.

766
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,240
Villagers couldn’t vote, sir.

767
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,560
What?

768
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,880
A storm wasn’t enough,
(now there’s a whirlpool too?)

769
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,920
A whirlpool, really?

770
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,920
Help me!

771
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,160
(Soaked from every direction now!)

772
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,040
(This one’s right on the head!)

773
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,600
You think you’re that pretty?

774
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,720
Never thought I was pretty at all.

775
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,360
That’s the right way to think.

776
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,880
It’s obvious.
(It’s obvious who’s the prettiest!)

777
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,600
Hey, that’s a trans woman!

778
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,880
Pure Love, Brave Heart.
(The Trans Woman Who Never Yields.)
