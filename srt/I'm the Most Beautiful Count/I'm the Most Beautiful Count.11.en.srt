1
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,720
Even if you dislike what I did to Banjong,

2
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,800
I want you to know
I did it because I love you.

3
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,960
Love is love.

4
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,960
But you have no right to use love

5
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,320
as an excuse to hurt others.

6
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,640
You and Kosol...

7
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,600
You’re together, aren’t you?

8
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,479
I’ve seen everything clearly now.

9
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,680
From this moment on,

10
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,000
I won’t stand in the way

11
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,479
between you and Worradej anymore.

12
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,920
So fussy, seriously.

13
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,480
Too many things to deal with.

14
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,480
It’s so hot.
My armpits are drenched already.

15
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,720
It’s rare for you to attend an event.

16
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,680
Please endure a bit, Your Majesty.

17
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,000
That jug is for the
ceremonial water, Your Majesty.

18
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,079
Take it away.

19
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:29,320
I already have one, can’t you see?

20
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,280
Your Majesty is the King.

21
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,440
You must use a golden jug
befitting your grace.

22
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,560
How could you use clay like a commoner?

23
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,240
Please get dressed, Your Majesty.

24
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,000
The ceremony is about to begin.

25
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,960
Jade.

26
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,320
How are we two any different?

27
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,520
Why must we use different things?

28
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,600
The clothes we wear,

29
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,200
the language we speak.

30
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,320
As Chid has said, Your Majesty.

31
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,760
You are the ruler,

32
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,000
while I am but a servant.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,520
That is only make-believe.

34
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,000
What is true is that you
were born from your mother’s womb.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,079
And so was I.

36
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:33,720
One day you will grow old, and so will I.

37
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,720
When you fall ill,

38
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,280
so do I.

39
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,040
In the end neither of us can escape death.

40
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,000
Then what makes me so superior to you?

41
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,280
Your Majesty.

42
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,600
Please do not lower yourself
to compare with commoners.

43
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,920
It pains me to hear it, Your Majesty.

44
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,680
Whenever I wish to do
what ordinary people do,

45
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,840
I am told it is improper.

46
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,880
Because I am said to be
a deity born into this world,

47
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,200
with merit and power above all others.

48
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,040
You have been with me a long time.

49
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,440
You know it has never been that way at all.

50
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,440
I’m just a filthy human like anyone else.

51
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,120
Why do you speak
so strangely today, Your Majesty?

52
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,480
Are you feeling unwell?

53
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,959
I was merely wondering
what my true essence is.

54
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,360
Jade.

55
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,280
No matter how different you and I may be.

56
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,880
The one thing that will come to us equally.

57
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,600
Is death itself.

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,800
Everyone, gather around!

59
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,160
The ceremony is about to begin.
Please come together.

60
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,400
Why is the jug that Banjong
and Pandao made so beautiful?

61
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,200
Look at the one Kosol made.

62
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,680
It’s all crooked like a termite mound.

63
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,520
I didn’t make it myself.

64
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,159
I bought it.

65
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,000
I knew it.

66
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,960
It’s really pretty.

67
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,640
His Majesty King Chaiyached has arrived.

68
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,360
It brings me great joy
that on this full moon of the twelfth month,

69
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,040
I am here in Singhanakhon.

70
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,000
A city where everyone loves their homeland.

71
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,080
And cherishes their own freedom.

72
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,520
Willing to fight to the death to protect it.

73
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,840
I am deeply honored
to have fought alongside you all.

74
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,880
I hereby declare that
on this day every year...

75
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,720
Shall be known as the Festival of Rinkasin.

76
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,880
To honor the fallen heroes.

77
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,920
And to seek forgiveness
from the Goddess of Water,

78
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,040
whom we have relied on all year.

79
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,680
I ask everyone.

80
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,960
To focus your mind
and think only of good things.

81
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,200
And pour the water into the pond now.

82
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,600
May Kosol stay this sweet forever.

83
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,680
Amen.

84
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,520
May Worradej be less of a flirt.

85
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,840
Are you praying or cursing?

86
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,240
Praying.

87
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,200
Because if he flirts too much.

88
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,040
I’ll get tired of chasing after him.

89
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,480
Amen.

90
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,200
May I forget Worradej soon.

91
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,320
Amen.

92
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,040
May I find new love
and finally forget Count Kosol.

93
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,000
Amen.

94
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,880
That’s clear enough.

95
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,560
There he is.

96
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,760
Your Majesty.

97
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,240
King Chaiyached has been shot.

98
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,480
Chaiyached!

99
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,400
Your Majesty! Please stay strong!

100
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,280
Your Majesty! Count Kosol!

101
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,960
- Your Majesty.
- Chaiyached!

102
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,919
- Your Majesty.
- Stay strong, please!

103
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,720
- Your Majesty.
- Take him back to the palace!

104
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,960
- Yes, sir.
- At once!

105
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,240
Your Majesty!

106
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,799
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

107
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,520
- Get inside! It’s dangerous! Hurry!
- Please hang in there, Your Majesty!

108
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,120
Please hold on, Your Majesty!

109
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,320
Get inside! It’s dangerous! Go!

110
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,000
Quickly! Hurry!

111
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,600
Find the shooter!

112
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,800
All of you, come with me!

113
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,280
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

114
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,600
Your Majesty!

115
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,520
Your Majesty!

116
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,240
Please don’t leave us, Your Majesty!

117
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,000
Stay with us!
Please hold on, Your Majesty!

118
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,040
Chit, go get the royal physician now!

119
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,320
Yes, sir!

120
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,720
Please wake up,
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

121
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,600
Your Majesty!

122
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,400
Your Majesty!

123
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,280
No one is allowed to enter this room!

124
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,520
Yes, sir.

125
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,120
Your Majesty.

126
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,600
Your Majesty.

127
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,080
Your Majesty...

128
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,320
Your Majesty.

129
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,240
Your Majesty.

130
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,880
Your Majesty.

131
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,360
Your Majesty.

132
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,040
Will His Majesty be all right?

133
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,960
Will the royal physician be able to save him?

134
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,640
Your Majesty.

135
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,960
Please answer me, Your Majesty.

136
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,080
He might not make it.

137
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,440
Why?

138
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,520
Why, sir?

139
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,320
Please hold on, Your Majesty.

140
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,840
- Your Majesty.
- Jade.

141
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,640
Go wait outside.

142
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,080
And when the physician arrives,
tell him to leave.

143
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,240
His Majesty...

144
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,520
Has passed away.

145
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,560
Your Majesty!

146
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,880
Your Majesty!

147
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,800
Please wake up, Your Majesty!

148
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,680
Jade is waiting for you, Your Majesty!

149
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,360
Please wake up and
stay with me, Your Majesty!

150
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,240
Your Majesty!

151
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,800
Your Majesty.

152
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,280
Your Majesty...
who will Jade stay with now?

153
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,800
Your Majesty...

154
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,600
Your Majesty...

155
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,280
Jade, come serve as my royal page.

156
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,720
I’ve told you before, you are my friend.

157
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,760
And friends should do things together.

158
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,600
Jade, help me with this.

159
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,200
Before we go to the market,

160
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,320
let’s do something fun first.

161
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,040
Tell your servant.

162
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,880
To clean my shoes right now.

163
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,080
Allow me to do it myself, Your Majesty.

164
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,160
No need.

165
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,840
- Jade.
- Today, at the market,

166
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,680
I had the most fun ever.

167
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,600
Let’s play like that again sometime.

168
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,880
Please wake up, Your Majesty!

169
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,160
Jade is waiting for you!

170
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,640
Your Majesty...

171
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,960
"Ched" and "Jade" sound quite alike.

172
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,680
That means we’re a perfect duo.

173
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,160
Let’s make a promise.

174
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,200
If we both grow old
and still can’t find wives,

175
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,200
we’ll stay single and be friends forever.

176
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,280
Please wake up, Your Majesty.

177
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,280
Your Majesty...

178
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,800
Now,

179
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,600
His Majesty King Chaiyached,
ruler of Thanapura,

180
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,520
has passed away.

181
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,160
Passed away.

182
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,800
His Majesty has passed away.

183
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,960
On Thursday night,

184
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,200
the fifteenth day of
the twelfth lunar month, Year of the Rat,

185
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,440
in the Buddhist Era year 1200.

186
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,200
Let this be known to all citizens.

187
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,240
Now the throne of Thanapura stands vacant.

188
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,720
For King Chaiyached left
no appointed heir to the throne.

189
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,920
It was His Majesty’s will

190
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,280
to return power to the people,

191
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,200
allowing them to choose their own leader.

192
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,280
But Lord Saenyakorn,

193
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,720
who conspired to assassinate King Chaiyached,

194
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,200
will soon

195
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,080
declare himself the first ruler
of a new dynasty.

196
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,040
That, we shall never allow.

197
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,760
I will not stand for it either.

198
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,640
If it was King Chaiyached’s
will to return power to the people,

199
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,320
then we must honor that.

200
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,920
Anyone who dares defy

201
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,400
His Majesty’s final decree,

202
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,640
I, the governor of Nakhon Suang,

203
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,600
will lead my army to crush him.

204
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,960
King Chaiyached
was only eighteen years of age.

205
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,640
He had never quarreled with anyone.

206
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,600
Yet Lord Saenyakorn

207
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,080
betrayed him and took his life to seize power.

208
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,160
Such cruelty cannot be forgiven.

209
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,680
I am willing to send
my troops to join the battle.

210
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,600
Lord Saenyakorn’s act

211
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,720
is treason against the kingdom.

212
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,720
If such a man were to take power,

213
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,760
the land would be engulfed in flames.

214
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,880
I will commit my battalion

215
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,720
to help defeat those
who betray Thanapura.

216
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,120
I thank all four governors deeply.

217
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,480
Your support

218
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,480
will restore peace to
the Thanapura Kingdom once more.

219
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,520
If war should arise again in the future,

220
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,400
I shall inform you at once.

221
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,000
Are you certain everything
you’ve said is true?

222
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,400
Certain, my lord.

223
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,520
Our informant was
present at the royal funeral.

224
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,280
How did he die?

225
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,160
It wasn’t our doing, my lord.

226
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,400
Everyone was waiting
for Count’s command.

227
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,600
Never mind.

228
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,360
Good riddance that he’s dead.

229
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,280
Now,

230
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,800
King Chaiyached has passed away.

231
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,200
The throne cannot remain without a ruler.

232
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,320
As the royal regent,

233
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,400
I must proclaim myself

234
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,000
King Saenyakornklao,

235
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,280
the first sovereign of a new dynasty,

236
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,720
the Saenya Dynasty.

237
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,480
Long live the King!

238
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,240
- Long live the King!
- Long live the King!

239
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,160
- Long live the King!
- Long live the King!

240
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,920
- Long live the King!
- Long live the King!

241
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,280
Here, news from Thanapura.

242
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,720
Just as expected.

243
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,160
Saenyakorn wants to crown himself king.

244
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,080
But who knew he’d be so shameless,

245
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,560
naming the entire kingdom after himself?

246
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,880
The nation of Saenya has truly been born.

247
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,160
Can we even change history now?

248
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,880
We’re here.

249
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:26,200
You called me like I was about to flee
the country of Saenya or something.

250
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,680
Oh my, Nat!

251
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,600
Don’t die on me! What happened to you?

252
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,240
Not dead. I was laughing at that webtoon, girl.

253
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,080
It’s so fun.

254
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,040
Webtoon.

255
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,080
This one.

256
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,080
It’s about me, the most handsome
Khun Luang in Saenya.

257
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,160
So good.

258
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,320
Hey, you.

259
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,680
You’re obsessed with dramas
and now webtoons too?

260
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,160
See, the lead is a superstar.

261
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,520
Then he time-travels back
about a hundred years.

262
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,400
To when Saenya was just founded.

263
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,960
Then she runs into political trouble.

264
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,320
After that she jumps in
and helps solve things in a fresh way.

265
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,360
It’s so good, honestly.

266
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,720
So... can she really change history, though?

267
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,760
Do you know this?

268
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,440
The Grandfather Paradox.

269
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,800
Huh? Who? What?

270
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,720
No, it’s like...

271
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,120
- Suppose, say you,
- Yeah.

272
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,640
Travel back in time.

273
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,400
And you meet your grandfather and kill him.

274
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,800
If you kill your grandfather,
your father won’t exist.

275
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,680
If there’s no father, you won’t exist.

276
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,840
And if you don’t exist,
no one goes back to kill your grandfather.

277
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,640
Then your grandfather will not die.
If he lives, your father will exist.

278
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,200
Your father will have you,
and someone will still time-travel.

279
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,400
- Go back and kill your grandfather.
- Ow!

280
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,920
Stop, the more you explain,
the more confusing it gets.

281
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,920
Hey, I am asking you.

282
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,080
If you could go back in time,

283
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,560
what would you want to change?

284
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,960
I would change nothing at all.

285
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,600
Because it is impossible.

286
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,160
No one can change the past.

287
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,280
It can be changed!

288
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,400
In that story the hero changes it, you know.

289
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,880
I’ll ask you again.

290
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,560
If you could return to the past,

291
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,640
what would you want to change?

292
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,800
I already told you I would change nothing.

293
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,840
You’ve read so many webtoons
your brain is leaking.

294
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,160
Ow!

295
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,560
Say that again and I will smack you
as many times as your age.

296
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,120
You... you slapped me already just now.

297
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,560
Oh, right. Forgot.

298
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,080
You know I’m quick-handed.

299
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,280
This gives so much more than that, seriously.

300
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,640
Read it. You have to read it.

301
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,200
It’s really fun.

302
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,400
It gives you something to think about.
Read it, quick.

303
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,160
This part is so good right now.

304
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,800
- Read it.
- If it’s fun, then read it.

305
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,720
Oh, where are you going?
Stay and read with me.

306
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,720
- Eek, no I won’t read.
- Read it.

307
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,520
- Nat, you read it too.
- This is so fun.

308
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,880
- I said I won’t.
- It’s great, seriously.

309
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,400
Hey Prince, read it. Trust me, give it a try.

310
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,040
Worradej.

311
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,080
What did you mean just now?

312
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,920
Change history?

313
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,360
Yes.

314
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,920
It’s hypothetical.

315
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,280
Suppose the events ahead

316
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,960
are already set in motion.

317
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,680
The Saenya dynasty rules for centuries more.

318
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,800
Can we change that?

319
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,560
And who decides it?

320
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,760
How could we possibly know our own future?

321
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,320
Uh...

322
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,600
I was only speculating.

323
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,920
Even if Brahma has ordained the future,

324
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,920
that will not make me change my mind.

325
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,080
I only know one thing.

326
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,720
I must storm the royal palace.

327
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,840
Simply to defeat that Saenyakorn.

328
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,720
I myself.

329
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,400
Will be the one to change Brahma’s decree.

330
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,360
So then, proceed.

331
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,080
History will not repeat itself.

332
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,120
History must change.

333
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,840
But when will you storm the royal palace?

334
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,400
I am ready.

335
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,440
All of us, sir.

336
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,240
Should we wait until
the mourning is over before attacking?

337
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,560
Right now,

338
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,680
it seems everyone only thinks about
dealing with Saenyakorn.

339
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,680
And have completely
forgotten King Chaiyached.

340
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,160
Even though King Chaiyached
has only recently died.

341
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,880
It is very tragic, sir.

342
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,120
- Jade.
- Jade.

343
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,480
- What are you doing?
- Jade.

344
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,200
I will shave my head.

345
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,480
As a sign of mourning for His Majesty.

346
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,400
Eek, Jade, no!

347
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,800
- Jade, Jade, no!
- Jade.

348
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,160
- Jade, stop now.
- Jade.

349
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,440
- Let me go, sir.
- Jade, calm down.

350
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,640
Compose yourself. Jade, stop. Stop.

351
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,760
- Jade.
- Don’t do this, Jade.

352
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,560
King Chaiyached

353
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,000
Your Majesty, this...

354
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,560
Are you human or a spirit, Your Majesty?

355
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,840
Stop calling me King Chaiyached.

356
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,320
And stop using royal speech with me.

357
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,400
The king named Chaiyached
has long left this world.

358
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,840
Only Chet, a common man, remains.

359
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,320
What on earth is going on, my lord?

360
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,400
I got intel from that Lord Saenyakorn.

361
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,040
When I was captured by him.

362
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,360
He said that...

363
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,160
If I were to assassinate Your Majesty,

364
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,800
I would lose all legitimacy

365
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,600
to claim the throne for myself.

366
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,120
Therefore...

367
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,720
the other provinces would rise
and attack Thanapura

368
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,080
on charges of rebellion.

369
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,280
Hence,

370
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,040
Your Majesty remains essential to me.

371
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,920
That’s why he hasn’t killed me
or crowned himself.

372
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,160
He fears the other kingdoms
would rise and seize the throne.

373
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,760
That’s exactly why he’s afraid.

374
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,200
So he keeps you alive as his puppet.

375
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,440
Then...

376
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,200
what if we stage it to look like Lord Saenyakorn
assassinated Your Majesty?

377
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,960
We would gain legitimacy
to move against Lord Saenyakorn.

378
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,640
On charges of treason.

379
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,200
And win support
from the other provinces.

380
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,600
What do you think of this plan?

381
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,360
I agree
Playing dead sounds great fun.

382
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,440
Worradej

383
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,240
Do you think you can stage
Chaiyached's death convincingly?

384
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,480
Acting is my specialty.

385
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,880
Since we have a festival coming,

386
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,000
we will use it to our advantage.

387
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,120
While the crowds gather,

388
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,920
I will make it as real as possible.

389
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,760
Make it bloody enough
to leave everyone stunned.

390
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,000
Everyone...

391
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
So you all already know?

392
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,760
Then why am I the only one
who did not know about it?

393
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,560
It was my idea.

394
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,160
I fear that if you knew
it was merely staged,

395
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,720
you would not feel sad.

396
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,040
And others would suspect

397
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,760
that I am truly dead
and you show no sorrow at all.

398
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,280
So we must keep you
in the dark.

399
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,000
Your Majesty

400
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,000
Your Majesty, please
do not do that again.

401
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,280
Oh, Jade

402
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,320
Stop crying now. No one’s dead.
You can stop crying.

403
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,280
I’m crying because
I’m happy, Your Majesty.

404
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,160
It’s all right, it’s all right.

405
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,560
Your Majesty

406
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,640
You are safe now, aren’t you?

407
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,960
Come on, stop crying, Jade.

408
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,960
- Stop crying.
- There, there.

409
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,120
You... you’re hugging me too tight.

410
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,880
You’re all far too emotional.

411
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,240
Chaiyached

412
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,080
Go back to your chamber.

413
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,920
Someone might see you.

414
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,120
Come, escort me back.

415
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

416
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,480
Where are you going?

417
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,840
To inspect the inner palace, sir.

418
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,320
Lord Kosol ordered that

419
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,200
no one must approach
the royal bedchamber.

420
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,760
He wishes everything
to remain as it was.

421
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,040
Do you understand?

422
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,520
Yes, sir.

423
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,520
Your Majesty, please do not
leave the royal chamber again.

424
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,600
If anyone sees you,
it will cause a great uproar.

425
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,760
But it is so boring in here.

426
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,480
Then stay here
and keep me company.

427
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,240
Stay and talk with me all day,
and I promise I won’t go anywhere.

428
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,240
As you wish, Your Majesty.

429
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,240
Drop the royal speech already.

430
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,920
I am no longer a king.

431
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,880
Come on, call me "Brother Chet."

432
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,840
Uh... I dare not, Your Majesty.

433
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,640
Still with the "Your Majesty"?

434
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,360
Or is it because you don’t wish
to get close to me?

435
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,440
Do you intend to keep
this distance between us?

436
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,400
Uh...

437
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,720
May I speak to you
the same way I do with the Count?

438
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,040
It feels more comfortable.

439
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,360
Very well.
At least that narrows the gap a little.

440
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,960
What are you doing?

441
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,080
Hmm.

442
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,800
You just touched my head.

443
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,480
And now your head’s still fine.

444
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,000
No ashes or brimstone fell on it.

445
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,280
Nor did hell swallow you whole.

446
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,000
So from now on,

447
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,080
you may speak freely with me.

448
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,040
No need to be afraid anymore.

449
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,760
Come now, Jade.

450
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,920
I am but a commoner now,
just like you.

451
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,440
Relax around me, will you?

452
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,760
Okay then.

453
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,080
Yes, sir.

454
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,080
Thank you so much, old friend.

455
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,880
Is it too tight?

456
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,600
Now put your arm around me.

457
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,920
You can hug me, right?

458
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,720
Uh...

459
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,080
It’s a bit tight, sir.

460
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,160
Brother Chet

461
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,760
Is Jade handsome?

462
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,280
Handsome.

463
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,560
Very handsome?

464
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,360
Truly handsome.

465
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,120
Kosol

466
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,560
Do you have any plan
to storm the royal palace?

467
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,560
Not yet.

468
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,320
I only know that
Lord Saenyakorn

469
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,960
has likely prepared forces
to meet us.

470
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,840
Lord Kosol

471
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,720
Madam Nisa has traveled
from Thanapura to see you.

472
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,800
Who do you think it is?

473
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:34,000
Madam Nisa,
Chaiyached’s maternal aunt.

474
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,120
Who is she?

475
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,240
She is Chet’s aunt.

476
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,760
Tell them I do not wish
to receive her.

477
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,280
Tell her to return home.

478
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,560
But it seems

479
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,560
Madam Nisa has urgent business, sir.

480
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,920
No matter how urgent,
it means nothing to me.

481
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,960
If she refuses to leave,
let her wait as long as she wants.

482
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,400
Yes, sir.

483
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,160
Madam Nisa,

484
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,320
Lord Kosol asked me to inform you
that he will not receive you.

485
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,080
Please return, my lady.

486
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,200
Where is Kosol?
I will go to him myself.

487
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,720
Better not, my lady.

488
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,520
Lord Kosol said
he is not available to meet you.

489
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,760
How dare he!

490
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,680
I’ve come all the way
from Thanapura,

491
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,480
and he dares turn me away?

492
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,000
Kosol, how could you
be so cruel?

493
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
She might have
something important to say.

494
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,760
Why not just talk it through?

495
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,800
Or do you two have
some history together?

496
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,600
Chet’s family and mine,
we’ve always been enemies.

497
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,560
That hatred has been passed down
to our generation.

498
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,360
After so many generations of hate,
what even started it?

499
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,040
What else?

500
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,440
Power and the lust to rule, of course.

501
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,440
Answer me now,
where is Kosol?

502
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,080
But Nisa’s hatred toward me

503
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,920
runs deeper than that.

504
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,560
Why is that?

505
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,000
No answer, huh?

506
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,360
Fine, then I’ll go ask her myself.

507
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,920
Please don’t, my lady.

508
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,240
Madam Nisa.

509
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,920
Please, my lady, don’t!

510
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,520
Because the man she wanted
fell for me instead.

511
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,840
Ouch!

512
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,520
So irritating!

513
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:21,040
Are you saying you were
the heartthrob of the royal court?

514
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,840
Kosol, why do you keep avoiding me?

515
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,880
Nat?

516
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,600
Nat, Nat! How did you get here?

517
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,520
Huh? It’s really you!

518
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,720
Not an illusion?

519
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,880
Nat, you came to take me home, right?

520
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,040
How did you get here,
and how will you get back?

521
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,040
- Ah!
- Do not touch me!

522
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,760
Who are you?

523
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,880
Wait, you’re not Nat?

524
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,040
My apologies, milady.

525
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,120
You just look so much like
my dearest friend.

526
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,600
Like a Grade-A copy, honestly.

527
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,040
Kosol

528
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,040
Kosol, are you keeping
an unworthy concubine?

529
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,400
I think she suits you well, though.

530
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,600
You’re still as sharp-tongued
as ever, Nisa.

531
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,600
State your business quickly.

532
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,000
So you may leave.

533
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,800
For I do not wish to see your face.

534
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,840
I will not go until I have
cursed you properly.

535
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,760
How did you raise Chaiyached
to be attacked like this?

536
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,280
Who harmed my beloved Chaiyached?

537
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,400
If the Lord denies it was he,

538
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,800
then who did?

539
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,040
Who are the rebels plotting treason?

540
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,760
Or is it you, Kosol?

541
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,320
Are you barely breathing through your gills?

542
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,600
Even if I must hold my breath
to berate you, I will.

543
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,920
I will do it.

544
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,720
Answer me this instant.

545
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,040
First: I have cared for that Chet well.

546
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,040
But you know Chet,

547
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,360
he loves to put himself in danger.

548
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,000
That is beyond my control.

549
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,200
Second: I insist

550
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,760
that the one plotting the
assassination is Lord Saenyakorn.

551
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,520
And third, if I intended to kill Chaiyached

552
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,720
I would have killed him
when I was three.

553
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,960
I would never have let him
live to this day.

554
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,080
Oh, Chaiyached...

555
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,040
My dear nephew.

556
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,520
Why must your life
be filled with such sorrow?

557
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,800
You lost your mother
when you were so young.

558
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,360
And when you grew older,

559
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,159
you became nothing more
than a puppet for nobles.

560
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,480
And just as you rose
to become a king,

561
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,400
you were taken from us
too soon.

562
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,600
Oh, my poor nephew...

563
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,239
Kosol, whose side is she on?

564
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,840
Ours or Lord Saenyakorn’s?

565
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,800
If she’s on our side,
shouldn’t we tell her the truth?

566
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,440
Nisa...

567
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,159
Let me ask you something.

568
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:37,120
What do you think of Lord Saenyakorn?

569
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,600
I despise him more than filth itself.

570
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,159
Your eyes...

571
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,640
Here.

572
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,400
Someone’s here, sir.

573
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,520
Worradej, go open the door.

574
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,400
Yes, sir.

575
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,000
Chet...

576
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,280
Look who I’ve brought with me.

577
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,600
Who is it?

578
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,080
Aunt.

579
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,400
My dear nephew.

580
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,480
I am not dreaming, am I?

581
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,880
You look thinner, my lady.

582
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,280
There, truly my dear nephew.

583
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,360
I heard you went to Singhanakhon.

584
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,280
What business did you have there?

585
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,920
I went to pay respects to King Chaiyached.

586
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,240
But I did not manage to.

587
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,400
King Chaiyached is not dead yet.

588
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,760
I had suspected as much.

589
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,720
Did you speak with them further?

590
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,160
Yes, I spoke with them at length.

591
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,280
About the plan to invade Thanapura.

592
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,600
And to capture and execute the king.

593
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,160
Will you storm the royal palace?

594
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,520
If there is anything I can do, tell me.

595
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,880
I long to behead that tyrant.

596
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,360
Very fitting.

597
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,840
You move freely in and out of the palace.

598
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,440
And you are close to Lord Saenyakorn.

599
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,400
You could be a great help to us.

600
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,800
But if we use a mole scheme,

601
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,720
you may be put in danger.

602
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,040
Can you bear it?

603
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,160
My life and the lives
of these other women

604
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,960
are already so wretched.

605
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,240
They never hold a woman
as equal to a man.

606
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,480
We are willing to risk
our very lives

607
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,720
so that we might escape
their dominion.

608
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,600
Then let us waste no time.

609
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,960
Let us plan and prepare
to storm the royal palace.

610
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,320
I will at once notify
the four supporting provinces

611
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,560
that back our forces.

612
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,920
Now... um...

613
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,720
May I say something?

614
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,680
From the last war,

615
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,800
many people lost their lives.

616
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,880
Whether enemy soldiers
or our own villagers,

617
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,600
they all had families.

618
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,520
I believe war is far too cruel.

619
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,800
I do not wish to witness
such things again.

620
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,200
But if you do not wish to see it,

621
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,360
you need not join this battle.

622
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:13,040
For the word "war" is written with cruelty.

623
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,640
But I feel the same as you, Worradej.

624
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,960
At that time, when I killed those soldiers,

625
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,800
I wondered what they had done wrong

626
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,120
They probably did not even want
to invade us

627
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,840
Yet they were conscripted anyway

628
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,240
If you remain soft-hearted

629
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,280
how shall we win the war

630
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,040
How about this

631
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,880
If our target is Lord Saenyakorn

632
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,360
and only a few nobles

633
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,320
we infiltrate the palace and strike only them

634
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,040
No need for bloody pitched battles

635
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,040
Brilliant

636
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,920
This plan is thrilling, Your Highness Chet

637
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,360
Then we will pose as a Natasha

638
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,520
sneak in to deal with the single mastermind

639
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,960
My plan, what say you, Kosol

640
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,640
It is a good plan

641
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,760
But the palace guards are many

642
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,680
How shall we infiltrate then

643
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,360
I know

644
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,400
First,

645
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,040
I must entrust Lady Nisa

646
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,560
to go and trick Lord Saenyakorn

647
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,800
into thinking we have another plan

648
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,120
I have heard that

649
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,200
they are mustering from four provinces

650
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,400
and meet at Pak Nam Inthu.

651
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,200
Count,

652
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,160
Yes, sir.

653
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,880
Send men to watch the river mouth at Inthu.

654
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,800
If they gather troops there at any time,

655
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,040
report back to me at once.

656
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,120
At your command.

657
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,840
Come sit on my lap.

658
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,640
Go sit on the bench.

659
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,920
That would be improper.

660
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,520
On my lap.

661
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,200
Yes.

662
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,200
When this war is over,

663
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,160
I will grant you a handsome reward.

664
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,080
It would be Your great mercy.

665
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,560
Just that?

666
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,360
Is that so?

667
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,480
Kosol.

668
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,720
Um...

669
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,160
Could you not wipe there, please?

670
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,280
I mean...

671
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,840
I am ticklish.

672
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,440
I am preparing weapons
to fight that Lord Saenyakorn.

673
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,800
You are being crude and off-topic.

674
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,800
Crude, how? Well...

675
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,320
I am ticklish because
you wipe there.

676
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,120
What if the gun goes off
and someone is killed?

677
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,320
There are no bullets.

678
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,000
How could it possibly fire?

679
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,080
If there are none,
then there are none.

680
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,400
You could have told me
there were no bullets.

681
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,040
You are always finding
fault with me.

682
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,920
Worradej.

683
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,520
If the two of us enter
the royal palace,

684
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,520
we cannot be bickering
like this anymore.

685
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,440
Windows have ears,
doors have eyes.

686
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,840
Every step could be
dangerous.

687
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,720
Do you realize that?

688
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,560
Mm.

689
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,280
I know.

690
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,480
Kosol.

691
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,840
You have been away from
the palace for such a long time.

692
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,920
You will be returning home.
Are you excited?

693
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,600
A home filled only with
family hatred,

694
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,280
is like living in a ring of fire.
I do not wish to return.

695
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,600
Once our mission is complete,

696
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,640
it will be over.

697
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,000
The killing and fighting for power,

698
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,960
is drawing near, Worradej.

699
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,560
Near what?

700
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,240
The wish I once told you about,

701
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,760
it is about to come true.

702
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,240
Really?

703
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,320
And once your wish is fulfilled,

704
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,680
we will return home, right?

705
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,480
I wonder how things are back there now.

706
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,200
- Ta-da!
- Ta-da!

707
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,480
Have you lost your mind?

708
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,280
That’s women’s cloth
for wrapping as a shawl.

709
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,400
Exactly! We’ll disguise
ourselves as court ladies.

710
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,720
We’ll dress as women
to enter the palace.

711
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,120
Dress as women?

712
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,320
- No.
- Nope.

713
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,120
Right now every regiment

714
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,840
is marching out of the capital.

715
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,600
There should be only a few
guards left in the palace.

716
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,440
Now we court ladies
outnumber them.

717
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,600
My lord, flee. I’ll handle them.

718
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,280
No. I will never abandon you.

719
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,040
We’ll stand and fight together.

720
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,200
This side says,

721
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,960
"Aunt."

722
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,160
And that side says,

723
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,800
"Chaiyached, my dear nephew."

724
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,960
Alright, one at a time.

725
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,840
(No slaps, no fights, still no better)
One thing at a time

726
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,560
(No slaps, no fights, still no better)

727
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,960
As he spoke

728
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,800
(Huh? What’s with Lord Kosol?)

729
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,280
(Looks like she’s rehearsing her lines)

730
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,640
Phew, why did he make it?

731
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,120
(That’s pure inner acting, Banjong)

732
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,400
Once grabbed,

733
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,000
(So wicked, Count)
Better if he were dead
