1
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,280
Kosol.

2
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,760
You were ambushed, weren’t you?

3
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,880
How are you holding up?

4
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,120
The Fire Ritual day will be our victory.

5
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,840
I’ll reveal the plan to you later.

6
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,600
I sense Worradej isn’t dead yet.

7
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,000
Don’t think you can force yourself on me.

8
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
An eye for an eye.

9
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,680
Jade kissed me and wished me sweet dreams.

10
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,759
Banjong.

11
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,200
Release Worradej.

12
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,120
No, don’t come closer.

13
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,480
- Stay back.
- Jade!

14
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,639
Let go, let me go.

15
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,840
I said let go, I’m not leaving.

16
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,120
Let me go.

17
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,400
I won’t leave, I’ll stay here with my friend.

18
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,000
Open the door.

19
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,120
I said open the door.

20
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,440
Worradej!

21
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,160
You ungrateful brat,
I risked myself to save you.

22
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,680
And you want to go die again?

23
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,520
Do I need to beat sense into you, huh?

24
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,240
Huh, huh?

25
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,880
Father and son fighting?

26
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,360
Quite entertaining.

27
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,000
Your Majesty.

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,520
It’s my father, Your Majesty.

29
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,440
He plans to throw us all
into the Fire Ritual tomorrow.

30
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,400
Please save us, Your Majesty.

31
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,760
Count, how could you do this?

32
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,160
What I ordered…

33
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,400
Was only for Kosol, wasn’t it?

34
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,880
I caught Kosol at Banjong’s manor.

35
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,800
That’s how I learned
they were conspiring together, sire.

36
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,000
I had no choice but
to send them all into the Fire Ritual.

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,120
To prove their innocence, sire.

38
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,400
When I fled to Banjong’s manor,

39
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,880
I never told him
what crimes I had committed.

40
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,240
So Banjong knew nothing of it.

41
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,920
As for Worradej,

42
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,440
You already know

43
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,560
I was holding him hostage.

44
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,000
And Jade was only following
his master’s orders.

45
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,160
To assume everyone around me
shares my thoughts,

46
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,320
That’s too harsh an accusation, Count.

47
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,160
A true elder wouldn’t do such a thing.

48
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,680
My elder brother speaks the truth.

49
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,120
Do you agree, Count?

50
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,480
You dare defy me?

51
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,280
Or are you plotting rebellion too?

52
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,280
Seems like…

53
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,720
I’ll have to throw you
into the Fire Ritual as well.

54
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,600
I wouldn’t dare, Your Majesty.

55
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,680
Only Kosol will face the Fire Ritual alone.

56
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,160
As for the others,

57
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,560
There’s no need to prove
their innocence, sire.

58
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,160
Your Majesty has judged correctly.

59
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:51,800
Slay, Queen. Mommy rules.

60
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,440
Mother. Fierce.

61
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,520
Slay, Queen. Mommy rules.

62
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,120
Mother. Fierce.

63
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:01,200
Sorry babe, my life’s too fab.

64
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,120
So sorry babe, my life’s too fab.

65
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,120
Slay, Queen. Mommy rules.

66
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,920
Mother. Fierce.

67
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,400
Your Majesty.

68
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,920
May I ask something?

69
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,920
Didn’t Your Majesty say
my father was rebelling?

70
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,000
From what I just saw,

71
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,760
He still looked respectful
and obedient to you, sire.

72
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:35,640
Because he still needs me
as an excuse to get rid of Kosol.

73
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,280
But if he turns against me now,

74
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,200
He’ll be the one branded a traitor.

75
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,159
Because some nobles
are still loyal to me.

76
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,640
So if my father manages,

77
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,800
To get rid of Kosol, then he’ll…

78
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,760
Come after me next.

79
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,880
That’s why we must rely on Kosol’s allies.

80
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,760
To take down the corrupt nobles.

81
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,280
So, have you planned
a way to save Kosol yet?

82
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,800
Not yet, Your Majesty.

83
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,800
What? You’ve been in that cell so long,

84
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,280
And still no plan?

85
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,720
When I was in prison,

86
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,600
I already asked Kosol
and Banjong to break out with me.

87
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,720
But the two of them seemed
to have their own secret scheme.

88
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,640
No matter how much I asked,
they never told me.

89
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,160
I got mad, sulked, even pouted,

90
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,200
But they still wouldn’t say a word.

91
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,080
Why not ask Banjong yourself, Your Majesty?

92
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,600
Maybe he’ll tell you.

93
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,680
Banjong.

94
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,480
Where is Lord Banjong?

95
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,040
There, sire.

96
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,400
He went that way.

97
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,280
Banjong! Banjong!

98
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,080
Banjong!

99
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,840
Ugh, where’s he rushing off to?

100
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,800
If their plan is so secret it can’t be told,

101
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,840
That they’d rather run away,

102
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,440
It must be something extremely risky.

103
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,120
That’s why they won’t let us know.

104
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,360
True, Your Majesty.

105
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,680
The greater the risk,
the bigger the chance of failure.

106
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,880
Either way,

107
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,120
We should still have a backup plan, sire.

108
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,840
I’ve just had some sugar in my bloodstream.

109
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,560
I’ve got an idea!

110
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,360
But we’ll need a few supplies.

111
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,840
Let’s go shop at the market, shall we?

112
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,400
The market?

113
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,800
Sure, I haven’t strolled the market in ages.

114
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,720
Hey Jade, have some too.

115
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,120
It’s delicious.

116
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
Thank you kindly.

117
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,360
Oh, Worradej,

118
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,240
I’ll make Jade my personal page.

119
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,920
I want a companion
by my side at all times.

120
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,920
And I choose Jade.

121
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,800
Really, sire?

122
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,200
Jade, aren’t you glad?

123
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,080
Serving him is way better than serving me.

124
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,000
You’re lucky indeed.

125
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,800
When I was with my master, I wasn’t suffering.

126
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,120
But life in the palace is still far better.

127
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,520
Besides,

128
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,320
His Majesty isn’t cruel like my father was to you.

129
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,760
Isn’t that true, sire?

130
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,440
I may have never had a friend in this life,

131
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,880
But I know what it means to be a good friend.

132
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,280
Aren’t you glad, Jade?

133
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,200
You’ll be the very first friend,

134
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,880
And the only one of King Chaiyached.

135
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,559
I’m honored, sire.

136
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,799
Good.

137
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,320
Then before the market,
let’s go have some fun.

138
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,120
Jade, give me a hand.

139
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,400
And… Jade?

140
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,920
You look rather regal yourself.

141
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,880
This feels improper, Your Majesty.

142
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,000
I fear the crows will peck my head off.

143
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,880
Please, let me change back, sire.

144
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,960
If crows peck your head,

145
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,720
I’ll have the royal physician heal you.

146
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,400
So don’t be afraid.

147
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,080
I just want to try being the lord for once.

148
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,080
I’ve just realized,

149
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,840
This outfit is way comfier
than that stiff one.

150
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,280
But Your Majesty playing Jade’s servant,

151
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,280
Who would believe that?

152
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,120
Your skin, Your Majesty,

153
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,400
It’s fair like you bathe every hour.

154
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,960
Jade.

155
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,400
If they don’t believe you’re
the master and I’m the servant,

156
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,720
Then roar at them loudly, understand?

157
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,320
I don’t dare, sire.

158
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,360
In this life I’ve never yelled at anyone.

159
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,640
I’ve only ever been yelled at, sire.

160
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,760
Then drop the "sire" already.

161
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,960
Today I’ll call you Lord Jade.

162
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,880
And you’ll call me Chaiyached.

163
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,720
Oh no, wait…

164
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,320
I think…

165
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,560
"Chaiyached" sounds a bit too harsh.

166
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,120
How about we change it to…

167
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,240
"Little Chaiyached"?

168
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,840
Mmm, that works.

169
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,200
Come on then, let’s head to the market.

170
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,080
After you, Lord Jade. Lord Worradej.

171
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,160
Yes, Little Chaiyached.

172
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,040
And please drop that Isaan accent someday.

173
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,800
Yes, sir.

174
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,760
Lord Jade, walk tall with your chest out.

175
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,520
Why do you walk so slouched, like a captive?

176
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,600
Yes, sire.

177
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,080
Still with the "sire"?

178
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,920
I told you to stop saying that.

179
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,320
Someone might overhear.

180
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,480
Little Chaiyached,

181
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,400
Don’t scold Lord Jade too harshly.

182
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,240
New masters are like that.

183
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,000
Give him time to adjust.

184
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,320
Lord Jade,

185
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,200
Please look after Little Chaiyached.

186
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,560
I’ll go check something over there.

187
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,680
Oh wait, no,

188
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,120
Little Chaiyached,

189
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,120
Please watch over Lord Jade.

190
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,640
I’ll be right back.

191
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,120
Is there anything you’d like to see,
Little Chaiyached?

192
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,840
I’ll take you there.

193
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,480
I’d like to see some
exotic goods from abroad.

194
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,440
Lord Jade, please take me there.

195
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,760
Of course.

196
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,480
Oh, hello mister!

197
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,520
If you fancy something, just ask me, sire.

198
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,800
Shopkeeper, what do you call
this strange tube?

199
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,200
Hey, don’t meddle with that!

200
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,200
And don’t touch that either, understood?

201
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,120
I’m interested in that tube, shopkeeper.

202
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,280
What is it?

203
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,880
It’s called binoculars, sire.

204
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,440
Try putting your eyes to it,

205
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,960
And look far into the distance.

206
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,400
What is this?

207
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,800
So strange, I can see people,

208
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,600
And houses not right before me.

209
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,400
It shows images from far away, sire.

210
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,200
This lens lets you see things,

211
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,040
Far beyond what human eyes,

212
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,600
Can see on their own.

213
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,560
It’s like having divine vision!

214
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,520
Here, let me try.

215
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,560
Oh wow.

216
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,280
Amazing!

217
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,640
Shopkeeper, I’ll take this one.

218
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,200
Hey,

219
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,800
You worthless servant!

220
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,680
You never know your place, do you?

221
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,280
Always trying to outshine your master.

222
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,880
Sire, you should teach him a lesson.

223
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,440
It’s fine, shopkeeper.

224
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,000
He and I are close, like true friends.

225
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,320
I don’t mind.

226
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,320
Alright then, I’ll take this one.

227
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,680
Yes, sire.

228
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,240
Don’t meddle, will you!

229
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,080
Being a servant is tough.

230
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,480
You can’t even speak your mind freely.

231
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,000
Always getting scolded.

232
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,280
Lord Jade,

233
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,240
Give that to me.
It’s my duty to carry it.

234
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,200
It’s fine, Little Chaiyached.

235
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,320
It’s light, I can carry it myself.

236
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,320
But it’s my responsibility, sire.

237
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,840
Damn you, you dirtied my shoes!

238
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,880
Please accept my apology on his behalf.

239
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,640
He truly didn’t mean it, sire.

240
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,000
Tell your servant,

241
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,240
To wipe my shoes this instant!

242
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,880
No, sire. I cannot, absolutely not.

243
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,280
And why not?

244
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,280
Lowly work belongs
to lowly people, that’s why!

245
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,240
Then allow me to do it instead, sire.

246
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,360
No need.

247
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,840
Sire,

248
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,800
I have some savings put aside.

249
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,320
I’ll pay for you to buy a new pair of shoes.

250
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,400
This way the matter should end well, sire.

251
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,480
No way. I’ll never let a lowlife like you,

252
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,440
Throw money at me to shut me up.

253
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,320
I said wipe my shoes right now!

254
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,400
And if I refuse, sire?

255
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,960
You insolent peasant!

256
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,080
Then this is what you’ll get!

257
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,240
Run, sire, run!

258
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,480
Run, sire!

259
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,240
Bastard!

260
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,800
Whoa, that was rough!

261
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,360
If that man knew
who Your Majesty really was,

262
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,280
His legs would’ve gone weak,

263
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,480
And he’d crawl back home in shame.

264
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,960
But the truth is,

265
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,600
No matter who I am,

266
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,000
No matter my rank,
no one should treat me so rudely.

267
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,320
That’s true, sire.

268
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,680
If one day,

269
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,840
People saw each other as equals,
it would be good.

270
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,280
Someday,

271
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,800
That day will come.

272
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,880
It’ll just take a little time.

273
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,800
That must be what Kosol is fighting for.

274
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,720
So, what did you bring back from the market?

275
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,280
Ta-da!

276
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,160
Lace from France,

277
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,720
And silk from Surin, sire.

278
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,800
I’ll have a dress made
for tomorrow’s Fire Ritual.

279
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,040
Jade.

280
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,600
- Yes, sire?
- Where have you been?

281
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,760
Uh… I, I went…

282
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,000
You went to tuck Worradej in, didn’t you?

283
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,680
Yes, sire.

284
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,160
I beg Your Majesty’s forgiveness.

285
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I’m not blaming you for anything.

286
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,360
I know you can’t forget your old master.

287
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,400
But don’t abandon me, alright?

288
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,080
Yes, sire. I swear it.

289
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,600
Oh, Jade,

290
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,840
Yes, sire?

291
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,600
Today when we went to the market,

292
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,360
I had the most fun ever.

293
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,200
Let’s do it again sometime.

294
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,640
Oh, Your Majesty…

295
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,319
I’ve had enough of that, sire.

296
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,680
Please don’t make me do it again.

297
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,359
I’m not cut out for it.

298
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,079
Besides, if Your Majesty pretends
to be a peasant again,

299
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,800
It might not be as safe as it was today.

300
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,160
Even as a king, I’m not safe.

301
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,440
The reason I fled here,

302
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,080
Wasn’t it because someone wanted me dead?

303
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,120
Sometimes I think,

304
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,760
I’d rather be a peasant living day by day.

305
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,440
But once I tried, it wasn’t so easy.

306
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,720
No honor. No dignity.

307
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,880
And others bully you with ease.

308
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,720
I pity you, Jade.

309
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,400
Jade.

310
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,640
Jade, are you even listening to me?

311
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,960
Bring forth Kosol for the Fire Ritual!

312
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,320
Kosol denies the charge.

313
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,480
He claims no involvement,

314
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,200
In the attempted regicide
of King Chaiyached.

315
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,800
If those words are true,

316
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,200
The divine will shield him from the flames.

317
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,760
But if they are false,

318
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,280
May he be burned to ashes,

319
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,000
To nothingness!

320
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,840
The time has come.

321
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,360
Kosol, step into the fire at once!

322
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,560
One.

323
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,520
Two.

324
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,920
Three.

325
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,720
Wait!

326
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,000
I have a witness to face
the fire in Kosol’s place.

327
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,640
Bring forth the witness!

328
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,680
I, Count Worradej,

329
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,160
Will prove the innocence of Kosol.

330
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,720
If what I say is true,

331
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,520
May heaven and earth,

332
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,720
Bring forth a miracle.

333
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,800
May the flames not burn me.

334
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,040
Just as slander,

335
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,280
Can never burn the truth.

336
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,200
Enough of this nonsense!

337
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,720
Your Majesty!

338
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,880
Worradej is deranged.

339
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,880
He cannot serve as a witness.

340
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,480
Please, Your Majesty,
revoke Worradej’s testimony!

341
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,520
The Fire Ritual is sacred.

342
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,400
Anyone’s words may be tested.

343
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,920
Even those called mad,

344
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,040
Whose words you claim
are unfit to be tested.

345
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,160
Are you mocking the ritual itself?

346
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,080
Then I’ll step into the fire now!

347
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,240
Worradej!

348
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,520
What are you doing?

349
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,240
Don’t throw your life away!

350
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,440
Worradej, get out of there!

351
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,960
Ta-da!

352
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,240
Not sinking, not gone,
not dead in the fire.

353
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,760
Because I am,

354
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,960
God’s chosen one!

355
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,160
Now you all see, don’t you?

356
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,280
The divine is on my side!

357
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,120
So stop slandering Kosol already!

358
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,200
- Yes, yes!
- That’s right!

359
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,520
Yes!

360
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,400
Worradej, what trick is this?

361
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,680
Just fireproof cloth, sire.

362
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,400
I’m using science I once studied,

363
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,960
To stage a miracle!

364
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,400
But how long can it withstand flames?

365
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,640
We don’t want
to linger in fire too long.

366
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,600
Just this much
is enough to stay safe, sire.

367
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,080
Worradej!

368
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,120
Who told you to do this, huh?

369
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,400
Well…

370
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,960
My heart did.

371
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,520
You…

372
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,160
You’ve ruined my whole plan!

373
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,600
Everyone, look!

374
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,640
Kosol is coercing a false witness!

375
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,960
No!

376
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,080
No one forced me to do anything.

377
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,120
I speak the truth!

378
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,000
Those words can’t be trusted.

379
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,560
My child was coerced as well!

380
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,760
That’s a lie!

381
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,840
No one forced me, no one threatened me!

382
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,640
If you don’t believe me,
then watch this!

383
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,880
This kiss, I gave it willingly.

384
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,160
Now do you believe,

385
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,520
That Kosol never forced me?

386
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,600
You wretched son!

387
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,040
I saved you time and again,
yet you defy me!

388
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,800
From this day on, I’ll cast you aside!

389
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,720
Even if no one is guilty of regicide today,

390
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,880
You and Kosol,

391
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,760
Are guilty of sodomy!

392
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,120
Guards!

393
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,080
Seize Kosol and Worradej at once!

394
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,800
That’s enough!

395
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,400
I’ve had more than enough of this!

396
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,120
Count, stop your obstinance!

397
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,240
The Fire Ritual is over!

398
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,240
Kosol is hereby acquitted!

399
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,960
As for the charge of sodomy,

400
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,120
I see this law as a problem.

401
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,640
I’ll take time to review and amend it.

402
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,760
That’s the end of it. Everyone, disperse.

403
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,320
Wait, Your Majesty!

404
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,240
I hold the seat of Chao Phraya Singhanakhon.

405
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,920
It is my duty to rule over
this land and all its people,

406
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,440
To maintain order in the kingdom.

407
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,160
I must defy Your Majesty’s decree.

408
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,840
Soldiers!

409
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,600
Seize them!

410
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,640
Stop right now!

411
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,320
I command you to stop!

412
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,280
Who are you people?

413
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,000
Whose side are you on?

414
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,160
With gun barrels aimed straight at you,

415
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,960
Do you really need to ask?

416
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,120
At the Fire Ritual,

417
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,520
Villagers will gather in crowds to watch.

418
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,240
Call in our allies from the provinces,

419
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,480
And hide them among the villagers.

420
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,000
Have weapons ready.

421
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,400
The moment I step into the fire,

422
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,840
That’s when you strike!

423
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,720
We should target the Count first,

424
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,520
To take control of the soldiers.

425
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,720
As for King Chaiyached, there’s no threat.

426
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,960
He has no troops and no power at all.

427
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,920
Just take a good look around,

428
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,040
And see whose weapons kill faster.

429
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,040
Soldiers!

430
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,760
Lay down your arms!

431
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,680
Seize them!

432
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,040
- Back off!
- Move, now!

433
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,480
- Go!
- Hurry!

434
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,000
- Quickly!
- Go!

435
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,680
Don’t, Count Kosol!

436
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,240
So… my brother’s seized power from me?

437
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,000
- You knew it all along.
- You…

438
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,120
Kosol!

439
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,320
Didn’t you say it was only a coup?

440
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,680
Why are you like this, breaking your word?

441
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,920
You,  You!

442
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,560
Don’t blame him yet, Count.

443
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,680
My brother would never truly harm me.

444
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,520
He was only teasing me.

445
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,040
Right, brother?

446
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,040
You’re just too fun to mess with.

447
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,480
Ouch!

448
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,720
My heart can’t take it!

449
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,880
Hey!

450
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,120
What is it with these two brothers?

451
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,000
So dramatic!

452
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,080
The reason I don’t kill you,

453
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,920
Isn’t because you’re
my brother or out of pity.

454
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,760
I know.

455
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,360
You’re keeping me alive for use,

456
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,520
In toppling Somdet Saenyakorn.

457
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,400
But I’ll use your hand as well, brother.

458
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,920
I may be king, but I have no troops.

459
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,520
While you have troops, but no crown.

460
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
If the two of us join forces,

461
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,400
We can bring Somdet down easily.

462
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,160
Fierce. Fierce. Fierce!

463
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,040
That’s iconic!

464
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,320
If the brothers unite,

465
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,120
Our desire,

466
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,080
Will surely come true with ease!

467
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,880
Here, come here!

468
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,200
What are you doing?

469
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,400
Since you two,

470
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,720
Are teaming up anyway…

471
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,440
Shake hands!

472
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,480
Mission accomplished!

473
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,160
Soon we’ll return
to the glory we left behind.

474
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Oh, my beloved fans!

475
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,240
Hold on, my darlings.

476
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,120
Mama will be back on stage real soon!

477
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,040
Hey, ah! Let me go!

478
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,240
Hey!

479
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,920
I went through the trouble
to reconcile you brothers,

480
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,920
And you’re still lashing out at me?

481
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,680
You’re guilty of defiance,

482
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,680
And meddling in matters uncalled for.

483
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,520
First with that prison stunt with me,

484
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,920
And today, stepping into the fire for me!

485
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,240
You can’t put all the blame on me!

486
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,400
It’s you,

487
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,160
Who wouldn’t share your plan.

488
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,160
I only did it because I wanted to help.

489
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,720
I didn’t want you to die!

490
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,720
What did I say wrong this time?

491
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,240
Worradej,

492
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,880
The question I once asked you,

493
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,600
You still haven’t answered me.

494
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Will you answer me today?

495
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,280
Q-Question…?

496
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,760
When did you ask me anything?

497
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,160
The day you first gave in to me.

498
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,080
Worradej,

499
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,800
Confess to me, once and for all.

500
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,080
That you joined our group,

501
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,440
Just to spy and report back to your father?

502
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,680
That’s not true!

503
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,800
I joined this group,

504
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,960
Because I, too, wanted to
change this land, like you.

505
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,960
Why must you push me onto the enemy’s side?

506
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,120
Because you were born a noble!

507
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,640
We don’t believe someone who has wealth,

508
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,360
And servants would want any change at all.

509
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,200
But life requires more than just that!

510
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,640
To show our true selves,

511
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,240
And to love freely, that matters too!

512
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,880
I want to abolish laws,

513
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,800
That forbid us from showing our true selves.

514
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,720
And laws that deny people’s love.

515
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,480
That’s why I joined you.

516
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,200
We fight for the villagers’ livelihoods,

517
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,640
But you fight only for yourself.

518
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,600
How pathetic!

519
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,480
Get out of our group!

520
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,480
Before this gets ugly.

521
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,240
I don’t want Banjong to know.

522
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,160
Get out!

523
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,760
Will you leave quietly, or get hurt?

524
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,080
Huh?

525
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,160
- Wait, hear me out!
- Get out!

526
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,400
- I won’t listen!
- It’s not me!

527
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,000
- I didn’t do it!
- Out!

528
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,600
Brother Kosol, Worradej is a traitor!

529
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,200
He’s spilling our secrets to Count Singha!

530
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,240
Please, deal with him, Brother Kosol!

531
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,480
From now on, no one is to lay
a hand on Worradej!

532
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,560
If anyone wishes to know what happens,

533
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,600
When you defy me…

534
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,920
Brother Kosol.

535
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,320
Brother Kosol…

536
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,160
Brother Kosol!

537
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,080
At home, my father scolds me
for faults I never had.

538
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,680
When I joined this group,

539
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,440
I hoped someone would
understand the real me.

540
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,440
Yet I was still cast aside…

541
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,480
As if there’s no place for me in this world.

542
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,320
This is your place, right here.

543
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,200
I’ll be the one to wipe away your tears.

544
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,960
What’s wrong?

545
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,920
Are you hurt?

546
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,160
I’m sorry.

547
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,720
Next time, just tell me.

548
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,200
So I’ll know to stop.

549
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,320
Or maybe the pain isn’t in your body…

550
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,760
You’re thinking of Banjong, aren’t you?

551
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,200
But he’s already rejected you.

552
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,960
Why torture yourself over him?

553
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,160
You’ve got me by your side now.

554
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,480
Forget about him already.

555
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,000
I’m grateful that you care for me.

556
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,000
But…

557
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,120
But what?

558
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,200
Nothing.

559
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,640
It’s nothing.

560
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,720
Say it.

561
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,080
I like things clear.

562
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,160
I want to know.

563
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,760
Do you have feelings for me or not?

564
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,040
Opportunist!

565
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,240
You pounce the moment I’m weak!

566
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,320
And the prey just lets me devour him.

567
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,400
So answer me now,

568
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,520
Do you have feelings for me or not?

569
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,800
Worradej won’t answer,

570
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,680
Because he loves Banjong.

571
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,040
He never had feelings for Kosol.

572
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,280
And now…

573
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,040
Who should I answer as?

574
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,560
Ugh, this is crazy!

575
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,480
You’re hesitating again.

576
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,160
But I can see your gaze has changed.

577
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,400
When you said you cared for me,

578
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,960
That you didn’t want me to die,

579
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,600
I felt you had feelings for me,
even if just a little.

580
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,880
Oh no…

581
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,920
Was my gaze that obvious?

582
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,800
So embarrassing!

583
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,920
Don’t hide from me anymore.

584
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,120
Tell me what’s in your heart.

585
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,000
My name isn’t Worradej.

586
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,440
It’s Prince.

587
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,800
How am I even supposed to answer this?

588
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,040
Will you answer me or not?

589
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,720
Do you have feelings for me?

590
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,800
Fine, I’ll answer you.

591
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,040
But I’ll answer with this.

592
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,360
Since we’re heading home anyway,

593
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,320
Let me show off a little flair.

594
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,640
A signature move,

595
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,480
From a 21st-century diva,
as a gift for this ancient warrior.

596
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,880
You really have changed.

597
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,120
Thank you, everyone.

598
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,120
The mission was a success.

599
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,440
But I want you all to be prepared…

600
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,280
A bigger mission awaits us.

601
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,720
And I believe there’s
one person who can help.

602
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,560
That person is Worradej.

603
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,480
Today you’ve all seen,

604
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,160
He crafted fireproof cloth
with his knowledge.

605
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,000
He has quick wit and survival skills.

606
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,000
And he has proven,

607
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,520
That he stands with us.

608
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,520
Not with the Count, as we once thought.

609
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,680
But what about him killing
our comrade, brother?

610
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,840
How do we take that?

611
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,440
Since that day,

612
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,880
I’ve never spoken seriously with Worradej.

613
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,240
I’ll summon him before everyone,

614
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,920
So nothing is left unsettled.

615
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,400
Because we must work together again.

616
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,480
I want us all to put
the cause above all else.

617
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,920
And set aside personal grudges.

618
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,760
Brother, are you sure this isn’t
personal with Worradej?

619
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,240
Banjong…

620
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,800
I love you.

621
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,800
Even if the sun and the moon,

622
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,600
Share the same sky,

623
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,280
They can never cross paths.

624
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,400
Why can’t we love each other?

625
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,360
I’m back, right?

626
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:46,560
Back to my glorious modern world!

627
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,720
Worradej, you brat!

628
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,800
Didn’t you say,

629
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,560
If I helped make Banjong
and Kosol’s wish come true,

630
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,600
I’d get to go home?

631
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,680
You tricked me, didn’t you?

632
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,200
Send me home right now!

633
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,760
I need to get back to my stage!

634
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,720
No… this can’t be real!

635
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,760
Worradej, did you scream from a nightmare?

636
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,320
A nightmare, yes.

637
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,560
But I wasn’t dreaming.

638
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,320
And my name isn’t Worradej.

639
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,920
I just want to go home!

640
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,280
Where are you going?

641
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,120
Home, obviously!

642
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,600
But…

643
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,480
I don’t even know how to get back.

644
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,360
Or which way to go.

645
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,120
Why is life this hard just for being trans?

646
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,840
Ready the troops!

647
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,880
We’ll march into battle soon!

648
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,480
I have something to consult with you.

649
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,480
Help me think it through.

650
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,120
Help me gather forces for war.

651
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,960
I will summon the deity,

652
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,920
To descend into Count Kosol’s body.

653
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,240
I am the King!

654
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,360
How dare you do this to me?

655
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,440
Last night you pleased me so much.

656
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,080
Let’s go another round.

657
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,480
Ugh, wait, Kosol!
(Easy on him, Count Kosol.)

658
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,520
Cut!

659
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,880
Get P’Nut a towel, he’s drenched.

660
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,400
What’s so funny?
(Used up too much energy.)

661
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,280
(This scene’s intense.)

662
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,000
(Giving it all, no holding back.)

663
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,360
He’s lighter, but maybe less stamina.

664
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,600
It feels heavier here.
(Still fit enough, though.)

665
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,960
I feel fatter today.

666
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,480
And these heels,  the rain ruined it.

667
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,440
The ground sank,
heel stuck, fabric snagged.

668
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,800
(It was a struggle.)

669
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,960
This diva’s about to drop dead!
