1
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,640
Soldiers from the royal court
came and killed everyone.

2
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,720
They said

3
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,120
it was an order

4
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,400
from Somdet Saenyakon.

5
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,640
Once back at the palace,
sound the war drums at once.

6
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,600
This time you must train
seriously for battle.

7
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,400
Start with Jade as the tank,

8
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,160
the front-line fighter.

9
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,240
Your Majesty will be the mage,
supporting from the center.

10
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,039
Banjong will be the carry.

11
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,680
Kosol the assassin.

12
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,160
He must find a way
to take down Somdet.

13
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,600
Have you told Banjong yet?

14
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,720
Told him?

15
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,560
Told him what?

16
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,840
That the two of us
are lovers now.

17
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,520
And you should tell him
you’ve turned him down.

18
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,120
Not yet.

19
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,760
Then why haven’t you?

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,400
What are you waiting for?

21
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,240
I’m just afraid that,

22
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,240
won’t he get confused?

23
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,640
Because before this,

24
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,800
I once confessed my love to him.

25
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,360
And now suddenly I go and reject him.

26
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,760
I wouldn’t even know what reason to give.

27
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,120
Hearts can change at any time.

28
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,079
It’s nothing strange

29
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:45,320
that yesterday you loved,
and today you don’t.

30
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,400
But speaking your feelings honestly

31
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,920
is what you should do,

32
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,040
instead of holding back

33
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,400
and making things so gloomy.

34
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,520
That way, Banjong can stop
his hopeless dreams.

35
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,560
But won’t he be hurt?

36
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,000
So what if he is?

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,160
If he dares to love,
he must dare to be hurt.

38
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,440
And every time I see him
flirt with you, it grates on me.

39
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,400
One day I might not be able to hold back.

40
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,920
I’ll smash his face in
just for being annoying.

41
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,160
Don’t you dare.

42
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,200
When the time and chance come,

43
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,800
I’ll tell him myself.

44
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,920
Give me time to sort out my heart.

45
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,400
And tell me,

46
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,400
how can I be sure you won’t
change your heart for another?

47
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,920
No.

48
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,480
No, what?

49
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,320
You said it yourself,

50
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,960
that hearts can change anytime.

51
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,720
So how can I be sure

52
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,520
you’ll love me forever and ever?

53
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,920
I was talking about people in general.

54
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,079
But I’m not like the rest.

55
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,040
Everyone in this world but me,

56
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:50,079
I’ll love you unchangingly.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,600
A guy like you,

58
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,800
saying things like that, huh?

59
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,480
Can I write that line down?

60
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,120
I’ll use it to write a new song.

61
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,720
The title will be,

62
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,320
“I’m Not Like Anyone Else.”

63
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,720
Brother Kosol.

64
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,959
Oh, are you all eating?

65
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,000
I came right on time.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,720
Mind if I join in?

67
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,440
Whoa!

68
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,520
Shrimp paste chili dip.

69
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,640
So pungent.

70
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,720
Let’s see what I brought along.

71
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,360
Fermented fish dip.

72
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,080
Smells good.

73
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,400
Looks tasty, doesn’t it?

74
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,640
I made this especially for you,
Brother Kosol.

75
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,040
Oops.

76
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,680
The shrimp paste again.

77
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,440
Ugh, stinky.

78
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,880
Jade, what are you doing?

79
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,640
Why aren’t you asleep yet?

80
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,200
I was waiting for the Count,
my Lord.

81
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,920
Worradej has been staying
at your brother’s quarters.

82
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,720
He hasn’t returned here
for many nights.

83
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,280
And you’re still waiting?

84
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,240
I must wait, my Lord.

85
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,400
In case the Count chooses
to sleep here,

86
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,640
so I can attend to him.

87
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,400
And how long will you wait?

88
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,240
Once the moon rises high
above the treetops,

89
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,320
I’ll go to bed, my Lord.

90
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,160
Your Majesty.

91
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,320
Where are you going,
Your Majesty?

92
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,760
To wait here and keep you company.

93
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,800
Please don’t, my Lord.

94
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,280
You should rest, Your Majesty.

95
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,760
You must spar early
tomorrow morning.

96
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,680
I can wait by myself, my Lord.

97
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,320
Aren’t we training partners?

98
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,159
I sleep when you sleep.

99
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,360
I wake when you wake.

100
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,640
I’ve told you before, you’re my friend.

101
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,280
And friends should do everything together.

102
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,680
Well then…

103
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,040
I’ll go to bed, Your Majesty.

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,240
Jade.

105
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

106
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Come lie here on the bed with me.

107
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,200
Your Majesty…

108
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,880
I wouldn’t dare, sire.
Ringworm will eat my head.

109
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,640
Ringworm again?

110
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,360
If the Ringworm eats your head,

111
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,320
I’ll have the royal physician
treat you myself.

112
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,600
Come up.

113
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,120
Your Majesty, I…

114
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,400
Do you dare defy my command?

115
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,880
No one escapes royal punishment.

116
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,880
A lowly servant lying on the king’s bed,

117
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,440
that would be truly improper, sire.

118
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,040
Then sleep there, if you must.

119
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,800
But stay and keep me company.

120
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,880
You always fall asleep first.

121
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,720
Don’t you dare fall asleep.

122
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,280
Hey, Jade.

123
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,000
Have you ever had someone you loved?

124
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,200
Jade.

125
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,200
Falling asleep this fast, really?

126
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,040
Jade, wake up and answer me,
have you ever loved someone?

127
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,520
Jade.

128
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,720
Jade.

129
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,240
Jade.

130
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,840
I’m already grown like this,

131
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,120
why have I never loved anyone?

132
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,200
I don’t even know why.

133
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,520
Banjong.

134
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,760
Hm?

135
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,560
Well…

136
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,280
that last shot I fired yesterday,

137
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,400
I still don’t know if it hit the mark or not.

138
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,960
- Shoot.
- Enough practice for today.

139
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,760
I’ll hold your hand and teach you
until you never miss.

140
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,200
Hmm… still missed.

141
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,840
Just grazed it again.

142
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,040
Really?

143
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,120
Then I guess,

144
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,400
I’m not cut out for shooting.

145
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,760
I should do something else.

146
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,640
Don’t want to waste your time.

147
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,280
It’s fine. I’m glad to teach you.

148
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,480
I don’t feel tired at all.

149
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,640
I’ll keep teaching you until you hit true.

150
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,480
Even if it takes a lifetime.

151
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,720
Then maybe…

152
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,320
I should get glasses first.

153
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,080
The problem might be my eyesight.

154
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,440
Glasses?

155
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,920
Perfect. You’ll be my partner in crime.

156
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,240
Banjong, you…

157
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,480
Don’t say that.

158
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,960
I’m shy.

159
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,800
You’re shy because of me?

160
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,240
So that means you feel something for me.

161
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,120
This is a prelude,

162
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,440
to accepting my love, isn’t it?

163
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,520
Go ahead, say it.

164
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,000
I’m ready to hear it.

165
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,760
Uh…

166
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,400
Easy now, Banjong.

167
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,560
- I…
- I get it.

168
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,640
Accepting someone’s love

169
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,360
can be hard.

170
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,240
But right now it’s just the two of us.

171
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,840
No need to be shy.

172
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,520
Speaking your feelings honestly matters

173
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,520
more than holding back

174
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,000
and leaving things in the air like this.

175
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,400
The truth is…

176
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,880
I have something to tell you.

177
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,720
Banjong.

178
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,480
I don’t love,

179
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,120
Banjong.

180
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,760
What’s wrong with you?

181
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,440
Banjong

182
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,680
Banjong, Banjong, what’s wrong with you?

183
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,160
Banjong, Banjong

184
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,480
Banjong

185
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,200
Help, somebody help!

186
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,040
Please, someone help!

187
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,800
Banjong, Banjong, what’s happening?

188
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,080
Help!

189
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,280
Help, somebody help!

190
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,880
Help, Banjong!

191
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,800
Help!

192
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,600
Stay with me!

193
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,080
Help!

194
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,480
Help!

195
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,800
Banjong

196
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,360
Huh? You’re faking a seizure?

197
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
I didn’t know what else to do.

198
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,320
I just needed to buy myself some time.

199
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,880
So I’d have more time
to prove my feelings to Worradej.

200
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,200
What about you?

201
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,600
Does Kosol seem to like you back?

202
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,840
Kind of, yeah.

203
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,000
Yesterday Kosol ate the food I made.

204
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,680
He really seemed to enjoy it.

205
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,720
Eat it, please.

206
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,920
Or should I feed you?

207
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,240
No need, no need.

208
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,720
I’ll eat it myself.

209
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,040
Is it good?

210
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,520
Look at his face.

211
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,520
See if he actually wants to eat.

212
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,400
He does. If not, he’d have spat it out.

213
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,360
Right, Kosol?

214
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,440
See?

215
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,680
Kosol likes my cooking.

216
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,960
Here, one more bite.

217
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,480
No thanks.

218
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,640
In that case,

219
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,200
you’ll have to cook for Kosol every day.

220
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,640
Don’t ever miss a day.

221
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,240
Your cooking skills

222
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,520
might make Kosol leave Worradej

223
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,280
and turn his eyes to you.

224
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,280
Since Worradej can’t cook at all.

225
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,000
As for me,

226
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,240
I’ll keep chasing after Worradej.

227
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,840
Divide and conquer, that’s the plan.

228
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,400
Same target.

229
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,480
Deal?

230
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,720
And when I hit my goal,

231
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,200
I’ll find a way to split you from Worradej.

232
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,880
Again.

233
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,280
Harder.

234
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,480
Elbow strike.

235
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,000
Another elbow.

236
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,520
Elbow strike.

237
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,480
- Good.
- Again.

238
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,080
Come on, hit again.

239
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,440
Harder.

240
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,080
Swing that punch.

241
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,160
Come on.

242
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,720
Hit.

243
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,960
Elbow.

244
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,840
Swing it, kick again.

245
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,240
Kosol.

246
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,560
Here’s some water.

247
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,440
Thanks.

248
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,000
But take it to your brother,
I can scoop some myself.

249
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,640
I mixed sacred drops
in this one just for you.

250
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,400
It’s extra refreshing.

251
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,200
Don’t turn me down.

252
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,520
Here, let me feed you.

253
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,960
Feeling refreshed?

254
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,000
Worradej.

255
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,920
Are you sore anywhere?

256
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,280
I can give you a massage.

257
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,520
No, I’m fine. Not sore yet.

258
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,680
If I do get sore, I can handle it myself.

259
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,440
Even if you’re not sore,
a massage won’t hurt.

260
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,120
It’ll help your muscles relax.

261
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,360
I learned massage from Wat Pho, you know.

262
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,920
Somdet’s army is coming.

263
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,200
We’ve got one watch to prepare.

264
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,840
Everyone, to your posts.

265
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,600
Follow the plan we laid out.

266
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,760
Go.

267
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,280
Move, quick.

268
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,320
- Get in.
- Wait.

269
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,600
They’re opening
the city gates to welcome us?

270
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,080
That looks way too suspicious.

271
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,480
It must be some kind of trap.

272
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,520
When their troops march in,

273
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,520
we’ll leave our gates wide open

274
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,200
with not a single guard stationed there.

275
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,680
Are you out of your mind?

276
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,080
How could we just open the gates
and let them in so easily?

277
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,640
Our forces are far fewer.

278
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,960
If we clash head-on at the walls,

279
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,000
we’ll lose men for nothing.

280
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,880
This plan will make them paranoid.

281
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,200
We’ll lure them inside the city.

282
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,040
It’ll be easier to deal with them there.

283
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,040
All of you,

284
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,760
stay alert with every step you take.

285
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,840
This city is riddled with traps.

286
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,120
Is that clear?

287
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,920
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

288
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,560
Here they are, everyone. Come on in!

289
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,960
- Come on in, come on!
- Come inside!

290
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,320
Hurry in!

291
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,680
Count your kids and family carefully.

292
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,600
Pandao, take everyone to hide in that room.

293
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,040
This way, this way.
Grandma, are you okay?

294
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,040
You okay? Easy now.

295
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,440
Walk slowly.

296
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,960
Search every corner.

297
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,040
Take them all alive
and bring them back as slaves.

298
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,600
If anyone resists, kill them.

299
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,760
The only one to capture alive
is King Chaiyached.

300
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,880
Go on in, Grandma.

301
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,280
Inside, careful now.

302
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,640
- Get inside.
- Hurry, go inside.

303
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,640
- Quickly.
- Get inside.

304
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,320
- Go first, go on.
- Get inside.

305
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,120
Kids, we need to stay quiet now.

306
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,240
If you’re loud, the enemies will take you.

307
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,480
The elderly and children will hide together.

308
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,320
It’ll be easier to look after them.

309
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,040
Soldiers and volunteer forces

310
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,880
will set up ambushes.

311
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,760
Spread out at different points.

312
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,560
This plan will split them into small groups.

313
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,120
And we can finish them off easier.

314
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,800
So divide yourselves up,

315
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,640
choose who’ll take which post.

316
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,280
As for me...

317
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,720
I’ll deal with that Somdet myself.

318
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,400
Kosol.

319
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,920
You’d better surrender.

320
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,920
And I’ll spare your lives.

321
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,720
Otherwise,

322
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,080
I’ll wipe you all out.

323
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,840
Till Singhanakhon becomes a ghost town.

324
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,760
Everyone!

325
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,560
You heard the enemy’s threats, right?

326
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,880
Defend our land

327
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,520
to the last breath!

328
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,280
Soldiers!

329
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,520
Whoever slaughters
the most Singhanakhon people

330
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,040
will earn a reward from me!

331
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,120
Charge!

332
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,000
Whoever’s hiding, come out now!

333
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,320
If I find you myself,
I’ll gut you on the spot.

334
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,040
Forgive me.

335
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,240
Please grant me absolution.

336
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,440
Come out, no use hiding.

337
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,600
I know someone’s inside.

338
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,040
Come out!

339
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,040
If you don’t, I’ll break
the door down right now!

340
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,200
Break it down!

341
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,800
Harder!

342
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,600
Push again!

343
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,040
If they break through, what do we do?

344
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,880
They won’t get through.

345
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,200
Because we’ve got help.

346
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,640
Help?

347
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,680
This house cat...

348
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,760
Why’s it so huge?

349
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,040
Eat up, Mumu. Enjoy your meal.

350
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,240
The one accusing others of treason

351
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,720
is the true traitor himself.

352
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,480
I only seek to save the land.

353
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,560
A weak king will bring ruin to the realm.

354
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,440
I alone shall restore the nation.

355
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,960
Aren’t you ashamed of your own vile words?

356
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,680
I’m sick of hearing them.

357
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,280
Storm the palace!

358
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,400
Seize King Chaiyached!

359
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,760
Storm the palace!

360
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,320
Pandao, open the door. It’s me.

361
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,240
Did you finish them all?

362
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,960
Mumu took care of them.

363
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,960
I doubt anyone else will come here.

364
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,200
But stay here and look after the villagers.

365
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,960
I’ll head into the city.

366
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,600
Wait.

367
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,600
Be careful.

368
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,200
Thanks.

369
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,800
Hey, wait,

370
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,440
Mumu won’t…

371
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,080
eat me, will it?

372
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,320
Mumu doesn’t eat women.

373
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,480
Dressed like this,

374
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,560
I may be safe from Somdet’s soldiers,

375
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,040
but how can I be sure

376
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,880
I won’t be attacked by my own side?

377
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,040
Your Majesty.

378
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,440
Everyone in Singhanakhon knows your face.

379
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,040
No one would dare harm you, Your Majesty.

380
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,360
Then stay close to me.

381
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,840
If anyone tries to hurt me, you can help.

382
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,360
The villagers are hiding over there, right?

383
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,280
No, sir.

384
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,280
They’re over there, but…

385
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,120
I just saw them that way.

386
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,080
Or maybe they’ve all gone already.

387
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,600
I really don’t remember, sir.

388
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,240
Attack.

389
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,880
Banjong.

390
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,120
Worradej, are you hurt anywhere?

391
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,840
I’m fine. Thank you so much.

392
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,880
Banjong.

393
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,120
Banjong.

394
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,240
Banjong.

395
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,680
Banjong.

396
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,160
Banjong.

397
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,240
Banjong, Banjong.

398
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,760
Please, stop.

399
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,200
Don’t do this.

400
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,200
We’ve never had any grudge.

401
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,520
And we didn’t even know each other before.

402
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,640
Please stop.

403
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,560
I don’t want to kill you.

404
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,240
But it’s my duty. Rest in peace.

405
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,000
Kosol.

406
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,440
Kosol, Kosol, help Banjong!

407
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,600
Banjong!

408
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,800
Your Majesty, using this ambush tactic
on the palace guards,

409
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,600
, we managed to push them back
and seize many of their weapons.

410
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,000
Including this gun.

411
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,720
It was also taken from the palace guards.

412
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,080
But that Somdet Saenyakorn
still hasn’t been captured.

413
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,760
I think,

414
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,800
, he must still be inside this palace.

415
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,720
We need a way to lure him out.

416
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,840
Take this.

417
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,960
When the time is right, fire.

418
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,920
That’s not right, Your Majesty.

419
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,920
You’d be putting yourself
in too much danger.

420
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,360
It should be Your Majesty
who takes the shot.

421
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,640
Let me be the decoy instead.

422
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,320
You can’t lure Somdet.

423
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,200
He doesn’t care about you.
He only cares about me.

424
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,520
But what if something goes wrong?

425
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,600
Somdet should be here by now.

426
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,400
Enough talking. Do as I say.

427
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,080
Running home already,
Somdet?

428
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,960
I didn’t realize

429
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,840
there was still one soldier
of Thanapura left.

430
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,600
Your Majesty.

431
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,560
Playtime is over.

432
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,400
Come back to the palace with me.

433
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,080
Back to being a puppet,

434
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,320
pulled by your strings
as before?

435
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,600
It’s you whose time is up.

436
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,600
It’s time I took
the power back from you,

437
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,280
and handed it to its rightful owner.

438
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,640
The rightful owner of power?

439
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,240
Don’t tell me you mean His Majesty himself.

440
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,760
Jade, what are you doing?

441
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,040
Why haven’t you fired yet?

442
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,520
Well?

443
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,320
Who do you mean?

444
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,360
Whoever I mean,
it doesn’t matter.

445
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,800
But one thing’s for sure,
it isn’t yours.

446
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,840
Put down your ambition.

447
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,280
Return to the order
where you belong.

448
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,040
The order where I belong?

449
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,840
I’ll decide that for myself.

450
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,480
Jade.

451
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,000
My lord.

452
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,720
I found this one lying in wait
to shoot you.

453
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,080
Jade.

454
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,840
An ambush, is it?

455
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,560
Such dishonor is unworthy
of Your Majesty.

456
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,480
Next time you fight me,

457
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,560
do it face-to-face.

458
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,320
What would you have me do
with him?

459
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,400
Kill him.

460
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,080
Don’t.

461
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,040
You want me, don’t you?

462
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,280
Does it sting?

463
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,840
Bear with it.

464
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,600
It’ll be over in a moment.

465
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,760
Reckless fool.

466
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,080
Who told you to be careless in battle?

467
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,800
Lucky you’re still alive.

468
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,640
If that blade had cut deeper,

469
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,680
your bones would’ve been shattered.

470
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,440
Hey Kosol.

471
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,320
Can’t you speak nicely?

472
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,640
Banjong risked his life to save me
and got slashed on the back.

473
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,960
Try praising someone. Comfort them.

474
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,920
Say something kind for once.

475
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,360
Let it go, Worradej.

476
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,480
Just you applying medicine on me

477
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,200
already fills my heart.

478
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,120
I don’t need hope from anyone else.

479
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,040
Now you’re making me wonder.

480
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,320
That you took the blade on your back

481
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,680
just to cozy up to Worradej?

482
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,280
Are you out of your mind?

483
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,160
Who would think like that?

484
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,600
Go do your job already.

485
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,960
I’ll stay here and look after Banjong.

486
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,320
- You kicking me out?
- No.

487
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,440
Or do you want to sit here with Banjong

488
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,880
while I go do your duties for you?

489
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,720
Does it hurt?

490
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,440
Hang in there, Banjong.

491
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,720
Should’ve let him die instead of saving him.

492
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,880
Don’t mind him.

493
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,280
He probably missed going to
the fields this morning.

494
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,680
That’s why he’s cranky
and taking it out on everyone.

495
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,440
Lord Kosol, Lord Kosol!

496
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,320
Please help Jade!

497
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,160
What happened to Jade?

498
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,080
And where’s King Chaiyached?
Why are you here alone?

499
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,000
I was lying in wait to snipe Somdet.

500
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,840
Then suddenly I blacked out.

501
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,040
At that time, King Chaiyached
was with Somdet.

502
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,520
Since you want to take the throne
in my place,

503
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,800
why not kill me outright?
Why drag me back alive?

504
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,239
Hey Somdet.

505
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,920
I am loyal to Your Majesty.

506
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,320
I would never dare commit
such a grave sin.

507
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,000
Yet you leash me like cattle,

508
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,280
and still dare speak of loyalty?

509
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,920
That is because Your Majesty

510
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,120
has strayed too far off the path.

511
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,520
I must force you back
into the rightful track.

512
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,920
Somdet.

513
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,320
Since I’m already in your grasp,

514
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,480
tell me clearly what’s on your mind.

515
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,040
At least then I’ll know my place

516
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,960
and how I should conduct myself.

517
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,800
If I were to kill Your Majesty,

518
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,400
I would lose all legitimacy
to seize power.

519
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,280
But the provincial lords...

520
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,280
they would storm Thanapura,

521
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,640
accusing me of treason.

522
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,960
Thus,

523
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,680
Your Majesty is still of great use to me.

524
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,240
So that’s how it is.

525
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,720
My Lord,

526
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,600
someone is riding after us.

527
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,480
It must be Kosol.

528
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,200
He guards his brother
like a cobra guards its eggs.

529
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,400
Shall we find cover first, My Lord?

530
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,760
Our forces are already too few,

531
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,520
and our weapons
have all been seized by them.

532
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,800
If you know

533
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,280
you’re no match for my elder brother,

534
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,520
then crawl into a hole and hide.

535
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,280
Otherwise my brother
will surely kill you.

536
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,520
We’ll rest here for now.

537
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,320
Once Kosol passes,
we’ll move on again.

538
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,080
Yes, My Lord.

539
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,240
Ched!

540
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,800
Ched!

541
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,480
Ched, where are you?

542
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,280
They’re getting closer, sir.

543
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,520
Why did they stop the horse?

544
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,400
Where’s Your Majesty’s helmet?

545
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,960
You were wearing it earlier.

546
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,080
Uh… I’m not sure, sir.

547
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,120
But I saw Your Majesty wearing it on the way.

548
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,280
The forest is vast.

549
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,960
Kosol will never find us here.

550
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,560
Hey!

551
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,160
Hey!

552
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,120
Stop!

553
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,080
Give it here.

554
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,200
Hand it over.

555
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,080
Give it to me.

556
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,760
Shameless grown-up stealing a kid’s toy.

557
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,400
Jade, be my page.

558
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,520
Ched and Jade sound alike,

559
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,440
so we’ll make a perfect duo.

560
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,400
I already told you, you’re my friend.

561
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,920
And what about His Majesty?

562
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,320
I know you can’t forget your old master.

563
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,160
But don’t abandon me either.

564
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,640
Jade.

565
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,640
Your Majesty.

566
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,960
What’s wrong? Why are you crying?

567
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,120
I’m not crying, sir.

568
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,840
Are you crying because
you’re worried about me?

569
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,600
And Your Majesty, you’re not hurt, are you?

570
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,200
My Lord.

571
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,320
We should deal with Kosol first, sir.

572
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,720
Why are you here alone?

573
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,680
Weren’t you captured by Samdet?

574
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,560
Yes, I was taken by him.

575
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,360
But once they knew you were close behind,

576
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,120
they ran off in a hurry.

577
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,280
At least they were wise
enough not to fight you.

578
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,400
Did they hurt you at all?

579
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,760
Not at all. I’m fine, all in one piece.

580
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,920
Chaiyached

581
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,320
Didn’t I tell you to stay put

582
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,880
Is it that hard not to risk yourself

583
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,800
See, I’m fine now

584
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,280
Why are you scolding me

585
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,200
But what if something happened to you

586
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,320
Come on

587
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:45,200
I know you’d never let anything happen to me

588
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,600
Am I right

589
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,640
I just went out a bit, what could happen

590
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,800
You’re the one, are you okay

591
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,880
I’m fine, Your Majesty

592
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,040
Then why are you crying

593
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,840
You were worried about me, weren’t you

594
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,200
Hey, I’ve got something to tell you

595
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,960
Sit

596
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,640
That Somdet

597
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,160
He tied me up and dragged me off so far away

598
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,720
I walked till my legs gave out, sore all over

599
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,440
But I kept trying to find a way to escape

600
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,840
So I started talking to him

601
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,840
hoping I could dig out some secrets

602
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,800
And did you get anything, Your Highness?

603
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,040
Got plenty, actually

604
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,520
But I knew Kosol would come save me anyway

605
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,440
so I tossed my hat, and you really found me

606
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,400
I must apologize to you, Worradej

607
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,080
I truly caused you trouble

608
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,920
I’ll hurry to find a craftsman to make
you new glasses as soon as possible

609
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,600
so you won’t have to suffer

610
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,160
being my arms and legs like this

611
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,720
It’s all right

612
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,200
You risked your life to save me

613
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,800
let me do something
to repay your kindness

614
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,840
Until you get your new glasses

615
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,040
whatever you want to pick up or do

616
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,720
just call me anytime

617
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,800
I’ll be your eyes for you

618
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,200
Banjong, Banjong

619
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,160
How are you? Where did you get hit?

620
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,640
On the back

621
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,720
Wor, what did you do to my brother?

622
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,720
- Tell me now!
- Pandao

623
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,760
Worradej didn’t do anything to him

624
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,200
He went in to save him

625
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,880
and got hurt by the enemy

626
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,400
Go on, get out of here

627
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,080
I’ll take care of my brother myself

628
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,200
I’m not leaving

629
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,400
I’m the reason Banjong got hurt

630
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,520
I’ll stay and look after him as atonement

631
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,560
- No need!
- Yes, need!

632
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,640
Shouldn’t you be at the infirmary
helping the wounded?

633
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,960
They’re already short-handed

634
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,920
I quit, I’ll leave and take care of my brother

635
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,360
- You should go help at the infirmary
- Pandao

636
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,040
Don’t you remember what we agreed?

637
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,400
I remember

638
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,720
Even if I’d rather not, honestly

639
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,480
Look, I already let you
take care of my brother

640
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,960
Then do it properly

641
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,320
I’ll come back to check later

642
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,720
No need for that

643
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,760
I can take better care of him than you

644
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,440
We’ve been through battles for a while now

645
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,840
So I think we should hold a celebration

646
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,640
Let everyone enjoy themselves
and bring back the spirit

647
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,960
To Somdet, our scouts reported

648
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,960
Singhanakhon will host a festival
on the full moon of the twelfth month

649
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,680
It’s said to be a grand event

650
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,400
I don’t know

651
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,520
what you’ve been through to become like this

652
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,880
But if one knows right from wrong

653
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,200
one should choose to change and improve

654
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,640
It’s up to you

655
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,120
whether you’ll accept it or not

656
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,440
(Come on, if you can take it)

657
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,040
Hold tight
(Come on, if you can take it)

658
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,560
Left, start with your left hand

659
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,200
Again, yeah

660
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,040
Ow, my hand hurts
(It’s already split open)

661
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,280
(Your hand’s hurt, Count)

662
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,080
Try using your knee

663
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,360
(Already flinched first)

664
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,240
(Why so startled, Count)

665
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,440
Cut

666
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,720
(Ears ringing now)
