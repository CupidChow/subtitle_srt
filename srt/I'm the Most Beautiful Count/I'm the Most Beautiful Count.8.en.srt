1
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,480
Even though we gathered allies
from other towns.

2
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,920
I still think it’s not enough.

3
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,920
Do you have any way to find more?

4
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,880
I’ve heard in the foothill forest.

5
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,479
There are villagers fleeing
the tattoo draft.

6
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:38,920
Our scouts reported.

7
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,360
Somdet Saenyakon.

8
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,320
Sent spies tailing Kosol’s group
without fail.

9
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,440
Hey, everyone hide!

10
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,520
Stay together and follow me!

11
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,680
So you’re the officials.

12
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,520
Here to drag us back, right?

13
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,039
No. We’re here to invite you
to rise against the officials.

14
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,960
Your village is really lovely.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,880
So calm and quiet.

16
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,000
Phai!

17
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,800
You betrayed us
and sided with the officials?

18
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,400
Attack!

19
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,680
No!

20
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,000
Hear me out.

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,480
They mean well. They’re here
to take us home.

22
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,440
No more hiding in this forest
like fugitives.

23
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,079
It’s true. Look at our faces.

24
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:29,600
Do we look like the kind who’d enslave you?

25
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,560
If you want to know how we’ll help you.

26
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,160
I’ll tell you now.

27
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:55,000
I believe every one of you.

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Loves freedom and wants
a life of your own.

29
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,600
Not to be anyone’s property.

30
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,920
Nor serve anyone else.

31
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,160
And all who love freedom.

32
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,560
Should live with dignity.

33
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,560
And share equal rights.

34
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,880
But the oppressive system.

35
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,360
Forced you to flee
into the forest.

36
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,680
How long will you keep hiding?

37
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,760
For generations to come?

38
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,520
Now I have seized
the city of Singhanakhon.

39
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,560
I want you all to go home.

40
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,480
And join as one force.

41
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,120
To fight the true source
of all this.

42
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,320
That Somdet Saenyakon,
who holds power now.

43
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,600
Who will stand with me?

44
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,480
Nothing in this world
comes easily.

45
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,080
And this fight.

46
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,800
May cost us blood.

47
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,880
And flesh.

48
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,400
But it’ll be worth it.

49
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,920
For the freedom we will gain.

50
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,400
We must rise and fight.

51
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,880
I’ll go back with you myself.

52
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,320
- I’ll go too.
- I’ll go too.

53
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,760
- I’ll go too.
- I’ll go too.

54
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,080
- I’ll go too.
- I’ll go too.

55
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,040
- I’ll go too.
- I’ll go too.

56
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,000
- I’ll go too.
- I’ll go too.

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,480
- I’ll go too.
- I’ll go too.

58
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,520
- I’ll go too.
- I’ll go too.

59
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,720
Then tonight will be the last night
we stay here.

60
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,960
Let’s have a farewell feast.

61
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,520
Why sit alone, brother?

62
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,400
Go dance with Worradej.

63
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,520
Are you mad?

64
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,240
I won’t do something
so embarrassing.

65
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,640
Come on, don’t be so shy.

66
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,280
Or someone else
might snatch him.

67
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,560
Don’t blame me then.

68
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,560
Come on, brother.

69
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,240
Chances like this
don’t come easy.

70
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,760
No.

71
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,240
I’d rather die than go dance.

72
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,360
Hey, Kosol.

73
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,440
Dance with me, it’ll be fun.

74
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,680
I don’t get it.

75
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,880
Why are you so eager
for me to dance?

76
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,280
Because you.

77
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,040
You’ve kept a straight face
since the journey.

78
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,600
So I was worried.

79
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,760
That your face might cramp up.

80
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,520
Now that we’ve finished
our mission.

81
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,880
Let’s do something fun
to relax a bit.

82
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,640
Come on, dance with me.

83
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,280
- No.
- Please.

84
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,200
I said no means no.

85
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,600
Why not?

86
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,360
No means no. No reason needed.

87
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,920
Worradej.

88
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,520
If you don’t mind.

89
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,600
Would you dance with me?

90
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,400
With pleasure.

91
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,120
Let’s go.

92
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,800
See?

93
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,280
He got snatched away.

94
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,880
Don’t blame me now.

95
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,480
Your Majesty, please come dance.

96
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,760
- What the,
- Kosol!

97
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,000
Kosol!

98
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,760
You can’t take Worradej away!

99
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,400
Let me go!

100
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,440
Let go! I said let go!

101
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,080
Let go, ah!

102
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,080
Hey!

103
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,840
I’m not a doll you can just
carry around!

104
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,640
I was dancing with Banjong.

105
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,480
You’ve no right
to kidnap me like this!

106
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,720
Wait!

107
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,040
Didn’t you ask me
to dance with you?

108
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,040
So I brought you here
to dance with me.

109
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,000
Hey.

110
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,520
If you want to dance with me.

111
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,000
Why drag me this deep
into the woods?

112
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,360
Can’t you do things
like normal folks?

113
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,360
I’m shy.

114
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,680
I can’t dance.

115
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,320
But if it’s swordplay,
I’m pretty good.

116
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,960
When it comes to dancing.

117
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,720
I’m hopeless.

118
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,760
So I want you to teach me.

119
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,400
Look, dancing’s just for fun.

120
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,160
There’s no right or wrong.

121
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,920
People dance to enjoy.

122
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,680
Come on, Worradej.

123
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,000
Teach me, please.

124
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,680
Then I’ll teach you.

125
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,400
Let’s start with forming the circle.

126
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,960
Do you know how?

127
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,000
Like this.

128
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,640
Make it a bit more graceful.

129
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,840
Here.

130
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,760
Bend it up.

131
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,280
Okay.

132
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,200
Next, the other hand makes a lotus.

133
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,800
Like this, a lotus.

134
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,880
Keep it graceful.

135
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,080
Don’t bend your arm.

136
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,120
Bend like this, yes, the hand.

137
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,480
Okay.

138
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,080
Now I’ll give the beat.

139
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,320
It goes one, two, three, four.

140
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,240
Then switch to the other side.

141
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,800
Three, four.

142
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,520
Uh-huh, try it.

143
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,440
One, two, three, four.

144
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
Okay?

145
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,640
One, two, three, four.

146
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,600
One, two, three, four.

147
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,680
One, two, three, four.

148
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,800
One, two, three, four.

149
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,640
One, two, three,

150
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,000
Don’t laugh at me.

151
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,440
I just find you endearing.

152
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,800
You’re dancing so stiffly.

153
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,640
If it’s not your thing,
don’t force it.

154
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,680
I’m forcing myself for you.

155
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,160
Because I want
to dance with you.

156
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,880
Like other lovers do.

157
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,480
Then…

158
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,960
If you want to dance with me.

159
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,720
Shall we go back
to the village?

160
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,880
Here.

161
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,160
There’s no one around.

162
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,080
It’s more fun with others,
and there’s no music. Come on.

163
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,000
I want to be here with you,
just us two.

164
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,680
We don’t need music.

165
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,400
It’s already in my heart.

166
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,840
I’m not jealous.

167
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,160
Not jealous, but restless.

168
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,880
Since Lord Kosol carried
my master away.

169
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,280
No need to follow.

170
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,080
He’ll be back soon.

171
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,360
I wasn’t going to follow.

172
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,200
I’m sure Worradej
will choose me anyway.

173
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,200
That sure of yourself?

174
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,600
This is way harder
than swordplay.

175
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,200
Worradej.

176
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,000
Don’t tell anyone.

177
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,600
That I danced with you.

178
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,920
I let only you see this side of me.

179
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,480
Why not? Hey.

180
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,960
You’re a warrior.

181
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,400
But you can dance too,
it’s actually cute.

182
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,280
Really cute?

183
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,560
Of course. Cute.

184
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,040
Then do you love me?

185
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,720
What’s with you?

186
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,560
How did it get to this?

187
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,680
You’ve been dodging me all along.

188
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,240
Every time I asked
how you feel about me.

189
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,920
I don’t care.

190
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,960
You must answer me today.

191
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,960
If you don’t, I won’t let you
leave this forest.

192
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,560
We’ll just stay here together.

193
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,240
Hey, didn’t you say
you wanted to dance with me?

194
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,760
So you tricked me
into a trap, huh?

195
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,320
I don’t mind being in the woods.

196
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,880
Plenty of ozone here, I like it.

197
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,480
You’re dodging me again.

198
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,720
But I think I can already guess
from your actions.

199
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,680
What your answer really is.

200
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,400
What we had before.

201
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,800
Was only physical pleasure.

202
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,840
Something you wanted from me.

203
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,960
There was never any depth of heart.

204
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,280
It’s my fault.

205
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,440
For feeling it alone.

206
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,040
Go back.

207
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,960
And don’t toy with my heart again.

208
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,920
Wait, Kosol!

209
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,640
Give me a moment
to think of an answer.

210
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,880
Oh man…

211
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,520
Such a world-shaking problem.

212
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,000
If only P’Oi and P’Chod were here.

213
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,400
But right now.

214
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,680
I’m all alone.

215
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,720
So then.

216
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,920
I’ll just be my own advisor first.

217
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,040
What do you think, Worradej?

218
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,480
This body belongs to me.

219
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,480
So you should choose Banjong.

220
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,160
Because I love Banjong.

221
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,600
You should choose him
for my desire’s sake.

222
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,040
But…

223
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,000
You’re already dead, Worradej.

224
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,400
I’m the one living
in this body now.

225
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,840
That’s me.

226
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,040
So I should choose Kosol.

227
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,640
To follow my own desire,
that’d be right.

228
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,440
And how do you know.

229
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
That Kosol loves me.

230
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,480
Or loves you, Prince?

231
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,920
Exactly.

232
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,840
If Kosol loves Worradej.

233
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,840
Wouldn’t that be imposture?

234
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,080
And that would mean.

235
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,200
He doesn’t love us
for who we truly are.

236
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,400
If we stay like this,
it won’t last.

237
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,680
What should I do?

238
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,600
Ugh, my head hurts.

239
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,040
So now you can give me
an answer, right?

240
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,160
Mm.

241
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,720
But before I answer you.

242
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,600
Let me ask you something.

243
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,640
Earlier, you once said.

244
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,920
That I.

245
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,720
Before drinking poison
and after drinking it.

246
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,720
Seemed like two different people.

247
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,440
So which one do you love?

248
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,280
Such a strange question.

249
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,720
You talk as if you’re two people.

250
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,320
To me.

251
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,000
You’re still the same Worradej.

252
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,800
The one with fierce determination.

253
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,240
The only difference is.

254
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,760
Back then you spoke less.

255
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,840
Now you talk more, that’s all.

256
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,000
That’s all, really?

257
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,800
That’s all.

258
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,440
So.

259
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,240
Do you love the quiet one.

260
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,280
Or the talkative one more?

261
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,520
Whether it’s you back then,
quiet.

262
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,680
Or you now.

263
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,120
Made talkative by the poison.

264
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,800
I believe inside
you’re still the same.

265
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,320
Don’t worry, Worradej.

266
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,040
Be whoever you are.

267
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,080
Just be yourself, that’s enough.

268
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,760
That’s the you I love.

269
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,680
How lucky I am.

270
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,320
That in this world.

271
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,080
There’s someone who truly
loves my real self.

272
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,480
And I love his true self too.

273
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,320
Kosol.

274
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,560
I love you.

275
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,680
I’ve waited so long to hear this,
Worradej.

276
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,960
I love you too.

277
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,680
And I won’t give you the chance
to reject me again.

278
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,800
What are you going to do?

279
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,400
I’ll do this.

280
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,599
Since tonight.

281
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,960
Is already special.

282
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,520
Let’s do something…

283
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,839
That’ll make it unforgettable.

284
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,720
It’s dark, walk carefully, sir.

285
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,560
Watch out for wild beasts?

286
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,720
Nothing’s scarier now
than Lord Kosol.

287
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,520
Don’t you smile.

288
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,680
I’m itching all over now.

289
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,840
Got bitten on the butt by ants!

290
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,920
And who was it.

291
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,880
That said tonight would be
unforgettable?

292
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,200
I’ll remember it till I die!

293
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,160
I got stabbed by rocks too.

294
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,920
So…

295
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,720
Did you like it?

296
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,640
I did.

297
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,520
It’s like turning into
a wild beast.

298
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,200
Living by instinct
in the middle of nature.

299
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,040
Hey.

300
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,720
Crazy.

301
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,720
Thanks.

302
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,280
But you don’t need
to comfort me.

303
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,680
You… you…

304
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,320
What’s wrong with you?

305
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,320
Kosol!

306
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,000
What on earth happened?

307
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,920
Count!

308
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,920
Phai!

309
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,880
Hey!

310
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,400
What’s going on?

311
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,240
Why is it like this?

312
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,040
Soldiers from the palace.

313
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,920
They killed everyone.

314
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,720
They said.

315
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,480
It was an order.

316
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,920
From Somdet Saenyakon.

317
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,360
Phai! Phai!

318
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,480
Phai!

319
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,720
They sent soldiers to kill me.

320
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,520
But these villagers
had to pay the price.

321
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,440
That means…

322
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,480
Somdet Saenyakon
has been watching us all along.

323
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,720
The volunteer force we have now.

324
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,720
Lacks fighting skills.

325
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,840
We must begin training at once.

326
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,840
Not just the volunteers.

327
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,760
But every one of you as well.

328
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,400
You must master combat tactics too.

329
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,040
Me too?

330
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,160
No way!

331
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,600
Let me cook instead.

332
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,360
Or work in the medics.

333
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,240
Or even entertain the troops,
better than that.

334
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,720
But holding swords or guns
to kill?

335
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,240
I can’t do that.

336
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,680
You must.

337
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,840
And everyone must too.

338
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,520
If you all have some
fighting skills.

339
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,600
You won’t have to rely
on me alone.

340
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,680
I agree.

341
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,800
At least we should
have the basics.

342
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,400
Better than nothing at all.

343
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,760
Like me, sir.

344
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,920
I only know one neck chop move.

345
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,160
Hmph. Before you get close enough.

346
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,760
Your head would be cut off first.

347
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,920
Exactly. You need sword training.

348
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,520
I trained with my brother
long ago.

349
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,680
I’d like to brush it up again.

350
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,360
Just thinking about it sounds fun.

351
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,360
Then tomorrow at dawn.

352
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,760
All of you gather
at the palace yard.

353
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,600
We’ll start by training
our bodies to endure.

354
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,480
Respectful greetings, my Lord.

355
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,080
Lord Kosol, sir.

356
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,320
Somdet Saenyakon is here.

357
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,000
How many came?

358
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,320
Only two, sir.

359
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,840
Somdet and one guard.

360
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,920
The sentries at the city wall
reported.

361
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,000
No troops followed behind.

362
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,160
Strange. What game
are they playing?

363
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,680
If not to strike us down.

364
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,720
Even if just two came.

365
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,120
They still can’t be trusted.

366
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,360
Chaiyached.

367
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,320
Go prepare yourself well.

368
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,680
I’m sure they came
because of you.

369
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,160
Somdet Saenyakon.

370
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,760
The Minister of War
requests audience.

371
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,600
Respectful greetings, my Lord.

372
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,160
It hasn’t been that long.

373
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,680
But you’ve aged so much,
Count Somdet.

374
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,800
I’ve heard Count Singha
has raised rebellion.

375
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,280
It made me deeply worried
for Your Majesty.

376
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,920
So I hurried here
to pay respects.

377
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,120
Seeing Your Majesty
safe and sound.

378
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,120
I feel greatly relieved.

379
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,880
You truly are
a funny man.

380
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,760
Isn’t Count Singha
your own man?

381
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,120
That’s true.

382
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,800
He once worked with me.

383
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,320
But his rebellion was done
on his own accord.

384
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,000
And what about the soldiers
you sent to raid the village?

385
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,960
How will you explain that?

386
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,640
I heard Your Majesty
would travel.

387
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,560
So I dispatched soldiers
to guard you.

388
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,640
But what happened after,
I had no knowledge of.

389
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,120
Since those soldiers
haven’t returned.

390
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,320
Finding this suspicious.

391
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,400
I came to invite Your Majesty
back to the capital.

392
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,600
So you deny
every accusation.

393
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,480
Feign ignorance.

394
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,800
And that clears you
of treason?

395
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,480
How convenient.

396
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,600
Your Majesty.

397
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,720
The one you should truly
be concerned about.

398
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,880
Is this very Kosol.

399
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,360
A traitor disguised
as a loyal brother.

400
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,240
Have you forgotten, Your Majesty?

401
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,840
How deeply he resents you.

402
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,640
For seizing the throne
that was once his.

403
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,120
He is the true traitor.

404
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,000
No, you are the traitor.

405
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,160
Did you think I never knew?

406
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,000
That you stirred unrest in the court.

407
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,480
Turning brothers
against each other.

408
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,520
So you could seize power
in the end.

409
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,080
But I will be the one
to end this vile cycle.

410
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,520
See, Your Majesty?

411
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,800
He just admitted
he’s the traitor.

412
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,560
Enough.

413
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,320
I don’t want to hear
that word again.

414
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,400
I’ve heard it all my life
and I’m sick of it.

415
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,000
False accusations of treason,
over and over.

416
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,360
Pretending to care for me.

417
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,120
But only for your own gain.

418
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,200
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

419
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,320
I never intended
to anger you.

420
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,200
In this kingdom,

421
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,840
no one is more loyal
to Your Majesty than I.

422
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,640
Please return to the capital
with me, Your Majesty.

423
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,360
It is dangerous
to remain here.

424
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,600
I will personally guard
Your Majesty’s safety.

425
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,160
You wish for me to return?

426
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,480
Very well, I will return.

427
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,120
But Brother Kosol
shall return with me.

428
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,160
And you must restore
his noble title.

429
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,440
What say you?

430
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,520
That would be most improper,
Your Majesty.

431
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,760
If you do so,

432
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,160
it would defy the will
of the late king.

433
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,240
Your own father,

434
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,280
who stripped Kosol of rank
and made him common.

435
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,840
Will you serve the present king,
or the late one?

436
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,360
If you choose the late,

437
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,000
I shall send you to him
this very instant.

438
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,400
Thank you, Count Somdet,
for your concern.

439
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,680
But I am well here
with my brother.

440
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,520
If you have no more business,
you may leave.

441
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,160
Once you return to the capital,

442
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,760
sound the war drums at once.

443
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,120
Yes, my Lord.

444
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,120
Now you must all train
for battle in earnest.

445
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,040
For Somdet will march
his army soon enough.

446
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,480
As the Art of War
by Sun Wu says,

447
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,480
Know the enemy, know yourself.

448
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,160
A hundred battles,
a hundred victories.

449
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,360
The capital’s soldiers
outnumber us.

450
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,240
But their hearts are weaker.

451
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,560
Because they never wished
to fight at all.

452
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,120
They were conscripted.

453
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,920
Our forces may be fewer.

454
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,960
But every one of us fights

455
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,880
for our own freedom.

456
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,360
We’ll divide into units,

457
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,240
each with clear duties.

458
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,600
But we’re already few in number.

459
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,120
Won’t dividing us further

460
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,960
make us even weaker?

461
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,160
I agree with Banjong on this.

462
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,200
Everyone has different strengths.

463
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,360
We’re not all the same.

464
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,920
And what do you know of war,
Worradej?

465
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,720
To dare voice an opinion?

466
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,840
Then I’ll do it.

467
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,800
I’ll divide us by personality.

468
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,760
Starting with Jade, you’re the tank.

469
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,000
Your Majesty, you’re the mage.

470
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,240
Kosol, you’re the assassin.

471
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,240
Banjong, you’re the carry.

472
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,000
The rest of you are fighters.

473
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,080
And I’ll be support.

474
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,040
What exactly
are you implying here?

475
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,600
Explain yourself.

476
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,360
What are those strange terms
you keep saying?

477
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,840
Then listen closely, everyone.

478
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,080
Starting with Jade as the tank.

479
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,240
You’re the frontline fighter.

480
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,440
His Majesty is the mage.

481
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,040
Staying in the middle
to support all sides.

482
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,560
Kosol is the assassin.

483
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
He must find a way

484
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,000
to slip in and slay Somdet.

485
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,800
Guard your sword well.

486
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,520
Or you’ll lose your life easily.

487
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,040
Better guard your cheeks too.

488
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,080
Or you’ll get kissed easily as well.

489
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,240
Banjong is the carry.

490
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,640
The long-range attacker.

491
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,800
Wow, just a bit more!

492
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,120
I’ll train till I shoot
like Banjong.

493
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,520
Worradej.

494
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,920
Aren’t you shooting?

495
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,480
I thought I was, Your Majesty.

496
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,960
But why are there no holes?

497
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,720
Because you missed, that’s why.

498
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,720
Worradej.

499
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,520
I’ll teach you.

500
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,040
You must stand firm first.

501
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,040
And then what, Banjong?

502
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,640
Raise your hands like this.

503
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,160
And I’ll be support.

504
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,920
The big picture, looking pretty.

505
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,400
Stay calm, Your Majesty.

506
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,640
I’ll play the mage role anyway.

507
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,240
You can’t stop me, brother.

508
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,800
Why can’t I stop you?

509
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,600
I’m your elder brother.

510
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,280
I forbid you to play it.

511
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,000
I can wield a sword
and shoot a gun.

512
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,320
Why won’t you let me take
an attack position?

513
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,960
Because you’re still young.

514
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,760
But I’m already eighteen.

515
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,360
When you were my age,

516
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,920
you went with Father
to crush rebellions.

517
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,080
So why stop me now?

518
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,760
Because we’re not the same.

519
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,320
If I let you fight,

520
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,960
you’ll only die in vain.

521
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,160
Worse, you could be
a burden to others.

522
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,240
I order you to stay put.

523
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,080
Do not leave until this war ends.

524
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,000
Your Majesty.

525
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,800
Your Majesty, Your Majesty.

526
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,120
Enough, Your Majesty.

527
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,440
That’s something I could never bear.

528
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,639
Your Majesty.

529
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,679
Please calm your heart first.

530
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:59,320
Lord Kosol forbade you only

531
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,480
because he worries for you.

532
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,120
I’m glad he cares for me.

533
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,440
But I’m also hurt

534
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,800
that he doesn’t trust my ability.

535
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,600
Do you know?

536
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,880
Do you know what my name,
Chaiyached, means?

537
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,360
I do not, Your Majesty.

538
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,520
“Chai” means one who is better.

539
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,360
And “Ched” means the very best.

540
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,880
Ched.

541
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,520
The finest of all.

542
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,000
I am Father’s youngest son.

543
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,640
Mother wanted me to surpass
all my brothers.

544
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,880
So she gave me this name.

545
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,600
But in truth,

546
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,720
my name carries another meaning.

547
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,200
“Chai” means victory.

548
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,560
“Ched” means elder brother.

549
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,840
Which can mean,

550
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,000
One who triumphs over his brother.

551
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,200
But I never wished to be that.

552
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,720
I never wished to stand above anyone.

553
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,280
Sometimes I long for a simple name like yours.

554
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,720
Jade.

555
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,480
Is your name spelled with “D” at the end?

556
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,400
I would not know, Your Majesty.

557
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,480
I cannot read or write.

558
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,040
In truth,

559
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,920
my name is “Jiad,” Your Majesty.

560
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,280
In my village tongue

561
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,680
it means “to share.”

562
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,840
But when the officials recorded slaves,

563
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,440
my parents’ speech was not so clear.

564
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,160
So they wrote it down as “Jade.”

565
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,720
That’s good.

566
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,080
“Ched” and “Jiad” sound alike.

567
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,200
So we can be a pair.

568
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,560
A foreign slave like me

569
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,320
cannot grow close to a king like you, Sire.

570
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,520
The curse would fall upon me.

571
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,360
But if one day

572
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,440
I am no longer king,

573
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,440
then we can be close, can we not?

574
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,000
And no curse will come upon you.

575
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,800
Your Majesty’s question is hard to answer.

576
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,840
I truly don’t know how to reply, Sire.

577
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,880
Banjong, I feel oddly confident.

578
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,920
This time I’ll surely hit the mark.

579
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,960
Mm.

580
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,000
That split second when the sight aligns…

581
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,360
That’s the moment.

582
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,600
Fire.

583
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,600
Much better, Worradej.

584
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,440
Just a bit more practice.

585
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,040
Ugh, I’m done.

586
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,960
At this rate, even lifetimes of training
won’t make me hit.

587
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,920
I’d rather switch to another unit.

588
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,040
Calm down.

589
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,800
We still have time.

590
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,200
Before Somdet’s army arrives,

591
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,280
we can keep training steadily.

592
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,560
I’ll guide your hand until you shoot true.

593
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,080
Mm, all right then.

594
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,760
If the teacher won’t give up,

595
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,280
the student won’t quit.

596
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,880
- Mm.
- Let’s try again.

597
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,240
Come.

598
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,840
Don’t forget what I taught you.

599
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,240
Keep your back straight.

600
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,160
Spread your legs.

601
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,200
Focus.

602
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,680
Stay mindful.

603
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,640
Be steady.

604
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,760
- Fire.
- Training’s over.

605
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,880
Hey.

606
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,240
What are you doing, Kosol?

607
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,040
What if I panicked, swung my gun,
and shot you dead?

608
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,680
Even if you fired a hundred more times,
I’d bet you’d never hit me.

609
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,320
With Banjong as your teacher,

610
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,040
you’ll never shoot straight.

611
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,120
Insult me if you want,

612
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,720
but don’t you dare insult
my student, Worradej.

613
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,800
Worradej.

614
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,760
Ignore the crows cawing,
the dogs and cats barking.

615
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,840
Just listen to me.

616
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,960
Trust me, one day you’ll hit the mark.

617
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,640
Come on, let’s keep training.

618
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,440
Banjong, I think…

619
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,520
Maybe we should call it a day.

620
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,840
We’ll pick it up again tomorrow.

621
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,600
Uh…

622
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,200
Come on, back to the quarters.

623
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,800
It’s dinner time.

624
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,800
Banjong.

625
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,360
Sorry.

626
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,480
I only set the table for two.

627
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,840
Didn’t save you a spot.

628
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,040
Banjong, dinner’s ready.

629
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,800
Come on, let’s eat.

630
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,080
You eat first.

631
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,400
I’m not hungry.

632
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,840
How can you not be?

633
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,040
You trained all day with swords and guns.

634
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,120
Hey, I made fermented fish dip,
your favorite.

635
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,720
If you don’t eat, I’ll be so upset.

636
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,800
What’s wrong?

637
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,120
You look like you just got dumped.

638
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,080
No, I didn’t.

639
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,960
Why the deep voice then?

640
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,760
I didn’t say you actually got dumped.

641
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,000
I just meant you look like someone who did.

642
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,560
Wait.

643
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,160
Did you really get dumped?

644
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,640
Come on, tell me.

645
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,320
I said no.

646
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,720
Stop pestering me.

647
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,320
That confirms it.

648
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,040
The way you’re yelling,
totally heartbroken.

649
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,400
Nah.

650
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,680
Worradej hasn’t rejected me yet.

651
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,280
So I’m not heartbroken.

652
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,920
You still haven’t given up on Worradej?

653
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,000
I don’t get what’s so special about him.

654
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,880
When you like someone,

655
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,480
it doesn’t matter.

656
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,120
Whether they’re good or not.

657
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,760
Like means like.

658
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,600
And I really like him.

659
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,480
- Stay out of it.
- I can’t.

660
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,640
I don’t want him as my sister-in-law.

661
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,640
I’ll pray day and night

662
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,720
that you get dumped by Worradej.

663
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,280
If I get dumped,

664
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,120
then you’ll get dumped too.

665
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,160
Because Worradej will choose Kosol.

666
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,360
What? No way.

667
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,120
Okay fine, I’ll change it.

668
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,720
I’ll pray that your wish comes true.

669
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,880
No, no!

670
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,240
I don’t want anyone to end up with Worradej.

671
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,640
If you want Kosol,

672
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,600
you need to help me get Worradej.

673
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,720
No way.

674
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,440
Forget it, I’ll pass.

675
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,200
Pandao

676
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,760
You have to help me.

677
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,280
There’s no other choice.

678
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,960
I order you right here, Banjong,

679
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,680
stay away from my Worradej forever.

680
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:59,000
Thunder cracks loud, fire of guns,

681
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,240
a raging war inside my chest.

682
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,440
Fighting with all my heart, two battles,

683
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,600
love and war colliding,

684
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,400
yet I fear nothing.

685
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,840
Could we really be together,

686
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,560
like in the verses of a poem?

687
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,200
The Count’s army is coming.

688
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,240
We have one hour to prepare.

689
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,920
Everyone, to your units and follow the plan.

690
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,520
When their troops arrive,

691
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,080
we’ll leave the gates open.

692
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,520
Lure them inside the city,

693
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,040
then it’ll be easier to strike.

694
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,040
Surrender now,

695
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,800
and I’ll spare your lives.

696
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,120
As for me,

697
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,960
I’ll take down the Count myself.

698
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,240
Banjong!

699
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,560
Banjong!

700
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,440
Would you dance with me?

701
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,360
With pleasure, my lord.

702
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,960
(They’re really practicing hard.)

703
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,200
(Perfect teamwork.)

704
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,440
You’re stars, kids.
(Keep it cool, kids.)

705
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,080
Cut!

706
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,360
So much sweat.
(All that energy.)

707
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,320
Get ready.

708
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,680
See? You’ll never forget it now.
(It’ll stick forever.)

709
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,000
Never forget.

710
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,200
(The Count’s body aches all over.)
