3
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,520
No one is in charge of

4
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,670
the spirit jade mines now.

5
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,680
Why don't we

6
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,280
let Lord Dongfang take over?

7
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,230
Yuan,

8
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,840
it's important.

9
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,790
We can take time to discuss it.

10
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,950
Lord Dongfang has assisted Uncle

11
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,040
in governing the mines for many years.

12
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,350
He's done a good job.

13
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,520
Besides,

14
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,310
he also worked for my father.

15
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:15,950
We should trust him.

16
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,840
I really trust Lord Dongfang, but...

17
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,680
Mother,

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,070
we're thinking

19
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,070
the same thing.

20
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,480
Your Majesty, Your Highness,

21
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,150
I'll be loyal and fulfill my duty.

22
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,070
Your Majesty,

23
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,400
we've taken over the spirit jade mines.

24
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,150
The cultivation of feather guards

25
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,510
has seen huge progress.

26
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,710
They're dying to fight for you

27
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,760
as soon as possible.

28
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,190
It's soon.

29
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,600
The sharp sword

30
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,640
are going out.

31
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,360
(Tapir monsters love this.)

32
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,360
(I can't wait to see them
tearing you apart.)

33
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,840
I've locked your spiritual power.

34
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,080
You can't escape anymore.

35
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,560
Lady, are you okay?

36
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,960
I'm okay.

37
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,590
(He...)

38
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,120
(Why is he so familiar?)

39
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,590
(I think I've seen him before.)

40
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,710
What's your name?

41
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,360
Meng Li.

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,960
Meng Li?

43
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,300
(Yinchen)

44
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,430
This is my name.

45
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,360
Yinchen?

46
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,710
Nice to meet you.

47
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,840
I've prepared a gift for you.

48
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,960
With the essence of tapir monsters,

49
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,310
you can enter anyone's dreams.

50
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,510
We're meant to meet each other.

51
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,040
I believe I'll see you again.

52
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,150
Meng Li.

53
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,190
Your Majesty,

54
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,480
why did you come here?

55
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,510
What about you?

56
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,870
I was...

57
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,800
homesick,

58
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,120
so

59
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,120
I wanted to take a walk.

60
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,920
I'm leaving.

61
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,560
You're lying.

62
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,070
(With the essence of tapir monsters,)

63
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,160
(you can enter anyone's dreams.)

64
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,830
She was the one
who murdered your father.

65
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,190
Beat her.

66
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,600
Beat her to death!

67
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,520
Mother!

68
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,430
I'll surprise her.

69
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,150
Sister.

70
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,190
I think

71
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,950
maybe we should just kill that witch.

72
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,240
She'll always be a threat.

73
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,390
What if someday,

74
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,600
Si Yuan finds out

75
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,680
that witch is her real mother?

76
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,270
I want He Lanjin to see
with her own eyes

77
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
how her son

78
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,000
calls me mother,

79
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,720
and how he

80
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,000
treats her like his enemy

81
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:37,070
and tortures her with whips.

82
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,480
That's right.

83
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,750
Even if he finds out,

84
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,800
so what?

85
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,240
We managed to kill the old Demon God.

86
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,560
Why should we fear an ignorant boy?

87
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,950
My son is still missing.

88
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,950
Si Yuan is useful now.

89
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,190
We can kill him

90
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,920
after my son is back.

all these years?

110
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,000
I was raised up by a tapir monster

111
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,390
at Woods of Void.

112

Yes.

Mother.

115

Your Majesty.

119
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,870
He's back.

120
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,000
Blessed by our ancestors,

121
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,360
I've finally found my son Yinchen

in this lifetime.

123

124

126
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,030

127
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,240
I owe you too much.

128
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,240
Mother, if you think you owe me,

129
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,030
can I ask for a gift
from you and my brother

130
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,720
on this blessed day

131
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,240
of family reunion?

132
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,240
Brother, just tell us.

00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,960

142
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,790
who attracted my brother's attention

143
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,960
in such a big Earthly Fiend Palace.

144
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,350
It's her.

145
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,670
She's just a normal deer monster.

146
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,550
If that's the case,

147
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,320
