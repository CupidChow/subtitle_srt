He...

4
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:19,640
How's that possible?

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,190
Nangong Henshui

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,030
was the one who killed my people!

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,510
Sorry, Shang You.

8
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,510
Back then, I lost my mind
and believed him.

9
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,600
I tried to use your blood
to restore my broken spiritual roots.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,200
I was also the one
who found the traces of Si Yuan

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,750
and tried to blame it on the demons,

12
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,150
but I didn't expect
I'd do Nangong Henshui a favor.

13
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,430
However, that's also

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,320
why we could ruin his plan.

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,750
All the images we saw
in the Reminiscence Mirror

16
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,200
were also Nangong Henshui's magic.

17
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,310
What's she doing?

18
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,960
Shang You!

19
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,030
It was I...

20
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,400
It was I who killed my dad.

21
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,960
It's my fault.

22
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,360
I killed my people!

23
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,200
Shang You.

24
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,470
It's not

25
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,840
your fault.

26
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,750
He did all this

27
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,470
to refine the three of us

28
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,960
and obtain the power
of the ancient Rakshasa Evil Deer.

29
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,310
Since Yin passed away,

30
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,590
I've realized I made huge mistakes.

31
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,560
Now I only want to save Yin.

32
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,150
Shang You,

33
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,550
Si Yuan,

34
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,470
Nangong Henshui has committed
unforgivable sins.

35
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,470
We cannot let him get away with this.

36
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,520
Nangong Henshui.

37
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,360
I trusted you with all my heart,

38
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,430
but you've deceived me again and again.

39
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,750
Tonight, I'm going to refine all of you

40
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,960
and sacrifice you to the Rakshasa

41
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,840
to gain the greatest power
in the world!

42
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,270
Yin Chen!

43
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,590

45
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,360
I can finally reunite with you...
