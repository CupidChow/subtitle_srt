00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,340
=Beloved of A Lifetime=

2
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,900
=Episode 25=

3
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,840
Shang You.

4
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,560
It's been so many days.

5
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,000
You still won't talk to me.

6
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,070
Immortals and demons

7
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,070
are destined to be enemies.

8
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,350
Let me go,

9
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,400
and we'll

10
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,590
be even.

11
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,350
We're all born equal.

12
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,480
Maybe we have different backgrounds,

13
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,590
but if a demon can love someone

14
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:36,910
and be kind,

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,120
the demon

16
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,560
can become a god with one thought.

17
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,590
However, if a god has no love

18
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,310
and is controlled by evil thoughts,

19
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,510
the god can also

20
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,310
become a demon overnight.

21
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,870
I know you don't believe me.

22
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,350
You hate me

23
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,630
and blame me,

24
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,560
but the only way I can think of

25
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,000
to protect you

26
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,240
is to keep you here
in the Earthly Fiend Palace.

27
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,710
Protect me?

28
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,960
That night,

29
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,630
when I tried to save you
with the Skull Spring's heart,

30
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,360
I saw us in ancient times.

31
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,560
How's that possible?

32
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,560
How could it be?

33
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,470
Your Majesty.

34
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,000
The dark vines...

35
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,870
It's okay.

36
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,200
Go ahead.

37
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,030
I've dug into

38
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,910
the issue of dark vines

39
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,800
and found that Nangong Henshui

40
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,080
has something to do with Baili Xuxue.

41
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,360
Apart from Baili Hong,

42
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,630
Baili Xuxue has another younger sister

43
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,120
who were expelled from their family.

44
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,470
Her name is Baili Qinghuan.

45
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,630
She and Nangong Henshui
once fell in love with each other,

46
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,990
but their relationship was opposed
by both the immortals and the demons.

47
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:07,990
In the end,

48
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,030
Baili Qinghuan died with resentment.

49
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,840
Sister, we really love each other.

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,240
Please have mercy on us!

51
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,950
You're the second heiress
of the Baili Family.

52
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,000
How dare you hook up with
a Yuxu Sect's disciple?

53
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,390
You're so shameless!

54
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,310
Demons and immortals are enemies.

55
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,630
You can never be together!

56
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,830
Okay, sister, I'll come back with you,

57
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,160
but please...

58
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,310
please let him go!

59
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,430
I'm begging you!

60
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,720
- Take Qinghuan back.
- Please!

61
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,070
Sister, please!

62
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,430
Sister!

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,360
Please!

64
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,600
Henshui...

65
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,590
What happened?

66
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,440
Your essence...

67
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,830
Who destory it?

68
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,560
Baili Xuxue?

69
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,310
My sister has let me go.

70
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,870
I was expelled from my family.

71
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,390
We can finally be together.

72
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,710
Qinghuan!

73
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,910
Qinghuan!

74
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,830
Qinghuan!

75
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,600
Nangong Henshui

76
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,920
set me up and trapped me in the woods.

77
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,480
That's why you met me.

78
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,870
He was also the one who told you

79
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,240
only my amber heart

80
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,950
could bring your people back.

81
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,070
But now...

82
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,360
I'll collect the remnants
of their souls,

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,510
but you must get the Amber Heart

84
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,000
so that I can use ancient magic

85
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,600
to bring your people back.

86
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,390
Don't you think it's

87
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,510
far too coincidental?

88
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,480
He's behind

89
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,680
everything we've been through.

90
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,160
He only wants

91
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,830
to use you.

92
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,790
No way.

93
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,510
It's impossible.

94
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,190
Master has been so kind to me.

95
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,800
How could he lie to me?

96
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,350
No...

97
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,400
Shang You,

98
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,830
I know you can't accept it immediately,

99
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,110
but

100
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,750
I can wait.

101
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,150
Yin.

102
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,960
You're awake.

103
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,560
Ziheng,

104
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,190
don't ever believe Nangong Henshui.

105
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,230
The other day,

106
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,800
I heard him tell
the ancient Rakshasa's talisman...

107
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:59,270
After the ancient God of War Cang Li
killed the Evil Deer,

108
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,070
its soul of love entered Cang Li's body

109
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,720
and integrated with his heart

110
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,800
while the other two remnants of its soul
were scattered throughout the world.

111
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,360
The soul of kindness
turned into Shang You,

112
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,600
and the soul of evilness
turned into Jiang Ziheng.

113
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,920
After that, Cang Li became Si Yuan
in this lifetime.

114
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,160
Now we've got Si Yuan's amber heart.

115
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,040
We only need to refine
Shang You and Yin Chen's essence

116
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,720
to complete the process

117
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,630
and obtain the greatest power
in the world.

118
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,750
I've planned this for so many years.

119
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,360
It's all worth it.

120
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,240
I stole Yin Chen from the demons
and raised him.

121
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,600
I tried everything
to release the evil inside him.

122
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,950
Neither Shang You nor Yin Chen

123
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,750
can escape.

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,270
You must set up a formation
in the Yuxu Sect

125
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,310
and transfer resentments to me

126
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,360
when I refine them.

127
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,270
I'm going to send them

128
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,120
to Soul-catching Umbrella
to experience countless reincarnations

129
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,680
and eventually refine them to get
the soul remnants of the Evil Deer.

130
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,630
(The ancient Rakshasa is so powerful.)

131
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,070
(If I can get its power,)

132
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,040
(I'll be able to)

133
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,630
(rule the three realms)

134
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,240
(one day.)

135
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,270
Ziheng.

136
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,440
Master.

137
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,040
Since you've already found out,

138
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,360
I have no choice

139
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,040
but to accelerate the timeline.

140
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,670
Go!

141
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,240
I can't believe you burned

142
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,440
your spiritual energy for a man.

143
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,030
Go to hell!

144
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,200
Shang You!

145
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,230
It's me.

146
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,630
Si Yuan?

147
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,200
Calm down.

148
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,480
Anyway,

149
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,910
Nangong Henshui

150
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,960
is not as simple as he seems to be.

151
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,270
Maybe it's all a coincidence.

152
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,870
It's not a coincidence.

153
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,790
It's always been his plan.

154
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,440
Qinghuan...

155
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,390
The immortals wouldn't keep us.

156
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,870
The demons abandoned you and killed you.

157
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,150
I know

158
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,320
the Soul-catching Umbrella

159
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,440
lied about bringing you back.

160
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,080
Immortals and demons have been enemies
since ancient times.

161
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,270
You destroyed your cultivation
and left the demons

162
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,840
only to be with me.

163
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,320
Qinghuan!

164
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,870
Qinghuan!

165
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,840
Master, please save Qinghuan!

166
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,200
Master!

167
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,150
Please save Qinghuan!

168
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,720
I had high expectations for you

169
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,270
and believed you'd be
a perfect head in the future.

170
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,510
I've trained you with all my heart.

171
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,600
However, I never expected

172
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,200
that you'd be fooled by a demon!

173
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,440
Please save her!

174
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm willing to die in her stead!

175
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,270
All demons

176
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,550
are evil.

177
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,000
She deserves to go to hell!

178
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,600
Just leave.

179
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,510
Master wouldn't save her.

180
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,150
I was desperate.

181
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,270
She did this to herself.

182
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,600
Then I met the ancient evil spirit
by chance

183
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,600
and found out many secrets
about the ancient Rakshasa Evil Deer.

184
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,550
Do you want revenge?

185
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,670
I can help you.

186
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,080
I cooperated with the evil spirit

187
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,510
to acquire the power to avenge you.

188
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,510
With the help of the evil spirit,

189
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,320
I found the Evil Deer's reincarnation,

190
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,270
which is the second heir of the demons.

191
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,200
I took the chance to steal him,

192
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,600
and named him Jiang Ziheng

193
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,650
as my disciple.

194
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:22,490
♪Needless to say,
I still regret the mistakes I made♪

195
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,420
♪Talking to the moon♪

196
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,910
Then

197
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,240
I found the holy spirits' saint
Shang You,

198
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,360
the person
with the Evil Deer's soul of kindness.

199
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,200
My wife!

200
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,280
My love!

201
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,320
My love!

202
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,960
I also took her as my disciple

203
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,600
and started to implement my plan
step by step.

204
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,630
This kid was born with anomalies.

205
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,320
I'm afraid she'll bring disaster.

206
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,840
When she's grown up,

207
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,510
she can join the Yuxu Sect,

208
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,960
and I'll teach her mind spells

209
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,240
to protect her.

210
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,320
Thank you, Master Nangong.

211
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,440
One of my disciples

212
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,240
is born with the fate of jade,

213
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,370
which symbolizes the lucky star.

214
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,270
If they get married one day,

215
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,720
maybe he can

216
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,360
bring luck to her.

217
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,350
What's

218
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,550
your opinion?

219
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,150
Thanks, Master Nangong.

220
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,870
Don't worry.

221
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,030
I'll get the power

222
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,840
to change the rules of the world.

223
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,320
I'm going to send

224
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,910
everyone to hell for you!

225
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,510
He... How's that possible?

226
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,960
Nangong Henshui

227
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,080
