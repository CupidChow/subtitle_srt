=Episode 1=

3
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,670
(I'm Shang You.
I used to be the Holy Spirit Saint.)

4
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,320
(However, I was set up)

5
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,600
(by my sect's elder sister
before my wedding)

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,710
(and ended up like this.)

7
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,680
Sister,

8
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,790
why are you here?

9
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,320
You just drank Spirit Deprival Water.

10
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,640
As a result,

11
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,430
you'll lose your spiritual power
in the next hour.

12
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,280
If you're insulted by some hooligans

13
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:01,790
and lose your virginity,

14
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:02,960
do you think

15
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,920
- Brother Ziheng will still marry you?
- You can't go anywhere.

16
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,040
(On that day,)

17
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,920
(I met him)

18
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,070
(under the cliffs.)

19
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,950
(What is going on?)

20
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,230
(Why am I lying on a man's chest?)

21
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,520
(This man)

22
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,630
(is so pretty.)

23
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,310
Who are you?

24
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,710
(I can't believe he's blind.)

25
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,710
(What a pity.)

26
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,870
Shang You.

27
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,800
Dad,

28
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,030
I'm taking a bath.

29
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,190
I'll leave the wedding dress
at the door.

30
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,030
Okay.

31
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,080
How can you treat your savior like this?

32
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,710
I tried so hard

33
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,750
to drag you back.

34
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,590
Luckily, you're
in holy spirits' territory.

35
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,430
Holy spirits?

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,630
Don't move, blind young man.

37
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,360
Your eyes got hurt,

38
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,470
but I can fix you.

after my wedding.

57
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,430
Stay here

58
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,000
and don't go anywhere.

59
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,920

Your Majesty.

Bai Ze?

67
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,430
I received your message

68
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,360
and came here immediately.

69
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,200
Your eyes...

70
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,190
Let's go back first.

71
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,710
Okay.

72
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,360
In the presence of God,

73
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,000
we promise to stay together forever

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,480
till death do us part.

75
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,310
Ziheng,

76
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,190
from now on,

77
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,800
I'm your wife.

78
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,840
Yes.

79
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,040
From now on,

80
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,040
you're mine.

81
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,360
Why?

82
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,040
If you kill her now,

83
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,630
how can you explain it to others?

84
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,630
I wanted to kill her

85
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,000
after spending a few days with her.

86
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,160
I didn't expect

87
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,310
even God would help us.

88
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,800
The other day, I found her

89
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,120
save a person by accident,

90
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,310
and that person is a demon.

91
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,680
Now

92
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,160
there are demon scents in our territory.

93
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,630
Even if she's dead,

94
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,160
no one will suspect us.

95
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,190
Why do you have to marry Shang You?

96
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,390
I can't improve my cultivation
because my spiritual roots were damaged.

97
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,830
However,

98
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,160
I got into my master's
secret room by accident

99
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,600
and found that Shang You's blood

100
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,240
can heal all diseases
and restore everything.

101
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,240
If I refine her body,

102
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,120
I'll be able to restore my roots.

103
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,110
What's wrong?

104
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,720
Ziheng!

105
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,870
Wake up!

106
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,240
Ziheng!

107
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,920
Dad...

108
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,840
Dad!

109
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,240
Dad!

110
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,440
Dad!

111
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,200
Dad, wake up!

112
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,270
Dad!

113
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,910
Dad!

114
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Master.

115
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,040
Master,

116
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,080
What happened?

117
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,000
I don't know.

118
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,960
I think I had a dream.

119
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,240
I can't tell
whether it's fantasy or reality.

120
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,200
I woke up

121
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,510
only to see this.

122
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,200
I can feel the scents of demons.

123
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,320
Demons?

124
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,440
Demons

125
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,360
are brutal

126
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,510
and merciless.

127
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,270
(Demons,)

128
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,440
(I'll make you pay for this.)

129
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,260
Your Majesty,

130
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,480
all holy spirits were eliminated

131
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,840
somehow.

132
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,910
No one survived.

133
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,150
How has

134
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,670
the Queen Mother been doing lately?

135
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,120
Every time you come to Woods of Void,

136
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,840
no one knows your whereabouts.

137
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,360
She can't find out

138
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,510
about my mania.

139
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,510
Yes, Your Majesty.

140
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,200
This is my territory.

141
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,390
How dare you hunt my little monsters

142
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,600
without my permission?

143
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,120
(It's him.)

144
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,750
