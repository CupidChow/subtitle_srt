4
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,870
Did you take Xie Zhixun as your disciple

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,320
because he looked like that person?

6
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,870
No.

7
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,960
(Yinchen is also Jiang Ziheng.)

8
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,840

00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:10,710
what happened to my dad?

14
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,120
My Lady,

15
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,310
My Lord somehow lost

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,590
all his spiritual power

17
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:16,990
after he came back three years ago,

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,710
and a few days later, he...

19
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,790
Before he passed away, he said

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,510
his only wish was that you'd be happy,

21
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,840
and please don't feel guilty.

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,920
How's that possible?

23
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,150
How's that possible?

24
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,350

I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

29
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,200
I've lost everything!

30
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,120
Dad!

31
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,680
What should I do?

32
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,710
Dad!

33
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,350

please come home with me.

38
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,870
Sorry.

39
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,400
You're still thinking about her.

40
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,120
After everything she's done to you,

41
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,800
are you really going to see her again?

42
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,520
I want an answer.

43
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,280
I want to get my heart back.

44
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,550
So,

45
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,680
in your eyes,

46
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,800
no one

47
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,470
and nothing

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,560
can compare to her, right?

49
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,310
It's all because of you.

50
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,470
It's all because of you!

51
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,840
It's your fault!

52
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,840
It's your fault!

53
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,080
All traitors

54
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,910
must die!

55
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,720
Master, good morning.

56
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,600
From now on, you don't need
to greet me.

57
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,440
As my disciple, you don't have to
abide by the rules.

58
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,950
You're a beginner.

59
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,720

Recently,

75

many disciples have gone missing.

76
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,240
Look into it.

77
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,470
Be careful.

78
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,270
Don't let anyone find out.

79
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,880
Stop.

I'm Jiang Ziheng.

Are you Ziheng?

86
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,550
What happened to your face?

87
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,670
I've been looking for you
over the past few years.

88
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,510
I'm so glad to see you here.

89
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,390
Did you kill the disciples?

90
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,630
I was imprisoned for many years

91
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,960
and broke my spiritual roots
when I tried to escape.

92
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,000
I had no choice but to absorb
the spiritual power of our disciples.

93
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,080
Yin,

94
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,120
I'm sorry for your suffering.

95
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,550
When Master took you away,

96
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,870
I was afraid that he might hurt you,

97
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,090
so I've been looking for you secretly.

98
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,840
I'm so glad

99
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,390
that you're back.

100
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,480
It's him...

101
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,510
It's Master...

102
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,200
Yin, calm down.

103
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,200
It was he who did this to me!

104
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,280
Yin.

105
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,280
Don't be sacred.

106
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,320
You've got me.

107
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,360
Yin, don't worry.

108
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,840
I'll never leave you again.

109

Ziheng,

110
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,670
why do you look different now?

111
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,840
I tried to look for you

112
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,120
but was set up by Master.

113
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,460
I had no choice

114
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,270
but to absorb
the new disciple Yinchen's face

115
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,080
and impersonate him

116
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,180
to keep looking for you.

117
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,230
By the way,

118
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,550
keep an eye on Master

119
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,510
and figure out

120
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,630
what secret he's been hiding.

121
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,600
When I find the truth,

122
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,720
I'll definitely avenge you.
