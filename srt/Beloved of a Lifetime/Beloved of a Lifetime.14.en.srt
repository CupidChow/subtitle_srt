Mother, why did you
put Yinchen in prison?

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,440
I wanted to have mercy on him,

5
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,160
but he concealed his identity.

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,000
He must be up to something.

7
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,640
In the forbidden area,
Her Highness and I heard

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,600
that His Highness
didn't grow up in the Woods of Void

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,560
but was raised by Nangong Henshui,

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,200
the head of Yuxu Sect.

11
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,710
Yinchen deliberately tried
to become one of us.

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,390
He must've wanted something from us.

13
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,200
Now he's locked up.
We'll figure out the next step.

17
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:02,870
Yinchen.

18
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,120
From what I know of Si Yuan,

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,000
he'll definitely figure out who you are.

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,710
The longer you stay,
the more dangerous you are.

21
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,310
You have to leave the North Land

22
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,510
before he finds out the truth.

23
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,400
His birthday will come in six days.

24
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,350
They will let their guard down,

25
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,400
and I'll help you escape.

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,480
No.

27
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,480
It's too dangerous.

28
