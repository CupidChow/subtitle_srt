Lady Shancha's carriage

was robbed on the way here.

Dear sister,

59
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,150
you abandoned me,

60
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,430
so I won't let you

61
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,470
get what you want.

62
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,000
Yuan... Yuan.

00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,040
I'm your uncle.

64
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,630
I'm your uncle.

65
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,630
You're not.

66
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,630
You never were.

67
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,070
Don't come over.

68
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,510
Don't come over!

69
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,830
Don't come.

70
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,240
Stay away.

71
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,120
My sweetheart.

72
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,390
I'm sorry!

73
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,560
I'm dirty.

74
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,830
Don't touch me!

75
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,760
Don't touch me!

76
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,000
(I already knew)

77
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,390
(for Queen Mother,)

78
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,750
(Shancha is a tool)

79
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,430
(to control me and spy on His Majesty.)

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,270
(If I hadn't agreed to this marriage,)

81
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,870
(Shancha wouldn't have
ended up like this!)

82
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,160
Idiot!

83
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,430
He ruined my plans again and again.

84
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,190
He deserves to die!

85
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,150
Your Highness,

86
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,480
we've got news

87
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,360
from His Highness.

88
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,190
What happened to Ziheng?

89
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,120
You don't know?

90
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,240
He's disfigured.

91
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,040
His spiritual roots were damaged,

92
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,390
and he couldn't make a breakthrough.

93
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,800
Now he's like this.

94
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,310
What a pity.

95
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,080
Brother.

96
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,720
This is

97
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,160
a demon mark.

98
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,270
How's that possible?

99
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,270
Ziheng.

100
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,110
Ziheng.

101
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,030
Get out!

102
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,950
Get out!

103
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,560
Ziheng, what's wrong?

104
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,400
Get out.

105
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,600
What happened?

106
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,630
Are you okay?

107
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:42,790
Get out!

108
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,430
Get out!

109
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,720
Are you...

110
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,310
Master.

111
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,600
You can't let anyone know

112
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,240
that you're a demon.

113
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:05,910
Master.

114
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,040
I'm not a demon.

115
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,880
I'm not!

116
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,310
It's all fake, right?

117
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,270
I knew you were an abandoned demon

118
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,310
when I found you in the wild,

119
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,630
so I used secret magic to eliminate

120
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,040
your demon scent

121
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,680
and brought you back to Yuxu Sect.

122
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,600
Then I found out

123
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,600
the second heir of the demons
went missing

124
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,630
shortly after he was born.

125
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,070
I think

126
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,120
maybe you're

127
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,680
the missing heir.

128
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,120
You were born
with broken spiritual roots.

129
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,670
It'd be hard for you to survive

130
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,080
because demons only respect power,

131
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,030
let alone the demon royals.

132
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,080
Do you mean

133
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,630
I was abandoned

134
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,240
because of my broken roots?

135
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,200
It's in the past. Just move on.

136
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,720
Anyway,

137
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,480
I've always

138
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,080
treated you

139
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,840
like my own son.

140
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,630
Master.

141
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,910
I'll control Yin first.

142
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,270
Rest early.

143
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,440
Your Highness.

144
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,870
Lord Feng,

145
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,670
are you really going to
cancel the marriage?

146
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,790
Everyone knows

147
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,360
what happened to Shancha.

148
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,080
Even if they get married,

149
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,670
she'll be a disgrace to His Majesty.

150
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,200
The Feng family

151
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,320
is not destined for the blessing.

152
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,150
Shancha has been crying

153
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,120
since she was insulted.

154
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,120
Your Highness,

155
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,910
Shancha is so miserable.

156
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,630
Please have mercy.

157
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,960
To be honest, it was

158
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,510
the Baili family's monster

159
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,670
who ruined Shancha.

160
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,600
It's all our fault.

161
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,840
In that case,

162
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,270
we'll cancel the marriage.

163
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,750
Thanks, Your Highness.

164
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,440
Lord Feng canceled the marriage.

165
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,790
Mother asked me

166
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,630
to visit

167
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,790
Lord Feng tonight

168
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,960
and soothe his sorrow.

169
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,240
Right now,

170
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,550
the Queen Mother has not only failed

171
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,600
but offened Lord Feng

172
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,910
because of Baili Hong.

173
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,720
She must be afraid of
becoming the Fengs' enemy,

174
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,390
so she asked you

175
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,720
to apologize.

176
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,910
Unfortunately,

177
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,240
Shancha

178
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,000
is the only victim.

179
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,510
By the way,

180
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,360
the red moon will come out tonight.

181
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,630
Let me

182
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,080
go with you, Your Majesty.

183
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,470
Okay.

184
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,800
Your Majesty.

185
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,000
Lord Feng,

186
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,960
you don't have to do this.

187
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,480
Thanks, Your Majesty.

188
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Can I visit Shancha?

189
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,280
Yes.

190
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,280
Your Majesty!

191
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,910
Your Majesty, are you okay?

192
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,920
Your Majesty!

193
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,270
Zicheng.

194
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,150
Come to my room at 9:00 p.m.

195
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,280
Brother.

196
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,600
It's late. What's the matter?

197
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,200
I do have something

198
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,390
to tell you.

199
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,510
I want to borrow

200
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,150
something from you.

201
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,550
Jiang Ziheng!

202
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,350
Master!

203
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,030
How could you do something like that?

204
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,870
Master!

205
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,510
Master!

206
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,200
Please forgive me this time.

207
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,550
I'm so sorry!

208
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,550
If you can't forgive me,

209
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,510
I can only cleanse my sins with death.

210
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,360
Ziheng.

211
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,790
(Ziheng swapped faces with Yinchen,)

212
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,510
(but the evil deer's spirit
is still inside him.)

213
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,320
(I need to speed things up.)

214
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,840
(Yinchen is just a new disciple.)

215
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,630
(Only a few people know him.)

216
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,670
(Maybe I can let Ziheng)

217
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,000
(work for me with Yinchen's identity.)

218
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,080
Since you've got Yinchen's face,

219
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,480
you can use your new identity

220
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,670
to face the demons

221
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,960
and contribute to holy spirits.

222
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,030
Assist Shang You

223
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,480
in getting the amber heart.

224
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,030
Thanks, Master.

225
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,030
I will fulfill my mission.
