=Episode 4=

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,030
Have you made up your mind?

4
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,560
I want

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,560
to make a deal with you, Your Majesty.

6
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,600
We sliver deer monsters

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,920
are weak

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,710
and are always bullied by others.

9
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,070
All my people

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,840
and friends

11
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,670
are gone.

12
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,110
I want the murderers

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,390
to pay for this.

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,320
I need your power, Your Majesty.

15
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,670
Are you telling the truth?

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,200
Absolutely.

17
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,840
Puppet Wood Spell?

18
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,280
Your Majesty, you're just as suspicious

19
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,920
as Queen Mother.

20
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,150
I can't believe

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,040
you made me your puppet wood

22
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,680
to take the pain for you.

23
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,070
You're a smart prey.

24
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,870
You're useful

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,150
to me.

26
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,560
I can cooperate with you.

27
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,400
However,

28
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,640
I didn't, I don't,

29
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,430
and I'll never

30
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,070
trust

31
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,480
you.

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,680
Your Majesty, it's my honor

33
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,150
to be your ally.

34
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,920
Your Majesty,

35
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,640
Meng Li's heart

36
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,790
will always stay loyal to you,

37
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,150
regardless of

38
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,950
time.

39
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,280
Siyuan,

40
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,150
I found a golden lingzhi for you.

41
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,590
It's good for your disease.

42
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,240
I'll ask them to make soup

43
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,080
and send it to you later.

44
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,470
Shancha, thank you.

45
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,590
What's

46
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,150
going on?

47
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,630
A little monster.

48
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,430
She's always lying,

49
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,960
so I'm teaching her a lesson.

50
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,710
You must've been too mean

51
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,080
and freaked her out.

52
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,190
She's so miserable.

53
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,710
Please set her free.

54
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,470
She's not as innocent as she seems.

55
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,000
However,

56
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,680
she's told me the truth.

57
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,750
I'll forgive her.

58
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,240
Remember,

59
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,520
don't lie to me again.

60
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,080
Lady,

61
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,310
are you okay?

62
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,360
Have a seat.

63
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,840
Shancha, what brings you

64
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,150
here?

65
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,630
You have beautiful hands.

66
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,680
There can't be scars.

67
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,680
It might hurt a little.

68
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,080
Bear with it.

69
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,000
Thanks, Shancha.

70
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,560
Not a big deal.

71
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,190
By the way, what's your name?

72
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,680
Meng Li.

73
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,640
Don't move.

74
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,800
What's wrong,

75
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,800
Meng Li?

76
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,360
Nothing.

77
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,070
You're so kind,

78
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,360
so I think

79
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,000
His Majesty and you

80
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,510
will be a good couple.

81
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,000
Well...

82
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,510
Get some rest.

83
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,560
I'm leaving.

84
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,430
(If Si Yuan falls in love with
Feng Shancha,)

85
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,760
(he'll also)

86
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,600
(form an amber heart.)

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,680
Si Yuan and Feng Shancha
are close to each other.

88
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,120
Will he fall for her sooner than for me?

89
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,120
Dad...

90
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,480

From now on,

92
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,750

(Yuxu Sect)

118
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,630
(Over the past few days,)

119
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,270
(I've almost healed Ziheng.)

120
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,360
(However, the wound on his face)

121
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,680
(was infected by evil deer's spirit)

122
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,600
(and cannot recover.)

123
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,390
What exactly happened?

124
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,190
On that day...

125
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,270
I can't remember anything.

126
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,480
I only know

127
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,870
I saw some demons.

128
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,880
(It seems)

129
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,950
(his soul was damaged,)

130
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,680
(and he lost his memory.)

131
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,240
That's what I expected.

132
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,830
Rest well.

133
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,440
Okay.

134
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,680
Ziheng,

135
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,520
you're awake.

136
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,480
Shang You...

137
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,310
You never
went to holy spirits' territory

138
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,680
or saw anything.

139
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,470
Your Majesty,

140
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,600
Her Highness asked you
to marry Feng Shanchan

141
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,240
because she wanted
to use her to control you.

142
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,630
Shall we...?

143
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,360
It's not a good time.

144
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,150
I have a plan.

145
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,480
Your Majesty,
Her Highness asked you to come.

146
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,710
I got it.

147
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,920
Mother.

148
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,800

149
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,750
How are you feeling?

150
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,870
Shancha brought me some herbs.

151
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,390
I'm feeling

152
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,630
much better now.

153
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,630
By the way,

154
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,600
you two have grown up together.

155
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,550
I talked to Lord Feng.

156
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,750
You'll marry Shancha

157
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,910
at the beginning of next month.

158
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,750
Yes.

159
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,280
Mother,

160
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,080
it's up to you.

161
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,750
Come on.

162
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,870
Let's visit that person.

163
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,240
Yuan is getting married,

164
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,670
so we're here to visit you.

165
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,000
If it weren't for you,

166
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,270
his father

167
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,480
would be able to attend his wedding.

168
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,720
Is this monster crazy?

169
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,630
He's hurting himself again.

170
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,320
Why are you here?

171
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,320
Your Majesty, did you forget

172
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,910
I'm your puppet wood?

173
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,840
You hurt,

174
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,960
I hurt.

175
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,150
If anyone else

176
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,840
finds out about this,

177
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,670
I'll burn you to ashes.

178
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,150
We're allies now.

179
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,840
How can I tell your secret

180
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,000
to others?

181
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,720
Your Majesty,
you don't have to believe me,

182
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,030
but I will

183
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,150
eliminate anyone

184
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,080
who gets in your way.

185
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,630
If it's a buddha,

186
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,510
I'll slay the buddha.

187
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,840
If it's a demon,

188
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,200
I'll slaughter the demon.

189
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,720
Now,

190
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,030
I'm starting to wonder

191
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,000
what else you've got,

192
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,080
