=Episode 13=

3
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,350
Why are you here?

4
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,070
I remember the first time I met you,

5
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:45,920
you were

6
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,070
tormented by him.

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,320
And now,

8
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,240
it's happening all over again.

9
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,070
You didn't come at this hour

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,920
to just make fun of me, did you?

11
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,280
I just want to see

12
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,880
if my heart

13
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,310
will feel sympathy for you again.

14
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,680
I want to know

15
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,400
if I will pity you and save you again

16
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,000
when I see you

17
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,480
suffer like this.

18
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,760
After all you've done,

19
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,350
you've already had an answer,
haven't you?

20
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,790
Yes.

21
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,680
I've done a lot of things...

22
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:38,280
to make Si Yuan torture you.

23
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,790
I saved you

24
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:41,870
but ruined myself.

25
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,310
I grew up with Si Yuan,

26
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,000
but you

27
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,000
took all his love away from me!

28
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,790
So,

29
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,150
it was you who poisoned Her Highness.

30
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,840
You set me up.

31
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,350
Her Highness

32
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,480
wasn't poisoned by Kirin's venom, right?

33
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,280
You're smart.

34
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,800
It was a specially made poison

35
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,870
that is very similar to Kirin's venom.

36
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,080
You really worked hard

37
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,710
to set me up.

38
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,680
Of course I did.

39
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,680
If I hadn't saved you,
I wouldn't have ended up like this.

40
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,310
So, it's time to end this.

41
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,470
It's over!

42
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,150
Shancha.

43
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,750
It was you.

44
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,240
You finally found out.

45
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,960
Wake up.

46
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't want to see you
making more mistakes.

47
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,190
Turn back.

48
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,200
Turn back?

49
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,240
Are you asking me to turn back?

50
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,710
Did you see it?

51
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,150
Look at my face!

52
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,280
I was insulted by Baili Hong

53
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,520
and couldn't marry you.

54
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,800
My face...

55
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,000
My face has been destroyed.

56
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,190
I'll live in pain
for the rest of my life.

57
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,630
Turn back? How can I turn back?

58
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,910
All your suffering

59
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,870
was because of me.

60
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,680
It has nothing to do with Meng Li.

61
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,470
Do you think I don't want to kill you?

62
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,280
Do you think I don't want to kill you?

63
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,240
But your Si Yuan.

64
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,630
If she's innocent...

65
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,120
what about me?

66
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,430
Am I guilty?

67
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,360
Am I wrong?

68
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,830
You asked me to have mercy on her,

69
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,160
but who will have mercy on me?

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,950
You...

71
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,120
Your essence is still there.

72
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,560
I know you didn't poison my mother.

73
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,870
We need to put on a show together.

74
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,510
I won't tell my mother

75
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,680
that you poisoned her.

76
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,830
I hope you can move on

77
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,000
and set yourself free.

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,840
Let's go.

79
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,360
No turning back.

80
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,000
There's no turning back.

81
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,800
No turning back...

82
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,270
It's all over...

83
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,590
Mother.

84
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,750
I've figured out who poisoned you.

85
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,680
Meng Li is innocent.

86
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,560
The real criminal
is Baili Xuxue's remaining supporter.

87
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,560
Do you think I will believe that?

88
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,000
Yuan,

89
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,430
that deer monster nearly killed me.

90
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,040
How can you let her go?

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,120
Mother,

92
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,990
please stop being prejudiced
against her.

93
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,680
I'm leaving.

94
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,560
How could you lie to me

95
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,950
for a deer monster?

96
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,600
You're back.

97
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,270
I heard what happened.

98
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,710
Are you okay?

99
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,160
I'm fine.

100
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,070
Si Yuan ascertained my innocence.

101
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,870
By the way, what did Master say?

102
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,360
Reminiscence Mirror?

103
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,870
Master asked me to give you this.

104
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,920
You'll get the answers
you've been looking for.

105
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,160
With a drop of your and Si Yuan's blood,

106
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,870
you'll be able to see

107
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,320
everything you've been through.

108

111
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,310

112
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,360
I saw in the North Land

113
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,070

Brother,

116
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,600
you should go back to your place.

119
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,710
you can't do this.

120
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,560
Get out.

121
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,270

Not dead.

192
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,390
Unfortunately,

193
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,030
I want more than this.

194
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,550
Who's Baili Qinghuan?

195
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,080
Where did you get this name?

196
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,960
Someone brought it up by chance.

197
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,910
Is that so?

198
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,480
In this world,

199
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,600
only one person would still

200
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,480
be obsessed with this name

201
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,200
and bring it up.

202
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,750
The person is

203
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,720
Nangong Henshui.

204
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,120
You didn't grow up in the Woods of Void.

205
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,390
Karma is real.

206
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,750
I never expected

207
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,840
that you'd

208
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,720
end up in Yuxu Sect

209
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,790
and being raised by Nangong Henshui.

210
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,750
Are you my master's old acquaintance?

211
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,720
It's much more than that.

212
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,040
Well,

213
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,670
do you want to know?

214
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,790
Help me get out of here,

215
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,510
and I'll tell you.

216
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:17,870
No need.

217
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,710
You...

218
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,270
In the presence of God,

219
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,750
we promise to stay together forever

220
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,320
till death do us part.

221
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,000
What did His Highness do?

222
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,360
Why is he locked up in the dungeon?

223
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,200
I heard it has something to do
with the immortals.

224
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,910
