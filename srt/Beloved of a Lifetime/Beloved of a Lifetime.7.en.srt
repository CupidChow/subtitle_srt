=Episode 7=

3
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,190
Kings are really heartless.

4
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,480
How could you send me

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,120
to someone else like that?

6
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,320
When did he fall for you?

7
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,240
A few days ago,

8
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,280
I was dragged by someone

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,200
and thrown into Woods of Void.

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,640
I was attacked,

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,150
and he saved me.

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,470
What a silver deer monster.

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,350
You're so good at seducing men.

14
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,470
It's not my fault.

15
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,070
I'm wondering

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,600
who'd set me up.

17
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,600
It's Feng Shancha.

18
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,840
It turns out

19
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,760
I was paying the debt of love

20
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,510
for you, Your Majesty.

21
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,870
- You...
- Forget it.

22
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,040
Your Majesty, don't feel guilty.

23
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,200
After all, I'm just
an insignificant little monster.

24
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,350
Your Majesty, you can sell me

25
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,150
to anyone you want.

26
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,400
However,

27
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,590
at least

28
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,760
I'll marry the second heir
of the demons.

29
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,510
It doesn't seem

30
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,350
to be a bad deal.

31
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,310
If one day,

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,120
you regret it

33
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,350
and don't want me to marry him,

34
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,480
then

35
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,870
I won't marry him.

36
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,630
Back then,
I took you to the Woods of Void

37
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,080
to find a way to repair
your spiritual roots,

38
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,000
but you were kidnapped by a bad guy.

39
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,520
After that, you went missing
for so many years

40
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,910
and suffered a lot.

41
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,080
This is a high-security palace.

42
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,240
Who could kidnap me secretly
without being noticed?

43
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,280
I've investigated it for many years

44
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,280
but haven't found any clues.

45
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,430
(I was you who abandoned me
because of my broken roots.)

46
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,190
(How can you pretend
that you care about me?)

47
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,310
God blessed me.

48
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,960
I finally found my home,
and now I can take care of you.

49
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,710
I assume my brother has been busy

50
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,520
fulfilling his duties to the demons

51
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,870
and doesn't have much time for you.

52
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,680
Therefore, I'm supposed
to take care of you

53
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,400
and

54
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,710
always put you first, Mother.

55
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,750
(I made Si Yuan the Demon God)

56
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,190
(because my son was missing.)

57
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,470
(Now)

58
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,360
(my son Chen)

59
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,520
(is back.)

60
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,240
Si Yuan can feel love now,

61
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,800
but it's far from enough

62
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,190
to form the amber heart.

63
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,630
And Yin Chen suddenly showed up.

64
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,910
I can only take one step at a time.

65
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,800
No need.

66
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,000
Like I said, we're meant
to meet each other.

67
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:06,990
See?

68
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,400
We're

69
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,000
already engaged.

70
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,470
This is the snow plum blossom

71
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,710
that only blooms
once in a hundred years.

72
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,950
It's good for one's health and beauty.

73
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,000
Take this.

74
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,390
This is too valuable.

75
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,870
I can't take it.

76
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,270
Nothing is too valuable

77
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,360
to send you.

78
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,560
Are you going to ask me
why I want to marry you?

79
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,560
It's because I like you.

80
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
Your Highness,

81
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,830
we've only just met.

82
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,630
When it comes to love,

83
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,890
if two people are meant to be together,

84
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,160
they'll know at first sight.

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,840
If not,

86
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,270
no matter how many times they meet,

87
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,600
it won't work.

88
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,120
Your Highness,

89
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,600
I have something to do. Goodbye.

90
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,630
What's wrong, Bai Ze?

91
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,470
Meng Li,

92
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,000
His Majesty said

93
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,800
he didn't want to see you.

94
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,140
(Meng Li)

95
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,960
Your Majesty.

96
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,630
Meng Li has left.

97
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,310
I didn't ask.

98
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,360
(What's wrong with me?)

99
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,510
Your Majesty, your pulse is stable

100
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,190
and normal.

101
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,720
Sometimes I felt

102
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,630
my heart racing,

103
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,720
but sometimes

104
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,480
I felt empty.

105
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,830
When did you feel your heart racing,

106
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,040
and when did you feel empty?

107
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,630
I want

108
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,830
one of your servants, brother.

109
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,630
I fell in love with her

110
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,950
the first time we met.

111
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,510
I can't remember.

112
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,040
I've been a doctor for many years

113
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,360
but never seen such a strange disease.

114
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:22,740
(Earthly Fiend Palace)

115
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,880
Your Majesty,

116
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,190
why have you been

117
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,560
hiding from me?

118
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,800
Ridiculous.

119
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,160
I'm the Demon God.

120
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,950
Why would I hide from you?

121
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,600
But you didn't want

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,270
to see me these days.

123
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,800
I was just busy with work.

124
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,080
By the way,

125
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,270
don't think too highly of yourself.

126
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,630
I have work to do.

127
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,760
Goodbye.

128
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,910
Your Majesty.

129
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,360
Let me come with you.

130
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,470
No need.

131
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,030
By the way,

132
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,950
you should wait for Yin Chen

133
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,830
to marry you.

134
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,070
Is he jealous?

135
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,630
Your Majesty!

136
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,910
It doesn't seem

137
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,840
to be a bad thing to marry Yin Chen.

138
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,320
He's making Si Yuan Jealous.

139
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,240
He'll learn how to love faster.

140
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,240
I can use that

141
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,750
to make him

142
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,120
fall in love with me

143
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,320
and form an amber heart sooner.

144
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,080
Meng Li, something happened.

145
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,150
His Majesty is missing.

146
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,360
Whoever trapped
by Heart Poison Formation

147
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,200
cannot use spiritual power.

148
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,720
Just give up.

149
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,270
