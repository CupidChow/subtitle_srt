3
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,710
Your Highness,

4
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,510
take care of yourself.

5
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,680
This deer monster

6
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,790
is a hoodoo!

7
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:10,680
But...

8
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,950
If you give her a hard time in public...

9
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,400
His Majesty will hold a grudge
against you.

10
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,310
Meng Li.

11
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,870
Sorry for what happened last time.

12
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,480
Her Highness wants to give you

13
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,710
an explanation.

14
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,760
Mother.

15
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,550
Yuan,

16
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,760
why did you come in such a hurry?

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,840
What are you...?

18
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,640
In the next few days,

19
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,560
Meng Li will stay
in Everlasting Peace Palace,

20
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,200
and I'll teach her the royal rules.

21
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,150
I'm not smart.

22
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm afraid I can't...

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,120
Since you know you're not smart,

24
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,840
you need to work harder.

25
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,080
Otherwise,

26
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,470
how can you take care of Yuan?

27
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,430
Yes,

28
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,470
Your Highness.

29
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,710
I invited Shancha

30
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,750
to our family dinner tonight.

31
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,310
Meng Li,

32
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,840
serve the wine for Shancha
and His Majesty.

33
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,310
How you forgotten

34
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,360

35
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,200
Your Highness,

36
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,680
isn't it inappropriate

37
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,000
to let Meng Li serve the wine?

38
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,960
Monsters

39
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,560
have always been humble servants.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,840
Thanks.

41
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,960
Let me do it.

42
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,190
It seems she needs

43
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,590
to learn the rules all over again.

44
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,680
Your Highness, thanks for teaching me.

45
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,430
Your Majesty.

46
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,400
You'll be a perfect couple.

47
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,630
I'll fill up the wine.

49
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,560

50
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,000
(You can get out of here)

51
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,870
(once you get his heart.)

52
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,680
Your Highness,
please take the medicine.

53
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,160

- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

57
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,630
Your Majesty, something's wrong.

58
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,600
Her Majesty is poisoned!

59
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,800
What's wrong with my mother?

60
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,870
Her Highness was poisoned by...

61
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,360
Kirin's venom.

62
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,310
Kirin's venom...

63

66
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,680
arrest her.

67
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,190
- Aye.
- Don't you dare!

68
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,000
Mother,

69
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,560
this must be a misunderstanding.

70
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,390
What misunderstanding?

71
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,950
The evidence is conclusive.

72
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,360
When will you stop defending her?

73
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,830
- But...
- Arrest her.

74
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,480
Arrest her!

75

be poisoned by Kirin's venom?)

Your Majesty, you don't believe me?

in the world.

Kirin's venom

81
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,390
has to be catalyzed
by a silver deer monster's essence

82
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,630
to become poisonous.

83
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,160
