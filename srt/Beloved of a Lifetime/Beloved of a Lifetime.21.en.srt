=Beloved of A Lifetime=

2
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,900
=Episode 21=

3
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,280
Your Majesty.

4
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,160
I heard something recently.

5
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,280
The imperial guard Xiao Xuanyi...

6
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,280
Xiao Xuanyi?

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,150
What's wrong with him?

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,430
He's got a false identity.

9
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,080
False identity?

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,410
How's that possible?

11
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,750
Your Majesty, please take a look.

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,560
According to our records,

13
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,430
he was born in Jiang City,
Yi Lin Province.

14
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,490
His family has run
the Xiao's Pharmacy for generations.

15
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,280
(Personnel Records)
A few years ago, a group of bandits

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,560
killed all his family.

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,750
I sent Zhuqi to Jiang City

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,920
and found

19
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,790
that his family did have a son

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,640
named Xiao Xuanyi,

21
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,640
but he died of a serious disease

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,790
when he was 13 years old.

23
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,350
Your Majesty,

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,870
a phony

25
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,280
has lurked around you.

26
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,840
Something must be wrong.

27
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,150
Your Majesty, please order the guards

28
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,310
to put him in the dungeon

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,710
and interrogate him.

30
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,960
I

31
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,200
will interrogate him myself.

32
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,680
Who are you?

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,040
I'm Xiao Xuanyi.

34
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,280
Your identity in our records

35
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,640
is fake.

36
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,430
The person you mentioned

37
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,430
died at the age of 13.

38
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,040
Your Majesty, you don't believe me?

39
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,280
The evidence is conclusive.

40
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,950
How can I believe you?

41
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,760
If you tell me the truth,

42
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,590
I'll spare your life.

43
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,870
Your Majesty,

44
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,910
I'm always my true self
when I'm with you.

45
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,750
Kill the monster!
Save the country!

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,590
Kill the monster!
Save the country!

47
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:35,190
Kill the monster!
Save the country!

48
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,120
Kill the monster!
Save the country!

49
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,280
Your Majesty, do you trust me?

50
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,800
I believe

51
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,240
you won't hurt me.

52
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,560
The ministers have misunderstood you.

53
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,910
I'll explain everything to them.

54
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,430
Your Majesty,

55
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:58,710
when I'm with you,

56
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,430
I'm always my true self.

57
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,750
(Are these all coincidences?)

58
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,470
Your Majesty,

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,470
Xiao Xuanyi's identity is still unclear.

60
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,240
Something must be wrong.

61
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,080
Someone must be behind this.

62
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,400
Lord Ziheng.

63
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,560
Do you

64
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,560
believe in

65
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,910
reincarnation?

66
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,080
Reincarnation?

67
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,750
If you'd owed someone
in the previous life,

68
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,960
when you had another life,

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,080
God

70
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,470
would send you to experience

71
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,470
that person's previous life.

72
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,270
Your Majesty,

73
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,910
I don't understand what it means,

74
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,470
but I think

75
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,190
the new reincarnation

76
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,310
means that everything should start over.

77
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,470
Your Majesty,

78
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,680
whether it's good or bad,

79
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,430
it's time to let go of the past.

80
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,240
Let go?

81
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,240
What if

82
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,920
I can't?

83
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,760
Your Majesty.

84
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,560
the jailer said

85
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,310
Xiao Xuanyi passed out.

86
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,030
What?

87
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,470
Your Majesty...

88
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,360
When didn't you tell the jailer

89
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,560
that you were not feeling well?

90
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,480
Your Majesty, you don't trust me.

91
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,560
I deserve to die.

92
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,480
Are you blaming me?

93
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,720
I wouldn't dare.

94
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,950
You even faked your identity.

95
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,800
Is there anything
you wouldn't dare to do?

96
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,590
Your Majesty...

97
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,430
I'm not Xiao Xuanyi
from Jiang City, Yi Lin Province.

98
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,560
I used to be an orphan without a name.

99
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,000
Later, I ended up

100
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,950
in Xiao's Pharmacy by chance.

101
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,800
Their son died young,

102
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,070
so they adopted me

103
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
and named me

104
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,870
Xiao Xuanyi.

105
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,950
Why didn't you tell me?

106
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,920
Because I wanted to bet.

107
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,960
What bet?

108
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,000
I wanted to bet that you

109
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,830
cared about me.

110
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,600
Come back

111
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,360
to Zichan Hall with me.

112
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,640
Your Majesty,

113
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,120
don't be fooled by Xiao Xuanyi!

114
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,190
I sent someone to Jiang City
to investigate it.

115
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,160
Xiao Xuanyi

116
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,510
didn't lie.

117
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,630
All his family was killed by bandits.

118
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,830
No one can testify for him!

119
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,670
Enough.

120
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,600
Lord Ziheng, please stop.

121
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,560
Your Majesty!

122
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,510
Lady Yin, Her Highness wants to see you.

123
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,920
Her Highness?

124
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,950
Where's Yin?

125
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,310
Her Highness wanted to see her.

126
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,790
Come on.

127
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,560
Let me teach you.

128
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,320
Like this.

129
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,640
Yin.

130
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,000
Lord Ziheng,

131
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,560
why are you so nervous?

132
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,070
I only invited Lady Yin

133
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,510
to spend some time with me.

134
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,510
What do you want?

135
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,510
I can give you

136
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,160
everything you've ever wanted.

137
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,560
Your Highness,

138
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,650
you wouldn't do anything
that doesn't benefit you, would you?

139
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,830
Her Majesty

140
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,680
doesn't value your talents.

141
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,720
Why are you still loyal to her?

142
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,270
Why don't you

143
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,630
work for me?

144
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,390
Your Highness,
please be careful what you say.

145
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,720
Lord Ziheng,

146
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,270
what's the point

147
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,480
of deceiving yourself?

148
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,390
Yin, let's go.

149
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,390
I have

150
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,360
the cure of Yin's disease.

151
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,240
What a loyal dog.

152
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,360
Jiang Wan,

153
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,790
Mother trusted you,

154
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,790
so does Lord Ziheng.

155
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,150
Fine.

156
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,200
Let's wait and see

157
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,240
who'll have the last laugh.

158
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,960
What... What's going on?

159
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,150
I don't know.

160
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,360
It seems

161
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,600
Jiang Wan has started to care about you.

162
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,790
That makes sense.

163
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,150
Who doesn't like

164
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,480
someone

165
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,150
with such a beautiful face?

166
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,600
It's about time.

167
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,510
Put this

168
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,120
into her medicine.

169
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,360
Are we really going to do this so soon?

170
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,320
Well,

171
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,270
you're not

172
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,120
worried about her, are you?

173
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,750
No way.

174
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,870
Good.

175
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,910
Don't forget

176
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,200
who killed your family

177
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,240
at the general's mansion.

178
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,240
I will kill

179
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,670
my enemy.

180
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,910
In the 16th year of Yaosheng's reign,

181
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,390
General Shen's army token was withdrawn
due to his rebellion.

182
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,390
He was imprisoned in his mansion,

183
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,510
and all his family hanged themselves
out of guilt.

184
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,030
All 58 people in the mansion

185
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,840
died.

186
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,870
Dad!

187
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,600
Dad!

188
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,270
Dad, don't leave me!

189
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,120
(I knew I was right.)

190
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,550
(In this lifetime,)

191
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,790
(Xiao Xuanyi experienced
my previous life,)

192
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
(and I'm his former position.)

193
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,720
