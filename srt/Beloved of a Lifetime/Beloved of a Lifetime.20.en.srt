00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,340
=Beloved of A Lifetime=

2
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,900
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,160
Lord Gao,

4
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,070
what do you think of Lord Ziheng?

5
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,800
He's the kindest person I've ever seen.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,070
He's not only loyal to you

7
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,840
but concerned about the people.

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,470
Last year, he even spent all his savings

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,280
repairing the Orphanage.

10
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,000
(In this life, Ziheng)

11
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,670
(is a completely different person.)

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,750
(The past is in the past.)

13
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,150
(Everything starts over.)

14
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,240
(Ziheng did all the bad things
in the previous life,)

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,400
(but)

16
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,200
(he's completely different now.)

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,710
(I can forget my hatred for Ziheng
in the last life,)

18
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,320
(but I can never forget)

19
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,280
(your love for me.)

20
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,280
The luckiest thing

21
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:07,870
in my life

22
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,310
is that I met you.

23
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,070
I want to stay with you forever.

24
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,870
Me too.

25
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,880
My Lord,

26
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,230
I searched the entire palace

27
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,560
but didn't find anything.

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,590
What kind of person

29
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,950
could do it without leaving any traces?

30
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:56,910
Zhuqi,

31
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,680
investigate a person for me.

32
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,240
Dad!

33
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,590
Dad!

34
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,750
Dad!

35
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,470
Dad!

36
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,960
Dad!

37
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,840
Dad!

38
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,470
Dad!

39
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,310
Do you hate them?

40
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,120
Don't be nervous.

41
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,240
I'm not your enemy.

42
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,590
Your enemy

43
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,960
is the future empress of Coldmoon,

44
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,400
Jiang Wan.

45
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,870
Why don't we

46
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,800
make a deal?

47
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,960
I'll adopt you

48
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,240
and help you take revenge

49
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,630
and kill Jiang Wan.

50
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,710
When I become the empress,

51
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,590
(Righteousness)
I'll help you

52
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,560
to restore your family's reputation.

53
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,710
How about that?

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,120
Xiao Xuanyi...

55
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,870
This time...

56
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,240
I'm going to protect you.

57
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,390
Help!

58
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,760
Yin!

59
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,360
- Come on.
- My Lord,

60
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,510
it hurts!

61
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,800
Are you okay? Be careful.

62
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,360
(Yin is getting worse.)

63
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,190
(I have to)

64
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,390
(find the cure as soon as possible.)

65
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,880
My Lord.

66
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,300
According to the investigation,

67
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,950
Xiao Xianyi was born
in Jiang City, Yi Lin Province.

68
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,680
His family has run Xiao's Pharmacy
for generations.

69
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,680
A few years ago,

70
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,920
a group of bandits

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,190
killed all his family.

72
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,950
His background

73
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,750
is the same as our records.

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,040
There's nothing wrong.

75
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,240
Sometimes,

76
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,040
the more normal it seems,

77
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,430
the more complicated it is.

78
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,120
Lord Ziheng is so stubborn.

79
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,800
He's been loyal to Jiang Wan.

80
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,870
So stupid.

81
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,870
Her Majesty

82
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,870
is going to have a meeting with him

83
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,270
in the Zichen Hall tonight.

84
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,560
I got it.

85
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Your Highness, I'm leaving.

86
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,560
Your Majesty.

87
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,560
Here's my proposed amendments

88
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,040
to the law.

89
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,670
Your Majesty.

90
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,800
Lord Ziheng's servant Zhuqi outside

91
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,310
said Lady Yin was ill again.

92
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,910
My Lord,

93
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,950
go back and take care of her.

94
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,190
We can talk about this later.

95
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,600
Thanks, Your Majesty.

96
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,720
I'm leaving.

97
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,840
Your Majesty.

98
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:25,950
I'm Xuanyi.

99
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,710
Your Majesty!

100
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,030
Your Majesty.

101
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,400
Your Majesty...

102
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,520
Your Majesty...

103
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,640
Your Highness,

104
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,360
Her Majesty is having a meeting
with Lord Ziheng tonight.

105
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,560
She didn't summon us.

106
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,800
If we visit Her Majesty
without her permission,

107
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,920
will it be...?

108
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,120
Lord Chen,

109
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,160
you're thinking too much.

110
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,240
Her Majesty never cares about the rules.

111
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,800
She'll be glad

112
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,750
that we can relieve her anxiety.

113
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,800
(Ziheng,)

114
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,950
(I don't think)

115
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,600
(you can be the Grand Tutor anymore.)

116
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,590
Oh, no.

117
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,760
Your Majesty...

118
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,030
Why are you here?

119
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,390
How dare you insult Her Majesty?

120
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,840
Arrest him now!

121
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,560
My Lord!

122
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,080
My Lord, something happened

123
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,480
at Zitan Hall.

124
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,030
I wanted to set Ziheng up

125
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,030
and force him to resign and leave.

126
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,630
I didn't expect

127
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,030
that Xuanyi would get into this
by accident.

128
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,440
Your Highness,

129
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,750
what should we do?

130
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,510
You tell me.

131
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,040
Your Highness...

132
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,190
Your Majesty,

133
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,080
you're finally awake.

134
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,080
Where's Xiao Xuanyi?

135
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,200
He tried to insult you,

136
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,510
so we put him in the dungeon.

137
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,280
What?

138
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,200
He disrespected Her Majesty.

139
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,550
Beat him to death!

140
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,820
Her Majesty has arrived!

141
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,910
Your Majesty,
I was going to beat him to death

142
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,550
to defend your decency.

143
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,870
He works for me.

144
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,390
How dare you touch him?

145
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,320
Your Majesty,

146
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,200
I wouldn't dare!

147
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,440
Your Majesty...

148
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,960
In her confession, the maid stated

149
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,790
she spilled pleasure incense
into the incense burner by accident.

150
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:35,080
It integrated with the peony in the room

151
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,630
and generated an intoxicating aroma.

152
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,510
My Lord, if you hadn't come back,

153
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,630
you'd be accused

154
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,750
of insulting Her Majesty.

155
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,240
Considering the timing,

156
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,720
they were obviously

157
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:52,960
targeting you, My Lord.

158
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,200
Unfortunately,

159
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,480
that maid has killed herself.

160
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,510
No one can testify now.

161
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,790
This must be a ploy.

162
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,910
If it weren't for protecting
someone more important,

163
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,910
they wouldn't have blamed it all

164
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,000
on the maid.

165
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,590
Zhuqi!

166
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,270
Go to Jiang City now.

167
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,840
Aye.

168
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,910
What are you doing?

169
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,840
Making a sky lantern.

170
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,790
Your Majesty, you saved me,

171
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,720
but I have nothing to return the favor.

172
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,510
In my hometown,

173
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,600
if we write down wishes

174
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,720
on a handmade sky lantern,

175
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,630
they will come true.

176
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,590
What happened to your hand?

177
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,470

188
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,190
