00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,900
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,550
Little beauty,

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,190
let me

5
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,440
take care of you.

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,240
Baili Hong,

7
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,840
why is His Majesty
so scared of Queen Mother?

8
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,640
His Majesty?

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:43,920
Si Yuan

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,520
is nothing but a puppet

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,240
the Bailis use to rule the world.

12
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,710
He didn't even have
the coronation ceremony.

13
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,560
I've controlled

14
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,470
all the spirit jade mines,

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,710
and my sister has handed over
the army to Jin Chong.

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,640
Jin Chong...

17
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,950
Jin Chong?

18
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,590
What's wrong with him?

19
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,430
He's been looking down on me.

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,120
His wife

21
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,640
has been capturing young girls

22
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,480
to help him cultivate evil magic.

23
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:17,910
However,

24
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,840
his wife

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,400
is a stunning beauty.

26
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,120
If I can feel her body...

27
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,430
Oh, no.

28
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,150
She means everything to Jin Chong.

29
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,790
If he finds out,

30
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,430
he'll skin me alive!

31
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,230
Jin Chong.

32
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,510
Have you learned the rules?

33
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,870
You Majesty,
you seem to care about me a lot.

34
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,710
You're here

35
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,430
to pick me up at midnight.

36
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,030
You'd better behave yourself.

37
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,080
Remember, you're my prey.

38
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,000
Your Majesty,
Meng Li is your loyal servant.

39
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,520
Of course

40
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,800
I'll solve problems for you.

41
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,080
Your duty

42
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,280
is to offer me fresh blood.

43
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,150
But I don't want

44
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,800
to just be your blood bank.

45
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,430
Ambition

46
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,630
will get you killed.

47
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,200
Is that so?

48
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:43,780
(Earthly Fiend Palace)

49
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,680
(Meng Li's blood)

50
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,520
(can suppress my mania.)

51
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,190
(As long as she's with me,)

52
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,470
(I don't need to eat monster pills
to control the disease.)

53
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,960
Your Majesty, Queen Mother
summoned Meng Li.

54
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:01,990
Is she

55
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,240
suspecting her?

56
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,870
Are you the sliver deer monster

57
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,750
His Majesty brought back
from Woods of Void?

58
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,840
Yes, Your Highness.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,120
Did His Majesty sleep with you?

60
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,710
Blessed be.

61
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,000
Give her abortion soup.

62
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,590
Your Highness, why are you doing this?

63
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,120
Humble monster,

64
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,870
how dare you want to have
the Demon God's children?

65
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,120
If His Majesty knows,

66
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,430
he'll protect me.

67
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,630
In demons' territory,

68
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,520
only I can decide

69
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,030
who's the Demon God.

70
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,800
Yuan,

71
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,590
don't you agree?

72
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,520
Mother.

73
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,200
Your Majesty!

74
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,400
Her Highness...

75
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,830
She forced me to drink
the abortion soup.

76
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,190
Mother is right.

77
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,120
You're just a deer monster.

78
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,830
You should be grateful

79
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,600
that I slept with you.

80
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,630
Don't go too far.

81
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,560
By the way,

82
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,750
how dare you disrespect Queen Mother?

83
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,150
Bai Ze.

84
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,110
Punish her.

85
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,110
Yes.

86
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,100
(Earthly Fiend Palace)

87
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,310
No wonder they say
all kings are heartless.

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,950
I've realized it now.

89
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,480
I just helped you during the day,

90
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,870
and you're

91
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,360
doing this to me at night.

92
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,480
What do you know?

93
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,870
The other day,

94
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,830
Her Highness sent the soup here,

95
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,950
but you poured it out.

96
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,480
Your Majesty, why?

97
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What are you suspecting?

98
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,120
Her Highness suddenly came yesterday,

99
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,560
and you pretended to sleep with me.

100
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,680
You did it

101
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,560
to either cover up

102
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,270
the scars on your body

103
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,590
or

104
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,480
hide the fact

105
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,680
that you went to Woods of Void

106
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,240
to hunt monsters,

107
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,830
or

108
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,750
both.

109
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,310
Interesting.

110
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,360
Go on.

111
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,240
Her Highness knew you slept with me,

112
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,430
and there are many eyes in your place,

113
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,320
but

114
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,000
she still asked me

115
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,240
whether you slept with me,

116
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,160
so I had no choice

117
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,000
but to keep pretending it

118
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,630
as you wanted.

119
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,360
After all,

120
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,720
Your Majesty,

121
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,740
(Yuan)

122
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,190
I'm yours now.

123
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,070
(Yuan)
I've left a special mark

124
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,070
on your body.

125
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,640
You

126
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,870
can never escape.

127
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,120
Your Majesty,
I've prepared a gift for you.

128
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,750
Shall we check it out tomorrow?

129
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:37,180
(Immortal Pavilion, Long-lasting Peace)

130
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,040
Here's the gift.

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,870
I'm not interested in women,

132
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,920
let alone

133
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,270
a married woman.

134
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,830
You're not interested,

135
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,950
but others are.

136
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,430
I'd never do

137
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,830
such sneaky things.

138
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:03,160
Your Majesty, haven't you done

139
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,800
a lot of sneaky things?

140
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,680
Do you have any idea
what you're talking about?

141
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:26,060
(Immortal Pavilion, Long-lasting Peace)

142
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,750
General, Lady Mei is missing.

143
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,510
How can the woman I stole yesterday be

144
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,630
Jin... Jing Chong's wife?

145
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,720
If he finds out,

146
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,510
he'll tear me apart.

147
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,030
Nasty man, how dare you?

148
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,630
I'm General Jin's wife.

149
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,670
If he finds out,

150
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,240
you'll go to hell!

151
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,750
No one can find out.

152
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,480
Otherwise, even my sister can't save me!

153
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,000
So, go to hell!

154
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,120
Baili Hong!

155
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,750
General Jin, I didn't do it.

156
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,750
I don't know what happened.

157
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,750
I didn't do it.

158
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,150
Baili Hong,

159
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,910
I'll kill you!

160
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,270
Sister! Sister! Save me!

161
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,870
Jin Chong is going to kill me!

162
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,710
Your Highness,

163
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,600
Baili Hong insulted my wife

164
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,390
and chocked her to death

165
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,720
to evade responsibility.

166
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,440
Mother,

167
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,720
what should

168
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,560
we do?

169
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,790
Jin Chong

170
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,390
still holds the army token.

171
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,550
You're slandering me!

172
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:53,990
It was she...

173
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,840
She seduced me first!

174
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,030
Besides,

175
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,480
she's just a woman.

176
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,670
Her life means nothing!

177
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,670
What else do you want?

178
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,320
Your Highness, please uphold justice

179
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,630
and kill Baili Hong,

180
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,720
or I'll kill him myself

181
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,390
to avenge my wife!

182
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,000
General Jin,

183
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,910
Uncle and you

184
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,480
are both important to us demons.

185
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,730
Please don't turn against each other.

186
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,030
What the hell?

187
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,390
He insulted

188
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,510
and killed my wife.

189
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,910
If I forgive him,

190
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,360
how can the people trust me?

191
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,320
Sister, help.

192
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,280
I didn't...

193
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,670
I've told you a million times

194
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,200
to stay away from women

195
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,750
to avoid trouble,

196
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,030
but you never listened to me.

197
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,870
Now you've made such a big mistake

198
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,270
that even I can't protect you.

199
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,030
We must look at the bigger picture.

200
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,150
Sister...

201
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,030
Guards, destroy
Baili Hong's cultivation.

202
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,870
Sister.

203
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,510
Sister, I'm your brother!

204
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,390
Sister, I'm your family!

205
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,800
Sister!

206
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,840
Sister, you can't do this to me!

207
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,750
Sister!

208
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,870
You can't do this, sister!

209
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,960
Sister!

210
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,720
Let me go!

211
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,240
I want to see my sister!

212
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,630
I want to see His Majesty!

213
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,200
If they know how you treat me,

214
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,510
they won't let you get away!

215
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,750
Let me go!

216
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,200
Good nephew.

217
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,270
Did my sister send you here?

218
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,080
I knew you wouldn't leave me alone.

219
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,750
Did she ask you to take me back?

220
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,080
Mother did send me here,

221
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,360
but

222
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,910
she told me to destroy you.

223
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,750
Impossible.

224
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,200
Why would my sister...?

225
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,840
Mother is so disappointed,

226
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,440
but she still cares about her brother,

227
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,630
so she didn't come.

228
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,600
If she hadn't given the orders,

229
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,480
I wouldn't dare

230
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,320
to hurt you.

231
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:06,870
Impossible.

232
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,120
I'm her brother.

233
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,550
She wouldn't destory my cultivation!

234
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,320
Si Yuan.

235
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,750
I don't mind telling you the truth.

236
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,790
Do you know why she's stolen your power

237
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,870
and ruled herself

238
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,080
all these years?

239
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,270
Because you're not her son.

240
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,960
I'm telling the truth.

241
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,360
Many years ago, she killed your father.

242
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,270
Your mother

243
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,000
is the woman you've tortured.

244
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,150
You're trying to turn us
against each other.

245
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,600
I'll destroy your essence now.

246
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,030
My mission is completed.

247
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,110
Guards,

248
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,200
take my uncle to his mansion
to get some rest.

249
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,080
Where is he?

250
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,000
What did you see?

251
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,240
I've seen things

252
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,080
I should

253
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,630
or shouldn't see.

254
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,200
Aren't you afraid of death?

255
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,200
I am.

256
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,390
How can I not be afraid?

257
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,080
What did Baili Hong tell you that night?

258
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,320
Why did you set up
him and Jin Chong's wife?

259
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,390
It turns out

260
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,550
I can never fool you, Your Majesty.

261
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,960
I just played a little trick

262
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,150
to make two bad buys
fight against each other.

263
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,440
In that case,

264
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,240
the outsider

265
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,910
will gain all the benefits.

266
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,270
Your Majesty, you became the Demon God
when you were young,

267
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,670
but you've never ruled.

268
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,840
That's because

269
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,670
the Bailis

270
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,120
have controlled the demons.

271
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,750
It seems my uncle told you a lot.

272
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,510
Your Majesty, you've been
tolerating and pretending

273
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,080
because you want to rule.

274
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,080
However, to achieve this,

275
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,670
you have you

276
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,200
take over the spirit jade mines

277
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,390
and the demon army token

278
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,630
from the Bailis.

279
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,320
You also have to get

280
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,840
Demon God's Crown.

281
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,320
Did Baili Hong tell you this?

282
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,750
Of course not.

283
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,960
Your Majesty,

284
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,840
this is just

285
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,840
my assumption.

286
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,960
However, your reaction

287
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,910
has proved

288
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,360
that I'm right.

289
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,870
You have a thorough plan.

290
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,030
What do you want?

291
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,240
Your Majesty,

292
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,150
what do you think

293
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,750
a woman would try every means

294
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,120
to please a man for?

295
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,790
It's obvious because

296
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,600
I like you.

297
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,320
Little deer monster.

298
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,480
You're not honest.

299
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,630
Tell me when you

300
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,960
