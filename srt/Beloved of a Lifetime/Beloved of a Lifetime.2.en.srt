00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,900
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,670
(It's him.)

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,160
(I can't believe he's the Demon God.)

5
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,120
Sliver Deer Monster.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,350
Deer monster?

7
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,320
What an ugly name.

8
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,280
You're quite good-looking.

9
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,470
Why don't you

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,350
Stay?

11
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,560
I'll collect the remnants
of their souls,

12
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,510
but you must get the Amber Heart

13
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,280
so that I can use ancient magic

14
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,840
to bring your people back.

15
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,070
Amber Heart?

16
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,230
What's that?

17
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,640
Some people are born

18
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,310
with Fate of Solitary Star.

19
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,070
They can never fall in love.

20
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,230
When they give their all
to someone else,

21
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,840
a pure and true Amber Heart

22
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,920
will be formed.

23
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,840
I will

24
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,280
look for it.

25
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,710
It's said the Demon God Si Yuan

26
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,150
has the Fate of Solitary Star,

27
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,950
but no one really knows

28
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,430
if it's real.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,430
(Why does she smell so familiar?)

30
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,030
(Why is her blood)

31
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,360
(suppressing my mania?)

32
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,680
Your Majesty.

33
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,800
Take her back.

34
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,960
Yes.

35
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,310
Go.

36
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,030
(So, you're the Demon God.)

37
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,520
(It was I who saved the devil)

38
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,120
(and led to the massacre of my people.)

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,870
(Si Yuan,)

40
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,750
(I'll let you rot in hell.)

41
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,200
(Dad,)

42
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,200
(Li,)

43
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,120
(I will bring you back.)

44
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,190
(I'll bring all my people back.)

45
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,280
You're the Demon God.

46
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,310
Why are you bullying
a humble girl like me?

47
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,240
From now on,

48
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,520
you're mine.

49
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,400
If you obey me,

50
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,640
I'll only

51
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,870
drink your blood.

52
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,870
You'll

53
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,430
live.

54
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,960
What if I don't?

55
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,150
Then I'll

56
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,870
eat your flesh.

57
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,960
You'll

58
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,040
die.

59
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,950
You won't.

60
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,870
I'm still useful.

61
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,630
You're not stupid.

62
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,680
Your Majesty,
I want to make a deal with you.

63
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,560
You don't deserve

64
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,390
to make a deal with me.

65
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,920
What are you doing?

66
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,270
From now on,

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,270
you're mine.

68
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,800
You'd better be my prey.

69
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,360
I've left a special mark

70
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,830
on your body.

71
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,440
You

72
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,720
can never escape.

73
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,110
Your Majesty.

74
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,390
Thank my mother for me.

75
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,080
Yes.

76
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,310
Your Majesty, I'm leaving.

77
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,920
Keep your mouth shut,

78
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,680
or

79
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,680
you won't be able to survive tonight.

80
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,080
Besides,

81
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,390
whenever the red moon comes out,

82
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,390
you need...

83
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,190
Need what?

84
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,560
You need to feed me

85
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,070
with your blood

86
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,870
on

87
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,040
time.

88
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,800
You can go.

89
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,960
Yes.

90
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,000
I'll announce

91
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,830
that you're my servant spirit

92
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,430
and need to follow me wherever I go.

93
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,720
Good evening, mother.

94
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,160
Blessed day.

95
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,720
How are

96
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,920
things in North Land lately?

97
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,920
There's a lot of work.

98
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,000
Sometimes,
I don't know how to deal with it.

99
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,910
Luckily,

100
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,240
my uncle

101
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,800
and General Jin Chong have assisted me.

102
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,630
The weather is pleasing.

103
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,600
Let's visit a friend.

104
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,590
Okay.

105
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,510
Yuan,

106
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,950
this vicious woman killed your father.

107
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,190
Are you going to

108
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,680
have mercy on her?

109
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,720
Remember,

110
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,430
you're the Demon God.

111
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,600

Be a good prey.

135
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,510
Get out!

136
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,470
Queen Mother.

137
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,840
You'll

138
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,630
serve me

139
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,320
tonight.

140
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,480
Forget it.

141
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,440
Don't disrupt His Majesty.

142
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,920
Yes.

143
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,720
(His relationship with Baili Xuxue)

144
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,440
(can't be as simple as it seems.)

145
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,240
Since he's started
to be interested in women,

146
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,080
we'll give him what he wants.

147
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:58,120
Arrange more eyes for me

148
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,200
to keep a close eye

149
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,030
on his everything.

150
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,630
We can't take any risks.

151
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,600
Sister,

152
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,600
I've already

153
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,840
arranged everything.

154
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,510
Girls,

155
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,480
show him

156
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,790
what you've got.

157
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,870
- Please him.
- Yes.

158
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,840
If His Majesty likes you,

159
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,360
you'll be

160
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,630
highly rewarded.

161
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,160
Your Majesty.

162
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,550
Uncle, you don't have to do this.

163
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,870
I found something interesting for you

164
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,750
on my trip.

165
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,750
Come on,

166
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,750
let's to.

167
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,870
Just sit here and watch.

168
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:54,870
I've

169
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,440
arranged everything.

170
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,000
Girls,

171
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,510
time to dance.

172
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,840
How dare you?

173
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,200
If I don't have guts,

174
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,360
how can I

175
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,120
steal your heart, Your Majesty?

176
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,240
You're just a dance girl. How dare you
talk to His Majesty like that?

177
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,510
Know your place.

178
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,350
Your Majesty,

179
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,320
this stupid girl doesn't know the rules.

180
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,600
I'll teach her a lesson

181
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,840
and send her to you.

182
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,670
Thanks, Uncle.

183
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,080
Go.

184
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,320
Keep dancing.

185
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,600
Serve His Majesty well.

186
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,200
