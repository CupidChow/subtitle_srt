00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,340
=Beloved of A Lifetime=

2
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,900
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,800
Yuxu Sect's spell.

4
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,430
(Luckily, I didn't try to seize power
in plain sight.)

5
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,590
(Otherwise,)

6
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,240
(I would've died here.)

7
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,920
Rest for a few days,

8
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,320
and you'll be fine.

9
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,070
Thank you for your efforts

10
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,390
over the last few days.

11
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,350
You treated my disease

12
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,600
and prepared medicine.

13
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,310
Yuan,

14
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,790
Shancha is a good girl.

15
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,150
Don't miss her.

16
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,550
Your Highness,

17
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,710
I'm aware that I don't deserve
to be the queen.

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,400
I wouldn't dare think about it.

19
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,120
Shancha,

20
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,920
don't be too hard on yourself.

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,280
I know you're a good girl.

22
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,230
Those things

23
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,400
are not your fault.

24
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:20,630
Yuan,

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,040
don't you think so?

26
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,120
By the way,

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,790
today is the Lantern Festival.

28
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,760
You can take Shancha

29
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,870
to the lantern show

30
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,070
so as to thank Shancha

31
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,400
for me.

32
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,280
What are you drawing?

33
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,960
My dad taught me

34
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,310
to draw images on umbrellas
for the Lantern Festival.

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,590
This is the nostalgia flower that only
grows in extremely cold places.

36
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,030
It's also

37
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,400
my favorite flower

38
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,190
because it can stay alive and bloom

39
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,150
in all kinds of environments.

40
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,030
Ziheng.

41
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,750
Ziheng!

42
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,190
I know it's you.

43
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,150
Why wouldn't you recognize me?

44
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,120
(What's happening?)

45
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,630
(She seems to have forgotten
that I hurt her before.)

46
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,750
A while ago,

47
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,960
I saw you use Yuxu Sect's magic,

48
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,750
so I followed you secretly.

49
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,150
When I saw you
drawing nostalgia flowers...

50
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,910
It's you, right?

51
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,750
Shang You.

52
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,750
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,190
Ziheng,

54
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,590
it's you!

55
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,360
You're still alive!

56
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,080
I'm sorry that I didn't protect you.

57
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,190
I can't face you.

58
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,710
It's not your fault.

59
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,520
(She really forgot)

60
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,960
(that I tried to kill her.)

61
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,120
By the way,

62
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,750
on our wedding,

63
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,470
didn't you...

64
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,430
Master saved me.

65
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,870
Master?

66
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,120
What happened

67
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,910
on our wedding?

68
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,030
I can't remember anything.

69
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,030
When I woke up,

70
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,000
all my people had...

71
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,950
Master used magic to change my face

72
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,190
so that I can help you
to fulfill your mission.

73
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,630
I don't know
what exactly happened either.

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,240
When I woke up,

75
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,480
I was at the Yuxu Sect.

76
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,360
I'll take this jade pendant.

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,510
I didn't argue with my mother

78
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,600
because I didn't want to embarrass you.

79
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,160
Your Majesty,
you don't need to explain this.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,360
I understand.

81
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,950
In that case...

82
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,750
Actually,

83
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,870
we don't have solid evidence to prove

84
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,750
that it was the demons

85
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,640
who killed our people.

86
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,310
I'll ask Master

87
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,070
about this again.

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,840
Okay.

89
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,750
Be careful.

90
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,110
Don't worry.

91
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,400
Meng Li.

92
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,000
Your Majesty?

93
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,360
Why are you here?

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,430
Silver Deer Monster,

95
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,120
you fall in love

96
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,430
with every man you see.

97
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,800
You're so good at

98
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,830
seducing men, aren't you?

99
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,800
Your Majesty, I don't understand.

100
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,750
You just gave me this ring,

101
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,240
and now

102
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,430
you're flirting with Yinchen.

103
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,870
Your Majesty,

104
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,950
are you jealous?

105
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,870
Ridiculous.

106
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,630
Why would I be jealous

107
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,120
for a deer monster.

108
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,040
You're nothing

109
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,190
but a prey to me.

110
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,720
Give it back.

111
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,160
Your Majesty,

112
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,720
is this for your prey?

113
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,070
When did I say

114
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,600
it's for you?

115
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,680
But it's engraved

116
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,190
with a deer.

117
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,160
A while ago,

118
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,800
I met His Highness

119
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,510
by chance.

120
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,440
And?

121
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,510
And...

122
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,870
Thanks for the pendant, Your Majesty.

123
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,750
Shancha.

124
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,750
You should spend more time

125
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,120
with Yuan.

126
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,430
What's wrong?

127
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,920
Meng Li is always

128
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,630
by His Majesty's side.

129
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,630
I don't want to bother them.

130
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,310
What are you talking about?

131
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,800
She's just a monster.

132
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,040
Meng Li

133
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,680
has a beautiful face

134
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,800
and know His Majesty well.

135
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,270
Of course he likes her.

136
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,720
As long as His Majesty is happy,

137
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,920
I'm happy.

138
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,310
Shancha,

139
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,000
you're a good girl.

140
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,510
Unlike that monster,

141
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,630
my lady is very decent.

142
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,750
That monster not only
seduced His Majesty

143
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,000
but is also playing
with His Highness Yinchen.

144
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,360
- The other day...
- Xichun!

145
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,870
What happened?

146
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,000
Go on.

147
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,000
On the day of the Lantern Festival,

148
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,750
My Lady and His Majesty

149
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,600
met Meng Li and Yinchen
at the lantern show.

150
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,120
His Majesty was somehow bewitched

151
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,080
by her secret magic

152
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,390
and abandoned My Lady

153
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,550
and left with Meng Li.

154
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:03,990
Back then,

155
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,670
on Meng Li
and His Highness Yinchen's wedding,

156
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,000
His Majesty took her away

157
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,270
in front of everyone,

158
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,480
and now,

159
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,670
she's flirting with His Majesty

160
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,910
and His Highness at the same time.

161
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,600
Shancha,

162
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
is she telling the truth?

163
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,510
Perhaps

164
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,510
His Majesty needed

165
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,360
to tell Meng Li something important.

166
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,960
How dare she?

167
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,920
Molan.

168
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,510
Yes, Your Highness.

169
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,480
Your Highness.

170
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,870
On your knees.

171
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,630
Squeeze her fingers.

172
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,230
Your Highness.

173
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,750
What's this for?

174
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,360
You seduced His Majesty

175
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,790
and have an affair with Yinchen.

176
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,360
Do you know what your crime is?

177
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,240
Do it.

178
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,510
Your Highness, I'm innocent!

179
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,600
Your Highness...

180
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,910
Your Highness, please have mercy.

181
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,080
Yinchen,

182
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,270
are you sure you want to offend me?

183
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,030
Back off.

184
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,320
Mother,

185
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,550
what's this for?

186
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,670
I'm just punishing a deer monster,

187
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,550
and you're both defending her.

188
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,870
It seems the monster

189
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,200
is really special.

♪The sun goes down, the moon comes out♪

191
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,000
