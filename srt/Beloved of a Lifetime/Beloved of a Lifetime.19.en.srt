00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,900
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,320
Where's His Majesty?

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,550
His Majesty went to the Heavenly Prison.

5
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,030
Don't blame me.

6
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,520
This is your retribution.

7
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,880
Your mother set up my mother

8
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,520
and made her die of depression
in the deserted palace.

9
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,200
I had to grow up alone

10
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,710
and was bullied by others

11
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,470
in the deserted palace.

12
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,560
You deserve this.

13
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,150
It's all your fault.

14
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,920
You and your mother owe me,

15
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,790
understand?

16
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,920
If you beg me,

17
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,000
maybe I'll have mercy

18
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,590
and spare your life.

19
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,000
I'll never surrender to a rebel.

20
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,280
I'm the winner!

21
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,150
It's me!

22
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,760
In the end,

23
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,560
I have to thank Wan.

24
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,710
I've trained her all these years.

25
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,510
I taught her various arts

26
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,000
to satisfy you

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,200
and make her my strongest weapon.

28
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,280
(Xiao Xuanyi)

29
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,710
(You killed my parents.)

30
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,480
(I'll make you pay.)

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,150
I was the one

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,710
who made the poison

33
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,430
and asked her

34
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,840
to poison your medicine.

35
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,590
Your Majesty.

36
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,460
Okay.

37
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,630
Is it good?

38
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,710
Anything you made

39
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,150
is good.

40
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,080
She did everything I told her to do.

41
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,150
She's been so loyal.

42
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,750
So disgusting.

43
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,080
Get his dead body out of here

44
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,280
and hang it on the gate.

45
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,750
Aye.

46
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,920
Guards!

47
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,150
Your Majesty,

48
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,800
I've eliminated everyone

49
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,440
who knew you ordered them to kill

50
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,560
the general and his family.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,400
Her Majesty's servants

52
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,560
don't know about the massacre

53
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,800
either.

54
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,430
So,

55
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,400
it was you who ordered
to kill my family.

56
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,400
All these years,

57
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,080
you've been using me.

58
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,960
I'm nothing but a tool for you.

59
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,960
Wan?

60
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,150
Why are you here?

61
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,540
Mo Feng,

62
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,910
take Her Majesty back now.

63
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,430
Aye.

64
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,200
Wan!

65
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,710
- Xuanyi!
- Wan!

66
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,030
Wan.

67
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,520
Come on.

68
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,710
Come back with me.

69
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,840
Stay away from me.

70
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,750
Wan.

71
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,960
Come here.

72
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,240
Wan!

73
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,680
Wan.

74
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,750
Stay away from me!

75
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,360
Calm down.

76
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,680
It was you.

77
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,400
You've been using me

78
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,800
and lying to me!

79
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,510
You made me murder Xiao Xuanyi!

80
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,950
I did use you,

81
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,120
but I've raised you for many years.

82
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,600
I taught you various arts

83
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,830
and martial arts.

84
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,600
Now you're the queen,

85
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,190
the most powerful person
in the world except me.

86
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,120
What else do you want?

87
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,480
It's my fault.

88
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,270
I trusted the wrong person.

89
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,950
Xuanyi.

90
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,040
I did this to you.

91
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,310
It's all my fault!

92
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,920
Wan!

♪We're destined to meet each other♪

94
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,040
♪But it never lasts♪

(Xiao Xuanyi)

100
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,600
(I've failed you in this lifetime.)

101
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,510
(I will pay you back...)

102
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,870
(in another life.)

103
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
Xuanyi...

104
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,150
No...

105
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,270
No!

106
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,590
No!

107
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,710
Xuanyi!

108
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,270
Your Majesty.

109
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,310
Xuanyi?

110
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,870
Xuanyi!

111
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,680
You're still alive!

112
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,480
You're still alive!

113
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,160
Xuanyi...

114
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,080
Your Majesty.

115
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,950
Did you have another nightmare?

116
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,630
Your Majesty?

117
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,480
I didn't take good care of you.

118
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,920
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

119
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,440
What...

120
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,750
did you call me?

121
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,000
Your Majesty,

122
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,310
it's time to go to the court.

123
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,120
(Are they)

124
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,560
(all my ministers?)

125
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,350
(What?)

126
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,680
(Why are there many women in the court?)

127
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,600
Your Majesty, you proposed

128
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,270
equal rights for men and women
in the imperial examination,

129
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,510
and it has made huge progress

130
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,630
in the past three years.

131
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,000
More and more women started to read

132
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,250
- What's going on?
- and become officials.

133
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,430
This year, half of the candidates
in the imperial examination

134
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,160
are women.

135
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,870
(What's happening?)

136
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,560
(Why is this world)

137
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,680
(so different)

138
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,120
(in another life?)

139
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,350
Your Majesty,

140
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,750
we admire you for your dedication

141
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,800
to the country and the people,

142
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,630
but it is also important
to pass on the royal blood.

143
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,000
Your Majesty, you still haven't got
an authentic husband.

144
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,560
You're 26 years old.

145
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,360
It's time to marry some men.

146
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,000
That's right.

147
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,850
The former emperor had you
when he was only 18 years old.

148
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,040
Your Majesty, you've prioritized
national prosperity

149
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,190
and given up momentary pleasure.

150
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,950
You're so responsible and visionary.

151
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,240
Nasty men!

152
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,300
You don't understand!

153
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,640
The harem is the top priority!

154
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,480
Her Majesty should focus on
the country's development!

155
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,720
A husband will only lead to disasters!

156
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,800
You women

157
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,000
are so ridiculous!

158
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,600
This is nonsense!

159
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,310
So ridiculous!

160
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,870
Let's listen to the Grand Tutor

161
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,190
and the Princess Royal's opinions!

162
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,390
Grand Tutor?

163
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,240
Look at me.

164
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,390
(You're just like him.)

165
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,720
This mole under your eye...

166
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,910
When I was young, I heard

167
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,200
a mole under the eye

168
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,350
means one's still trapped
by the destiny of the previous lifetime.

169
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,910
One must wait for the fated person
in this life.

170
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,920
Okay.

171
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,390
They say

172
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,440
a person with a mole under the eye
is the most loyal lover.

173
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,030
Your Majesty, I'm so greedy

174
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,270
that I not only want your love
in this lifetime

175
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,910
but I want you

176
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,870
to find me in another life.

177
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,960
Okay.

178
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
I promise you.

179
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,130
♪If we can start over,
I'll never say goodbye♪

180
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:35,690
♪Let me protect you this time
and fulfill all your wishes♪

181
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,480
Your Majesty.

182
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,910
From now on,

183
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,910
you don't have to

184
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,120
bow to me.

185
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,000
Thanks, Your Majesty.

186
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,240
(What's wrong with her lately?)

187
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,200
(She's acting strange.)

188
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,510
(Is she suspecting my identity)

189
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,390
(and trying to test me?)

190
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,320
Your Majesty,

191
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,440
the Grand Tutor and the Princess Royal
want to see you.

192
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,710
Let them in.

193
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,840
Your Majesty.

194
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,840
Your Majesty.

195
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,440
(It's them.)

196
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,870
(It turns out in this life,)

197
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,550
(all of us have)

198
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,870
(different identities.)

199
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,600
Get up.

200
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,990
Your Majesty,

201
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,250
here's the list of the disaster victims.

202
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,390
Please take a look.

203
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,150
In previous years

204
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,390
the disaster relief funds

205
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,720
for Ling River's floods

206
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,000
were plundered and restricted

207
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,130
by different cities and counties.

208
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,750
The victims

209
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,790
never received the money.

210
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,350
Your Majesty,

211
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,670
in my opinion,

212
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,550
we should send someone
to escort the funds

213
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,840
to the disaster area.

214
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,840
It's a good idea.

215
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,390
My lord, you'll take care of this.

216
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,750
Aye.

217
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,910
My Lord,

218
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,030
you care about the people so much.

219
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,390
I should learn from you.

220
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,120
Your Highness, I'm so flattered.

221
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,960
I'm just doing my job.

222
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,200
Yin,

223
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,600
why are you waiting outside again?

224
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,320
It's okay, My Lord.

225
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,510
I just wanted to see you
sooner every day.

226
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,560
Come here.

227
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,960
The wind is cold.

228
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,150
You are in poor health.

229
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,790
Don't wait here anymore.

230
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,920
Okay.

231
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,840
Let's go back.

232
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,360
You're here.

233
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,000
You didn't let me down,

234
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,270
Xuanyi.

235
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,240
I can tell

236
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,320
Jiang Wan

237
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,030
trusts you a lot.

238
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,510
It seems

239
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,480
