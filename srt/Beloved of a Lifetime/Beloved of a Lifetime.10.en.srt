00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,340
=Beloved of A Lifetime=

2
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,900
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:36,990
Your Majesty!

4
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,740
(Earthly Fiend Palace)

5
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,560
Your Majesty,

6
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,200
are you not feeling well?

7
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,640
Mother, I've been

8
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,510
feeling tired lately.

9
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,510
I feel like

10
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,590
I can't pull myself together.

11
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,150
Did you see the doctor?

12
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,400
Yes,

13
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,070
but he didn't find the cause.

14
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,760
May I just

15
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,430
need to rest well.

16
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,070
Take care of yourself,

17
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:51,910
Yuan.

18
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,430
Thanks, Mother.

19
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,280
Take the medicine and get some rest.

20
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,030
His Majesty is weak right now

21
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,470
because of a persistent disease.

22
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,680
His Highness Yinchen

23
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,430
will take over the North Land's affairs.

24
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,150
Yes, Your Highness.

25
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,520
A storm is coming.

26
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,750
Don't move!

27
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,080
- Get down!
- Get down!

28
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,750
Don't move!

29
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,590
As long as you behave yourself,

30
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,680
the insect won't do any harm to you.

31
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
This is

32
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,120
the same insect

33
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,190
as the ones in the bodies
of her eyes in the palace.

34
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,830
Over the years,

35
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,560
I've found the cure
to this insect poison.

36
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,270
Your Majesty,

37
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,720
I'll get the cure now.

38
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,880
Wait.

39
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,920
Why don't we use

40
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,680
this opportunity

41
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,750
to find the key to the forbidden area?

42
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,520
This one

43
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,120
is from Baili Xuxue,

44
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,910
and this is

45
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,360
the one I prepared for you.

46
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,750
I can do it.

47
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,390
Just leave.

48
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,620
(The spell to open the forbidden area
is just as I expected.)

49
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,360
(Good job,)

50
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,830
(Little Deer Monster.)

51
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,950
(Of course,)

52
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,000
(Your Majesty.)

53
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,720
Your Majesty,

54
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,630
what's this all about?

55
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,310
Jin Chong has been
practicing evil magic.

56
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,390
- Take him down.
- Aye.

57
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,120
How dare you?

58
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,360
Then it's a deal.

59
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,510
Your Highness,
why didn't you ask my opinion?

60
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,480
Yuan?

61
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,670
How did you...?

62
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,750
Your Highness, are you surprised

63
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,560
to see me here?

64
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,480
Your Majesty, how can you...?

65
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,390
Who else

66
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,040
has a problem?

67
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,120
Yuan,

68
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,630
why are you so angry today?

69
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:33,910
However,

70
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,390
I'm so glad to see

71
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,160
that you've recovered.

72
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,750
Vicious witch,

73
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,240
you don't deserve to be my mother.

74
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,000
- You...
- My mother

75
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,800
is He Lanjin

76
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,430
instead of you, Baili Xuxue.

77
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,800
Nonsense!

78
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Baili Xuxue,

79
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,920
stop pretending.

80
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,160
Back then,

81
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,270
she stole my son Yuan

82
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,430
and locked me up in the forbidden area.

83
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,430
She was the one
who murdered the old Demon God.

84
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,920
Vicious witch,

85
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,190
you've done so many evil things

86
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,390
and sabotaged royal security.

87
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,160
You don't deserve
to be the Queen Mother!

88
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,510
You're lying.

89
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Ridiculous.

90
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,120
Ridiculous!

91
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,550
Long live His Majesty!

92
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:46,080
Long live His Majesty!

93
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,910
God bless him!

94
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,870
Baili Xuxue,

95
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,960
your sins

96
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,360
are unforgivable.

97
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,150
Lock her up in the forbidden area

98
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,150
till the end of the world.

99
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,390
After

100
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,440
all the effort I've made,

101
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,630
I can't believe

102
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,000
I ended up like this.

103
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,750
Sister, we could've

104
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,720
gotten along with each other.

105
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,240
However, your evilness

106
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,480
and greediness

107
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,030
have destroyed yourself.

108
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,320
You deserve this.

109
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,360
It was you

110
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,960
who seduced the old Demon God

111
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,920
and took everything from me!

112
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,680
Your Majesty,

113
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,270
I made some cakes for you.

114
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,280
Here you are.

115
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,560
It's too dry.

116
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,510
Make some soup.

117
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,470
Hurry up.

118
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,030
(I thought)

119
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,750
(His Majesty favored you
because you got pregnant.)

120
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,670
Your Majesty.

121
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,120
- (So, I pretended to be pregnant)
- I miss you every day.

122
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,370
to win his favor.

123
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,550
Your Majesty, stay with me tonight...

124
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,550
- I have something to do.
- (However...)

125
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,390
I'm leaving.

126
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,600
- (His Majesty never cared about me.)
- Your Majesty!

127
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,030
(I was furious,)

128
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,630
(so I poisoned him.)

129
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,320
(Then he died.)

130
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,390
Sister,

131
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,910
let me see my child.

132
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,080
Concubine Jin had obstructed labor

133
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,360
and died with her child.

134
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,550
The Queen had the Demon God's child!

135
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,080
You...

136
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,120
You took everything from me.

137
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,390
I'll let you lose everything too.

138
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,030
(However, a few days later,)

139
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,550
(I found myself pregnant.)

140
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,030
(After I had Chen,)

141
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,270
(I found his spiritual roots
were damaged.)

142
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,080
(I tried every means
to look for the cure to his disease.)

143
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,480
(However,)

144
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,120
(someone stole him)

145
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,550
(on the way.)

146
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,120
(Since my child is gone,)

147
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,150
(I won't go easy on your son.)

148
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,030
In that case,

149
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,240
you deserve to die

150
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,360
in this dark place.

151
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:08,840
Wait!

152
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,790
You won,

153
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,600
but please have mercy on Chen.

154
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,030
He's innocent!

155
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,840
He was never a part of this!

156
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,550
As long as he doesn't make trouble,

157
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,440
I won't hurt him.

158
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,710
Your Majesty.

159
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,110
What's wrong?

160
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,670
Yinchen asked the maid

161
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,790
to send this to Meng Li,

162
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,120
but I caught her

163
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,270
and brought it here.

164
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,550
What do you think?

165
00:12:59,150 --> 00:12:59,990
Your Majesty.

166
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,600
Your Majesty,

167
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,670
are you waiting here

168
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,150
to heal my wound?

169
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,480
Not a big deal.

170
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,360
Your Majesty, it seems

171
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,960
you've become more tender.

172
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,840
Here,

173
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,550
Yinchen asked me

174
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,440
to give it to you.

175
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,870
I'm so glad to see it.

176
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,240
I've been looking for it.

177
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,240
Is it yours?

178
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,790
Didn't he give this to you?

179
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,910
Of course not.

180
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,630
I met

181
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,320
His Highness in the woods.

182
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,200
I think I lost it there.

183
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,160
What's wrong?

184
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,040
Nothing.

185
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,000
Just asking.

186
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,550
Your Majesty,
you sent me a bone whistle.

187
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,390
Therefore,

188
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,750
I wanted to give you this

189
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,000
in return.

190
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,750
Is this your gift for me?

191
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,960
It's cliche and ugly.

192
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,080
Then...

193
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,030
I'll take it.
