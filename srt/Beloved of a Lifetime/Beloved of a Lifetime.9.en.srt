That woman is so impressive.

110
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,780

I can't believe
you were fooled by a monster

120
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,660
and made such a mistake.

121
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,700
Mother, I've realized my mistake.

00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,420
I'm sorry.

123
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,660

Yinchen and you are both my children,

126
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,860

127
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,780

129
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,580
However, you must

130
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,860
give him an explanation.

131
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,660
I will

132
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,820
apologize

133
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,860
and make it up for him.

134
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,180
Chen is old enough to be knighted.

135
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,020
He should be crowned prince

136
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,660
and work in the court.

Yes.

144
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,140
Open your mouth.

145
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,100

148
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,540

150
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,780
I have a good news today.

151

Your son didn't die.

152

It seems

153
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,660
he's quite strong and lucky.

154
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,700
Even my Heart Poison Formation
couldn't kill him.

155
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,380
However, it's even better.

156
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,780
He doesn't deserve a quick death.

157
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,820
I've prepared

158
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,420
a poison for him.

159
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,260
I'm going to make him suffer

160
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,380

161
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,460
