00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,000
Shang You.

4
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,680
It's been a long time,

5
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,840
my old friend

6
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,070
Cang Li.

7
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,350
Cang Li.

8
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,350
Give up.

9
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,560
You're no match for me.

10
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,030
Evil Deer,

11
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,560
your sins are unforgivable.

12
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,240
I'll eliminate the evil for the people

13
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,840
and the way of heaven.

14
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,910
Way of heaven?

15
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,630
What is the way of heaven?

16
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,910
I'm

17
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,590
the way.

18
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,750
(Why did I see the memories
of ancient times?)

19
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,030
(Was that Shang You and me
in the previous life?)

20
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,840
(What's)

21
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,800
(the secret behind this?)

22
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,870
Xie Zhixun!

23
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,840
(Is this)

24
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,000
(the Skull Spring's heart?)

25
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,280
(His heart was made from
the Skull Spring's heart.)

26
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,080
(So, you're always Si Yuan.)

27
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,270
(Holy spirits...)

28
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,400
Master.

29
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,640
Are you

30
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,430
familiar with this place?

31
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,870
I've never

32
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,270
been here before.

33
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,870
I don't know this place.

34
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,120
This is the holy spirits' territory.

35
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,560
It's my hometown.

36
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,560
By the way,

37
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,630
did you heal

38
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,190
my wounds?

39
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,510
I'm wondering...

40
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,840
how

41
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,430
you healed me.

42
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,750
I don't know what happened.

43
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,190
Really?

44
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,190
Master, I'm your loyal disciple.

45
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,510
I'll never lie to you.

46
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,120
Since

47
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,240
you're so loyal to me,

48
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,950
why don't you

49
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,800
become my puppet wood

50
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,830
and take the pain for me?

51
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,150
How about that?

52
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,790
Well,

53
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
are you reluctant

54
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,070
or scared?

55
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,270
You weren't like this

56
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,680
when you cast

57
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,920
Puppet Wood Spell on me!

58
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,640
Master,

59
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,510
I don't know what you're talking about.

60
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,600
You don't have a heart.

61
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,270
You only have

62
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,070
the Skull Spring's heart.

63
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,160

and light up the Heart Ring.

83
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,000
you'd form an amber heart.

84
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,560
So, you gave me the ring

85
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,870

86
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,750

everything

178
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,080
has a reason,

179
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,390
and only I can save myself

180
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,510
from all the suffering.

181
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,790
I have to grow up eventually,

182
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,630
don't I?

183
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,550
By the way, you came back to reclaim

184
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,270

185
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:54,000

in this life anymore.

you'll fulfill your aspirations.

193
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,840
But I...

194
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,270
I'm going to break down
barriers and stereotypes.

195
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,030
Why do we have to be called demons?

196
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,320
Why can't an immortal marry a demon?

197
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,320
Why can't a woman

198
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,960
rule the world?

199
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,160
What about you?

200
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,150
I have something more important to do.

201
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,710
Take care,

202
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,800
Shancha.

203
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,390
I've found out

204
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,390
you were trapped by dark vines.

205
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,550
Powerful as they are,

206
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,600
they're always sleeping under the roots

207
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,790
and won't attack people.

208
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,200
I've finally found out

209
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,600
on that day, a little monster

210
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,790
saw the Yuxu Sect's head

211
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,320
casting a spell on the dark vines

212
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,750
in the Woods of Void.

213
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,030
Keep digging.

214
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,440
Aye.
