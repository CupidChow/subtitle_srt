3
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,230
We've got

4
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,790
the most important soul

5
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,110
so far.

6
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,790
We only need

7
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,560
two other souls.

8
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:41,910
Don't worry.

9
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:43,470
Everything

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,000
is going as planned.

11
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,200
We're so close

12
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:49,960
to success.

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,240
We can't make any mistakes.

14
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,280
Find a way

15
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,430
to lure them into
the ruins of Rakshasa Palace.

16
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:59,840
I can unleash

17
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,840
my full power there

18
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,870
and refine them all.

19
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,270
- Master.
- Master.

20
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,790
Shang You, Yinchen,

21
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,510
I have a mission for you.

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,430
Master, what's this?

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,150
It's an evil relic,

24
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,870
the talisman of the Ancient Rakshasa
Evil Deer.

25
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,400
Master,

26
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,590
is it about the Rakshasa Palace?

27
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,710
Yes.

28
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,760
Once opened,
the relic will absorb people,

29
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,200
and they'll teleport to
a world of voids

30
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,000
and experience another lifetime
of love, hatred, anger, and stupidity.

31
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,310
If anything goes wrong,

32
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,590
they'll be

33
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,310
stuck in the formation forever.

34
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,950
You're going to destroy this thing
at the Rakshasa Palace

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,790
to prevent it from harming people.

36
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,150
Now,

37
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,950
I'm going to teach you

38
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,350
the spell to destroy it.

39
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,120
Ziheng.

40
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,470
What has Master been doing lately?

41
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,280
Master?

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,470
You're so useless!

43
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,960
Ziheng...

44
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,800
I brought you back.

45
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,310
Let me go!

46
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,630
Ziheng!

47
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,590
Yin,

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,840
are you okay?

49
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,870
Sorry.

50
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,080
Sorry.

51
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,520
I was out of my mind.

52
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,150
I wanted to help you,

53
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,710
but I was too anxious.

54
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,190
Are you okay?

55
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,800
I'm okay.

56
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:55,700
Please don't blame me, okay?

57
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,080
Yin,

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,430
please help me.

59
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,520
When I find out Master's secret,

60
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,080
I'll definitely avenge you.

61
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,150
I'm

62
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,280
going out with Ziheng tomorrow.

63
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,960
Stay in the Yuxu Sect

64
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,000
and practice the magic I taught you.

65
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,150
Master,

66
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,430
where are you going?

67
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,120
We have to fulfill a mission

68
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,630
Master gave me.

69
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,840
Can I go with you?

70
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,750
No.

71
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,910
It's dangerous.

72
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,430
You're just a mortal.

73
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,430
You can't go.

74
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,680
Master,

75
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,400
please give me a chance
to improve myself,

76
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,840
okay?

77
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,270
Zhixun.

78
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,510
Step back.

79
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,480
Don't get hurt.

80
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,240
Yes, Master.

81
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,370
- Break!
- Break!

82
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,710

83

91
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,230
Wan, take a seat.

92
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,040
Your Majesty, do you want to try

93
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,800
the osmanthus wine I just made?

94
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,750
Is it good?

95
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,790
Yes.

96
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,440
Report!

97
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,560
Your Majesty, Prince Jing
started a mutiny.

98
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,750
They're already here!

99
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,390
Where are the Royal Guards?

100
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,040
They've all surrendered.

101
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,950
It was Commander Mo Feng

102
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,910
who opened the gate.

103
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,680
Wan, don't be afraid.

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,800
I'll let the Shadows take you out.

105
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,480

106
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,560
