1
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:14,389
(I'm screwed)

2
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:16,474
Yoon...

3
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:22,355
Is this your type?

4
00:00:24,826 --> 00:00:29,036
[One week ago]

5
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,467
Mr. Han

6
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,384
I’ll be heading out

7
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,052
Yeah

8
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:52,594
Okay

9
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,346
You’ve worked hard under me

10
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,645
Keep in touch sometimes, okay?

11
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:03,438
I’ll get going now

12
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,481
Mm-hm

13
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,505
Hello, Director?

14
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,423
Don’t you think this is too much for me?

15
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,634
Sure, the company is going under, but still

16
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:37,430
How am I supposed to handle all these partnerships on my own?

17
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,557
What?  

18
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,267
How’s this my fault that the team left?

19
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,394
They love me!

20
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,443
What? 

21
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:52,779
Just one?

22
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,197
One..

23
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,573
One person?

24
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,867
What am I supposed to do with just them?

25
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,619
Go on a date or something?

26
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,329
Fine, fine!

27
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,205
I can’t do this

28
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,164
I might as well quit

29
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:03,998
Ugh, I’m hanging up!

30
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,335
아..

31
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:10,004
Unbelievable

32
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,299
Oh, Hwang

33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,676
Wait

34
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,261
Don’t tell me you’re the one being sent here?

35
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,639
Of course, working with you would be great

36
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,139
But..

37
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,433
Am I that popular at headquarters?

38
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,434
Right

39
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,310
So..

40
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,688
What brings the star of recruitment

41
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,107
To this sinking team?

42
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,990
Hello

43
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,408
I’m Yoon Su-an

44
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,701
Sent from the Support Team to assist Sales Team 2

45
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,871
It’s a three-month temporary assignment

46
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,080
But the transfer notice is official

47
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,666
You’ll show up as part of Sales Team 2 on the internal system

48
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,584
Su-an

49
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,086
Here is one of the stars of the Support Team, Mr. Han

50
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,130
Really?

51
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,266
Mr. Han

52
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,684
I have a meeting, so I’ll be heading out first

53
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,394
Yeah

54
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,104
See you later

55
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,988
Nice to meet you. 

56
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:22,452
I’m Han Woo-jin, the leader of Sales Team 2

57
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,747
Nice to meet you

58
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,400
Is there anything you need me to do?

59
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,069
He speaks

60
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,278
What?

61
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,907
You’ve been so quiet

62
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,952
Do you have a girlfriend, Yoon?

63
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,751
No

64
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:13,878
Why not?

65
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,505
You’re cute

66
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:24,764
Oh?

67
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,140
Lgnoring me, huh?

68
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,528
Sorry

69
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,539
I’ll be leaving first

70
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,207
Yeah, take care

71
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,561
Good morning

72
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,980
Good morning

73
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,357
Good morning

74
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,027
Good morning

75
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:19,944
Good morning

76
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,738
Good morning, Su-an

77
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,073
I’ll be heading out first

78
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,075
I’ll be heading out first

79
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:27,535
I’m leaving now

80
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:28,411
Take care

81
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,246
I’ll be heading out first

82
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,249
I’ll be heading out first

83
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:34,542
Have a good evening

84
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,009
At least he’s got good manners…

85
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,821
[Back to the present]

86
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,650
Su-an

87
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,486
Can you send me the list of companies

88
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,488
we worked with on handwritten contracts?

89
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,209
It’s in the folder named ‘Handwritten_Underbar_Client List'

90
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,210
Thanks

91
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,055
This..  
90

92
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,057
Isn’t a client list...

93
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,642
This is… your preference list, Yoon?

94
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,933
Hey, Yoon

95
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,518
What does it feel like to kiss a guy

96
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,191
What kind of question is that?

97
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,194
You’re the only guy

98
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:28,239
I know who’s kissed another guy

99
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,751
Take this home, read it carefully and..

100
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,087
Give me your honest thoughts, alright?

101
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,924
We’ll hit it big and

102
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:47,967
Go on vacation

103
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,097
India, the Philippines, Brazil,

104
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:56,392
France, Thailand, Mexico, Indonesia

105
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,269
Just name it

106
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:28,799
(Ah...)

107
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:29,800
(Damn Ji-yoon…)

108
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,192
This isn’t mine

109
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,781
Then is it mine?

110
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,749
Maybe so

111
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,710
I’ll unlock the client list and 

112
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,463
Send it to you via messenger

113
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,475
Wow...

114
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,601
Incredible!

115
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:25,189
These guys are handsome

116
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,486
You’re into this kind of thing?

117
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,989
Wow, this is amazing

118
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,241
Look at this... Big... Huge..

119
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,451
Are you sure it's not a tumbler?

120
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:42,999
Does this even fit in there?

121
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:44,875
Wow, it fits!

122
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:46,627
Why?

123
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,587
Let’s watch it together

124
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,879
It’s not mine

125
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,799
I apologize for the inappropriate content

126
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,926
I’ll return it to its owner

127
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,304
I’ll be heading out first

128
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,187
Enjoy

129
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,023
Have a good time, Su-an~

130
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,461
Hah... fuck

131
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:33,549
I really can’t stand him right now
