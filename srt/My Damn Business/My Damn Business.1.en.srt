14
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,240
{\an8}Is this your new job?

15
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,409
{\an8}No, I...

16
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,995
{\an8}-[Si-kyung] How did you get in there?
-I wanted to surprise you.

17
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,830
{\an8}I asked them if I could come in here.

18
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,415
{\an8}You look great under the red light.

19
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,541
{\an8}-[Dong-youp] Really?
-Yes.

20
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,544
{\an8}The ambience here is something else.

21
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,171
{\an8}-It's just so different.
-[Dong-youp] Mm.

22
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,257
{\an8}-Everything looks so red here.
-[Si-kyung] So red.

23
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,217
{\an8}[Dong-youp] Right?

24
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,428
{\an8}We're in Amsterdam, Netherlands,

25
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,096
{\an8}in the famous Red Light District.

26
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,307
{\an8}-This is my first time in the Netherlands.
-Same here.

27
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,391
{\an8}I've only been to Germany.

28
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,144
{\an8}We went to Japan in Season 1,

29
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,146
{\an8}and then Taiwan in Season 2.

30
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,483
{\an8}[Dong-youp] We visited Asian countries,
which are closer to us at heart.

31
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,568
{\an8}But Season 3 feels totally different.

32
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,945
{\an8}RISQUÉ BUSINESS SEASON 3:
THE NETHERLANDS AND GERMANY

33
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,988
{\an8}[Si-kyung] I think this is
the end of the line for me.

34
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:57,158
{\an8}-We can't top this.
-[Dong-youp laughs] Right.

35
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,203
{\an8}I heard the Netherlands
was the first to do a lot of things.

36
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:05,583
{\an8}It became the first country in the world
to legalize sex work in 2000.

37
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,168
[Si-kyung] They legalized
same-sex marriages very early.

38
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,087
-[Dong-youp] They were the first.
-[Si-kyung] I think it was in 2001.

39
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,673
{\an8}-They legalized cannabis as well.
-They did.

40
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,633
{\an8}[Si-kyung] Be careful of
the "coffeeshops" here.

41
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:14,592
{\an8}[Dong-youp laughs]

42
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,262
{\an8}-They're not just for coffee.
-No.

43
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,681
[sensual music playing]

44
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,808
[Dong-youp] The cafés
where you can smoke cannabis

45
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,393
{\an8}are called "coffeeshops."

46
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,311
{\an8}If you're just trying to get coffee,

47
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,273
{\an8}you want to look for a sign
that says "café."

48
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,399
{\an8}CAFÉ: WHERE THEY SELL COFFEE

49
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,526
{\an8}So if you're a Korean tourist

50
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:35,905
{\an8}looking for coffee in Amsterdam,
please don't walk into a coffeeshop.

51
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,616
{\an8}Also, they'll kick you out
if you smoke cigarettes there.

52
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,036
{\an8}Cigarettes have unhealthy
chemical additives,

53
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,997
{\an8}-so they'll kick you out.
-Really?

54
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,874
{\an8}How do you know that?

55
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,792
{\an8}[trumpet blares comically]

56
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,127
{\an8}I don't.

57
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,545
{\an8}-You must've studied.
-Yes.

58
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:51,963
{\an8}-Gotta be careful.
-Exactly.

59
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,091
{\an8}-[Si-kyung] There's just so much red here.
-[Dong-youp] I know.

60
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:56,634
{\an8}[Si-kyung] So where are we going?

61
00:02:56,718 --> 00:03:00,555
{\an8}One of the sex workers here
agreed to do an interview with us.

65
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,397
{\an8}-[Si-kyung] Let's go then.

{\an8}-You wanna go in first?
-Okay.

{\an8}-So my name is Briana.
-Briana.

00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,603
{\an8}[in Korean] This is actually
our first time in Amsterdam,

82
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,064
{\an8}and we heard that the Red Light District
is really famous.

83
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,358
{\an8}[in English] And we know that
this place is really famous.

84
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:56,903
{\an8}Yes. It's very famous
for, uh, sex workers like me,

85
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:59,822
{\an8}and also for the clients
who want service sexual.

86
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:04,702
{\an8}So actually,
prostitution is prohibited in Korea.

87
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,996
{\an8}-Uh, here is legal.
-Legal, yeah.

88
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,959
{\an8}The Netherlands was
the first country in the world

89
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,127
{\an8}who legalized prostitution,

90
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,754
{\an8}so it's one profession.

91
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,631
{\an8}[Si-kyung in Korean]
So it's a profession here.

92
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,008
{\an8}So how did you start working here?

93
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,344
{\an8}[in English] Why did you decide
to get into this business?

94
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,680
{\an8}Because you are free here.

95
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,516
{\an8}So you don't have your boss,
nobody tell you what to do.

96
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,268
{\an8}I work when I want.

97
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,436
{\an8}-I come and go when I want.
-Ah.

98
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,564
{\an8}Okay, so do you have open hours
and closing times, like, what's...

99
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:38,486
{\an8}Yeah, but for the girls from the morning,
it's from 10:00 until 7:00.

100
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,450
{\an8}And from eight until three o'clock
in the night.

101
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,785
{\an8}Or five o'clock, depends.

102
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,249
{\an8}<i>Between this time,
you come and you go when you want.</i>

103
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,673
{\an8}[in Korean] Do you just wait at the window
until you get a client?

104
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,216
{\an8}[in English] Yes, I keep standing.

105
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,011
{\an8}DO YOU WANT TO TRY IT YOURSELF?

106
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,013
{\an8}-[laughs]
-I don't think this will...

107
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,016
{\an8}-Okay. Can I try?
-Yes, of course.

108
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,684
[Si-kyung in Korean] Let's give it a go.

109
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,769
{\an8}-[Dong-youp] Right here?
-Say, "Hello".

110
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,355
{\an8}[in Korean] Say hello. Go on.

111
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,941
{\an8}[in English] Uh, hello.

112
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,735
[Dong-youp] Oh!

113
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,069
[laughs]

114
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,656
{\an8}[in Korean] Could someone come in
if they like me?

115
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,949
{\an8}[in English]
No problem. You can take them.

116
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,367
{\an8}[laughs]

117
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,202
{\an8}But he doesn't have the license.

118
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,621
{\an8}[Briana] Yeah. You cannot work
without the license.

119
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,166
{\an8}You need the paper for work on the window.

120
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:36,461
{\an8}[in Korean] And the government
manages this business, right?

121
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,879
{\an8}[in English] Yes, of course.

122

Is there a reason why it's all red lights?

129
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,774
{\an8}Because, uh,
the beginning of prostitution,

130
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,693
{\an8}this red light,
to know where is sex worker.

on our way here.

137
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,459
{\an8}Blue light is for transgender.

138
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,960
Uh-huh.

[Dong-youp exclaims]

140
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,175
{\an8}[in Korean] Do you sometimes get clients
that are hard to deal with?

141
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:28,513
{\an8}Are they sometimes drunk
or simply distasteful?

142
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,974
{\an8}[in English] I speak nice with them
and I reject them very nice.

143
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,436
{\an8}-Maybe I say one big price.
-[exclaims]

144
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,521
{\an8}[Si-kyung] Like how much?

145
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,481
{\an8}I don't know, 500, 700.

146
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,150
{\an8}[Si-kyung] So if you don't like
the person, you reject nicely

147
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,735
{\an8}or say a higher price.

148
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,655
{\an8}If you like the person,
the price goes down?

149
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,490
{\an8}No, minimum price is 100.

150
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,659
{\an8}So just coming in costs 100.

151
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,576
{\an8}[Briana] Yeah.

152
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,036
{\an8}And it goes up to...

153
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,122
{\an8}-No limit.
-No limit? Oh.

154
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,665
{\an8}It's minimum 100.

155
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,167
{\an8}If you want sex, it's plus 100.

156
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,585
{\an8}If you want, I don't know...

157

00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,966
{\an8}[Dong-youp] Mm.

159
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:09,220
{\an8}[Briana] So you want to come with me
in my room?

160
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,555
{\an8}Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

161
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:14,016
{\an8}Welcome. This is my room.

162
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,936
-Oh.
-Aah.

165
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:27,405
{\an8}So this is your private room?

166
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:30,324
{\an8}Yes. So, here is my... The rules.

167
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,869
{\an8}-[Si-kyung] Can I see it?
-[Briana] Yes, of course.

168
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,665
HOUSE RULES FOR VISITORS

169
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,000
[Si-kyung in Korean]
<i>You have to be respectful.</i>

170
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,669
<i>Sex workers have the right to say no.</i>

171
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,505
-<i>You must use contraception.</i>
-[Briana in English] <i>Everything is safe.</i>

172
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,924
[Si-kyung in Korean] <i>They can't force
sex workers to drink or take drugs.</i>

173
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,052
<i>Intoxicated or drunk clients
will be rejected.</i>

174
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,973
<i>There are also transgender workers here,
and you can ask the workers about them.</i>

175
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:56,225
<i>That one's about your sexual orientation.</i>

176
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,186
{\an8}<i>Sex workers must be
regularly tested for STDs.</i>

177
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,855
{\an8}<i>You can ask them
to show you their test results</i>

178
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,899
{\an8}<i>if you want to see them.</i>

179
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,985
{\an8}[in English] So you have to...
You can show the customers about

180
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,737
{\an8}-your test results if they ask.
-Yeah, yeah.

181
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,696
{\an8}Mm.

182
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,073
{\an8}This is the button for panic.

183
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,408
{\an8}[Dong-youp in Korean]
Ah! So that's what it's for.

184
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,702
{\an8}-[Si-kyung in English] Don't, don't.
-Don't touch it.

185
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:19,123
{\an8}[Briana] If we have problem,
or one client gets aggressive,

186
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,209
{\an8}we push the button and in...

187
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,961
{\an8}one minute, two minutes maximum,
come police.

188
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,130
[crowd chattering]

189
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,260
ALL AREAS BESIDE THE ROOMS
ARE UNDER CCTV SURVEILLANCE

190
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,679
AND SECURITY IS ON STANDBY
FOR EMERGENCIES

191
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,099
{\an8}-Have you ever used it?
-No. Never.

192
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,809
{\an8}[in Korean]
Has the client ever pressed it?

193
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,187
{\an8}[laughs]
[in English] No. Never. No.

194
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:45,441
{\an8}[in Korean]
Do you pay rent to use this room?

195
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,319
{\an8}[in English] We pay everyday 110.

196
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,404
{\an8}-[in Korean] So this place is rented.
-I see.

197
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,114
{\an8}[in English] When we go to the office,

198
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,910
{\an8}we pay 110, we show our paper,

199
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,580
{\an8}and after, they will give us the key.

200
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,543
{\an8}<i>And we come in the room
and we start the job.</i>

201
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,837
{\an8}And you work as much as you want,
then you take the rest.

202
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,172
{\an8}Yes, of course.

203
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,382
{\an8}And then you have to pay tax.

204
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,093
{\an8}Yes, tax, 21% from everything.

205
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,095
{\an8}-[in Korean] It's 21%?
-[in English] Yes.

206
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,222
{\an8}So how many customers do you take?

207
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,640
{\an8}Every day, it's different.

208
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,059
{\an8}In one day, you can have zero,

209
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,812
{\an8}in one day, you can have nine, ten.

210
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,982
{\an8}Maybe can come one client
and can give you 1000

211
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,608
{\an8}-and you go home.
-[in Korean] Makes sense.

212
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,026
{\an8}[in English] So every day is different.

213
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,989
{\an8}I hate when the client, they come,

214
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:36,075
{\an8}they ask my price and I say,
"Yeah, it's minimum 100."

215
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:43,207
{\an8}And they say, "Eighty?" and
maybe in one day, I say, "Okay, come."

216
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,671
{\an8}And they give me 100 anyway, the rest.
[chuckles]

217
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,382
{\an8}This, I don't understand.
But they have more money.

218
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,425
{\an8}[in Korean] They're misers.

219
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,468
{\an8}[in English] When you go to... to haircut,

220
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:58,222
{\an8}and him tell you, "Fifty euro,"
you don't say, "Come, 25 please."

221
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,141
{\an8}-[laughs]
-[in Korean] You don't do that

222
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,475
{\an8}-for a haircut.
-Right.

223
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,810
{\an8}[Si-kyung in English] It makes sense.

224
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,479
{\an8}[in Korean] Were there any
particularly memorable clients?

225
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,482
{\an8}[in English] One client, him come
and him don't want nothing.

226
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,902
{\an8}What I can do with one man
who don't want nothing?

227
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,822
{\an8}-Oh, so no sex, just talk?
-Only speaking.

228
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:18,117
{\an8}So, and him start to speak with me
about his wife,

229
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,119
{\an8}because they don't have good relation.

230
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,205
{\an8}-So you're a counselor. Like, adviser.
-Yes.

231
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,416
{\an8}After long time,

232
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:29,920
{\an8}him come with she, and they say,
"Thank you" for me because I save...

233
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,255
{\an8}He came here with her?

234
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,214
{\an8}Yes, with her.

235
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,259
{\an8}That's...

236
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,761
[laughs]

237
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,554
{\an8}[Si-kyung in Korean]
They're so open-minded.

238
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:44,185
{\an8}People seem to be open-minded
about sex in the Netherlands,

239
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:47,980
{\an8}but there must be people
who frown upon sex work, right?

240
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,523
{\an8}Q. ARE THERE PEOPLE
WHO FROWN UPON SEX WORK?

241
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,526
{\an8}[interviewer in English]
Could you briefly introduce yourself?

242
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,613
{\an8}Yes, sure. My name is Angela.
I'm a sex worker from the Netherlands.

243
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:58,532
{\an8}My name is Saskia, and I'm a sex worker.

244
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,077
{\an8}Um, unfortunately,
there are a lot of misconceptions

245
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,703
{\an8}and stigma around sex work.

246
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,414
{\an8}And a lot of people have a, still,
a negative view on it.

247
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,375
{\an8}"They're dirty. They're uneducated."

248
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,044
{\an8}That, "They don't like it.
It's stupid. You're a slut."

249
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,880
{\an8}And also, a lot of times,
they think you <i>just</i> do it for the money

250
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,423
{\an8}because you need fast cash.

251
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,925
{\an8}Obviously, money is a motivator,

252
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,718
{\an8}But I'm basically just...

253
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:21,389
{\an8}Simply put, using my body
in another way to get money

254
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,349
{\an8}just like every other worker.

{\an8}If you're a painter,
you're using your arms.

256
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,811
{\an8}Even if you work in an office,

257
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,604
{\an8}you use your fingers
to type on the computer.

258
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,648
{\an8}You have a nurse, you have a gardener,

259
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,066
{\an8}and I'm a sex worker.

260
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,734
{\an8}What's negative about it?

261
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,029
{\an8}Some person, they are not okay with this,

262
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,572
{\an8}but I understand everybody, no?

263
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,573
Mm.

264
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:43,411
{\an8}Also me, when I... Before to start
this job here on the window,

265
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,495
{\an8}I think,

266
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:49,875
{\an8}"How one girl can stay in the front of
one window and can sell her body?

267
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,421
{\an8}But when you come inside,
you see it totally different.

268
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,424
{\an8}It's different.

-Exactly.

-Hello.

00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,395
{\an8}[journalist] Hi.

284
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,605
{\an8}I am Djanlissa Pringels.

285
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:56,233
{\an8}I am a journalist,
and I mainly write about sex, intimacy,

286
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,652
{\an8}and also about sex work in De Wallen.

287
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,572
{\an8}And sometimes,
I also try out things myself,

288
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,658
{\an8}-but I just try it for the article.
-Ooh!

289
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,994
{\an8}[in Korean] A true professional.

290
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,204
{\an8}[in English] Oh, thank you.

291
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,914
{\an8}And you're from this town.

292
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:13,876
{\an8}Yes. Actually, I used to live
in the street there.

293
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,670
{\an8}[in Korean] So there are residents
who live up there, right?

294
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,088
{\an8}[in English]
So normal people live up there?

295
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,674
{\an8}Yes. Also, in these houses,

296
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,052
{\an8}sex workers work here,
but they also live here,

297
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,180
{\an8}and there are also other residents
that just live here in these houses.

298
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,932
{\an8}[in Korean] Is it always so crowded here?

299
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,768
{\an8}[Djanlissa in English] Yes.
This area is very crowded, very busy,

300
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,646
{\an8}and especially during the weekends
when all the tourists come over.

301
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:37,274
{\an8}Because Amsterdam has
roughly 20 million yearly visitors

302
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:40,778
{\an8}and a big chunk of them
go to the Red Light District.

303
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,196
{\an8}-[Si-kyung] Twenty million?
-[Djanlissa] Yes.

304
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,572
{\an8}Especially during the weekends,

305
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,699
{\an8}there were times
that I just couldn't leave my house.

306
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:49,161
{\an8}I had to push out tourists
that were sitting in front of my house,

307
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,456
{\an8}-smoking weed or eating some waffles.
-[laughs]

308
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,627
{\an8}[in Korean] I'm curious about

309
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,754
{\an8}what the residents think about
the sex workers here.

310
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:01,423
{\an8}[in English] What do the people think
about the sex workers that's...

311
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,300
{\an8}I think sex work is work,

312
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:06,428
{\an8}and it should be viewed
as just a normal profession.

313
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,681
{\an8}-It's a very old profession as well.
-Yes.

314
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,683
{\an8}[Djanlissa] So I think it's proven
time and time again

315
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,227
{\an8}that if you criminalize it,
it just goes underground.

316
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,646
{\an8}-Mm-hmm.
-But just because it's legal

317
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,691
{\an8}-doesn't mean it's widely accepted.
-Mm-hmm.

318
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:21,527
{\an8}There are a lot of
different opinions on sex work.

319
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,445
{\an8}More conservative view,

320
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,908
{\an8}people thinking that it's not proper
as women to stand behind a window.

321
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:31,036
{\an8}But also,
you have the vast majority, by far,

322
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,038
{\an8}the more liberal way of thinking.

323
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,540
{\an8}If it's a freedom of choice,

324
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,917
{\an8}then please do it,
and do it in a safe way.

325
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,377
{\an8}Regardless of regulations,

326
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,254
{\an8}things are always going
to slip through the cracks.

327
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:44,633
{\an8}And maybe these women aren't
as safe as they're made out to be.

328
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:49,638
{\an8}I think sex work, in a way,
is a little bit, um, exploitative,

329
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,640
{\an8}and perhaps objectifying women.

330
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,809
{\an8}Okay, you can hide it away,

331
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,394
{\an8}but it doesn't help.

332
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:59,023
{\an8}If you make it too bad,

333
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:02,359
{\an8}you will see that it will be underground.

334
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,862
{\an8}They're someone's mother.
They're someone's sister.

335
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:05,863
{\an8}These are women,

336
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,240
{\an8}and they're basically
just neighbors for everyone around here.

337
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,951
{\an8}There's nothing wrong with sex workers,

338
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,412
{\an8}with the way they do their work.

339
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:16,332
{\an8}But we would love to get rid of

340
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,710
{\an8}human rights violations and misbehavior.

341
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:24,590
{\an8}What did you think of
seeing all the sex workers

342
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,050
{\an8}while you walked through the streets?

343
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:31,055
{\an8}Actually, I'm not really used to it.
But we try to accept it as it is

344
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,264
{\an8}without prejudice.

345
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,975
{\an8}Yeah. I can imagine
it's maybe a culture shock,

346
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,769
{\an8}-but you get used to it very easily.
-[Si-kyung] It is...

347
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,520
{\an8}[in Korean] Is there a place here

348
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,773
{\an8}that you'd recommend that we visit?

349
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,441
{\an8}[in English] ...recommend a place?

350
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,444
{\an8}Well, you could go to the Casa Rosso.

351
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:48,322
{\an8}You might not have noticed
this big elephant.

352
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,865
{\an8}-[Si-kyung] That's a zoo, right? Elephant.
-[Djanlissa] Yes.

353
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,241
{\an8}Well, it's a live sex show.

354
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:55,120
{\an8}So you can have...
You can see people having sex on stage.

355
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,706
{\an8}Uh, so I really would recommend
you guys going.

356
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,125
{\an8}And maybe you could bring something
to put on your lap

357
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,460
{\an8}if it embarrassed.

358
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,003
{\an8}[Si-kyung] Uh, okay.

359
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,254
{\an8}This will do.

360
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,589
{\an8}-Yes, this will do.
-[laughs]

361
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,299
{\an8}[Djanlissa]
I think it's big enough, right?

362
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,509
{\an8}[Si-kyung] Yes, of course.

363
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:09,551
{\an8}Yes, perfect.

364
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,513
{\an8}You're all set. You're all ready to go,
and enjoy.

365
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,973
{\an8}-[Si-kyung] We will.
-Good luck.

366
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,599
{\an8}"Good luck"? What do you mean?

367
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,060
{\an8}Well, uh, just good luck.

368
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,730
{\an8}-[Dong-youp in Korean] "Casa Rosso"?
-[Si-kyung] It means "red house."

369
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,815
{\an8}Shall we?

370
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,697
{\an8}-Hello.
-[in English] Hi, guys.

371

{\an8}-Hello.
-Welcome to Casa Rosso.

372
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,157
Wow.

373
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,075
Wow.

375
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,788
{\an8}Casa Rosso is a sex theater.

{\an8}[employee] We've been open since 1968.

377
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,583
{\an8}So 50-plus years already.

378
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,751

383
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:54,013
{\an8}<i>The entrance is 60 euros per person.</i>

{\an8}<i>You guys will also get one drink included.</i>

385
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,851
{\an8}<i>And we basically have
a wide variety of sex shows.</i>

386
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,270
{\an8}<i>We also have a strip show, a banana show...</i>

387
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,816
{\an8}[in Korean] So when you say "sex show,"
do they really do it?

388
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,651
{\an8}[in English] Does "sex show" mean
they're actually gonna...

389
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,194
{\an8}Yes, we are. [chuckles]

390
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,447
{\an8}I get that reaction a lot,
but yes, we are.

391
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,991
{\an8}-[in Korean] So everyone reacts this way.
-[in English] Not me, so don't worry.

392
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,325
{\an8}-Not me.

{\an8}[employee] You guys can take
a seat here, please.

396
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,753
{\an8}Perfect. You're comfortable?

397
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,004
{\an8}[Si-kyung] This is very close.

398
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,172
{\an8}[employee] Good? Okay.

399
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,925
{\an8}[in Korean] I have another question
since the show hasn't started yet.

400
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,137
{\an8}What is the gender ratio of your audience?

401
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,347
{\an8}[in English] It's 60% guys, 40% girls.

402
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,975
{\an8}We also have families
that come here with their kids

403
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,602
{\an8}who are 18-plus, so don't worry.

404
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,687
{\an8}[in Korean] Parents bring
their children to the show?

405
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,022
{\an8}[in English] Sometimes,
it's the other way around.

406
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,356
{\an8}[in Korean] It goes both ways.

407
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,150
{\an8}Sometimes people bring their parents.

408
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,694
{\an8}[employee] Most of the time,
it's the children who take the parents,

409
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,654
{\an8}it's not the parents who take
the children.

410
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,199
{\an8}[in Korean] What a great way
to thank your parents.

411
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,242
{\an8}I can't believe
people bring their parents.

412
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,410
{\an8}It's unthinkable to us.

413
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,912
{\an8}[exclaims in surprise]

414
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,752
{\an8}[Si-kyung] It feels like
we're on a rollercoaster.

415
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,462
{\an8}Like right before the big drop.

416
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,718
{\an8}Could you ask them
if this is their first time here?

417
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,595
{\an8}-[in English] Yes.
-Where are you from?

418
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,555
{\an8}-The US. From Florida.
-[Si-kyung] Oh, okay.

419
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,557
{\an8}-I'm from Brazil.
-Wow, okay.

420
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,393
{\an8}[in Korean] Are there live sex shows
in Brazil too?

421
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,312
{\an8}[in English] No.
I'm pretty sure it's illegal.

422
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,313
-Mm.
-[guest] Yeah.

423
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:29,983
{\an8}One of the tour guides in Amsterdam,
he said this show was the best,

424
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,527
{\an8}-just cannot be explained.
-Wow.

425
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,780
{\an8}I was expecting more like
a stripping vibe, like dancing.

426
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,949
{\an8}And I spoke to my Dutch friends,
and they were like,

427
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,493
{\an8}"Yeah, no, no. It's way more sex."

428
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:40,828
{\an8}I'm scared already.

429
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,412

{\an8}-[laughs]
-Lucky her.

626
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,646
{\an8}And then we finish home.

627
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,648
{\an8}-Every day.
-He... Then he ejaculates.

628
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,025
{\an8}-[in Korean] They finish at home.
-That's where he does it.

629
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:15,610
{\an8}[in English] Not on this building.

630
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:18,446
{\an8}-But home, we finish.
-Every night at home.

631
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,156
{\an8}I don't have a turning bed at home.

632
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,825
[laughs]

633
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,576
{\an8}And you don't have to do this.

634
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,203
{\an8}-Well, sometimes.
-He does it sometimes.

635
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,372
{\an8}-Really?
-[Erica] Yes, he does it sometimes.

636
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,959
{\an8}-Actually, that was quite impressive.
-[Erica] Yes.

637
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,670
{\an8}Was there a moment when you felt like,

638
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,381
{\an8}"I made a good decision
that I decided to work at Casa Rosso"?

639
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:39,050
{\an8}It's always nice
when you see people smiling and leaving.

640
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,468
{\an8}Yeah, a nice experience.

641
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,513
{\an8}When people are smiling
and you can see in their faces...

642
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,311
{\an8}[in Korean] Sex is actually
a very important part of our lives.

643
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,689
{\an8}So it was very intriguing to see

644
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:59,362
{\an8}how the Netherlands
has turned it into a whole industry.

645
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,989
{\an8}-It's amazing.
-It really is.

646
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,032
{\an8}-Because Korea's not like that.
-No.

647
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,910
{\an8}And Dong-youp is always so busy with work.

648
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,913
{\an8}It was nice to see you
genuinely enjoy yourself for once.

649
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,540
{\an8}-Really?
-[Si-kyung] You look happy.

650
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:12,000
{\an8}-Can you tell?
-[Si-kyung] Absolutely.

651
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,585
{\an8}You're glowing right now.

652
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,336
{\an8}We're off to Germany tomorrow, right?

653
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,504
{\an8}I've been there before.

654
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,922
{\an8}Germany is just as good.

655
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,632
{\an8}Just as good as Amsterdam?

656
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:22,260
{\an8}We're going to Berlin.
That place is ahead of the curve.

657
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:25,013
{\an8}[woman 1 in English] <i>In Berlin,
you can literally do whatever you want</i>

658
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,347
{\an8}<i>without the fear of judgment.</i>

659
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:30,268
[Dong-youp in Korean]
<i>This is the hottest club in Berlin.</i>

660
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,312
{\an8}[woman 2 in German]
<i>Don't be shy. Put your hips into it.</i>

661
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,438
{\an8}[Shi-kyung in English]
<i>I don't know how to dance.</i>

662
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:34,689
[in Korean] <i>I wish I was a good dancer.</i>

663
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,275
POLYAMORY

664
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:40,236
{\an8}[in German] Alina is my wife,
and Melanie is my girlfriend.

665
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,571
{\an8}[in Korean] Hold on.

666
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,364
{\an8}[in German] It's simple. You just do this.

667
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,699
{\an8}[laughter]

668
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,992
{\an8}These are our children.

669
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:48,578
[in Korean] It's the husbands
who are holding the children.

670
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:51,206
[Dong-youp] <i>We were invited
to a party held by</i>

671
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,166
<i>the top female sex toy manufacturer.</i>

672
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:54,083
This one goes "brrr"...

673
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,211
And this one goes... [imitates suction]

674
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:59,088
Even for a man,
this sensation must be addicting.

675
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:02,008
[singing a tune]

676
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:03,718
{\an8}[in English] Right now,
I can't stop talking about masturbation.

677
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,011
{\an8}What's your desire level?

678
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,347
{\an8}You can't compare a sex toy to a partner.

679
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,599
{\an8}Actually, I don't think it's the enemy.

680
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,642
{\an8}I know.

681
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:14,062
{\an8}In the Netherlands, it's quite common
to have sex at your parent's house.

682
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:17,398
{\an8}It's not unusual
to have oral sex in the toilet.

683
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:21,194
[Dong-youp in Korean]
<i>They respect all kinds of sexual fantasies</i>

684
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,111
<i>in this world.</i>

00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,614
{\an8}[in German] <i>I will punish you
if you cross me.</i>

686
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,324
{\an8}-[in Korean] Yes, my queen!
-Yes, my queen!

687
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,284
{\an8}I'm sorry, Mom.

688
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,036
[muffled] I'll kill you
if you put that in my mouth.

689
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,789
-[slaps]
-[exclaims in surprise]

{\an8}[Si-kyung] <i>Are we really going to
a public bath in Germany?</i>

691
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,253
{\an8}[Dong-youp] <i>I hardly even go to them
back home.</i>

692

{\an8}BERLIN, GERMANY
BATHHOUSES

00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,339
{\an8}[Si-kyung] <i>The public baths here
usually don't have</i>

694
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,842
{\an8}<i>separate baths for men and women.</i>

695
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,809
{\an8}Dong-youp takes his clothes off
on camera all the time.

696
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,185
{\an8}Doesn't he look so comfortable?

697
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,897
{\an8}[Dong-youp] <i>Come on, Director.</i>

698
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,399
{\an8}<i>I want to be naked.</i>

{\an8}[Si-kyung] <i>I've never interviewed anyone
naked before.</i>

700
