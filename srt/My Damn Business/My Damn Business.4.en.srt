1
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,561
What's this?

2
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,480
It's a posture correction doll

3
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:29,029
I can't think of anything

4
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:29,654
Hey

5
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,781
give me some ideas before you leave

6
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:35,535
I don't know

7
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,496
Don't ask me anymore

8
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:40,373
So

9
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:43,835
what does it feel like to kiss a guy?

10
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,428
Sweet…

11
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,889
like soju flavor?

12
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,017
Crazy

13
00:00:59,017 --> 00:00:59,934
Oh

14
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:06,483
I asked a crazy guy

15
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,568
I should ask someone else

16
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,217
Su-an, does your back hurt?

17
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,511
Oh, yes

18
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,513
I hurt it yesterday while moving a sofa

19
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,183
Come here, let me press on it

20
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,559
Oh

21
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,895
I'm okay...

22
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,814
I'm a massage expert

23
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,690
Just lean against the desk

24
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,486
Really, I'm fine

25
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:52,654
Ah

26
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,322
Ah!

27
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,250
Wow

28
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,960
now you're doing it openly

29
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,173
Mr. Han!

30
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,261
I think there's a misunderstanding

31
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:16,970
Ah

32
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,850
Probably not a misunderstanding

33
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,685
Do you want to hang out after work?

34
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,271
I haven't gotten an answer yet

35
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,398
I... have a lot to do today

36
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,483
See you after work

37
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,677
아.. 맞다

38
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:01,764
Uh...

39
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,891
Su-an

40
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,602
I forgot I have a dinner appointment

41
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,979
with the Director tonight

42
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:10,690
Oh

43
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,733
okay

44
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:14,444
Sorry

45
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,154
I'll buy you something nice next time

46
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,573
It's okay

47
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,689
(See you tomorrow)

48
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,632
What?

49
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,011
Oh, come on

50
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,931
How could you date someone so young?

51
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,061
Tomorrow?

52
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,480
No, I have plans

53
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,148
See you on the weekend then

54
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,609
Me?

55
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:43,283
I prefer keeping things casual

56
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,498
Ha..

57
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,375
I have to hang up now

58
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,461
I'm going to drink with an old geezer tonigh

59
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,838
Yeah,

60
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,716
yeah, take care

61
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,936
Oh?

62
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:12,562
Take care

63
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,235
You smell like cigarettes

64
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,862
Oh..

65
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,739
sorry

66
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,665
Take care!

67
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,705
Bastard...

68
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,542
Yes, yes

69
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,335
That's right

70
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,961
That's correct

71
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,880
Mr. Kim, the CEO

72
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,508
Just this once, please

73
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:27,595
We've been doing business together for five years now

74
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:28,679
Oh, yes

75
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,014
Then I'll revise it

76
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,809
and send it over right away

77
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,560
Yes, yes, thank you

78
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,145
Okay, take care

79
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,482
Wow...

80
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,112
Why did you make a mistake you never make?

81
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,447
They understand because we've been working with them for a long time

82
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:49,033
If it were another company, they'd have accepted the report as it was

83
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,162
We're already going under. You should at least care about your reputation

84
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:56,332
to make sure you get a good job after this, right?

85
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,798
Always finish things well

86
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,220
I'm sorry

87
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,055
It's resolved, so it's fine

88
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,765
Sigh~

89
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,935
Once the business trip tomorrow is over

90
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,563
this will be the last of it

91
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,609
Uh... 

92
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,403
I'm going to step out for some fresh air

93
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:27,780
Okay

94
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,516
Oh, you

95
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,813
It's okay

96
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,398
We resolved it well

97
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:06,152
It wasn't work for two people anyway

98
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,238
so this kind of mistake can happen

99
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,075
When we go on the business trip tomorrow

100
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,994
it'll be our first time spending the night together

101
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,790
Tomorrow

102
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,876
you'll be mine

103
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,345
Ha..

104
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,513
This is a company

105
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,140
And

106
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,310
I don't like casual relationships

107
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,687
I'm not like you, Mr.Han

108
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,816
Find someone else

109
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,530
No, I...
