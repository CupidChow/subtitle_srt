1
00:00:00,625 --> 00:00:04,713
Oh, this is killing me...

2
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:06,172
Su-an

3
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:09,092
Can you get me some honey tea?

4
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:14,848
Did you drink alone?

5
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:37,037
Oh

6
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,747
I'm sorry

7
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:40,999
Su-an?

8
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,917
Oh? Mr. Park!

9
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:44,627
It’s been a while

10
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:45,670
How have you been?

11
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,588
I’ve been well

12
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,547
What about you?

13
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:57,390
This is Team Leader Han Woo-jin from Sales Team 2

14
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,559
And this is Mr. Young-chan Park, CEO of our partner company

15
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,352
It’s a pleasure, Mr. Han

16
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:02,437
I’ve heard a lot about you

17
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,855
Likewise,

18
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:09,569
I really appreciate you

19
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,528
coming all this way

20
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:11,654
But it must be exhausting for you

21
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,364
coming all the way down from Seoul

22
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,450
Mr. Han

23
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,077
Oh, not at all

24
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,621
Ah, Mr. Park, you don’t drink coffee, right?

25
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,040
Hmm… I prefer…

26
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,665
grapefruit...

27
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:23,708
...honey tea!

28
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,086
Iced, since it’s hot, right?

29
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,880
Thank you

30
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,442
So

31
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,152
to avoid traffic on the way back

32
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,695
shall we get straight to the point?

33
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,197
Sounds good

34
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,740
Here’s the contract

35
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,243
we need to go over

36
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,619
It’s just as we discussed

37
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,128
Looks like that’s the last of it

38
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:12,924
Sorry to bother you with these manual signatures for closing the delivery deal

39
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,884
Oh, it’s no bother at all

40
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:18,638
In fact, it’s nice to see Su-an after so long

41
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,056
Ah

42
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,600
How do you know Yoon?

43
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,478
Oh, he’s my senior from school

44
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,064
Oh, so just… school seniors and juniors?

45
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,732
Not “just”…

46
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,361
We were close

47
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:33,987
Su-an and I

48
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,454
Seems the office won’t leave me alone

49
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,790
I’ll just step outside for a moment

50
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,184
You two seem…

51
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,727
awfully close, don’t you?

52
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,812
Oh, do we?

53
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,106
Su-an used to follow me around

54
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,484
just like a little puppy going "yip-yip."

55
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,236
"Yip-yip!"

56
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:00,698
So… is Mr. Park here

57
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:03,201
trying to scout Yoon Junior Manager for your company?

58
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:03,910
Oh, no

59
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,789
our company is far too small compared to GND International

60
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:11,000
Someone as talented as Su-an would be too much for us to handle

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,544
Naturally

62
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,672
But, seeing as GND International is rumored to be in trouble…

63
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,424
It’s hard to predict what will happen these days

64
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,718
Nothing seems

65
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,349
to go as planned

66
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:26,975
right?

67
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:29,686
Well

68
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:33,439
even so, it should still look good on Yoon’s career

69
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,067
Better than going to some “no-name company,” right?

70
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,834
Uh… M-Mr… Mr. Park!

71
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,420
don’t you have a busy afternoon schedule?

72
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:56,170
Oh!

73
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,340
Yes, I should get going

74
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,053
Su-an

75
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,890
Let’s have a drink together sometime

76
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,315
Yes, I’ll get in touch next time

77
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,400
Well then, I’ll take my leave

78
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,068
Please, go ahead

79
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:19,944
Su-an

80
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,575
I’ll call you

81
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,493
Alright

82
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,427
Ugh

83
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,015
What are you doing?

84
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,662
You can’t smoke here

85
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,930
Why am I feeling so irritated?

86
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,724
We’re almost done with work now, aren’t we?

87
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,018
I don’t like seeing you

88
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,729
laughing and chatting with other guys

89
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,524
And just how close are you with that annoying guy?

90
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:40,775
Huh?

91
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,360
Annoying?

92
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,362
Young-chan isn’t like that at all

93
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:45,488
Hmp

94
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,573
Then what kind of person is he?

95
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:50,910
What’s so special about some college senior?

96
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,958
He was…

97
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,628
someone who helped me a lot

98
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:01,546
With advice on my failed relationship

99
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,259
That’s all?

100
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,344
Yes

101
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,013
just… a drinking buddy, I guess

102
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:14,934
From now on, only drink with me. No more drinking with him

103
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,561
It’s been over seven years since we were close

104
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,312
It’s been quite a while for me, too, you know

105
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,898
But I only joined Sales Team 2 three months ago

106
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,026
Ah~

107
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,612
I’d love to have a coffee brewed by Su-an

108
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,082
Are… are you crazy?

109
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,710
People are watching!
