1
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,884
Why… aren’t we starting?

2
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:14,431
It’s not every day we get to have a little drive-date, Su-an.

3
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,182
I can’t spoil the mood

4
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,605
So

5
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:23,565
what’s the deal?

6
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,778
That I’m just so light, like a feather, that if you blew on me, I’d just flutter away?

7
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:30,947
Are you calling me someone so light and flimsy?

8
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,907
When did I ever say that?

9
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:36,619
So, what? You’re saying you don’t want to meet up because I’m some lightweight?

10
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:37,996
Is that it?

11
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,171
I overheard you on the phone

12
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,761
I didn’t mean to eavesdrop

13
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,888
but you were talking pretty loudly

14
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:58,099
Phone call?

15
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,642
What call?

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,854
You said

17
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,316
"“What’s the point of dating some kid?”"

18
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,362
at the smoking area

19
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:16,868
Oh..

20
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,037
that!

21
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,295
Wait, that’s why you’re acting like this?

22
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,922
It was just a friend who owns a shop

23
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:32,092
He’s dating some part-timer ten years younger than him

24
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:35,595
“Hey, I’m dating this new kid at work”

25
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:39,682
You’re insane. Dating a kid?

26
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,686
Isn’t he like a total cradle-robber?

27
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:46,397
Well, there’s quite an age gap between you and me, too

28
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:47,732
That’s different

29
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,067
Seems the same to me

30
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,444
But I’m…

31
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,781
good-looking, right?

32
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,911
Not denying it?

33
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,247
I’ll take that as agreement

34
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:05,875
Then…

35
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,672
what did you mean by saying you liked it light?

36
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,507
This is so unfair

37
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:15,927
I have a hiking meetup on the weekend, and I want to dress lightly

38
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:16,845
It’s hot out, too

39
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,639
Hiking…?

40
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,265
Yeah

41
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,894
See you this weekend, then

42
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,312
Me? 

43
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,025
I like to keep things light

44
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,571
What do I need gear for?

45
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:38,199
I’m not climbing Everest

46
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,286
Look at this

47
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,707
Cool, right?

48
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,710
A guy who hikes and takes care of himself

49
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,425
Looks more like an old guy

50
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,520
Let’s go. Time to work

51
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,816
An old guy, huh…

52
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,464
Ugh, Chairman Choi talks way too much

53
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,508
If he wanted me to just read emails

54
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:40,094
why drag me all the way here?

55
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,017
Hey

56
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,106
Sit

57
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,237
I don’t lie on the bed without showering

58
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,781
Oh yeah?

59
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,368
Then go ahead and shower

60
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,135
Need any help?

61
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:29,644
No

62
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,980
Mr. Han

63
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,690
You can shower now

64
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:23,698
Mr. Han

65
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,451
Mr. Han..

66
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,958
You don’t like me because I’m some old guy?

67
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,634
I work out, you know

68
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,144
You smell like sweat

69
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,940
Ugh, annoying~

70
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,340
Do you have a spare razor?

71
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,300
Uh, yeah…

72
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:28,345
Actually

73
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:30,515
no

74
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,893
Really?

75
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,771
Guess I’ll need to get one at the convenience store

76
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,959
Whoa, nice

77
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,335
You went out and bought some?

78
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,005
Wow

79
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:06,717
Only one team member, and they’re amazing at their job

80
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,266
Cheers~

81
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,480
Ah, refreshing

82
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,774
One can isn’t enough, though

83
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:32,994
You’re the best…

84
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,498
Now drink!

85
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,887
I’m a bit tipsy…

86
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,055
maybe it’s from being tired

87
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,064
So…

88
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:05,943
you drink with anyone else?

89
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,493
Just… one or two friends

90
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,496
Not many

91
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,249
So…

92
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,671
ever been in a relationship?

93
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,515
Just…

94
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,559
kind of. Nothing special

95
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,730
So, not great, huh?

96
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,197
They were just…

97
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,199
bad guys

98
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,119
So…

99
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:57,954
any thoughts about dating?

100
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,713
Not anymore

101
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,554
I don’t know why…

102
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,933
I just seem to attract jerks.

103
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,311
Hey, that’s nonsense

104
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:26,941
Come on, tell me everything

105
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,902
I’ll badmouth them with you

106
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:30,402
Hmph..

107
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,239
Seriously

108
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,366
go on. Tell me

109
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,159
There was this one

110
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:37,910
He was always

111
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,290
going out with other guys

112
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,292
He cheated on me

113
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,585
He cheated… on you?

114
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:46,836
Go on, I’m listening

115
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,076
Are you asleep?

116
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,084
Well…

117
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,629
Just…

118
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,923
forget what I said earlier

119
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,136
Sobered up, huh?

120
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,683
Embarrassed?

121
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:52,985
Yeah…

122
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,533
Want a hug?

123
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,869
Don’t come over here

124
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,287
Fine

125
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:05,539
sorry

126
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,421
But is it true… you threw up in your ex’s car?

127
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,840
Oh, come on!

128
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,598
Su-an

129
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,018
I’ll be the good guy for you

130
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,062
Date me

131
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,444
…Okay

132
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,865
Good night
