1
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,816
If Writer Choi’s still up at this hour, then something must be wrong, right?

2
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:25,942
Hey!

3
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:30,572
I finally finished the ending

4
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,115
You feel good?

5
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,783
Totally

6
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,785
Congrats

7
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:37,495
It’s your last day at work, right?

8
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,247
Should I congratulate you too?

9
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,623
How do you feel?

10
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,085
Hmm..

11
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:46,629
a little

12
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:49,966
bittersweet

13
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,928
I think I’ll miss my bus

14
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:54,804
Let’s talk later

15
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,359
This time, it feels a little different...

16
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,829
Damn this company

17
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:23,333
I didn’t actually mean for it to go under

18
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,419
I imagine it must feel like a huge loss for you

19
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:31,549
After all this time, it’s become familiar

20
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:34,219
But, aren’t you reconsidering?

21
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,971
They said they’d transfer support team members to new positions

22
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:39,599
ones that fit their skills

23
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:43,853
I planned to resign from the start

24
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,147
And I’ve already received another offer

25
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:49,025
Always on top of things

26
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,151
Hold on

27
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,153
it’s not with that annoying guy

28
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:56,574
Mr. Park, is it?

29
00:01:58,743 --> 00:01:59,911
Huh?

30
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,080
Why aren’t you saying anything?

31
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:02,705
Huh?

32
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:04,499
If you go work for Mr. Park’s company

33
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,917
I’ll follow you there

34
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,710
No

35
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,213
I’m aiming to work in strategic planning

36
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,215
Phew~

37
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:13,967
Of course

38
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,928
you’re smart

39
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,847
That’s why you’re dating me

40
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,934
That’s not why

41
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:24,310
Why?

42
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,187
Why not?

43
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:26,980
What’s wrong with me?

44
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,067
Well, I’m much younger than you

45
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,237
and I’ve got more stamina

46
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:37,699
Is that…

47
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,410
a challenge?

48
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,995
Or…

49
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,710
are you tempting me?

50
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,174
Mr. Han, I’m here to help you pack...

51
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:01,181
Even if it’s your last day, the two of you really...

52
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,143
Alright

53
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,644
It’s not my business

54
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:10,648
Please return your ID cards, and at least grab a coffee with me before you leave

55
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,066
I’ll be hurt if you don’t

56
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:12,567
Sure thing

57
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,320
Then…

58
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,198
I’ll leave you two

59
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:23,244
Su-an here makes an amazing cup of coffee

60
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,455
The machine brews the coffee

61
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,664
after all

62
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,583
No

63
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,628
even from way back, your coffee always tasted different

64
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,255
Office coffee tastes the same everywhere

65
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,133
I wasn’t talking about office coffee

66
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,386
You

67
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,973
used to work part-time at a café near the lake, right?

68
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:45,516
Yes...

69
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,187
Wait, what?

70
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,824
They still haven’t checked?

71
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:02,367
Yeah

72
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,162
I told you, I already sent it

73
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,580
Welcome

74
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,793
I said I sent it last week, Wednesday! Why haven’t they checked it yet?

75
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:12,252
One sec

76
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,586
I’ll have an Americano

77
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,088
iced, to go

78
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,589
Coming right up

79
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,094
So when will it be done?

80
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,762
Your coffee is ready

81
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,638
Okay, get it to me by today

82
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:24,347
Alright, I'm hanging up

83
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,768
Thanks

84
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:32,730
Your coffee...

85
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,734
What?

86
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,111
Oh

87
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,529
Yes

88
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,321
Thank you

89
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,865
Goodbye

90
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:56,629
Tastes great

91
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,304
I used to go there often, just to see you

92
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,930
Don’t you remember?

93
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,059
I don’t remember

94
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,063
I was seeing someone back then,

95
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,648
and I was busy preparing for jobs

96
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,943
Ugh~ I don’t want to know

97
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,696
Hearing about my boyfriend’s ex is not fun

98
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,502
Are you comforting me?

99
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:40,381
We still have a lot to pack

100
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,543
I’ll go return our ID cards

101
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,087
Hmm?

102
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,046
Yeah

103
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:32,683
Here

104
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,787
Shall we go?

105
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,972
This is really the end

106
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:03,024
You know, I should’ve kissed you and done everything else here while I could

107
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,359
That kind of behavior

108
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:08,070
is exactly why the company went under

109
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,033
Is that so?

110
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,861
Since…

111
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,780
we’re already ruined anyway

112
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,872
I’m really ruined

113
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,876
You’re responsible for my life now

114
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,841
That line…

115
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,426
sounds kind of like an old man

116
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,322
Shall we go, for real?

117
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,787
I like you

118
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,622
Su-an

119
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,709
I like you too

120
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,295
Mr. Han
