1
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:08,466
Hah…

2
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:10,301
I really don’t want to go to work

3
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,155
Hah…

4
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:34,284
How long will it take to look through all of this? 

5
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:38,204
So, Su-an

6
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:41,624
nothing else interesting 

7
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,251
today?

8
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,712
I’m curious about the next episode

9
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:48,506
We have twenty vendor invoices to reconcile by tomorrow,

10
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:50,800
or we’re getting sued

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,594
Will I be the one getting sued?

12
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,013
This damn company should get sued, not me

13
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:59,893
It happened because Sales Team 2 missed some records…

14
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,103
that means the responsibility falls on you, too.

15
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,397
Yeah, yeah, I get it

16
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:06,775
Ah~

17
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,276
you know

18
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,986
if only someone would make me a nice

19
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,738
strong cup of coffee

20
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,823
to wake me up

21
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,038
Geez, what a dinosaur

22
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,082
Wait

23
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,083
did you just

24
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,125
call me a dinosaur?

25
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:24,959
So,

26
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,377
you want a ‘dino-sized’ coffee?

27
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,717
You… you little…!

28
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,819
Hey, Su-an!

29
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,570
Did you enjoy last night’s episode?

30
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:53,863
Wow

31
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,407
Su-an, as usual

32
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:57,826
you handle things with a bang

33
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,744
So,

34
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,371
what kind of style do you like, Su-an?

35
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,338
Hah… that damn USB...

36
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,345
Thanks for the coffee, Su-an

37
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:22,725
Wait a second…

38
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,145
You didn’t spit in this, did you?

39
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:30,900
Just kidding

40
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,277
I’ll enjoy it

41
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,285
Ah, you really do make one hell of a good coffee... almost feels familiar

42
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,079
It’s my first time making

43
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,914
coffee for you

44
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,501
So why doesn’t it feel like the first time?

45
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,671
It’s already perfect for my taste!

46
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,299
Keep the coffee coming, okay?

47
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:55,717
Hah…

48
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,219
As per the Labor Standards Act

49
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,138
tasks unrelated to my job

50
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,306
like fetching coffee

51
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,224
could be considered workplace harassment

52
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,684
Well,

53
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,352
that won’t do

54
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,103
How about this

55
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,814
for every coffee you bring me

56
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,150
I’ll give you a shoulder massage

57
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,693
Fair deal?

58
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,445
No

59
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,487
I’m really fine

60
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,531
Oh, come on, hold still

61
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,699
I’m the Sales Department’s

62
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,201
top massage expert

63
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,828
Nice, huh?

64
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,246
Your shoulders…

65
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,414
wow

66
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,707
they’re really tight

67
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,875
huh

68
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,752
Here are the export documents for the first half of the year, Mr. Han...

69
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,336
Ah!

70
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:40,637
Whoops..

71
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,600
I’ll just leave these here, sir

72
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,353
Huh?

73
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:01,991
What’s with him?

74
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,118
I’m really fine

75
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,828
No massages necessary

76
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:09,832
I’ll make coffee for you… voluntarily

77
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,836
Huh, I was just looking

78
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:17,799
for a way to get closer to you over coffee…

79
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,467
Why not just accept it this once? 

80
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,181
Alright then~

81
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,408
Hah...

82
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,659
Almost done…

83
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,998
Not exactly how I imagined

84
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:53,626
spending the night with Su-an

85
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,336
kind of a shame

86
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,173
I sent the files over Messenger.

87
00:04:59,173 --> 00:04:59,966
Please check

88
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,009
The files?

89
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,053
Are they…

90
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,056
okay for me to see?

91
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,183
Yes

92
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,436
I sent you a whole bunch

93
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:11,853
just two guys

94
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,104
bleep'-ing and then 'bleep'-ing

95
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,522
and all the way to 'bleep'-town

96
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,900
Also,

97
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,028
I already told you the USB isn’t mine

98
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,322
It was my mistake to bring non-work-related material

99
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,364
But

100
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,074
I apologized right away, didn’t I?

101
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,246
Your constant behavior…

102
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,040
is really making me uncomfortable.

103
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,178
I’m truly sorry.

104
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,012
Yoon.

105
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:52,477
I guess I’m still lacking, even at my age.

106
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,605
Let's wrap things up, and you can head home.

107
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,023
I’ll take care of the rest.

108
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:17,710
So..

109
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,713
I’ll head out now

110
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,048
Sure

111
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,508
you can come in later tomorrow

112
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,009
Great work tonight

113
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,446
Oh, heading out now, Su-an?

114
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,450
You guys stayed together pretty late, huh?

115
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,203
I had to finish some work by tomorrow

116
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,664
Hmm~

117
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:58,876
Mr. Han’s leaving soon, but he’s really going all out until the end, huh…

118
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,503
like that whole USB thing last time

119
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,714
USB thing…?

120
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,425
You didn’t know?

121
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,884
Mr. Han got in trouble with security for having some…

122
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,594
Manhwa?

123
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,763
on his personal USB

124
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,350
He got called up for a scolding and probably had to write an apology note

125
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,149
Someone like Su-an deserves so much more

126
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,276
anyway

127
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,485
take care on your way home, Su-an

128
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,402
Would you like…

129
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,571
… to grab a drink?
