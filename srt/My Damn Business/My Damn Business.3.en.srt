1
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:09,134
What's going on?

2
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,886
Su-an, you suggested we finish the drinks first?

3
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:20,645
Because of the USB

4
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,814
I heard you got into a lot of trouble

5
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:26,401
Oh, that?

6
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,652
Well

7
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:28,695
it’s true

8
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,071
that I looked into it carefully

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,450
Earlier

10
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,912
I was a bit rude

11
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:39,914
What are you saying?

12
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:41,499
It was my fault

13
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:45,587
Guess I’m getting to that 'old guy' stage where I talk nonsense

14
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:50,050
I apologize

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,259
It’s fine

16
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,095
Su-an

17
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,805
you handle your drink well

18
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:00,226
It’s been a while since I’ve had a drink with someone else, and it’s sweet

19
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:06,316
Let’s have a drink like this sometimes

20
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:09,861
Sure

21
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,907
Here, have another drink

22
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,487
[Han Woo-jin (Sales Team Leader 2): Su-an]

23
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,031
[Han Woo-jin (Sales Team Leader 2): how about a drink tonight?]

24
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:00,787
[Yoon Su-an (Support Team): Ah...]

25
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:05,291
Let’s go

26
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,212
Ah..

27
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:09,921
Yes

28
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,927
Let’s go get some soju

29
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,345
Pardon?

30
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:35,029
Let’s grab a cold beer

31
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,115
Ah, today…

32
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,783
Not beer?

33
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:39,784
Then, soju?

34
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,536
Great

35
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,829
let’s go to the place from last time

36
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,746
I’ll head out first

37
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:46,249
No...

38
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:49,961
Hah...

39
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,352
When you said we’d have a drink sometimes,

40
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,104
I didn’t expect it would be every day

41
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,272
Hey~

42
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,191
I won’t drink tomorrow

43
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,943
Tomorrow’s the weekend, though…

44
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,779
Then, if we drink on the weekend together…

45
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,072
No

46
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,490
Right?

47
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,414
Don’t you have anyone

48
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,665
Mr. Han?

49
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,375
Anyone?

50
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,668
You mean someone I’m seeing?

51
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,171
Nope, no one

52
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,631
No one I’m seeing

53
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,257
no family

54
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,800
just me on my own

55
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,013
Oh…

56
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,306
Oh

57
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,975
it’s not like I really have no family

58
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,185
I just cut ties

59
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,269
with them

60
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,191
My father left to find love

61
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:57,237
and my mother left to find freedom

62
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,738
and I was left here alone

63
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,539
You look like you’re watching a lost puppy

64
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:10,750
Ah

65
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,127
no

66
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,005
You don’t really know how to comfort someone, huh?

67
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,173
At times like this,

68
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,094
you just pour them a drink

69
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,442
Ah, yes

70
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,582
All it takes is to drink with them

71
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,390
It’s bitter

72
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,061
The taste of alcohol depends on

73
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,314
who you’re drinking with

74
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,273
and what kind of stories you share with them

75
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,528
When you drink with me

76
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,071
I hope it tastes sweet

77
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,318
Su-an

78
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,698
do you want to go out with me?
