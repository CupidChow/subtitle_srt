(X Theater)

00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,110
You again?

3
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,750
I've told you so many times.

4
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,970
You can blame your dad's death

5
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:02,880
on whoever you want,

6
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,270
but it's not related to our site.

7
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,750
He died on your site.

8
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,520
Who else should I come to?

9
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,760
Alright.

10
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,070
Go get an adult from your family.

11
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,550
There's no one else in my family.

12
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,470
It's just me.

13
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,590
Then I'll tell you one last time.

14
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,830
I don't have a single cent.

15
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,480
Sue me wherever you want.

16
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,800
I'm not leaving without money.

17
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,320
Then stand here all you want.

18
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,240
Let me remind you.

19
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,800
Our construction site

20
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,760
gets pretty wild at night.

21
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,270
Think carefully.

22
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,480
Time for the game.

23
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,710
Four of Characters.

24
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,340
Hey.

25
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,830
What are you doing up there?

26
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,110
Come down now!

27
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,990
Don't come any closer.

28
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,920
Take one step and I'll jump!

29
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,040
What do you want?

30
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,200
I want my dad's compensation money.

31
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,200
Come down first.

32
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,240
Give me the money first.

33
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,990
Just come down, okay?

34
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,960
Money first!

35
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,940
(Full-service arrangements)

36
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,200
I want the best service.

37
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:45,100
(Body Care Room)

38
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,940

(In memory)

40
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,260
(Qin, you'll always be
the best dad in my heart.)

41
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,620
(I want to be your daughter
in the next life.)

42
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,710
Hong.

43
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,320
Hong.

44
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,960
Hong!

45
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,880
Don't live like me.

46
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,760
Make your life shine.

49
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,910
Excuse me, let me through.

50
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,900
(Chencang, 2010)

51
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,520
Excuse me.

52
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,320
Coming through.

53
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,670
What are you doing?

54
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,790
- Watch out.
- What's going on?

55
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,880
Sorry.

56
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,030
Watch where you're going.

57
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,010
- Thanks.
- These are for Qin Hong's store?

58
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,270
That's quite a lot.

59
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,590
They might not sell.

60
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,120
Come back here.

61
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:05,840
Hong.

62
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,520
Do you think this looks good on me?

63
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,520
Yeah.

64
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,080
It's the latest style, really trendy.

65
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,830
Is this my size?

66
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,760
Yeah.

67
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,320
Okay, wrap it up for me.

68
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,390
The green one's 220.

69
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,790
The yellow one's 230.

70
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,350
Just give me both for 400.

71
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,190
Okay.

72
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,910
Oh, you said the size was off last time.

73
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,640
I got you a new one; have a look.

74
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,520
Take it home and see if it fits.

75
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,630
But my old one's at home.

76
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,160
No worries, just bring it with you

77
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,240
when you come by next time.

78
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:37,920
Careful, careful.

79
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,700
(Tian Cai)

80
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,640
Hong.

81
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,800
Coming.

82
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,630
Next time you come, let me know.

83
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,470
Sure.

84
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,710
- The last load?
- Yeah.

85
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,550
Put them here.

86
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,920
Goodbye.

87
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,760
- Bye.
- Come again.

88
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,710
Why always wear that silk scarf?

89
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,690
Aren't you feeling hot?

90
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,060
No, I get cold easily.

91
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,110
This is heavy; let me.

92
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,400
Only six months till the Gaokao.

93
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,510
Stop coming here.

94
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,400
Go home and study.

95
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,800
- Hong.
- Goodbye.

96
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,620
I don't want to take the exam anymore.

97
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,020
I want to run the store with you.

98
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,960
You're too young to do this.

99
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,240
Just study hard for the exam.

100
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,750
You're always so tired.

101
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,010
I just want to give you a hand.

102
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,080
Don't worry.

103
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,400
I'm fine; just focus on your exam.

104
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,240
Qin Hong.

105
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,710
You're both here.

106
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,230
What do you want?

107
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,070
What's up?

108
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,640
Your brother

109
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,400
knocked over my mannequin just now.

110
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,240
I told him off a bit.

111
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,350
Then he got all upset

112
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,990
and kicked my mannequin again.

113
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,110
Look what he did to this.

114
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,600
How am I supposed to sell it now?

115
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,520
Nonsense.

116
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,750
How could you say
our clothes wouldn't sell?

117
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,680
Watch your tone.

118
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,870
Du, this is nothing.

119
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,320
Tell me the price; I'll cover it.

120
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,640
820.

121
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,830
820? Isn't that too much?

122
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,350
What are you doing?

123
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,400
What's your problem?

124
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,510
Who told you to touch him?

125
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,470
Du.

126
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,080
My brother ruined your clothes.

127
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,680
I should cover your losses.

128
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,680
But you can't rip me off, right?

129
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,800
Who's ripping you off?

130
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,640
You are.

131
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,230
The wholesale price is 820.

132
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,440
820, really?

133
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,590
Maybe I should introduce
my supplier to you.

134
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:13,920
Your wholesale price is 820,

135
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,700
and you're adding profit
before selling it.

136
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,360
Isn't that misleading your customers?

137
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,280
That's insulting.

138
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,460
You're insulting me here?

139
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,470
That's not what I meant.

140
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,870
If you run your business like that,

141
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,300
no one will buy your clothes again.

142
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,350
You just don't want to pay.

143
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,000
It's not that.

144
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,450
I'll pay whatever amount it costs.

145
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,540
But you can't rip me off.

146
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,000
That's your attitude?

147
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,870
Guess we're not doing business
today then.

148
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,710
Alright?

149
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,400
Come on.

150
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,920
Come on, everyone, take a look!

151
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,000
This family

152
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,700
ruined my clothes!

153
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,080
How am I supposed to sell them now?

154
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,020
They don't want to pay!

155
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,290
Yeah, it's them. Remember.

156
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,160
What's your problem?

157
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,440
- I'll pay you.
- What now?

158
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,470
Don't get physical.

159
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,900
- Hit me here.
- What are you doing?

160
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,200
If you've got guts, hit me here!

161
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,040
Stop!

162
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,880
Don't start a fight.

163
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:49,890
Let go.

164
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,080
- Stop looking.
- Step back.

165
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,920
What are you doing?

166
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,040
Why get physical?

167
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,640
- What are you doing?
- What happened?

168
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,880
Nothing serious.

169
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,430
Her brother

170
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,320
just came to my store

171
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,510
and ruined my clothes,

172
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,680
so I came to ask her for compensation.

173
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,960
They don't want to pay.

174
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,280
I didn't do anything wrong, Kaifu.

175
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,470
I can pay.

176
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,420
But he's ripping me off.

177
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,880
I'm not.

178
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,060
I didn't ask for a cent more.

179
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,670
Do you believe me?

180
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:15,870
I do.

181
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:16,710
If you do,

182
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,830
leave this to me.

183
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,510
Tell me your answer.

184
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,630
Okay, Kaifu.

185
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,470
You decide.

186
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,830
Fine.

187
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,630
I'm doing Kaifu a favor.

188
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,560
Alright, leave now.

189
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,110
Thanks, Kaifu.

190
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,470
It's alright.

191
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,470
Don't cause trouble again; go home now.

192
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,500
It's over. Stop watching.

193
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,830
Got it.

194
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,040
Ms. Qin.

195
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,040
Don't be upset.

196
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,280
A while ago,

197
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,650
he asked me to help sort out
the blocking issue.

198
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,990
He'd surely do me a favor.

199
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,870
A pack of cigarettes is enough.

200
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,990
Business is business.

201
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,710
I said I'd compensate him, and I will.

202
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,320
300 yuan, thanks for handling it, Kaifu.

203
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,260
Please give it to him.

204
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,960
His clothes are worth at most 150.

205
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,400
300 is more than fair.

206
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,560
Thanks, Kaifu.

207
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,350
No need to thank me.

208
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,920
You really live up to your name.

209
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,800
Always honest and genuine.

210
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,510
A rainbow (Hong) after the storm.

211
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,750
Even your name sounds pleasant.

212
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,830
A Sennheiser speaker.

213
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,280
Such a great speaker.

214
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,630
There's a KTV across the street.

215
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,960
I heard they use Sennheiser speakers.

216
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,470
All imported.

217
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
Excellent sound quality.

218
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,230
When you have time,

219
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,280
let's sing a song.

220
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,800
Sennheiser.

221
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,000
Imported.

222
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,470
You looked into me?

223
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,820
I didn't.

224
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,750
If you didn't,
how'd you know I love singing?

225
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,680
I just asked around a bit.

226
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:19,670
Asked around.

227
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,800
Asked around?

228
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,040
So, if I don't sing this song with you,

229
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,200
you won't help me with this thing?

230
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,470
Those are two different things.

231
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,750
Singing is just singing.

232
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,870
Business is business.

233
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,200
You need to keep that temper
in check, okay?

234
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,630
Getting along with people matters.

235
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,630
You know that?

236
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,060
(Tian Cai)

237
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,820
(Tian Cai)

238
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:14,870
Alright, stay here.

239
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,400
Wait for my news, okay?

240
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,350
Liu.

241
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,070
You've been reported several times
for blocking the lane.

242
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,230
Do me a favor.

243
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,590
Sure thing.

244
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,900
(Tian Cai)

245
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,800
Ms. Qin.

246
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,790
Kaifu.

247
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:39,670
You wanted to see me?

248
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,070
What happened to the corner of your eye?

249
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,230
Two ladies from Third Street
got into a fight over a dress.

250
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,870
I stepped in to break it up

251
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,730
and got scratched.

252
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,640
It's nothing.

253
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,440
I'm quitting my job anyway.

254
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,560
I'm just tired of it.

255
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,920
Take a seat.

256
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,440
In our market here,

257
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,710
customers fight,

258
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,450
and merchants are against each other.

259
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,560
I've had enough of it.

260
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,560
If everyone here were
as level-headed as you,

261
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,400
managing would be a breeze.

262
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,920
Same as me?

263
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,710
Then you'd be out of a job.

264
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,830
That's fine.

265
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,080
Actually, I could invest in your store.

266
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,400
We could be partners.

267
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,950
Here.

268
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,120
You

269
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,440
won't be unemployed.

270
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,960
This market wouldn't run without you.

271
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,280
Does it hurt?

272
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,310
No.

273
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,550
It doesn't.

274
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,320
What do you need me for?

275
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,920
Nothing major.

276
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,280
I've been losing goods lately.

277
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,110
Not just once or twice.

278
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,710
We don't even have cameras here.

279
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,110
So, I was hoping you could find out

280
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,970
what's going on.

281
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,260
Someone's been stealing from you?

282
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,830
How bold.

283
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,680
Don't be scared.

284
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,590
I'll handle this.

285
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,350
I'm not scared.

286
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,000
Thanks, Kaifu.

287
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,560
No need to thank me.

288
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,870
I promise you this.

289
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,510
If you lose another dress,

290
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,960
I'll pay for it out of my own pocket.

291
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,120
Be careful.

292
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,040
Thanks.

293
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,920
Kaifu.

294
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,400
You guys eat.

295
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,160
I'm not hungry.

296
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,180
(Tian Cai)

297
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,040
Kaifu.

298
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,710
Aren't we being too obvious?

299
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:56,920
Not really.

300
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,750
How strange.

301
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,310
I've asked around the nearby stores.

302
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,790
They didn't lose anything.

303
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,790
Only her store lost something.

304
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,310
Kaifu.

305
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,990
Do you have a thing for Hong?

306
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,470
Eat your pancake and be quiet.

307
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,680
Stop!

308
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:37,920
Stop right there!

309
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,030
Stop! Don't run.

310
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,350
After him!

311
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,470
- Stop!
- Don't run!

312
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,310
Stop right there!

313
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,270
Stop!

314
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,710
- Stop!
- Don't run!

315
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,600
You two, block him from that side.

316
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,670
Go that way and catch him.

317
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,360
Stop!

318
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,310
Don't run!

319
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,550
- Over here, block the front.
- Got it.

320
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,790
Stop right now!

321
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,200
Stop!

322
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,880
Still trying to run?

323
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,070
Don't, don't.

324
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,960
You know me.

325
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,300
- Cut me some slack.
- You okay?

326
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,270
Cut me some slack.

327
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,310
So exhausting.

328
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,600
What a runner.

329
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,230
It's fine; hold on a bit longer.

330
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,230
We're almost there.

331
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,680
It's alright.

332
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,790
At least we caught the thief.

333
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,750
Driver.

334
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,790
Turn on the ambulance light.

335
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,790
Go straight to Chencang Sports Arena.

336
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,270
Why are we going to the arena?

337
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,270
I pulled some strings
and got us two tickets

338
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,790
for the concert of "The Same Song".

339
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,550
Nonsense.

340
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,400
We can't go there.

341
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,640
Driver, head to the hospital.

342
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,600
Don't listen to him.

343
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,170
It took me a lot of effort to get this.

344
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,020
Take a break.

345
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,230
What nonsense.

346
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,890
It's ridiculously pricey.

347
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,260
(Tian Cai)

348
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,120
Alright, come back next time.

349
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,990
Bye-bye!

350
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,200
Did you see Hong?

351
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,640
She hasn't opened her store for days.

352
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,070
Look at this article.

353
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,400
In the Yiwu Garment Market,

354
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,200
merchants have been losing

355
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,990
their goods lately.

356
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:50,550
After a thorough investigation,
Security Captain Zhao Kaifu

357
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,270
identified the suspect

358
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,120
and bravely captured the thief.

359
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,600
Peace was restored to the market,

360
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,030
and merchants finally felt relieved.

361
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,880
Everyone praised Captain Zhao,

362
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,990
saying he's such a great captain.

363
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,310
Stop teasing me.

364
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,750
A press release isn't like that.

365
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,750
Well.

366
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,980
The one I made up is like that.

367
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,360
Don't just eat.

368
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,710
Here, have some water.

369
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,350
Well.

370
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,040
Someone's gotta keep an eye

371
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,120
on your store.

372
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,540
You should go back now.

373
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,550
Alright.

374
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,060
I'll go once you finish your water.

375
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,230
Finish it.

376
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,400
I'm not leaving even if you've finished.

377
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,710
Then I'll take a walk outside.

378
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,710
Okay, I'll go with you.

379
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,310
Why?

380
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,200
To walk around with you.

381
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,230
That's not convenient.

382
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,600
Why?

383
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,880
I suddenly don't feel like going.

384
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,440
Why?

385
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,470
I just don't feel like it.

386
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,270
Zhao Kaifu, what do you mean?

387
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,440
You keep avoiding me.

388
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,160
Are we playing hide and seek now?

389
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,550
No, don't get the wrong idea.

390
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,680
I didn't mean that.

391
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,060
Alright, I won't overthink it.

392
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,030
I'll go wherever you go,

393
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,100
and I won't overthink it.

394
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,990
I'm going to the bathroom.

395
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,230
I'll give you a hand; let's go.

396
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,600
I'm going to the men's room.

397
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,960
I'll give you a hand.

398
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,600
Why would you go into the men's room?

399
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,120
What's wrong with me offering help?

400
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,070
Forget it.

401
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:35,920
What happened?

402
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,110
You're not going?

403
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,120
Then let's talk.

404
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,310
Sure.

405
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,400
What do you mean?

406
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,750
What are you mumbling?

407
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,230
You don't understand my condition.

408
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,790
I do. Of course I do.

409
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,990
The doctor

410
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,550
told me everything.

411
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,390
You just

412
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,400
got hurt a little.

413
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,510
What's the big deal?

414
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,170
The doctor said

415
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,400
everything's functioning fine.

416
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,750
What's the problem?

417
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,220
What kind of act are you putting on?

418
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,680
I just don't want to hold you back.

419
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,680
Since when do you decide that?

420
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,880
Shouldn't that be my call?

421
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,440
Are you playing the macho card now?

422
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,070
I'm not some macho guy.

423
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,660
I had my fortune told when I was a kid.

424
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,510
They said I'd be scared of my wife.

425
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,680
A man who's scared of his wife

426
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,550
can't really be macho.

427
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,440
Alright.

428
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,990
Keep pursuing me.

429
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:42,260
(Tian Cai)

430
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,550
80 plus

431
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,680
50.

432
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,590
Hong.

433
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,440
Kaifu got into a fight!

434
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,510
Zhao Kaifu!

435
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,600
Zhao Kaifu!

436
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,880

That's so tacky.

No, it's not.

458
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,120
It's super trendy!

459
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,880
You didn't get to see

Hong.

482
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,550
You're here.

483
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,840
When did this new place open?

484
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,200
Why didn't you tell me?

485
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,350
Danshun.

486
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,310
I set this up with Kaifu.

487
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,550
How does it look?

488
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:00,870
Danshun.

489
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,640
Though this is

490
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,840
our first official meeting,

491
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,920
your sister talks
about you all the time.

492
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,250
Come on.

493
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,230
Come over, have a seat.

494
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,310
Big guy.

495
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,340
Come on.

496
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,790
It's a good day; let's have a drink.

497
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,590
Come on.

498
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,160
You're too young to drink.

499
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,120
I'm 18 already.

500
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,400
Still no.

501
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,920
It's a day to celebrate.

502
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,790
Let him drink.

503
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,640
He's an adult now.

504
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,640
Hey, Danshun.

505
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,990
Come on, drink up.

506
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,160
Let's drink together

507
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,030
to Hong.

508
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,680
Thanks for letting me join the store.

509
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,900
Here's to us making big money.

510
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,960
And best wishes to our Danshun.

511
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,470
May your studies go well.

512
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,640
May you ace the exams.

513
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,840
Slow down.

514
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,630
Danshun.

515
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,640
In a couple of days,

516
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,990
the clothing store will open.

517
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:57,830
You should come by.

518
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,070
I'm not taking the Gaokao.

519
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,200
I've been learning tattooing.

520
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,700
That's what I'll do after graduation.

521
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,880
Who told you to skip the exam?

522
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,870
You didn't even talk to me
before you made that decision?

523
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,920
You have to take the exam.

524
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,840
You didn't talk to me
about your stuff, either.

525
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,070
That's not the same thing.

526
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,120
If you stay here all day,

527
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,410
what kind of future can you get?

528
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,740
Aren't you also staying here?

529
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,360
Does that mean you've got no future?

530
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:25,990
Watch your tone.

531
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,960
Don't get worked up.

532
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,600
Let's talk it through calmly.

533
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,600
I'm done eating.

534
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,750
Don't touch my head again.

535
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,680
Danshun.

536
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,460
Ignore him; just eat.

537
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,350
Eat.

538
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:50,440
In business,
we make money through harmony.

539
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,960
- Right?
- Right.

540
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,040
- Come on.
- Good.

541
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,810
Wishing you a booming business.

542
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,600
Thanks, everyone.

543
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:59,230
We'll look out for each other, okay?

544
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,400
Sure.

545
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,900
Wishing you a booming business.

546
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,130
Thanks.

547
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,550
Who arranged these flowers?

548
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,710
What did I tell you yesterday?

549
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,400
Move it in.

550
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,120
You step out a little.

551
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,990
Good, Captain.

552
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,310
Still got your old skills.

553
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,340
You took some time off?

554
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,360
Of course.

555
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,640
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.

556
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,870
Here, your favorite.

557
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,310
Liu.

558
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,220
(Tian Cai, Grand Opening)

559
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,050
Come on.

560
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,230
Go inside and check on my girlfriend.

561
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,710
- Who?
- My girlfriend.

562
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,200
You're so quick.

563
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,310
You've found a girlfriend?

564
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,150
Hong.

565
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,440
Hong.

566
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,680
Take your time.

567
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,490
My buddy from the army.

568
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,060
A municipal criminal police.

569
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,230
Wang.

570
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,400
He's been talking about you.

571
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,240
You're Wang, right?

572
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:02,870
Hello, Hong.

573
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,230
You even came in this heavy rain.

574
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,360
We really appreciate it.

575
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,540
You know my bond with Kaifu.

576
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,440
If I didn't show up,

577
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,740
he'd probably tease me for life.

578
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,700
Am I that petty?

579
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,830
Are you saying that?

580
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,200
No, no. You're nothing like that.

581
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,070
I'm the petty one.

582
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,600
You don't have to show up,

583
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,850
but your money has to be here.

584
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,960
Watch how you talk.

585
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,880
Of course.

586
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,920
Here.

587
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,640
I'm not taking it.

588
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,120
Whoever is in charge should take it.

589
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,270
Hong, a small token of blessings.

590
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,840
Wishing you a great opening.

591
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,880
May your business thrive.

592
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,200
Then I'll accept this good luck.

593
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,680
Thank you, Wang.

594
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,790
Let's get a photo together.

595
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,640
Come on.

596
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,480
Come on.

597
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,620
(Grand Opening)

598
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:36,830
Kaifu.

599
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,470
Look toward the center.

600
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:41,040
Three, two, one.

601
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,070
Why didn't Danshun come?

602
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:08,840
I don't care.

603
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:30,660
(Chuan Q Tattoo)

604
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,680
Danshun.

605
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,840
Still working now?

606
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,360
Let's grab something to eat

607
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,500
and have a couple of drinks.

608
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,990
Kaifu, all the dishes are here.

609
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:00,930
Call me if you need me.

610
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,350
Have a drink.

611
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,880
Didn't Hong tell me not to drink?

612
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,120
Hong also said a real man drinks.

613
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,310
It's our first time eating alone.

614
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:16,830
Cheers.

615
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,640
Here, eat something.

616
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,600
What do you want from me?

617
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,360
Why have you been avoiding Hong lately?

618
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,790
I haven't. I've been busy.

619
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,800
Because of me?

620
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,470
You're not that important.

621
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,270
You have feelings for Qin Hong.

622
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,960
I stole the woman you like.

623
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,070
That's why you're upset.

624
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,310
If that's true, just say yes.

625
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,880
Men are not so indecisive.

626
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,400
What did you just say? Say it again.

627
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,230
If you like her,

628
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,790
we should drink again.

629
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,150
Come on.

630
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,360
I've known Hong for ten years.

631
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:32,030
How long have you known her?

632
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,170
What makes you deserve her?

633
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,680
Feelings are tricky.

634
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,310
How long you've known her
doesn't matter.

635
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,470
Do you know what Hong needs?

636
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,640
She acts strong when she's with you.

637
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,960
But deep down,

638
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:03,270
she needs someone who can protect her.

639
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:05,680
You can't give her that.

640
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,990
Why can't I?

641
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,700
I can protect her now.

642
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,550
All because of you.

643
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,800
Yeah.

644
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,760
Because of me.

645
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,640
I stole Qin Hong.

646
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,510
I'm right here.

647
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:20,680
What can you do to me?

648
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,310
I'll call the police.

649
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,160
Don't.

650
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,920
We were just kidding.

651
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,480
Go back.

652
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,990
Do you feel better now?

653
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,680
If not,

654
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,470
I'll find a place

655
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,090
for you to vent it all out.

656
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,110
Danshun.

657
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,070
You and Hong grew up together.

658
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,960
No one

659
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,190
can ever erase those memories.

660
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,920
Hong doesn't belong to anyone.

661
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,920
She belongs only to herself.

662
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,070
She's with me.

663
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,240
That's my choice,

664
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,630
and hers as well.

665
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:30,150
You need to respect that.

666
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,110
These past few days,

667
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,650
you've been giving her attitude.

668
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,920
She's barely eating

669
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,240
and can't sleep at night.

670
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,070
I've noticed it all.

671
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:50,800
It breaks my heart.

672
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,190
You said you'd protect her.

673
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,840
Is this how you do that?

674
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,720
I admit it.

675
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,920
Sometimes,

676
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,510
I envy you.

677
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,470
I told myself

678
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,630
that if one day Hong stops loving me,

679
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,920
she has every right

680
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,280
to walk away from me.

681
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,240
But you're different.

682
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,960
She treats you like her brother.

683
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,720
She'd never leave you.

684
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,070
You can't break her heart.

685
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,110
Right?

686
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,840
Hong will always

687
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,720
keep you in her heart.

688
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,240
She'd never let you go.

689
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,470
Think about it carefully.

690
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:19,340
(Chuan Q Tattoo)

691
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:36,070
Why did you call me here?

692
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,630
To show you something.

693
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,800
I designed it.

694
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:43,990
Does it good?

695
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,800
Give me your hand.

696
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,200
What for?

697
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,360
This hand.

698
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,600
Sit here.

699
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,440
You don't know there's a scar?

700
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,280
I know.

701
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,670
You wear long sleeves all year round.

702
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,230
You always wear a silk scarf
on a hot day.

703
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,070
This design is specially made
to match your scar.

704
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,280
Look at that horizon.

705
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,590
It's just like your scar.

706
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,880
Once I ink it, you won't see it anymore.

707
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,190
This is the first tattoo
I've ever wanted to do.

708
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,800
What?

709
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,600
- The first one.
- The first one?

710
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,400
Are you using me as a guinea animal?

711
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,540
Just to practice your skills?

712
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,880
Come on, go ahead.

713
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,520
You'd better be sure about this.

714
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,470
Once it's on, you can't wash it off.

715
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,320
Do it. I'm not scared.

716
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,190
Besides, the design looks pretty cool.

717
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,830
If you mess it up,

718
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:54,710
it'll be on my wrist.

719
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,110
Better mine than a client's, right?

720
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,590
Can you give me a little confidence?

721
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,150
Cheer me up.

722
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,110
What more do you want?

723
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,510
I even let you do this.

724
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,630
You brat.

725
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,190
You don't know a thing.

726
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,630
I'll start now.

727
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,060
You're really dropping out of school?

728
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,400
I honestly like this job.

729
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,070
Whatever happens down the road,

730
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,150
I just wanna give it a try first.

731
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,150
I'm your brother.

732
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:38,590
I won't let you down.

733
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,510
Then you'd better think it through.

734
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,470
Once you quit school,
there's no turning back.

735
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,670
I can take responsibility for myself.

736
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,630
You...

737
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,670
Don't move.

738
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:17,990
All done.

739
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,220
(Tian Cai)

740
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,950
The market just got
a new batch of clothes.

741
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,630
We've got your size.

742
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,470
Here.

743
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,120
What for?

744
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,720
Need a favor from me?

745
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,630
Got you a shirt.

746
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,030
This meal is on you.

747
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,120
Of course.

748
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,840
Do you still remember

749
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,160
Huang Shuquan?

750
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,200
Yeah.

751
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,630
He used to collect protection fees
at our market.

752
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,400
I got him locked up.

753
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,210
He served a few years inside

754
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,760
and was released last year.

755
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,400
Still playing the same underworld games.

756
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,440
He's gotten some influence.

757
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,400
I've been keeping tabs on him lately.

758
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,510
He's a suspect

759
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,750
in several recent cases we got.

760
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,400
I also found out

761
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,510
he's been hanging

762
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,760
around your area a lot lately.

763
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,440
Just giving you a heads-up.

764
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,720
Be careful.

765
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,070
I'm worried he holds a grudge
against you.

766
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,720
Got it.

767
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:51,380
(Tian Cai)

768
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,030
Passers-by are looking at you.

769
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,590
Such a big shot

770
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:56,960
climbing a ladder to fix a store sign.

771
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,440
Aren't you afraid people will laugh?

772
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,720
I'm fixing the sign
for my girlfriend's store.

773
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,510
Why would I care if people laugh?

774
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:06,470
(Tian Cai)

775
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:07,400
Come on, give it a try.

776
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,590
Hold it steady.

777
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,720
No worries.

778
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,090
- Is it lit?
- Is it working?

779
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,290
How do you know how to do everything?

780
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,630
Graduated from the school of life.

781
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,920
A true all-round talent.

782
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,760
Take it easy.

783
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,800
Kaifu.

784
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:44,590
Still strong as ever.

785
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,320
What brings you here?

786
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,800
That's not a nice way to put it.

787
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,360
We haven't met in years.

788
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,510
I've actually missed you.

789
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,760
Can't I just drop by and visit?

790
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,720
Let me introduce you.

791
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:03,320
This is the well-known Kaifu.

792
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,400
He runs this whole clothing market.

793
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,400
Don't say it like that.

794
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,760
I'm no gang guy.

795
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,920
Is this your girlfriend?

796
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,440
What's this about?

797
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,360
It's a long story.

798
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,070
Your girlfriend has great taste.

799
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,760
I've walked past so many stores
on my way here.

800
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,400
But yours is the one that stands out.

801
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,840
Once I came in,

802
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,490
your girlfriend stood out, too.

803
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:49,880
Kaifu, you're so lucky.

804
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,510
We mainly sell women's clothing.

805
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,210
Feel free to take a look.

806
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,240
Are you buying it as a gift

807
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,320
or for yourself?

808
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,110
Watch how you talk.

809
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:08,830
Kaifu.

810
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:10,840
You actually guessed it right.

811
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,190
For all your clothes,

812
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,510
give me the total price.

813
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,800
I'll take them all.

814
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:17,510
What do you mean?

815
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,190
Your store isn't bad at all.

816
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:23,410
How about this?

817
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:25,800
Sell the store to me, too.

818
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:35,760
Who runs a store without profits?

819
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:36,950
Let me think.

820
00:43:58,740 --> 00:43:59,840
For the clothes downstairs,

821
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,150
a total of 43,000.

822
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,670
There's still 40,000 worth
of clothes upstairs.

823
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,750
I can give it to you at a lower price.

824
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:06,510
100,000 in total.

825
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:07,430
Deal.

826
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,840
As for this store,

827
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,320
Kaifu and I put a lot of effort into it,

828
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:12,440
so it's not cheap.

829
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,150
It's ten million.

830
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,150
Ten million?

831
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,880
You're joking, right?

832
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,920
No.

833
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,840
If you think the price is too high,

834
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,960
you can just take the clothes instead.

835
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,030
Kaifu,

836
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:39,240
I think you've misunderstood me.

837
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,400
Let me be honest with you.

838
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,990
All the other clothing markets

839
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:45,150
are renovating now.

840
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,670
But this place

841
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:48,670
is getting more rundown by the day.

842
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,630
I feel really down.

843
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,280
Why?

844
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:54,400
Because I'm attached to this place.

845
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:58,320
And I've stumbled here before.

846
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,290
Isn't that right, Kaifu?

847
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,320
Over the past few years,

848
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,240
I managed to make some money.

849
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:05,920
So, I wanted to buy

850
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,720
all the stores around here

851
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,320
to make a plan

852
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,470
for renovation

853
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:12,960
and change the market completely.

854
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,470
If you still want to run

855
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:17,550
a clothing store by then,

856
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:19,850
I'll rent the space to you
at a lower price.

857
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,800
That's a good thing.

858
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,880
Right, Kaifu?

859
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:26,590
How about this?

860
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:27,470
Help him out

861
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:29,760
and introduce him to someone
from the committee.

862
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:31,510
Let me give you an idea.

863
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,190
You make a donation

864
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,190
and cover all the renovation costs.

865
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:39,030
It'll cost way less
than buying these stores.

866
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,440
The committee might even
put up a plaque for you

867
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,360
at the intersection.

868
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,300
Everyone passing by will see it

869
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,240
and pay their respects.

870
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,360
It's honorable, respectable,
and builds goodwill.

871
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,200
How nice.

872
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:50,350
Kaifu,

873
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,190
your girlfriend is so eloquent.

874
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,190
Think it over carefully.

875
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:58,150
Give me a practical price.

876
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:59,280
I already told you.

877
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,670
It's not for sale.

878
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,110
Times have changed, Kaifu.

879
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,550
Do you think
I'm still the same Huang Shuquan?

880
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,030
Yes, times have changed.

881
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,320
However,

882
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,340
I can't change who I am.

883
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:28,740
Well.

884
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,280
You two should discuss it.

885
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,670
I'll wait for your good news.

886
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:32,870
Bye.

887
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,440
There's always someone
standing at the door.

888
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,550
Customers don't even dare

889
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:57,840
to come into our store anymore.

890
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,720
How are we supposed
to do business like this?

891
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,510
What is Huang Shuquan trying to do?

892
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,470
I looked into it.

893
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:07,840
Kaifu.

894
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:13,880
Our area is about to be demolished.

895
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:15,630
Huang Shuquan

896
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:17,880
probably wants to buy a few stores here

897
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:21,010
to negotiate with the developer

898
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:22,390
and sell them off at a high price.

899
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:23,310
No wonder.

900
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,470
If you ask me,

901
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,550
we might as well sell him the store.

902
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,240
It'll save us from all this trouble.

903
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,840
- Zhang.
- That won't work.

904
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:31,910
If you do that,

905
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:33,540
you're putting everyone in a tough spot.

906
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:34,670
What do you mean by that?

907
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:35,960
Take this toothpick here.

908
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,030
One snap and it breaks.

909
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:40,840
But if you grab a bunch of them,

910
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,550
they're much harder to snap.

911
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,320
Isn't Huang Shuquan going door to door,

912
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,400
trying to scare you all?

913
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,240
I think our priority now

914
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,440
is to set up

915
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,510
a demolition committee.

916
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,800
Everyone needs to sign
and press their fingerprint.

917
00:47:56,190 --> 00:47:58,240
Before we reach out to the developer,

918
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,320
we shouldn't talk to anyone else.

919
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:01,760
Do you agree?

920
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:03,240
- Yes.
- Sure.

921
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:04,840
Kaifu's idea is spot on.

922
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,920
Let's set up a demolition committee.

923
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,150
If Huang Shuquan wants to talk,

924
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:10,320
he can come to the committee, right?

925
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,670
- Sure.
- Okay.

926
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:13,150
Then we'll follow Kaifu's lead.

927
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:14,320
Yeah, we listen to Kaifu.

928
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,420
- We'll follow you.
- Yes.

929
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,720
What's going on here so late?

930
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,960
Watch where you're going.

931
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:33,800
Come on.

932
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:37,950
Where are you going?

933
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:39,880
What are you doing?

934
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:40,960
Who are you?

935
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,560
Liu.

936
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,360
Someone's gotta go

937
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,880
and talk to Shuquan first.

938
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,790
I think you're the right guy for that.

939
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,070
Listen.

940
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,760
We've formed a demolition committee.

941
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,760
If you want to negotiate,

942
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,360
go to the committee and talk to Kaifu.

943
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,320
Are you saying

944
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,880
you're not willing to talk to Shuquan?

945
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:00,760
I...

946
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:01,760
I won't talk to him.

947
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:03,630
Let's stop wasting our time.

948
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,200
What are you doing?

949
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,960
Help! Somebody help!

950
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,280
Help!

951
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,880
What are you doing? Let go!

952
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:11,950
Let go!

953
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,470
- Kaifu!
- Kaifu, you're here!

954
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:25,400
How's he doing?

955
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,240
He's inside. Go check on him.

956
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:35,680
Liu.

957
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,160
Kaifu.

958
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,760
You're sure
Huang Shuquan's people did this?

959
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,280
Yes.

960
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:45,260
Do you remember everyone
who attacked you?

961
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:46,640
Yes.

962
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:53,590
Mrs. Liu,

963
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:54,610
I didn't bring anything.

964
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:55,880
- No.
- Take the money.

965
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,030
No, Kaifu, we can't take it.

966
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:57,880
- Kaifu.
- We can't.

967
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:58,770
Do as I say.

968
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:02,210
Focus on getting better.

969
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:04,840
- No.
- Kaifu.

970
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,110
Kaifu, Kaifu.
