Hong.

Officer Liu, you're here again.

18
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,000
- Is she in her room?
- No.

19
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,960
She's in the activity room.
I'll take you there.

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,800

these are your favorite

28
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,640
Here, have a taste.

29
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,320
Officer Liu,

30
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,640
Qin Hong's case has been over
for more than a year.

31
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,760
You still drop by to see me often.

32
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,760
Sometimes, I really think

33
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,120
you're just feeling sorry for me.

34
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,560
But I know

35
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,320
you just want to know

36
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,320
if Qin Hong's reached out to me.

37
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,560
That's part of it, sure.

38
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,440
You're her mom, after all.

39
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:34,230
Qin Hong would never call me.

40
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,640
She only has eyes for her dad.

41
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,000
Guess who I am.

42
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,120
We were never that close.

43
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,120
Dad, I thought you were
on a business trip.

44
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,760
I came back once I wrapped things up.

45
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,760
Come and look.

46
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
Come here for a sec.

47
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,390
Look what I got

48
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,080
for you.

49
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,680
This is the trendiest style right now.

50
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,440
Only wear it on weekends.

51
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,640
Don't wear it to school.

52
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,320
Or your mom's gonna tell me off again.

53
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,120
Okay.

54
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,520
Oh, my gosh.

55
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,520
Dad, I thought you'd forgotten.

56
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,560
How could I?

57
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,320
- She was in the dark.
- You asked for it.

58
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,440
Dad, you're the best.

59
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,440
She didn't know her dad

60
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,000
was already buried in debt.

61
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,630
To be honest,

62
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,750
Qin Hong's dad was a good father,

63
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,080
always thinking of her
whenever something good happened.

64
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,110
But he wasn't a good husband.

65
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,200
He insisted on starting a business
like others.

66
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,750
He was afraid I'd find out.

67
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,320
So, he resigned behind my back.

68
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,200
But he wasn't made for business.

69
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,230
So, later on,

70
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,510
how did you find out

71
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,750
that he was in debt?

72
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,240
Alright then.

73
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,990
Here's the IOU he wrote me.

74
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,350
Take a look for yourself.

75
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,510
Qin Desheng

76
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,110
(IOU)
borrowed some money from me

77
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,400
and used your house as collateral.

78
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,280
Now, he's missing.

79
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,130
Sorry.

80
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,110
I'll need you to transfer

81
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,480
the ownership of this house.

82
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,630
No way.

83
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,510
He'd never mortgage the house.

84
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,630
Your mom's been
calling your dad nonstop.

85
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,630
But she can't get through.

86
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,750
Am I being too nice to you?

87
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,870
Have I been too easy on you?

88
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,510
What are you doing?

89
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,280
- Don't touch my kid!
- Get up.

90
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,710
Get up.

91
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,400
I moved out with Qin Hong.

92
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,040
We rented an old place in the suburbs.

93
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,510
The place is in rough shape.

94
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:17,870
Why keep this?

95
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,720
For memories?

96
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,600
I'm not selling this.

97
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,470
Let go!

98
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,490
Let go!

99
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,750
My dad gave it to me.

100
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,350
Your dad gave it to you, huh?

101
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,630
Then go find your dad!

102
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,990
Do you even realize your dad

103
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,230
has given up on you?

104
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,830
He gave it to you, huh?

105
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,110
I know.

106
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,960
Go then!

107
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,350
Qin Hong kept in touch with her dad.

108
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,630
He even secretly

109
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,750
sent her a bunch of stuff.

110
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,920
So, every time she argued with me,

111
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,510
she yelled that she'd go
to Pingtan to find him.

112
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,230
Pingtan?

113
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,830
Is her dad still there?

114
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,400
He died in an accident

115
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,990
at the construction site in Pingtan.

116
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,920
When the accident happened,

117
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,630
someone from the site called me,

118
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,510
asking me to handle things.

119
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,110
I told Qin Hong

120
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,400
that I wouldn't go.

121
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,710
To me, that man was gone long ago.

122
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,280
That's exactly why I said

123
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,590
I'm the last person Qin Hong
would reach out to.

124
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:26,110
She's been upset with me
since that incident.

125
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,750
Who handled things in the end?

126
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,630
Qin Hong went on her own.

127
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,990
She was only 16 back then.

128
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,830
I have no idea how she dealt with it.

129
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,400
I never asked, either.

130
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,280
Anyway, she changed after that.

131
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,040
She moved out of my place,

132
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,160
dropped out of school,

133
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,750
and found a job at a clothing market.

134
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,400
Did you ever see her again after that?

135
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,400
Hardly ever.

136
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,430
Just during the holidays
and the Chinese New Year.

137
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,470
Officer Liu,

138
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:20,110
if you catch her someday,

139
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,510
could you let me see her?

140
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,990
Over the years,

141
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,510
I've come to realize a lot of things.

142
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,280
I bear a lot of the responsibility

143
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,110
for what she is today.

144
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,710
After she came back
from dealing with her dad's affairs,

145
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,160
I noticed

146
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,510
she had

147
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,400
a scar here.

148
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,630
A pretty big one.

149
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,160
Later, she got a tattoo over it,

150
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,630
maybe because she thought it looked bad.

151
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,330
I didn't ask about it, either.

152
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,870
We found

153
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,400
Qin Hong.

154
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,230
Where is she?

155
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,880
Pingtan.

156
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,880
See?

157
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,110
What did I say?

158
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,230
She went to find her dad after all.

159
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,710
Does she have
a congenital heart disease?

160
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,710
No.

161
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,410
Are you sure?

162
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,350
Does she have any heart problems
later in life?

163
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,630
She's my daughter.
How could I not be sure?

164
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,590
She was born perfectly healthy.

165
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,270
But I'm not sure
if her heart is fine now.

166
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,110
Officer Liu, can I see her?

167
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,870
She might be dead.

168
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,230
Keep it if you want.

169
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,990
How useless.

170
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,110
Might be?

171
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,590
Is she dead or not?

172
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,630
Have you seen

173
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,470
this man before?

174
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:53,980
No.

175
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,590
He said he dated Qin Hong
for a few months.

176
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,990
After he laid hands on her,

177
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,400
her heart condition flared up,

178
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,920
and she died.

179
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,870
He's lying.

180
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,590
My daughter never had heart problems.

181
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,040
He could be making it up.

182
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,870
We found a large amount

183
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,230
of Qin Hong's blood at his place.

184
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,590
It looks more like a death

185
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,510
caused by violence.

186
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,990
What about the body?

187
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,510
Still not found.

188
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,110
That can't be right.

189
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,230
I think your investigation

190
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,040
might have gone the wrong way.

191
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,470
Qin Hong's been on the run
for over a year.

192
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,870
She even managed

193
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,230
to kill Huang Shuquan.

194
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,920
How could that jerk hurt her?

195
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,870
No way.

196
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,920
I don't buy it.

197
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,990
You must've made a mistake.

198
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,040
Why are you still here?

199
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,750
Qin Hong hasn't been caught yet.

200
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,590
Get moving and finish the case.

201
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:44,750
You're leaving?

202
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,710
Zhang.

203
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,990
The holidays are coming up.

204
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,830
Can you help me buy something

205
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:52,920
Ms. Wei likes to eat?

206
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,990
I can't take this, Officer Liu.

207
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:55,870
We've got rules.

208
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,710
We can't accept this.

209
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,160
It's fine; just don't tell anyone.

210
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,040
No, no.

211
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,950
How about this?

212
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,750
I'll put the money into her account.

213
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,820
We have a supermarket.

214
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,760
They've got everything.

215
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,990
She can buy whatever she wants

216
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,230
- by herself.
- Alright.

217
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,070
Sure.

218
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,730
- Bed 12.
- Got it.

219
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,990
Let me take a look.

220
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,120
Her account was just topped up.

221
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,230
Why top up again?

222
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,230
200,000 was transferred last time.

223
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,200
How much?

224
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,120
200,000.

225
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,840
Are you sure?

226
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,230
Yeah.

227
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,270
It was about two months ago.

228
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,640
Who transferred it?

229
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,640
(Zhang Yan, Pingtan City)

230
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,400
Pingtan City.

231
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,850
(Pingtan City)
The sender's name is

232
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:32,500
Zhang Yan.

233
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,790
Xiaoxiao, did you find anything?

234
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,670
Yeah.

235
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,960
Zhang Yan's ID information

236
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,830
was registered in Chang'an Town
not long ago.

237
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,900
She's probably still there.

238
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,600
I just went back
to ask Qin Hong's mother.

239
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,400
She didn't know

240
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,680
when the money was transferred.

241
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,470
And she doesn't know Zhang Yan.

242
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,440
Could that money have been wired
by Qin Hong herself?

243
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,550
Could Zhang Yan be another identity

244
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,640
Qin Hong used while on the run,

245
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,790
just like Lin Chang?

246
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,440
That's very possible.

247
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,840
But if the money was sent
by Zhang Yan herself,

248
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,640
it means she knew Qin Hong.

249
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,070
I'll go to Chang'an Town.

250
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,440
Wait for me. I'll be right back.

251
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,280
Let's go together.

252
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:22,820
(Pingtan, Chang'an Town, 2013)

253
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,710
So good to be living
in the sunlight again.

254
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,640
Everything is worth it.

255
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,680
How did Qin Hong's mother react?

256
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,270
She didn't believe Qin Hong was dead.

257
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,070
Do you think she truly didn't believe it

258
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,790
or just couldn't accept the truth?

259
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,360
I couldn't tell.

260
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,360
Because I don't believe it, either.

261
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,070
I have a question for you.

262
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,640
What is it?

263
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,440
You seem to know Qin Hong

264
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,880
quite well.

265
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,840
Watch your step.

266
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,910
Okay.

267
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,680
That building up ahead.

268
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,960
Lyu Danshun.

269
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,400
Officer Liu.

270
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,070
You two know each other?

271
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,840
He's Qin Hong's younger brother.

272
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,600
Her real brother?

273
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:27,960
No.

274
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,920
She took me in as a brother.

275
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,440
Qin Hong and he were neighbors
when they were kids.

276
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,160
They grew up together.

277
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,960
After Qin Hong's incident,

278
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,200
I talked to him once.

279
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,840
Back then, you told me

280
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,550
you were planning to go south for work.

281
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,200
So, you came here, huh?

282
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,180
I used to live somewhere else

283
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,030
and just moved here.

284
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:52,920
Where were you?

285
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,300
- Pingtan.
- Where?

286
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,440
Pingtan.

287
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,640
Zhang Yan's ID information

288
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,550
was registered in Chang'an Town
not long ago.

289
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,680
She's probably still there.

290
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:14,940
(Zhang Yan)

291
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,880
Can we go inside for a bit?

292
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,400
Sure.

293
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,880
After only a year,

294
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,550
you've become a dad?

295
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,710
That's my girlfriend's kid
with her ex-husband.

296
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,960
You two don't sleep in the same room?

297
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,510
The kid is still too young.

298
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,880
She needs to sleep with her mother.

299
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,120
Plus, the bed's not big enough.

300
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,120
So, I sleep in this room.

301
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,070
Do you know Zhang Yan?

302
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,200
She's my girlfriend.

303
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,710
Where is she now?

304
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,160
She took the kid to town.

305
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,680
When will she be back?

306
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,600
Probably not for a while.

307
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,880
Then we will

308
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,880
wait for her here.

309
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,790
I'll call her and tell her to come back.

310
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,120
No need, really.

311
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,240
We're not in a rush.

312
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,120
We haven't met for over a year.

313
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,600
Perfect time to catch up,

314
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,880
while waiting for her.

315
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,540
You're looking for Zhang Yan?

316
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,680
Your girlfriend, Zhang Yan,

317
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,030
sent money to Qin Hong's mother

318
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,310
two months ago.

319
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,470
Did you know about that?

320
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,880
I was the one who sent that money.

321
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,320
After Hong left,
no one could look after her mom.

322
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,640
I thought I'd help out however I could.

323
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,440
Why didn't you use your own account?

324
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,400
You've always thought

325
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,920
that Hong and I were connected.

326
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,400
I don't want more trouble
because of that.

327
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,640
Do you know how much you transferred?

328
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,200
I transferred all the money

329
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,400
I earned last year.

330
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,310
You saved 200,000 in a year?

331
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,120
What kind of job pays that well?

332
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,270
Come on, introduce me to it.

333
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,600
Officer Liu, to be honest,

334
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,360
it's not some decent job.

335
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,550
To make money,

336
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,880
no job

337
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,070
is embarrassing.

338
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,470
But it absolutely has to be legal.

339
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,920
Officer Liu, I admit it.

340
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,880
Hong and I

341
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,720
used to be close.

342
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,030
But I've moved on with my life now.

343
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,270
There's nothing between us anymore.

344
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,080
If you don't believe me,

345
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,900
I'll call Zhang Yan
and ask her to come back.

346
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,220
You can ask her what happened.

347
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,240
Go on.

348
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,840
Did you know Qin Hong
is also in Pingtan?

349
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,960
No, I didn't.

350
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,200
Really?

351
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,470
She hasn't tried
to reach out to you at all?

352
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,640
No.

353
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,640
Did you catch her?

354
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,960
Qin Hong is dead.

355
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,400
How did she die?

356
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,200
We haven't gotten to the bottom of it,

357
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,030
so I can't tell you any details.

358
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,880
Let me get you two

359
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,030
some tea.

360
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,070
The tide is rising.

361
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,120
Time to go back.

362
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,270
Mengmeng.

363
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:10,060
(Liu Wang is here. I'll hold them off.
Go and wait for my call.)

364
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,400
The water's boiling.

365
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,760
Yes.

366
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,680
I just talked to Zhang Yan

367
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,880
and told her to come back now.

368
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,790
Sorry, I lost control
of my emotions just now.

369
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,240
I get it.

370
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,880
- Let me.
- I got it.

371
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,600
Your girlfriend's back.

372
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,550
Go open the door.

373
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,600
Danshun,
I've got some fresh octopus today.

374
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,790
It's for your daughter.

375
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,720
Thanks. Let me pay you for it.

376
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:30,620
No need, really.

377
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,120
Zhang Yan frequents my place.

378
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,960
No need to pay.

379
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,150
Bye.

380
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,360
Thanks.

381
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,200
Take it slow.

382
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,390
No rush.

383
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,280
Go.

384
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,480
Mengmeng.

385
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,310
How about we don't go home now?

386
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,840
Where's Officer Liu?

387
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,270
He went to the restroom.

388
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,300
Zhang Yan should be back soon.

389
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,400
She bought a lot of groceries
with the kid.

390
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,680
I'll go pick her up.

391
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,600
I'll go with you.

392
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,580
It's fine.

393
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,680
The road is tricky.

394
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,030
I'll go by myself.

395
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,400
Once we're back, we can eat.

396
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:39,910
Chief Liu.

397
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,600
Danshun?

398
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,940
He's gone to pick up Zhang Yan.

399
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,120
To pick up Zhang Yan?

400
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,050
Oh, no.

401
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,240
Sorry.

402
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,600
Chief Liu, I'm sorry.

403
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,070
I didn't know he'd run off.

404
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,680
Notify the local station here.

405
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,640
Block all the roads leading out of town.

406
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,480
Got it.

407
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,040
Let them pass.

408
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,360
Drive forward. Yeah.

409
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:02,550
Chief Liu.

410
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,560
- Let them pass.
- The sheriff is here.

411
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,980
(Chang'an–Cao City)

412
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:15,740
(Ticket Inspector)

413
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,680
This is Sheriff Zhao
from the local station.

414
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,160
- Chief Liu.
- Thanks for your work.

415
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,270
That guy should still be in this town.

416
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,600
Please have your men work some overtime.

417
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
Don't worry, Chief Liu.

418
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,600
(Chang'an–Cao City)
Where's Uncle Danshun?

419
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,360
Aren't we waiting for him?

420
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,680
Be good, Mengmeng.

421
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,880
Uncle Danshun...

422
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,470
He'll come find us in a bit.

423
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,270
Everything's been arranged.

424
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,580
Our place is pretty small,

425
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,740
and there aren't many exits.

426
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,800
We've sealed them all off.

427
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,400
Other teams are checking the town.

428
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,270
Sheriff Zhao.

429
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,200
We've found Zhang Yan.

430
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,310
Chief Liu, Zhang Yan's been found.

431
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,240
Let's go.

432
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,790
This way.

433
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,710
She bought the ticket

434
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,160
a little after seven.

435
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,720
It's her.

436
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:05,860
(2013/12/16 Monday, Surveillance Center,
Security Checkpoint)

437
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,440
Stop, stop.

438
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,030
Rewind a bit.

439
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,160
Stop.

440
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,190
Can you zoom in?

441
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,880
Qin Hong.

442
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,320
Qin Hong is still alive.

443
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,840
Stop that bus. Hurry!

444
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,720
- Hurry!
- Got it!

445
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,920
- Move!
- Okay!

446
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,860
(Police)

447
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,800
Passenger bus.

448
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,400
Pull over for inspection.

449
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,880
Pull over for inspection.

450
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,150
Hello, we're looking for someone.

451
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,240
Okay, got it.

452
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,360
Thanks.

453
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,520
Chief Liu.

454
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,620
Qin Hong isn't on the bus.

455
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,600
The driver said a woman
holding a child got off

456
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,920
when they just left the station.

457
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,200
Sheriff Zhao.

458
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,960
Any news from town?

459
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,190
Still nothing.

460
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,030
We've been played.

461
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,360
Hong?

462
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:47,960
Hong?

463
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,550
Hong?

464
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,550
Uncle Danshun.

465
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,720
Why haven't you left?

466
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,190
Mengmeng was crying hard
before getting on the bus.

467
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,240
She said she had to go with you.

468
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,840
I think Liu Wang has found me.

469
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,440
Do you think all this is worth it?

470
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,320
Danshun.

471
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,880
Danshun.

472
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:49,920
Danshun.

473
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,880
Come out.

474
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,550
Danshun.

475
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,400
Didn't you hear me?

476
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,960
You brat.

477
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,720
Are you deaf or what?

478
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,760
Why are you standing there?

479
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,880
Pour me a glass of water.

480
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,070
You brat.

481
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,440
Useless.

482
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,880
A bunch of ingrates.

483
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,880
Are you trying to burn me?

484
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,400
I'm sorry.

485
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,400
Dad, I was wrong.

486
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,400
Get back here!

487
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,440
Open the door!

488
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,600
Open the door!

489
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,280
Open the door!

490
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,840
You've crossed the line.

491
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,440
How dare you lock me out?

492
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,880
You useless thing, just like your mom.

493
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,760
Neither of you can do anything.

494
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,760
You got a death wish, huh?

495
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,240
Did you hear me?

496
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,550
You've gone too far!

497
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,880
Open the door!

498
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,440
Open it!

499
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,680
Unlock it now!

500
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,280
I'll teach you a lesson.

501
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,670
Who is it?

502
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:16,550
Who threw that?

503
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,960
Who dared to smash my window?

504
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,070
Which jerk did that?

505
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,840
You got a death wish?

506
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,600
Don't run!

507
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,280
Stop running!

508
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,670
Stop right there!

509
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,990
Wait till I catch you!

510
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,280
Come out if you dare.

511
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,030
Playing dirty with me?

512
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,190
Come out!

513
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,920
Where are you?

514
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,760
How's your dad's hand?

515
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,920
Did you throw this?

516
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,320
Why do you keep everything?

517
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,470
It's called evidence.

518
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,800
This is dangerous.

519
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:28,760
A bone injury takes 100 days to heal.

520
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,360
Your dad won't be able to hit you
for at least three months.

521
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,080
Go tell your dad:

522
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,960
There are lots of weasel traps
around our yard.

523
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,240
Tell him to be careful.

524
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,590
What's your name?

525
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,960
I'm Lyu Danshun.

526
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,960
I'm Qin Hong.
