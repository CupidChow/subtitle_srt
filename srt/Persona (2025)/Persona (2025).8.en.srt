00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,750
We'll start eating when Mom gets back.

3
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:47,630
Okay?

4
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:48,550
Okay.

5
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,750
You're back.

6
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,990
It smells so good.

7
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,630
What did you make?

8
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,910
Mengmeng, I'm home.

9
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,910
Mom, come.

10
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,830
You even had time to do hot pot today?

11
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,420
The tattoo store closed early today.

12
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,270
You don't look good; what's wrong?

13
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,110
My stomach's been hurting.

14
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,270
Why not go get it checked?

15
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,270
No need.
I've gotten medicine from the clinic.

16
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,180
Don't worry.

18
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,070
You can't go abroad

19
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,450
without any connections in Pingtan,

20
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,460
especially with your background.

21
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,420
This guy's name is Feichuan.

22
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,860
Call him.

23
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,110
He can send you abroad.

24
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,500
(Feichuan)

25
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,020
How did you know someone like him?

26
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,550
Back then, Mengmeng's grandma

27
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,550
told me her son died at sea
while fishing.

28
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,140
She asked me to leave with Mengmeng.

29
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,550
It was so sudden for me to believe it.

30
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,860
I went around asking everyone.

31
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,550
Only then did I learn

32
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,420
that he went abroad

33
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,230
on Feichuan's ship.

34
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,830
That family knew you were kind

35
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,420
and took advantage of you.

36
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,550
Later, someone spotted him abroad.

37
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,700
He thought life overseas
would be better.

38
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,110
But things turned out just the same.

39
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,110
At the time,
I couldn't believe it at all.

40
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,990
So, I went to Feichuan again,

41
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,990
asking him over and over for answers.

42
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,830
He got annoyed

43
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,270
and asked me,

44
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,790
"Can't you live without that man?"

45
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,990
Those words

46
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,700
broke my last bit of hope.

47
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,230
Just when I was about to leave,

48
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,830
someone showed up
to mess with his business.

49
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,020
I shouted, "Police!"

50
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,670
and scared the group off.

51
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,860
He thought he owed me for that

52
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,270
and told me if I needed something,

53
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,270
he'd make sure to help.

54
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,270
I appreciate the offer,

55
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,550
but I can't make that call.

56
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,110
You don't believe me, do you?

57
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:22,990
Of course, I do.

58
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,990
I believe you.

59
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,710
I've felt terrible enough

60
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,990
about dragging Danshun into this.

61
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,110
It doesn't concern you anyway.

62
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:35,860
You have Mengmeng.

63
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,260
You have your own life.

64
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,420
I can't drag you into this.

65
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,510
Hong,

66
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,030
helping you is helping myself.

67
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,790
If you leave safely,

68
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,590
Danshun and I can also leave this place.

69
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,590
You two are leaving, too?

70
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,470
I mentioned it to him before,

71
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,150
but he didn't agree at that time.

72
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,030
Now, I finally understand

73
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,350
that he was waiting for you.

74
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,990
Don't worry.

75
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,420
Whether I make it out or not,

76
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,150
or whether...

77
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,350
I swear I'll never

78
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,790
turn you or Danshun in.

79
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,260
I won't say a single word

80
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,670
about you two.

81
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,260
Starting today,

82
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,770
let's just pretend we never met.

83
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,590
Actually, Danshun told me about you.

84
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,150
If I had that kind of nerve and courage,

85
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,590
I wouldn't have ended up like this.

86
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,350
What do you mean?

87
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,670
I'm in no place to judge Danshun.

88
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,920
I've been hiding something
from him, too.

89
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:10,910
Five or six years ago,

90
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,470
something happened to me.

91
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,100
I was 22 and had just moved here.

92
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,260
(Jiankanglu Health Technology)

93
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,340
I didn't know anything.

94
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,670
- And I had a kid with me.
- It's raining so hard.

95
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,470
It's just a bit of rain.

96
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,230
You can't handle this?

97
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,260
I only had one thought.

98
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,790
Someone even brought a child.

99
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,260
How are you supposed to work?

100
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,110
I need to survive.

102
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,030
My babysitter couldn't make it today,

103
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,470
so I had to bring her.

104
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,790
What about your sales numbers?

105
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,110
Who's handling your work?

106
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,050
There's barely anyone passing by here.

107
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,420
Who's heading to the market next?

108
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,650
Try to bring more people over.

109
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,110
Can you help me watch Mengmeng?

110
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:56,950
Sure.

111
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:57,990
Good girl.

112
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,090
Sir,

113
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,350
we're offering free checkups.
Would you like to join?

114
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,490
- No.
- Take a look.

115
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,990
Ma'am.

116
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,670
We're having a checkup event.

117
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,150
You'll get free eggs.

118
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,110
Mr. Ma.

119
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,910
What brings you here?

120
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,230
You've been working hard all day,

121
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,470
but there's still no result.

122
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,820
Then it's all in vain, right?

123
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,770
Do you know where the problem is?

124
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,630
Look over there.

125
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,150
Look at that lady.

126
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,110
She's rushing off
right after buying groceries,

127
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,030
so she's heading home
to cook for her kid.

128
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,420
She'd just ignore you.

129
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,230
Look at the other one.

130
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,790
She checks everything carefully.

131
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,790
She always haggles for everything.

132
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,470
Earning just a few cents
can make her happy.

133
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,910
Go talk to her.

134
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,670
Tell her we're running a promo.

135
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,350
We're giving away eggs for free.

136
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,470
See if she shows up.

137
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:09,990
As long as she comes,

138
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,810
we won't let her leave easily.

139
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,910
Go on, try again.

140
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,750
Alright.

141
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,310
Ma'am.

142
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,550
We're having a special event.

143
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,940
You can get a free health checkup

144
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,820
and free eggs.

145
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,500
Great.

146
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,500
Let me take you there.

147
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,780
Just follow me.

148
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:34,950
Alright.

149
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,350
Ladies and gentlemen,

150
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,660
I'm Ma Weicheng, General Distributor

151
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,160
from Jiankanglu

00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,990
(Citywide Elderly Care Initiative)
in China.

153
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,430
You can call me Ma

154
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,830
or Weicheng.

155
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,540
On behalf of our entire company,

156
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,140
I'd like to welcome you here today.

157
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,660
So, do you know why you're here today?

158
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,260
You're here to relax.

159
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,430
And what are we here for?

160
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,780
We're here to give.

161
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,900
Give what?

162
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,950
Love

163
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,070
and health.

164
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,780
That's what we call a win-win, right?

165
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,860
Good.

166
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,660
First of all,

167
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,500
I want to ask

168
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,540
everyone a question.

169
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,310
You've reached this age.

170
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,660
What is

171
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,070
the most important thing

172
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,780
in your life?

173
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,310
Your children,

174
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,780
your partner,

175
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,190
or the money in your bank account?

176
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,430
Of course, it's money.

177
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,500
Ma'am, what did you say?

178
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,270
Money.

179
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,270
It's money.

180
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,340
Alright, don't laugh.

181
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,660
Let me give you an example.

182
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,540
Let's say

183
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,380
your children...

184
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,540
You have children, right?

185
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,380
Two sons.

186
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,220
That's wonderful.

187
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,780
Let's imagine one day, your children

188
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,430
tell you

189
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,740
they need money

190
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,780
for something urgent.

191
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,780
Will you give them

192
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,620
all your savings?

193
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,270
Yes.

194
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,740
Then money isn't
the most important thing to you.

195
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,860
Were you just fooling me?

196
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,380
Now, let me flip the question.

197
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,660
If one day,

198
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,660
everyone sitting here

199
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,430
grows old,

200
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,020
falls ill,

201
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,260
and needs all of your son

202
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,780
and daughter-in-law's savings
for your treatment.

203
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,540
Do you think

204
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,500
they'd actually do that?

205
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,740
Not necessarily.

206
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:42,910
You're not sure.

207
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,900
Alright, that's fine.

208
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,620
Let me share a personal story with you.

209
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,660
When I was a kid, I was super naughty.

210
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,660
Such a naughty boy.

211
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,860
When I was nine,

212
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,780
my school was about to kick me out.

213
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,660
My homeroom teacher
called my mom to school

214
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,660
and told my mom

215
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,430
that I didn't study.

216
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,860
Guess what my mom said?

217
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,140
She said that it was

218
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,430
because what they taught
was too easy for me.

219
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,020
That teacher was so mad.

220
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,540
Later, when we got home,
I asked my mom,

221
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,430
"Why did you say that?"

222
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,950
My mom said,

223
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,020
"I respect you,"

224
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,430
"care for you,"

225
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,860
"and protect you as you grow up."

226
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,070
I'm deeply grateful to her.

227
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,260
It's because of a mother like her

228
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,860
that I've come this far

229
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,950
without ever losing my way.

230
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,430
Up to this day,

231
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,340
I've started my own business

232
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,640
and learned to stand on my own.

233
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,020
I truly love my mother.

234
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,020
But five years ago,

235
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,020
she was diagnosed

236
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,270
with an advanced stomach cancer.

237
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,660
I didn't know what to do.

238
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,380
I was still working a regular job,

239
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,540
working for someone else,

240
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,540
so I had to use all my salary

241
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,020
and every bit of my savings.

242
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,260
I found the best doctor,

243
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,140
used every connection we had,

244
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,370
and finally got her admitted
to the best hospital

245
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,660
in our province.

246
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,900
And she never came out again.

247
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,740
I watched her

248
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,430
grow thinner and weaker

249
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,020
day after day.

250
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,070
That's when I understood

251
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,070
what it means to be completely drained.

252
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,070
After that, I started thinking.

253
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,380
I asked myself

254
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,380
what I could've done

255
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,260
to change all of this,

256
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,140
and when I should've started

257
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,020
to spare her all the suffering.

258
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,430
Later, I realized

259
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,240
it had to start from the very beginning.

260
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,020
From the very start,
my mom had to be healthy.

261
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,190
She should never fall ill.

262
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,950
She should live a healthy life
from the very start.

263
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,310
So, when I heard

264
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,190
about Jiankanglu,

265
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,260
I put everything I had on it

266
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,430
without hesitation.

267
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,540
I decided to join them.

268
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,740
Why?

269
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,500
Because I wanted others

270
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,860
to never go through the same pain I did.

271
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,070
I wanted

272
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,780
to bring health and happiness

273
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,020
to every parent out there

274
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,020
and

275
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,020
every child who isn't here today.

276
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,020
Now, please close your eyes with me.

277
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,140
Try to picture this.

278
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,260
One day,

279
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,260
when you grew old,

280
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,150
when illness came,

281
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,780
your children

282
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,780
drained every bit

283
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,020
of their savings for you.

284
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,260
At the office,

285
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,430
their boss scolded them.

286
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,260
At home,

287
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,020
their partner complained.

288
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,950
In the end, they lost my job,

289
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,140
and their family fell apart.

290
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,380
Does that make your heart ache?

291
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,260
So,

292
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,140
tell me once more:

293
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,380
What truly matters the most?

294
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,310
Is it your kids,

295
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,780
your partner,

296
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,620
your money,

297
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,900
or your priceless health?

298
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,900
Health! Health!

299
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,780
(Jiankanglu Health Technology)

300
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,190
I want to share a quote

301
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,340
as a reminder for all of us.

302
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,540
Life is like a journey.

303
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,640
It's filled with hardships

304
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,480
and beauty.

305
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,500
Your vision decides how far you can go.

306
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,070
If what you see around you

307
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,430
is those better than you,

308
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,060
that means you're moving uphill.

309
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,340
But if you're surrounded
by people doing worse than you,

310
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,310
then you're sliding downhill.

311
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,020
I hope we can

312
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,380
keep walking

313
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,500
on the road of growth.

314
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,660
Good.

315
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,620
- Cheers.
- Thanks, Mr. Ma.

316
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,430
By the way,

317
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,620
there's one more thing today.

318
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,950
We've got a new hire.

319
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,320
Her name is Zhang Yan.

320
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,700
She's a single mother.

321
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,940
Life hasn't been easy for her.

322
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,020
So, you should treat her

323
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,500
like family,

324
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,500
help her out,

325
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,020
and understand her, alright?

326
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,900
Sure.

327
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,380
Welcome, welcome!

328
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,430
Everyone, enjoy.

329
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,020
Mr. Ma, may I say a few words?

330
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,500
Thank you.

331
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,380
Well.

332
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,950
Let me just say a few words.

333
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,430
What we have here really feels

334
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,500
like a big family.

335
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,140
Especially Mr. Ma.

336
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,020
He's always encouraging us.

337
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,780
I truly admire

338
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,020
and respect him.

339
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,020
I'm glad we have someone new

340
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,020
joining us today.

341
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,540
I have some good news I'd like to share

342
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,430
with everyone.

343
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,620
It's about me.

344
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,260
I got into college.

345
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,140
- Amazing!
- How amazing!

346
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,070
You're incredible.

347
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,190
Thanks. I'll drink to you all first.

348
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,140
Liu, I honestly didn't expect that.

349
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,500
What a surprise.

350
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,740
You were always so busy at work,

351
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,060
yet you still found time to study.

352
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,900
When you first joined us,

353
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,020
I told you this:

354
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,780
You have a sharp mind,

355
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,290
and as long as you work hard,

356
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,660
there's nothing you can't achieve.

357
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,690
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

358
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,430
Liu perfectly proves

359
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,430
what I just said.

360
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,900
Everyone should learn from him

361
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,540
and keep moving forward

362
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,430
with the best, okay?

363
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,310
Another toast to him.

364
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,180
- Cheers.
- Sure.

365
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,260
Drink more tonight.

366
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,660
- Thanks, Mr. Ma.
- Congrats.

367
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,190
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

368
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,620
Liu.

369
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,500
You're too capable

370
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,670
to stay here now.

371
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,720
- That's true.
- Thanks.

372
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,580
Have a drink with us.

373
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,870
- Bottom up!
- Cheers!

374
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,430
Make sure you drink more tonight.

375
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,500
Congrats.

376
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,340
Congratulations.

377
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,270
Zhang Yan.

378
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,850
- Mr. Ma.
- Did you gain anything today?

379
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:30,940
Liu, have a drink with me.

380
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,580
Yes, after hearing what you said,

381
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,140
I feel like I'm getting the hang of it.

382
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,030
I've been observing you.

383
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:36,890
You're pretty good.

384
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,190
You couldn't find your direction

385
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,190
because you didn't know

386
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,670
how to make the most of your talent.

387
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,060
Honestly, doing sales isn't complicated.

388
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,970
It's about thinking less about yourself

389
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,550
and paying more attention to others.

390
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,500
Take it step by step.

391
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,820
Gain experience little by little.

392
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,120
Things will keep getting better.

393
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,230
What you just said

394
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,100
really struck a chord with me.

395
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,150
I feel you're
an incredibly selfless man.

396
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,290
Our company's bound
to do better and better.

397
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,710
Let me drink to you.

398
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:05,950
No need.

399
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,450
You still have to look after the kid.

400
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,670
In the beginning,

401
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,050
I'm the one helping you.

402
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:12,990
After some time,

403
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,110
you'll be the one helping me.

404
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,870
I'll keep working hard.

405
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:16,710
Mr. Ma.

406
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,150
Mr. Ma, let me toast to you again.

407
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,300
Thank you
for all your support this year.

408
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,910
I've truly learned a lot.

409
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,820
I hope that one day,

410
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,820
I can become someone

411
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,060
strong enough and care

412
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,500
for others like you.

413
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,100
Though I'm heading to college now,

414
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,990
if I have time in the future,

415
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,390
I'll definitely come back

416
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,230
to visit everyone.

417
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:37,630
Once you leave,

418
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,670
can Zhang Yan take over your clients?

419
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,950
No problem, Mr. Ma.

420
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,760
We're out of charcoal.

421
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,010
Can you help add some more?

422
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,230
Sure.

423
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,310
Liu, what happened?

424
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:55,910
- What's wrong?
- Liu!

425
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:56,760
What happened?

426
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,060
Liu, are you okay?

427
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,390
That burn looks really bad.

428
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,670
Zhang, grab some cold water
from the restroom.

429
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,510
Hurry, hurry!

430
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,990
Are you okay?

431
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,660
Stop looking. Go and take care of it!

432
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,350
If it's serious,
take him to the hospital.

433
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,530
Let's rinse it with water.

434
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,100
- Go!
- Use cold water.

435
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,940
I'll take him there.

436
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,400
What were you thinking?

437
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:14,870
How did this happen?

438
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:17,500
Jiankanglu for success.

439
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,390
What a profitable business.

440
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,300
(Way of Wellness)
What a profitable business.

441
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,000
Health for everyone.

442
00:19:24,046 --> 00:19:26,407
Health for everyone.

443
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,630
What a shared happy future.

444
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,840
What a shared happy future.

445
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,580
We can do this!

446
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,670
Here, have some water.

447
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,230
Sure, thanks.

448
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,800
This way.

449
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,860
The sunlight is nice here.

450
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,990
I've saved you a good seat.

451
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,950
Ma'am, are you feeling unwell?

452
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,990
No, I just came to pick up
the gift and eggs.

453
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,820
You're sweating from the walk.

454
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,430
Why not rest here?

455
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,150
Try out our therapy device.

456
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,990
No need to bother.

457
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,500
I need to hurry back and make dinner.

458
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,870
I just heard

459
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,670
that you're giving out eggs and gifts,

460
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:58,820
so I came to check.

461
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,710
Ma'am.

462
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,670
Here's the thing.

463
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,230
All our gifts here

464
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,740
can only be claimed
after you try the product.

465
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,230
Why not try out

466
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,990
our massager for a moment?

467
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,150
It feels great.

468
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,150
It's also quick; why not have a try?

469
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,740
Forget it; this is too much trouble.

470
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,910
I'll skip it then.

471
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,870
- Take a look at our other items.
- Please wait.

472
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,950
Take these two with you.

473
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,950
- Here.
- I really shouldn't.

474
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,460
It's fine. They're free, Ma'am.

475
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,740
I'm the person in charge here.

476
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:27,790
My last name is Ma.

477
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,620
In the middle of the day,

478
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,990
you've been running around nonstop.

479
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,460
What if you get overheated out there?

480
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,510
How about this?

481
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,430
Rest here for a bit.

482
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,460
Cool yourself.

483
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,340
I'll find a car to take you home later.

484
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,660
Alright.

485
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,630
Yeah, I'm a bit thirsty.
It's crazy hot today.

486
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,300
This way, please.

487
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,730
How many people are in your family?

488
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,910
Just my husband and me.

489
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,160
Why didn't your husband come with you?

490
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,870
Look around here.

491
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,670
All the elderly couples came together.

492
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,100
Older folks show affection so openly.

493
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,470
We younger ones can't even compare.

494
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,990
My husband

495
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,630
needs me to take care of him.

496
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,190
He has hemiplegia.

497
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,010
How long has he been ill?

498
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,870
It's been over two years now.

499
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,670
When he first collapsed,

500
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,060
he kept getting angry,

501
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,430
complaining about his bad luck.

502
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,060
Now,

503
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,950
he keeps complaining about aches.

504
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,500
I take care of him all day long,

505
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,100
and he still blames me for everything.

506
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,340
I don't know what to do with him.

507
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,600
You have to cook

508
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,750
and look after him every day.

509
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,230
Your shoulders, neck, and lower back

510
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,710
must be under a lot of stress, right?

511
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,230
Of course.

512
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,950
My back's practically hunched already.

513
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:36,820
My whole body

514
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,910
hurts everywhere.

515
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,660
Manager Zhang,

516
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:40,670
let her try

517
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,870
our therapy device.

518
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,950
No need. I'm not buying anything.

519
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:44,910
Don't worry.

520
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,070
It's free.

521
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,950
You'll make me buy it after I try it.

522
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,150
I won't.

523
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:50,990
Don't worry.

524
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,470
I've told everyone

525
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,740
not to force customers to buy anything.

526
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,820
No one's allowed to touch

527
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,630
her wallet. Got it?

528
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:58,470
Sure.

529
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,470
Even if you don't buy anything,

530
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,100
you're welcome to come
every day for a free trial.

531
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,430
- Okay.
- Ma'am.

532
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,950
Give it a try.

533
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,390
It's a small token from Mr. Ma.

534
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,580
Bring over our magnetic foot spa,

535
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,470
so she can try it.

536
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,630
- Let her use it.
- No need.

537
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,010
- It's too much trouble.
- Listen.

538
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,580
There are 81 acupoints on the foot.

539
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,590
A short soak helps relieve
all kinds of problems.

540
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,430
Give it a try.

541
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,710
Alright, I'll give it a try.

542
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:27,830
Ma'am,

543
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:28,870
this is Manager Zhang.

544
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,010
She's thoughtful and caring.

545
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,190
If you ever need anything,
just go to her.

546
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,100
Ma'am,

547
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,150
my grandma has hemiplegia, too.

548
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,540
I used to take care of her.

549
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,100
Your grandma is so lucky to have you.

550
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,740
Alright, thanks. Goodbye.

551
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,010
- Take care, Ma'am.
- Goodbye.

552
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,470
Bye.

553
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,510
Mr. Ma.

554
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:54,910
I'm sorry.

555
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,710
I failed to get
any business again today.

556
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,580
That's okay.

557
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,430
If you want to win people over,

558
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:00,710
first,

559
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,770
make them believe
you're their most genuine friend.

560
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,430
You've known her situation well.

561
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,870
If she comes back again,

562
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,340
you have to make her truly feel

563
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,430
how much we're helping her.

564
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,150
I believe that over time,

565
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,630
she'll sense your genuine care for her.

566
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:18,710
Everyone,

567
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:19,990
I've always said

568
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,190
that our philosophy

569
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,230
is all about sharing goodwill
with the world.

570
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,100
Only when you keep

571
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,870
spreading kindness outward

572
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:32,060
will the world return
that kindness to you.

573
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:32,920
Today,

574
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,730
the long-term client that Zhang Yan
has been keeping in touch with,

575
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:36,900
Ms. Li Bingmei,

576
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,470
added 10,000 yuan to her account here

577
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,990
to purchase our products and services.

578
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:45,230
That's genuine care
winning genuine trust.

579
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,340
Let's give Zhang Yan
a round of applause.

580
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,500
Have a taste of this wine.

581
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,110
It's different from the last one.

582
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,550
How is it?

583
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:15,510
Pretty good.

584
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,340
Thanks, Mr. Ma.

585
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,100
I appreciate all your help lately.

586
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,150
I should be the one
treating you to dinner.

587
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,150
You treating me?

588
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,390
I'm your boss.

589
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,580
Do you think I need that?

590
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,950
You earn your money the hard way.

591
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:28,910
Keep it for yourself.

592
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,950
From your accent,
you're not local to Pingtan, are you?

593
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,340
No.

594
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,150
I'm from Shimen.

595
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,630
Do you have any siblings?

596
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,300
Yeah, I've got a younger brother.

597
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:43,100
He's still in school.

598
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,670
Is Mengmeng going to be okay

599
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,870
when we're having dinner?

600
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:49,710
It's fine.

601
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:50,740
I've asked a neighbor

602
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,340
to take care of her.

603
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,110
It must've been hard for you.

604
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,390
When I look at you,

605
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,200
it feels like I'm looking
at my younger self

606
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,230
when I first came to Pingtan
to make a living.

607
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,580
I didn't know anyone or anything.

608
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,430
Whatever kind of trouble I ran into,

609
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,910
I had to push through it on my own.

610
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,920
But things are even tougher for you.

611
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,670
You've got a kid.

612
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,150
Where's your husband?

613
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,950
He passed away.

614
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,270
Sorry to hear that.

615
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,820
It's okay.

616
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,670
Alright, let's drop it.

617
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,670
Come on, have a drink.

618
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,420
Bottom-up.

619
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,830
What's wrong?

620
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,420
Do you want to stop?

621
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,910
No.

622
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:09,910
I can drink.

623
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,910
If you don't want to, just say so.

624
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,670
It's okay.

625
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,500
Like when work gets tough,

626
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,500
you should speak up.

627
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,390
You gotta be honest with yourself.

628
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,300
I don't like this side of you.

629
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,390
Mr. Ma.

630
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:31,670
A person should first look inward

631
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,230
and then learn
to feel the world outside.

632
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,510
Got it?

633
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,150
It's not about you, Mr. Ma.

634
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,470
I just can't hold my liquor.

635
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,510
I...

636
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,580
Alright, come on.

637
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,500
Stop drinking then.

638
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,670
When I saw you for the first time,

639
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,100
you were out in the rain
handing out flyers.

640
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,740
No one else would go.

641
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:55,900
Why were you the only one?

642
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,090
Did you want to put on a show

643
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,050
to earn people's praise?

644
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,980
No.

645
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,870
I just noticed no one else wanted to go.

646
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:02,910
I didn't mind.

647
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:03,650
You didn't mind?

648
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,910
Why would you be the only one?

649
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:05,750
I...

650
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,670
I've never minded anything.

651
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:08,740
What?

652
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,990
Nonsense. You're lying.

653
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,340
Seriously, Mr. Ma.

654
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,430
I just don't mind.

655
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,740
When I was a kid,

656
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,060
my brother and I both wanted ice cream,

657
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,870
but my family didn't buy one for me,

658
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,470
and I didn't mind, either.

659
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:24,710
Later,

660
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,150
I only met Mengmeng's dad once,

661
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,670
and they suggested we get married.

662
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,910
I didn't mind, either.

663
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:34,150
None of them ever asked me.

664
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:40,100
I didn't mean you had to ask me.

665
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,340
I...

666
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,430
I don't know how to say it.

667
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,740
Honestly, I don't mind.

668
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,340
I shouldn't be telling you this.

669
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,910
When Mengmeng's dad didn't come back

670
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,950
from fishing,

671
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,470
everyone told me he was dead.

672
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,870
I didn't ask about it, either.

673
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,150
I didn't mind.

674
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:02,870
You didn't mind?

675
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,300
Zhang Yan, listen.

676
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,190
Sometimes,

677
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:17,500
you're tougher than you think.

678
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,230
But I don't need
that toughness from you.

679
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:28,340
I just want to see the real you.

680
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,630
The real me?

681
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:37,390
The real me has nothing at all.

682
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:40,940
Come on.

683
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,150
Do you know what matters most?

684
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,670
It's not about how many people like you

685
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,150
or how many love you;

686
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,340
it is

687
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,500
about whether you're worth being loved.

688
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,340
Look at me.

689
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,950
The woman in my eyes now

690
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,710
is the real you.

691
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,670
She deserves to be treated with care.

692
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:40,760
Mr. Ma.

693
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:41,660
You're awake.

694
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:42,630
Have some breakfast.

695
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,390
I...

696
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,430
You were drunk last night.

697
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,990
I helped you back to my room.

698
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,190
I slept in the guest room.

699
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,630
Oh, your phone's charged.

700
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:55,790
Okay.

701
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,990
Your neighbor
kept calling you last night.

702
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,100
I answer it for you.

703
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:06,390
She said Mengmeng was home alone
with no one to look after her,

704
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,100
so I asked her to help.

705
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,710
Remember to thank her today.

706
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,190
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

707
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,590
If you really want to thank me,

708
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,710
stop calling me Mr. Ma
when we're off work.

709
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:23,790
Also,

710
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,300
what I said yesterday

711
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,170
wasn't just the drink talking.

712
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:43,340
What made you suddenly want
to go shopping with me today?

713
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,430
Are you in love?

714
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,230
No.

715
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,950
I just got paid and wanted

716
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,430
to buy myself something new.

717
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,060
This one looks good.

718
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,100
It really suits you.

719
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,820
You look a bit different today.

720
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,910
Do you think this looks good on me?

721
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,950
I've told you.

722
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:45,910
What I love is the real you.

723
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,100
What I love is the real you.

724
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,460
(Win with Influence;
Become a Millionaire in Seven Years)

725
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:05,910
Did you sleep well?

726
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,750
Move in with me.

727
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,310
When Ma Weicheng treated me well,

728
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:15,990
he could be really nice.

729
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,430
Bring Mengmeng, too.

730
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,950
Though he'd done a lot of things

731
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,180
that really scared me...

732
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,350
Let me take care of you.

733
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,100
... He also said he loved me.

734
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:27,010
He said I deserve to be loved.

735
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,820
Maybe because, since I was little,

736
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,470
I've never been loved properly,

737
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,750
I honestly mistook that for love.

738
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,270
But that wasn't love.

739
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,830
That was just hurting you.

740
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,100
He said you deserved love?

741
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,280
If he thought that,

742
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,870
why control what you wear?

743
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,350
How is that supposed to be love?

744
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,350
He was just testing
how far he could push you

745
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:58,890
and trying to control you step by step.

746
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:00,710
Yeah.

747
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,700
Looking back now,

748
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,350
I realize
that when he was nice to me at first,

749
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:07,290
it was to figure out
what kind of woman I was.

750
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,990
He wanted to find my weak spots,

751
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,270
so he could use them against me.

752
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:16,020
Once he saw my insecurities,

753
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,390
I became easy for him to control.

754
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,540
Like a trap.

755
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,700
He drew an invisible circle around you,

756
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,160
and that circle kept shrinking

757
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,870
bit by bit

758
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,430
until there was only you and him inside.

759
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,800
Then your whole world
revolved around him.

760
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,180
You're right.

761
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,270
Everyone got paid this afternoon,

762
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,750
except for me.

763
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,350
I did that on purpose.

764
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,100
Just messing with you.

765
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,750
I bought an education fund for Mengmeng.

766
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,390
It's only a few thousand each month.

767
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,910
So, when she goes to college,

768
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:02,910
we won't have to worry.

769
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,060
Look.

770
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,620
That's quite a bit.

771
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,950
It's really good.

772
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,430
But my salary might not cover it.

773
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,890
You've got me to help, don't you?

774
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,310
Now that we're together,

775
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,360
there's no need
to separate yours and mine.

776
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,620
I'll put all our money

777
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,020
into one bank card.

778
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,540
Whenever you need it, just tell me.

779
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,310
Let's be more careful with spending,

780
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,430
and it'll be fine.

781
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,490
We should think long-term

782
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:43,990
for Mengmeng

783
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,830
and our future.

784
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,100
Thanks.

785
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:01,940
Thank you.

786
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,390
Ms. Xu,

787
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,430
I'll pass on the drink.

788
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:06,980
Have one.

789
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,430
It's not easy for us to get together.

790
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,620
Take it.

791
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:10,750
Yeah, come on.

792
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,430
Come on, let's drink.

793
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,270
Cheers!

794
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:21,830
Oh, Zhang Yan.

795
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:23,110
My husband's cousin

796
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,740
came to Pingtan to visit us
a while back.

797
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,790
After he left,
he started asking me about you.

798
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:28,220
Do you have someone you like?

799
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,870
She's definitely seeing someone.

800
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:31,910
No, I'm not.

801
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:34,310
Your smile gives it away every day.

802
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:36,950
We even went shopping days ago.

803
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,790
Why aren't you wearing that dress?

804
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,790
Who were you planning to show it to?

805
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:42,870
No one.

806
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,580
I just haven't put it on.

807
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,060
I'm back.

808
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,090
Did you buy the ink cartridge?

809
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,620
I forgot.

810
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,430
Do you need it right now?
I can go get one.

811
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,310
Did you drink?

812
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,470
Everyone was having fun,

813
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,270
so I had a little.

814
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,950
Do you think

815
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,110
what I say doesn't matter anymore?

816
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:40,870
Do you even care about me now?

817
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:41,750
Of course, I do.

818
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,870
Then how could you forget?

819
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:46,900
I'll go right now...

820
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:02,150
Mengmeng.

821
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:03,870
I'm here.

822
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:07,750
It's okay.

823
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:08,700
It's fine.

824
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,270
It's okay, Mengmeng.

825
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,430
I'm right here.

826
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,460
It's alright.

827
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:37,830
Do you think

828
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:39,310
I'm being selfish by not letting you

829
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:40,430
tell them about us?

830
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:42,190
No, not at all.

831
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,910
I know you were looking out for me.

832
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:46,750
Zhang Yan,

833
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,430
in this world,

834
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,870
not everyone is as kind as you imagine.

835
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,470
If they find out about us,

836
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:55,430
they'll talk behind your back at work.

837
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:57,750
That'd be bad for you.

838
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:58,910
I just wanted to protect you.

839
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,350
I know.

840
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:19,270
I'm sorry.

841
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,790
I lost my temper just now.

842
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:24,750
I shouldn't have gotten that angry.

843
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:27,590
Please forgive me.

844
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:28,900
Okay?

845
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:10,500
Don't hang out
with those people anymore.

846
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:13,310
You've got me and Mengmeng.

847
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:14,830
That's all you need.

848
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:23,860
(Longxiang Travel & Transport Co., Ltd.)

849
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:29,790
I haven't gone out

850
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,100
for fun in years.

851
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:34,830
That's sweet of you to plan this.

852
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:38,790
Zhang,

853
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,180
I often think

854
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,870
that if I had a daughter like you,

855
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:43,950
that would be wonderful.

856
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:47,790
Ms. Li,

857
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:53,220
I'm all alone in Pingtan.

858
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:55,470
I met you on my first day of work.

859
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:58,540
I really think that was fate.

860
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,350
In my heart,

861
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,020
I've long seen you as my mom.

862
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:06,700
Really?

863
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:10,790
Then I'll treat you like my daughter.

864
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,700
Don't be so polite with me.

865
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:14,950
You don't have to be so polite, either.

866
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:17,350
I've been watching the whole day.

867
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:18,910
She's really kind to you.

868
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:20,750
Yes.

869
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,060
At our age,

870
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,540
the greatest blessing is

871
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,540
to have such a caring child
by your side.

872
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:28,190
Exactly.

873
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:30,750
Is your daughter married?

874
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,180
Is she seeing anyone?

875
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:33,630
Mom.

876
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:36,620
Not yet.

877
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:38,350
What does she do for work?

878
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:45,060
She works at a health products company.

879
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:45,900
When you have time,

880
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,100
you should drop by her company.

881
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,020
Sure.

882
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,110
Once we get there,

883
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:53,270
I'll have my son drive there.

884
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:54,750
Right.

885
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:57,470
Later, you can take them there.

886
00:44:59,060 --> 00:44:59,900
Sure.

887
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,060
You can rest completely assured.

888
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:03,970
Our business

889
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:06,180
is definitely more reliable
than any bank investment.

890
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:08,790
- Ma, I trust you.
- Thanks.

891
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:10,180
Don't worry. I'll think it over.

892
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,500
- Goodbye.
- See you.

893
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,340
Goodbye.

894
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:30,470
You're back.

895
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:50,830
What's wrong?

896
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,180
Where did you go today?

897
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:01,950
I went hiking with Ms. Li. You...

898
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:02,790
Ms. Li?

899
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:15,270
I saw it all.

900
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:19,950
I've worked so hard

901
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,870
to give you and Mengmeng a better life.

902
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:27,270
Yet you went out
messing around with another guy?

903
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:28,110
I...

904
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:34,270
I know.

905
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:35,440
Is it because you saw someone

906
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:36,730
drive me back today?

907
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:37,690
No, that's not it.

908
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,260
His mom said she wanted a health check.

909
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,070
- Do you think I'll buy that?
- So, he...

910
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:43,310
It's true. I've made the arrangements.

911
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:19,540
I'm sorry.

912
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:20,670
Sorry.

913
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:21,700
I'm sorry.

914
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,060
Please hear me out.

915
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:24,900
I'm sorry.

916
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:28,430
It's my fault.

917
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:30,020
I'm sorry.

918
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:38,310
Sorry.

919
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:40,540
It's my fault.

920
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:42,990
Something's wrong with me.

921
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:50,180
Sorry, I just love you too much.

922
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:54,430
When I was 15,

923
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,790
I hid alone in my room.

924
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:01,220
They thought I couldn't hear them,

925
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:03,910
but I actually heard everything.

926
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,540
I walked out, knelt,

927
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,430
kowtowed three times to them,

928
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:09,270
and said,

929
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:12,470
"Please, don't leave."

930
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:15,270
I said...

931
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:21,190
I...

932
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:23,180
This is all I can do.

933
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,500
I can't control anything.

934
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:33,910
I'm sorry.

935
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:36,910
Then I met you.

936
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:38,540
I've felt what home means again.

937
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:43,500
I'm so scared you'll leave me.

938
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:44,950
That's why I act this way.

939
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:47,270
Please, don't go.

940
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:48,110
I'm begging you.

941
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:52,100
Please don't leave me.

942
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:54,270
Please.

943
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,790
I don't have a home anymore.

944
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:57,830
I'm begging you.

945
00:48:57,830 --> 00:48:59,390
Go ahead, hit me.

946
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:00,580
Hit me if you have to.

947
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:01,830
Please, I'm begging you. Okay?

948
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:03,190
Please.

949
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:10,790
I've lost my home.

950
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,950
I don't have a home now.

951
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,700
One day, I was cleaning up the house.

952
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,270
I opened one of his books,

953
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:29,620
and I realized everything he said
about his childhood

954
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:30,910
(My mother)
was all made up.

955
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:33,220
It was exactly the same
as what's written in the book.

956
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,260
(A child from a struggling family)

957
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:37,700
Every story he told me

958
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:38,620
was a lie.

959
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:39,870
It was just an act.

960
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:44,910
It was completely a way to control me.

961
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:50,500
That's how he took advantage

962
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:51,910
of my feelings.

963
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:53,010
He knew I had a soft heart.

964
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,310
He pushed until my boundaries broke.

965
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:00,500
He's a total scumbag.

966
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,620
His mind's completely twisted.

967
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:07,830
When faced
with something humiliating like that,

968
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:10,430
he must've resolved to violence.

969
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:15,700
He must've hit you very hard.

970
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,100
But I've read those books now.

971
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,470
However foolish I might be,

972
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,850
I knew he wasn't the one
who needed saving.

973
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,020
The one who needed saving was me.

974
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:33,320
A shameless man like him

975
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:37,060
would never let you walk away easily.

976
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:50,230
Mengmeng.

977
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:56,270
Zhang Yan.

978
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:57,350
Step aside.

979
00:50:57,350 --> 00:50:58,210
Move aside.

980
00:50:58,220 --> 00:50:59,430
Zhang Yan, calm down.

981
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:00,270
Step aside.

982
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:05,350
Ma Weicheng.

983
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:07,060
Give Mengmeng back to me.

984
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:15,180
Give Mengmeng back to me!

985
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:16,220
Ma Weicheng!

986
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:35,420
You want to leave?

987
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:36,950
You want to leave now?

988
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:44,270
Mengmeng!

989
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:54,620
Go on then! Leave!

990
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,060
If you dare leave,

991
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:00,100
I'll kill both you and Mengmeng.

992
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:07,100
I mean what I say.
