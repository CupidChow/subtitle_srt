1
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:26,370
(X Theater)

2
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:41,830
Where is Mengmeng?

3
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,700
(First Aid Room)

4
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,940
Who here
is Chen Yiting's family?

5
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,780
I am.

6
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,990
Doctor, how is my daughter?

7
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,580
We've tried everything.

8
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,270
But the fever
won't go down.

9
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,270
Does anyone in your family
take sleeping pills?

10
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,190
The Lab Test Results
came out.

11
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,550
It shows high levels of
Diazepam in the blood.

12
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,950
If the high fever persists,

13
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:11,180
it could cause brain damage.

14
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,390
You need to prepare yourself
for the worst.

15
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,950
I was just about to call you.

16
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,070
The child has woken up.

17
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,670
Mengmeng.

18
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,830
Mengmeng.

19
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,830
Mengmeng.

20
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,350
Mengmeng, you're awake.

21
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,860
Doctor.

22
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,620
What's wrong with her?

23
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,830
I reminded you before.

24
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,110
To be mentally prepared.

25
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,830
Her fever lasted so long

26
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,460
that she got brain damage.

27
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,390
I... I don't understand what you mean.

28
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,460
Cranio-cerebral Injury

29
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,540
can lead to

30
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,580
developmental regression.

31
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,550
As for the severity of the symptoms,

32
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,230
we need to wait and see.

33
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,300
Doctor.

34
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,740
Can she be cured?

35
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,270
It will take time.

36
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,020
Mom.

37
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,950
It's okay.

38
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,420
=Persona=
=Episode 9=

39
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,020
That day, as soon as I got home,

40
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,620
I saw sleeping pills
scattered on the floor.

41
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,620
I never thought I'd been living in a fog

42
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,550
and end up hurting Mengmeng.

43
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,820
Don't think that way.

44
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,860
Mengmeng wouldn't either.

45
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,380
She only wants you to be okay.

46
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,940
You didn't see her then.

47
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,230
I was so scared.

48
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,620
If she stays like this forever,

49
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,670
what will we do?

50
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,150
I'm wondering if she's in pain.

51
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,230
She's so little right now.

52
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,620
Will it hurt more as she grows up?

53
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,150
I even thought

54
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,990
maybe we should just
end it all together.

55
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,500
If we both died,

56
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,590
maybe we'd both be free
from this suffering.

57
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,620
But when I look at her

58
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,860
(Fear's okay)
trying so hard to call me "mom",

59
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,180
and she smiles at me

60
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,260
to cheer me up.

61
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,230
Then another voice appeared in my mind.

62
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,900
I think

63
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,620
maybe she can be cured.

64
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,420
What if she gets cured.

65
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,350
So I think

66
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,420
don't leave.

67
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,300
Just stay.

68
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,060
At least...

69
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,620
At least Ma Weicheng
can still pay for Mengmeng's treatment.

70
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,860
It doesn't matter if he controls me.

71
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,420
For Mengmeng, I can do anything.

72
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,350
I just tell myself not to
think about it.

73
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,230
Just live a bit more numb.

74
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,820
Anyway, time will pass quickly.

75
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,500
Mr. Carnegie once said,

76
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,820
if you want both happiness and success,

77
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,710
you must find joy in your work.

78
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,260
Zhang Yan

79
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,180
has found joy in her work.

80
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,500
She is the best example of this.

81
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,740
That's why she has achieved so much.

82
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,340
(Gold Sales Champion)

83
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,940
Let's give her a round of applause.

84
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,790
Miss, could you help me find Ma?

85
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,110
I have something urgent.

86
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,910
Aunt, Mr. Ma is not here.

87
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,470
Maybe come back another day.

88
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,260
- Or could you call him?
- Godmother.

89
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,420
Why are you here?

90
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,430
Kid.

91
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,030
Hurry and help me find Ma.

92
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,230
It's urgent.

93
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,110
I called him,

94
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,470
but he wouldn't pick up.

95
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,740
Relax, what happened?

96
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,230
What's wrong?

97
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,150
My husband fell in the bathroom

98
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,740
this morning.

99
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,740
And he broke his femoral head.

100
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,060
The doctor said
he needs surgery right away.

101
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,990
But my money...

102
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,060
I invested it all into your shop.

103
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:49,940
I need to withdraw it.

104
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,500
I need my money back.

105
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,110
What investment?

106
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,300
When did our store ask for investments?

107
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,420
You... you didn't know?

108
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,550
Ma approached me privately.

109
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,230
He said about the new branch.

110
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,030
Since I've spent so much
on membership cards

111
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,620
and I'm a long-time customer,

112
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,260
he asked
if I wanted to be a shareholder.

113
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,500
He said shareholders can

114
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,910
get discounts on products.

115
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,420
And I could also receive dividends.

116
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,470
Ma gave me dividends for two months.

117
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,790
But now,
but now my husband is in trouble.

118
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,380
I need to use money.

119
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,230
I have to hurry...

120
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,380
Kid, help me figure this out.

121
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,260
I can only count on you.

122
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,180
Okay.

123
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,180
Then I'll go ask.

124
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,740
- Wait for me.
- Alright, alright.

125
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,230
I'll wait for your news.

126
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,580
Come in.

127
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,300
(Welcome to Jiankanglu)

128
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:43,910
Mr. Ma.

129
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,590
Ms. Li is here.

130
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,470
She said her husband needs surgery
and requires money.

131
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,500
She had invested in our business before.

132
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,860
It was handled by you.

133
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,230
She's asking
if she can get her money back.

134
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,020
You really think
you're her real daughter?

135
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,070
Mengmeng's condition means

136
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,990
we'll need more money later.

137
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,070
Who has time for other people's affairs?

138
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,140
Just say something

139
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,540
to send her away.

140
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,380
Mr. Ma.

141
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:21,790
Go ahead.

142
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,990
You can do it.

143
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,740
Kid, how is it going?

144
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,950
Godmother,
maybe you should go home for today.

145
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,110
I'll think of another way.

146
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,310
What's wrong?

147
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,990
Ma refused, didn't he?

148
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,780
Tell me, is he inside?

149
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,900
No, I'll go find him myself.

150
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,590
- That's my own money.
- Godmother.

151
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,950
I must get that money back!

152
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,020
Ms. Li.

153
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,220
Come here.

154
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,830
Ms. Li.

155
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,900
The money you invested

156
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,950
cannot be returned.

157
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,710
I was very clear with you
from the start.

158
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,660
This money

159
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,740
was for our new branch in Zhangzhou.

160
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,660
The branch is already open.

161
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,990
How can we return the money?

162
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:23,140
Wait,
I don't want the dividends anymore.

163
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,430
Ma, just return my principal to me.

164
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,540
I don't need the full amount.

165
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,190
Keep whatever you've spent.

166
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,260
Just give me back
a couple hundred thousand, please.

167
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,430
Ms. Li, Ms. Li.

168
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,230
How about you think it over again?

169
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,860
After all, this investment

170
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,710
gives you thousands
in dividends each month.

171
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,230
Where else get a deal this good?

172
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,190
If I had another way,

173
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,430
I wouldn't be here.

174
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,900
- Wait, don't do this.
- Get up first.

175
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,260
I treated you all like family.

176
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,350
- Please!
- We can't take this.

177
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,190
- Get up first.
- Save my husband, okay?

178
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,230
Get up first, get up.

179
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,190
No, if you don't agree, I won't get up.

180
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,310
Alright, I promise you.

181
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,710
Come on, get up now.

182
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,580
Then...

183
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,460
Ms. Li.

184
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,780
If this company were mine,

185
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,540
I'd give you the money right now.

186
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,760
- So...
- But I am just an agent.

187
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,190
How about this.

188
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,350
Give me some time.

189
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,230
Trust me.

190
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,660
I'll call headquarters.

191
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,470
See if there's a special procedure

192
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,430
we can apply for.

193
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,620
Then we return your shares to you, okay?

194
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,070
Alright, then my spouse can be saved.

195
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,470
But, but...

196
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,780
Headquarters is overseas.

197
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,070
There's a time difference.

198
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:29,930
Once they start work,

199
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,380
I will give them a call.

200
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,220
Alright?

201
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,900
Go back and take care of uncle.

202
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,070
Don't overthink.

203
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:35,910
Here, Manager Zhang.

204
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,900
See Aunt out.

205
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,110
Alright.

206
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,260
Ma, I'll wait for your news.

207
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,830
Ma, let me know as soon as
you have news.

208
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,780
Okay.

209
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,190
Have you eaten?

210
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,660
Yes, you go ahead.

211
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,620
Alright.

212
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,030
What's wrong?

213
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,500
Need money?

214
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,590
For Mengmeng's recovery,

215
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,070
the hospital needs payment.

216
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,430
Don't use that card.

217
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,830
That card has no money.

218
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,780
What does the hospital need money for?

219
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,230
You can ask them to contact me directly.

220
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,860
You've already spent so much
on Mengmeng.

221
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,140
From now on,
let's manage our own expenses.

222
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,500
Give me my money.

223
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,500
Your money.

224
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,190
You don't have any money left.

225
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,140
Don't think I don't know.

226
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,700
You...

227
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,020
just want to use my money

228
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,780
to pay back your so-called godmother.

229
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,070
You never intended to refund her.

230
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,740
That's her spouse's life-saving money.

231
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,020
How can you be so cruel?

232
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,860
We don't have the Zhangzhou store.

233
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,710
You kept all that money for yourself.

234
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,140
You need to understand

235
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,310
who is really on your side.

236
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,270
Is it your dad?

237
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,380
Your mom?

238
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,780
Or that ex-husband?

239
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,020
Did any of them care
if you lived or died?

240
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,070
Now you're taking my money for them.

241
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,540
How can you be so shameless?

242
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,310
You'd better
keep your mouth shut about this.

243
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,470
What if one day

244
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,430
Mengmeng gets in trouble

245
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,320
and we need money.

246
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,780
What will we do?

247
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,690
(Kid, when will I get my refund?)

248
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,540
(The hospital is urging me again)

249
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,780
(I went to your store)

250
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,780
(You weren't there, and neither was Ma.)

251
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,260
(Are you guys lying to me)

252
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,990
Did you see that?

253
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:03,830
She's back at work.

254
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,500
I thought she had resigned.

255
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,990
Probably thinks
the old lady's problem is over.

256
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,870
So she came.

257
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,740
What happened to that old lady?

258
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,670
I don't know.

259
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,430
Those days she came making a scene.

260
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,630
No one dared to deal with her.

261
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,100
Better not to ask too much.

262
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,060
You're Zhang Yan, right?

263
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,150
(Police)
There is a case.

264
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,390
Please come with us

265
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,260
for the investigation.

266
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,100
Li Bingmei was your client, right?

267
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,260
Yes.

268
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,820
She bought some health products
at our store.

269
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,580
I was the one who served her.

270
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,390
Did you know your store

271
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,780
planned to open a new branch?

272
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,910
Did you know Ma Weicheng
tricked customers into investing

273
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,500
in the name of opening a new store?

274
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,230
Just say whatever you know.

275
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,580
Don't hold back.

276
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,470
Li Bingmei invested 200,000 yuan.

277
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,670
This is her mobile phone.

278
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,340
Her last text message

279
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,500
and phone call

280
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,780
were both to you.

281
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,820
Since we called you over,

282
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,100
it means we already have

283
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,990
certain leads.

284
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,190
Did Ms. Li call the police?

285
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,230
She jumped off a building.

286
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,630
Now you understand how serious this is?

287
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,020
How is Aunt Li now?

288
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,020
Still in hospital, critical care.

289
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,190
We don't know if she'll wake up.

290
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,430
I didn't expect
it would turn out like this.

291
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,270
Officer.

292
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,470
I really didn't expect this.

293
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,230
When her son reported it,

294
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,430
he said his dad passed away
before getting surgery.

295
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,540
All because the money was stolen.

296
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,470
His mom couldn't live with the guilt.

297
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,630
Right after his dad's funeral,

298
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,260
she jumped.

299
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,420
Zhang Yan.

300
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:57,990
What's done is done.

301
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,670
Feeling sad or guilty won't help.

302
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,020
Because the amount
involved in this case is large

303
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,950
and the victim was seriously injured,

304
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,630
the circumstances are extremely bad.

305
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,340
The only thing you can do now

306
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,820
is to assist the police.

307
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,950
To bring the criminal to justice.

308
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,780
And give the victim justice.

309
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,860
Do you understand?

310
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,260
Ma Weicheng, right?

311
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,950
You are suspected of fraud.

312
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,300
Come with us.

313
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,950
Sorry, no time today.

314
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,470
When the cop first questioned me,

315
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,780
I didn't dare say anything.

316
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,260
Officer.

317
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,500
- But Ms. Li's family is destroyed.
- You got it wrong.

318
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,060
I felt if I were so selfish,

319
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,060
letting Ma Weicheng get away with it.

320
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,190
How am I any different from him?

321
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,500
So I told the police

322
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,780
everything I knew.

323
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,670
My mind went blank then.

324
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,390
My only thought was to
take Mengmeng and run.

325
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,340
Don't cry, don't cry.

326
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,950
It's okay now. It's okay.

327
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:56,790
Mommy is here.

328
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:01,580
But Hong,

329
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,190
I'm really scared.

330
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,060
You're scared he'll show up again.

331
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,380
Right?

332
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,140
Yes.

333
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,260
And sometimes I can really see him.

334
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,950
I just see him at my doorstep.

335
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,580
Sometimes it's on the street.

336
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,190
I don't dare take the bus.

337
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,230
I'm afraid to go out.

338
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,580
Sometimes I don't even dare
let people see my face.

339
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,950
Even though I clearly know

340
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,100
he has already been sentenced.

341
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,670
But you are still afraid.

342
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,340
Because you can't tell
if what you're seeing is an illusion

343
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,300
or real.

344
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,150
This kind of fear

345
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,500
constantly hangs over you.

346
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,470
Suffocating you.

347
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,390
Yes.

348
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,540
Because I felt the same way.

349
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:05,780
You know...

350
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,670
when I saw Kaifu...

351
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,020
Seeing Kaifu lying there,

352
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,710
I felt like my world fell apart.

353
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,020
I didn't have any other thoughts then.

354
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,860
I just thought

355
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,630
I should go with him.

356
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,740
I might as well die too.

357
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:52,870
But I couldn't.

358
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,990
I must take revenge.

359
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,430
I was insane back then.

360
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,430
Just wanted revenge.

361
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,300
I was going to kill Huang Shuquan.

362
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,470
After I killed him

363
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,540
I thought I would feel

364
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:11,870
relief.

365
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,580
Justice served.

366
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,780
But it's not.

367
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,580
Killing is not bravery.

368
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,990
During my year and a half on the run,

369
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,870
I also seem to always see him.

370
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,430
Sometimes

371
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,990
I'd see Kaifu.

372
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:58,900
I...

373
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:02,750
really...

374
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,470
really miss him.

375
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,910
But what's even scarier is

376
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,870
I'd also see Huang Shuquan.

377
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,780
Saw him while eating.

378
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,950
Saw him while sleeping.

379
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,990
Saw him when I was doing hard labor.

380
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,230
Sometimes, sleeping under a bridge,

381
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,190
I'd turn around and see his face.

382
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,340
This fear

383
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,340
suffocated me.

384
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,990
So I know what you're saying.

385
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,500
I understand how you feel.

386
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,150
Until I met Danshun again.

387
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,710
Saw you,

388
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,710
Mengmeng,

389
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,390
and all these beautiful things.

390
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,430
Thank you.

391
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,190
During the time I was with Danshun,

392
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,020
I also felt saved by him.

393
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,100
I thought I could finally

394
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,390
get out of that pain.

395
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,910
But he still didn't let me go.

396
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,900
(Star Special Education Center)

397
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,100
A few months ago,

398
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,390
I went to pick up Mengmeng.

399
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,270
Teacher,

400
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,940
where's Mengmeng?

401
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,990
Your friend is with her
in the rehab room.

402
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:59,820
What friend?

403
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,190
That man said he is your friend.

404
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,260
Come on, Mengmeng.

405
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,230
Go, Mengmeng.

406
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,500
Yes, a little higher.

407
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,910
Come on, Mengmeng.

408
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,780
Mengmeng.

409
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,940
- Mengmeng.
- Go.

410
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,940
Mengmeng.

411
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,580
Mengmeng.

412
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,670
Didn't I tell you

413
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:24,060
not to play on this?

414
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,310
Let's go.

415
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,230
Long time no see.

416
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,100
Not even a greeting?

417
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,740
I have nothing to do with you anymore.

418
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,020
Nothing?

419
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,870
Mengmeng has improved so much.

420
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,340
You've changed too.

421
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:45,940
Confident.

422
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:46,990
Beautiful.

423
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,140
Independent.

424
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,230
Nothing like the old you.

425
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,340
Don't come near us again.

426
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,740
You were the one
who gave the police evidence, huh?

427
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,020
Our fate isn't over yet.

428
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:04,830
We'll meet again.

429
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,550
Bye bye, Mengmeng.

430
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:20,750
Danshun.

431
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,150
I want to discuss something with you.

432
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:28,550
Go ahead.

433
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,630
I took Mengmeng for a check-up today.

434
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,950
The doctor said
a hospital in Xiamen

435
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:34,950
is very suitable for her.

436
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,540
How about we move to Xiamen?

437
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,470
Maybe wait a bit longer.

438
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:45,780
Wait for what?

439
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,390
We've just started to
make some progress here.

440
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,870
The cost of living in Xiamen
is also high.

441
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,950
Then how long do we have to wait?

442
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,230
Let me save up a bit more money.

443
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,670
So you and Mengmeng
won't have to struggle there.

444
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:22,740
What's wrong?

445
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,430
You seem distracted lately.

446
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,060
Is something going on?

447
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:30,470
Nothing.

448
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,100
Let's sleep.

449
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,580
Coming.

450
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,430
You forgot your keys today?

451
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,910
It's fine. It's fine.

452
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,020
Don't be nervous.

453
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,380
I just say something.

454
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,420
Then I'll leave.

455
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,340
Not bad.

456
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,430
Living comfortably.

457
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,430
Even has a balcony.

458
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,870
Very cozy.

459
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,510
Mengmeng.

460
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,780
Miss uncle?

461
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,620
Mengmeng.

462
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:34,560
Mengmeng.

463
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,950
Let's go inside and play.

464
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,630
Mengmeng.

465
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:49,870
Play with the bunny first.

466
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:50,870
Don't come out.

467
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,740
Your boyfriend doesn't smoke?

468
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,340
What exactly do you want to do?

469
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,060
You're in a hurry?

470
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,670
Let me show you something.

471
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,430
What's wrong?

472
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,910
You're shameless!

473
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,780
It was hard to record this.

474
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,740
I know you'll leave me someday.

475
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,740
Without something in my hand,

476
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,990
I can't feel at ease.

477
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:43,580
You know?

478
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:47,300
After I came out, I really had nothing.

479
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,100
This is all your doing.

480
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,230
You should at least give me
some compensation.

481
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,710
I have no money.

482
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,190
I'll ask your boyfriend.

483
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,390
You can't.

484
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,340
Okay.

485
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,660
I won't go to him.

486
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,500
I also know

487
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,920
you need to pay for
Mengmeng's illness.

488
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:16,740
I'm not asking for much.

489
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,740
Fifty thousand.

490
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,870
Ten days.

491
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,950
If I can't get it after ten days,

492
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,990
I will send it to

493
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,470
Lyu Danshun.

494
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,580
Right?

495
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,340
I'll be waiting.

496
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,300
He asked for it more than once, huh?

497
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,780
After he was released from prison,

498
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,780
he completely lost that

499
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,390
superior attitude he had before.

500
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,190
No more acting.

501
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,820
Just a total scumbag.

502
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,630
Every time he asks for money,
he says it's the last time.

503
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,950
With that last video,

504
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:25,870
he kept squeezing close to

505
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,430
100 grand out of me,

506
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,870
half threatening, half swearing.

507
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,100
Holding so many videos in his hand.

508
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,670
When you were with him,

509
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,950
if you ever disobeyed him,

510
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,150
he could use the videos to control you.

511
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,500
Now that he sees you've moved on.

512
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,230
So he uses these videos to threaten you

513
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,020
to get what he wants.

514
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,630
Last week,

515
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:52,340
he asked me for thirty thousand again.

516
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,740
I really have no money left for him.

517
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,190
Let him do whatever.

518
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:00,870
I have it.

519
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,070
I'll give it to him.

520
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,020
But on one condition.

521
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,100
You help me get him to come out.

522
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,270
What do you want to do, Hong?

523
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,350
Nothing.

524
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,350
Just eliminate a scumbag
for the greater good.

525
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:16,950
No, no.

526
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:18,350
You have a case hanging over you.

527
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,750
- It's too dangerous.
- Dangerous?

528
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,100
Me, a murderer, dangerous?

529
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,540
Or a fraudster dangerous?

530
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,140
Don't worry.

531
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,140
If he meets me,

532
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,140
he's the one in danger.

533
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,220

We're even.

535
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,140
If you help me like this,

536
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,500
I don't know how to repay you.

537
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:50,950
Actually,

538
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,060
you have a way to repay.

539
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:57,990

00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,220

to have a worry-free old age.

545
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,950
Don't worry.

546
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:21,990
You rest assured too.

547
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,990
I'll deal with this scumbag.

548
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,220
Only after dealing with him

549
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,140
can I leave with peace of mind.

550
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:35,750
Come on.

551
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,700
Give me Feiyu's phone number.

552
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,350
It's Feichuan.

553
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,100

Here's the money.

564
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,180
Where's the video?

565
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,180
If you want to take this money today,

566
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,790
you have to give me the phone too.

567
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,700
This phone cost over three thousand.

568
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,500
Fifty thousand buys the videos.

569
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,140
Plus two thousand for your phone.

570
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,270
So straightforward?

571
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,100
Very unlike you.

572
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,910
Deal.

573
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:53,150
Password.

574
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,790
All my passwords are my birthday.

575
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:02,630
What?

576
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:03,990
You even forgot my birthday?

577
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,620
You have too many birthdays.

578
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,430
I don't know which one is real or fake.

579
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:11,180

581
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,470
Why only two?

582
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,350
Just two.

583
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,180
You're actually checking?

584
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,990
Didn't you say this stuff
was disgusting?

585
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,060
This is the last time.

586
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,390
Promise you won't ask me for them again.

587
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,580
How can I promise that?

588
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,950
Should I write you a guarantee?

589
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,270
Promise me

590
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,270
you'll never use

591
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:56,870
my sex video to threaten me.

592
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,390
How can you
say those words so easily?

593
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:10,940
Say it.

594
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,500
I promise you

595
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,790
I will never...

596
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:30,860
What are you doing?

597
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:32,830
Wanna call the police?

598
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:42,020
I, Ma Weicheng,

599
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,310
asked Zhang Yan for fifty thousand yuan.

600
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,540
But I deserve it.

601
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,830
She had no one to love her as a kid.

602
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:55,060
I was the one who saved her.

603
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:58,140
I took her in

604
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,040
like a stray dog.

605
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:01,100
But now she's turning on me.

606
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:09,500
Go ahead, call the police.

607
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,950
At most they'll arrest me again.

608
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,310
A few more days inside.

609
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,950
I've been there before.

610
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,100
I'll come to you after I get out.

611
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:24,310
You'll never get rid of me.

612
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,500
- Hello.
- Hong.

613
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,700
Try this password.

18881124.

615
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,140
But he found out I was recording.

616
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,220
He's on his way back now.

617
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,060

629
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,500
Why did we come here?

630
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:58,700
I want to show you something.

631
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,830
I don't want to look, just delete it.

632
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:10,750
Every time I see Mengmeng,

633
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,660
I think of you with another man.

634
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:14,870
The way you were together.

635
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,790
This is really too cruel.

636
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:35,540
Mengmeng.

637
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:39,670
Look.

638
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:42,500
Stop crying!

639
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:44,270
No crying allowed.

640
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:45,950
Stop crying, do you hear me?

641
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,310
Stop crying!

642
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:50,620
Stop crying!

643
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:55,860
Stop crying!

644
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:07,470
Zhang Yan.

645
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:12,620
Your child is just too noisy.

646
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:16,270
I really can't get a minute of rest.

647
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,870
It's really killing me.

648
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:23,430
However,

649
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:26,180
I thought of a good idea.

650
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,270
This idea

651
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:41,310
should help her fall asleep, right?

652
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:45,020
If this still doesn't work,

653
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:47,500
then I really have no other way.

654
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,470
Does anyone in your family
take sleeping pills?

655
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:51,060
The Lab Test Results
came out.

656
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:53,390
It shows high levels of
Diazepam in the blood.

657
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:56,240
- Her fever lasted so long
- Mengmeng.

658
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:57,750
- that she got brain damage.
- Mengmeng.

659
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,250
- It can lead
- Don't cry, milk time.

660
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:01,180
- to developmental regression.
- Milk time.

661
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,100
Hold it.

662
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,870
Let go of me!

663
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:07,390
Let me go!

664
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:09,990
Let go of me!

665
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:11,580
Let me go!
