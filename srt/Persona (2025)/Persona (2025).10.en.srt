Mengmeng.

Mengmeng.

00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,140
Mengmeng.

00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,860
Mengmeng.

6
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,980
Hello.

7
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:49,740
Mengmeng has a fever.

8
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,020
I'll take her to the hospital.

9
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,550
Hurry over.

=Episode 10=

11
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,830
How much do you family members
know about her condition?

12
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,510
We

13
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,140
don't know much.

14
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,980
(Considering high possibility
of pancreatic cancer)

15
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,950
It's stage IV
pancreatic malignant tumor.

16
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,860
(Recommend further examination)

17
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,230
So how is stage IV treated?

18
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,590
Basically just chemotherapy
plus immunotherapy.

19
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,670
Probably lose both life and money.

20
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,230
But it must be treated.

21
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,740
We'll pay whatever it takes.

22
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,420
I understand how you feel.

23
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,380
But to be blunt,

24
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,620
pancreatic cancer

25
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,820
is the king of cancers.

26
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,790
The condition

27
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,180
has already progressed to the point

28
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,260
where the patient feels
this kind of pain.

29
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,300
It'll only get worse later.

30
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,910
If you insist on treatment,

31
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,990
you need to talk it over with her first.

32
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,550
But to be honest,

33
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,420
it's not very meaningful.

34
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,390
Doctor.

35
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,790
Well...

36
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,670
what do you mean by

37
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,940
"not very meaningful"?

38
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,590
To be conservative,

39
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,590
three months to half a year.

40
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,380
How is it? Still hurting?

41
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,030
Nothing much.

42
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,860
It hurt a bit before.

43
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,260
It's much better now.

44
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,710
What's the illness?

45
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,180
- Doctor...
- Pancreatitis, right?

46
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,820
I looked it up before.

47
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,670
It's pretty much
the same as my symptoms.

48
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:01,860
It's nothing serious.

49
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,740
Just go back and rest,
and it'll be fine.

50
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,470
Hong.

51
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,350
Tell him to stop this IV drip.

52
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,820
Wait, let's finish the IV first.

53
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,740
Let's go home first.

54
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,580
Anyway,

55
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,740
Mengmeng is at home with Danshun.

56
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,180
Have you made up your mind?

57
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,470
Hospitalization?

58
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,230
I'll find you later.

59
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,110
Thank you.

60
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,030
No need for hospitalization.

61
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,100
Isn't...

62
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,670
Isn't it pancreatitis?

63
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:49,990
Zhang Yan.

64
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,790
The doctor said

65
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,110
you have stage IV pancreatic cancer.

66
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,350
Can it be treated?

67
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,910
To be conservative,

68
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,380
three months to half a year.

69
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,230
Of course.

70
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,030
It can definitely be cured.

71
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,550
Medical science is so advanced now.

72
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,380
Many cancers have been cured.

73
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,060
Really?

74
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,550
Yeah.

75
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,150
I can't be hospitalized.

76
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,350
- Zhang Yan.
- I want to go home.

77
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,550
Calm down.

78
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,150
Mengmeng is waiting.
I want to go home.

79
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,940
- Calm down.
- Hong, don't stop me.

80
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,260
I can't be hospitalized.

81
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,710
I want to go back.

82
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,590
Calm down, finish the IV drip.

83
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,060
Let's finish the IV drip.

84
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,940
Calm down.

85
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,940
I can't be hospitalized.

86
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,030
I don't have that much time.

87
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,180
Hong, let me go back.

88
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,110
Alright, alright.

89
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,310
No hospitalization.

90
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,910
Mengmeng is still waiting for me.

91
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:01,900
Okay.

92
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,110
Hong.

93
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,910
Don't tell Danshun yet.

94
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,310
I want to find a time to
tell him myself.

95
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:38,710
Alright.

take sleeping pills?

The Lab Test Results came out.

105

It shows high levels of
Diazepam in the blood.

106
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,900
If the high fever persists

107
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,070
and it lasts for a long time,

108
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,590
it could cause brain damage.

109
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,070
You need to prepare yourself
for the worst.

110
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,110
This idea

111
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,190
should help her fall asleep, right?

Not asleep yet?

122
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,350
I know what you're going to do.

123
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,190
I have another way.

124
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,990
After watching those videos,

125
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,070
you didn't even ask me what to do.

126
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,430
I knew you already had an idea.

127
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,260
Hong.

128
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,990
I can't let you kill Ma Weicheng.

129
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,740
Calm down and listen to me first.

130
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,620
While watching the videos, I realized

131
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,950
the time and date on

132
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,380
Ma Weicheng's last video

133
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,860
was the day Mengmeng got brain damage.

(Ma Weicheng Calling)

- not because accidental intake.
- Hello.

137
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,500
Mengmeng has a fever.

138
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,710
I'll take her to the hospital.

139
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,620
Hurry over.

140
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,430
It was because Ma Weicheng fed her.

141
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,950
Ma Weicheng used to lull her to sleep.

142
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,470
I thought he was being nice to her.

143
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,950
Mengmeng trusted him too.

144
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,860
Now I realize

145
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,590
he's been feeding Mengmeng
sleeping pills all along.

146
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,260
That's why
she got brain damage in the end.

147
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,660
He ruined Mengmeng's whole life.

148
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:13,860
Hong.

149
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,380
Look, I'm already like this.

150
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,830
I have a plan.

151
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,900
I don't have much time left

152
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,500
in this world.

153
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,990
I can entrust Mengmeng to
you and Danshun.

154
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,590
I think this is the best choice.

155
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,780
Don't talk nonsense.

156
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,190
I disagree.

157
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,710
When Mengmeng grows up,

158
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,540
I hope she will be more like you.

159
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,830
- Not like me.
- Don't talk nonsense.

160
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,190
You know.

161
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,380
There isn't that much time left.

162
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,380
Why waste it on

163
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,260
such a scumbag?

164
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,350
You should be spending this time
with Mengmeng.

165
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,950
Go back to Danshun.

166
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,140
Is this scumbag worth it?

167
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,900
The only thing
I worry about in this plan

168
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,590
- is you suffering.
- I don't mind it.

169
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,590
But is this person worth it?

170
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,740
Is he worth exchanging your life for?

171
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,900
I'm begging you.

172
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,230
Here we go.

173
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,190
Come on.

174
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,470
Tomorrow

175
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,860
we'll send Hong off.

176
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,950
Hong, hope you

177
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,780
will have a smooth and safe trip.

178
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,590
After the storm comes the rainbow.

179
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,710
Hong.

180
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,140
Once you get through this,

181
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,500
you won't have to
live in hiding anymore.

182
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,780
We'll live openly in the sun.

183
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,140
Come on, cheers.

184
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:47,980
Cheers.

185
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,620
I was just being petty before.

186
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,780
Exactly.

187
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,020
You two outsiders

188
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,470
came here without asking me for help.

189
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:04,790
Sis.

190
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,020
Let us know once you're settled.

191
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,860
Zhang Yan and I will take Mengmeng
to visit you.

192
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,500
I don't want auntie to leave.

193
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,580
Mengmeng.

194
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,430
Let's make an agreement
with auntie.

195
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,230
When you grow up, we'll go visit her.

196
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,070
Alright?

197
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,380
Danshun.

198
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,110
After I leave,

199
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,780
your most important task

200
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,390
is to take good care of
her and her child.

201
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,710
The three of you living well

202
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,950
is more important than anything.

203
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,470
Got it?

204
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,070
Don't worry, sis.

205
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,990
I always said I'd protect you
when I grew up.

206
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,540
But I never managed to do it.

207
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,990
This time, I will.

208
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:44,830
Also,

209
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,230
seeing you this time,
I really think you've grown up.

210
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,100
You're a real man.

211
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,540
So, it's time to change
those old bad habits.

212
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,020
Remember,

213
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,190
promise me one thing

214
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,910
that no matter what happens,

215
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,060
you must not act on impulse.

216
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:05,710
Okay?

217
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,420
Okay.

218
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,020
Let's eat dumplings.

219
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,540
They'll get cold soon.

220
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:30,990
Here, sis.

221
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,740
We can't tell Danshun.

222
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,540
We both know his personality.

223
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,580
You are the only one who can help me.

224
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,500
Hong.

225
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,990
I beg you.

226
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,340
Danshun.

227
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,190
Mengmeng is a bit sleepy.

228
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,780
Take her down to sleep first.

229
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,260
Alright, I'll come up later.

230
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,300
Mengmeng.

231
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,470
Time to sleep.

232
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,620
Hong.

233
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,420
Thank you.

234
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,380
For what?

235
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,910
One more crazy ride with you.

236
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,310
That's enough.

237
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,470
I asked around.

238
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,540
I never thought
this place would be empty.

239
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,710
The price is also quite cheap.

240
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,820
And it's convenient for me.

241
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,990
At least I know this area well.

242
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:26,990
This is where

243
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,820
Danshun and I met.

244
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,990
Before coming, I tidied up a bit.

245
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,630
From now on, this will be our base.

246
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,340
So,

247
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,580
what's your plan?

248
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,740
I think you should

249
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,870
use Lin Chang's identity to
get close to Ma Weicheng.

250
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,780
Get him interested in you first.

251
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,340
Because I thought it over.

252
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,950
He has his own standards
when hunting for prey.

253
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,220
Mr. Ma, go on back.

254
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,070
Alright, take care.

255
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,430
- Non-aggressive look.
- Go back.

256
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,710
Okay, be careful not to slip.

257
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,100
And weak personality.

258
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,020
Easy for him to brainwash and control.

259
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,580
Then let's tailor-make
a Lin Chang for him.

260
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,390
So what does Lin Chang do?

Open a clothing store.

264
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,620
Bro.

265
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,230
Sorry.

266
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,630
I just moved here.

267
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,500
A new store just opened up ahead.

268
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,060
I opened the Tian Cai

269
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,500
right next to his store.

270
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,190
First,

271
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,500
it lets him easily approach me.

272
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,950
Second,

273
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,820
if the cops check,
they'll find me right away.

274
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:06,500
Okay.

275
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,710
Let's do it as you said.

My name is Lin Chang.

Could I borrow

278
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,500
the rope for tying goods?
Do you have it?

279
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:17,710
Yes.

280
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,910
Can you lend it to me?

281
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:20,780
Of course.

282
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,430
Thank you.

I saw you were renovating here.

287

Looks pretty good.

You can also call me Weicheng.

all the way here to open a store?

321
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,820
I got divorced.

- Sorry.
- It's okay.

323

Anyway, after the divorce,

324
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,500
I thought I had no home left.

325
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,950

337
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,710
is also the first proper meal

338

I've had since I came here.

00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,500
So,

340
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,740
thank you.

348
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,150
I had some takeout.

349

for so long,

just tell me directly.

00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:02,910
Brought you some candles.

379
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,870
Weicheng,
why don't you come in for a while?

380
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,940
I'm...

381
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:08,820
afraid of the dark.

382
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,030
Alright.

383
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,100
Thanks.

384
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,340
Here.

385
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,940
Weicheng.

386
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,500
How long does the power
usually stay out?

387
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,430
Hard to say.

388
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,390
This area has a lot of old houses.

389
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,470
Power outages happen often.

390
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,390
Weicheng, don't you think

391
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,540
I'm too timid?

392
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,500
What are you talking about?

393
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,470
A woman like you

394
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,820
coming here alone to open a store.

395
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,580
That's already very brave.

396
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,990
It's not really bravery.

397
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,740
It's just...

398
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,500
being out of options.

399
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,740
Actually, I don't even know

400
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,780
if this store will make or lose money.

401
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,990
Women love looking nice.

402
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,230
Open a clothing store.

403
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,910
Even if there's a loss,
it shouldn't be too much, right?

404
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,340
You women always say

405
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,060
there's always one

406
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,470
missing piece in your closet.

407
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,670
Actually, men are the same.

408
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,870
They always feel
they never earn enough money.

409
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,230
The elderly always think
they don't live long enough.

410
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,150
Human nature is to never be satisfied.

411
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:38,020
So any business
that can satisfy human nature...

412
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,470
Weicheng,
you know a lot about human nature.

413
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:40,430
It will never lose money.

414
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,950
Then what do you think of me?

415
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,670
The power's back.

416
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:08,060
The power's back.

417
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,100
Weicheng, what did you just say?

418
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:21,830
I said

419
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,620
you

420
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,580
aren't suited for such heavy makeup.

421
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:28,630
Why?

422
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,740
You don't like it?

423
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,870
I don't like you

424
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,230
trying too hard to please others.

425
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,780
Being yourself is the most beautiful.

426
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,950
How about this?

427
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,470
Much better.

428
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,870
Do you think he's taken the bait?

429
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:01,200
Seducing him is a piece of cake.

430
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,540
It's just that
I haven't had enough fun yet.

431
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:06,430
We need to control the pace.

432
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,260
Then

433
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,820
how about we give him the

434
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,020
"play hard to get" treatment?

435
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,630
A slap, then a sweet date.

436
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,230
Keep him on the hook.

437
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,260
Then we reel him in.

438
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,020
Thanks for teaching me.

439
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:25,510
Oh, by the way.

440
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,870
That day's power outage

441
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,630
was not sudden.

442
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,260
(Power Outage Notice)
Due to old equipment on Jiuchang Street,

443
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,950
continuous maintenance
will be carried out for three months.

444
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,340
It is hereby scheduled each month

445
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,470
on the 11th from 10:00 to 12:00,

446
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,500
a two-hour power outage,

447
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,500
for circuit maintenance.

448
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:46,910
Hong.

449
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,430
The God is helping us.

450
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,780
Alright.

451
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,380
(6 Change outfit, 7 Final Operation)

452
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,900
(December)

453
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,150
(Final Operation)
Then our final time

454
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,780
will be set on this day.

455
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,230
Well, you

456
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,990
should put on makeup sometimes.

457
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:30,540
So that

458
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:32,430
Danshun doesn't see
how haggard you look.

459
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:44,540
I work in a cosmetics store,

460
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,390
but I never expected I'd

461
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:48,060
get a gift like this.

462
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,500
Don't worry.

463
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,580
In this great show,

464
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,540
we are both good actresses.

465
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:08,790
Weicheng.

466
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:11,580
I specially ordered
this clothes for you.

467
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,990
I think it fits your style perfectly.

468
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,230
- Take a look.
- Thank you.

469
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,020
I really like it.

470
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,430
It's big.

471
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,100
Is it?

472
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,300
I think it's fine.

473
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:27,860
It's big.

474
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,340
Let me measure your size again.

475
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,740
Why suddenly give me clothes?

476
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,310
Guess.

477
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,780
No idea.

478
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,340
Because you're a good person.

479
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,710
In those uncles and aunties' eyes,

480
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,910
you're practically their savior.

481
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,150
So I wanted to give you clothes.

482
00:32:58,950 --> 00:32:59,820
You're flattering me.

483
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,260
There is a viewpoint.

484
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,390
I don't know if you agree with it.

485
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:08,390
What is it?

486
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,990
Actually, when a person gets old,

487
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,990
rather than scrimping and saving,

488
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,710
leaving money to the hospital,

489
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,260
it's better to

490
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,300
plan ahead

491
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:23,060
and do more maintenance.

492
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,910
After all, you only live once.

493
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,630
Health is priceless.

494
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:28,710
Right?

495
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:31,990
Weicheng.

496
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,950
What you say is truly philosophical.

497
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,870
I just love listening to you talk.

498
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,740
I'll fix it and bring it to you later.

499
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,990
I don't take things for free.

500
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,020
As a return favor,

501
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:47,580
could I

502
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,150
treat you to a meal?

503
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,500
A meal.

504
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,380
(Tian Cai)

505
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,260
Sure.

506
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,710
Can you drink sake?

507
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:01,580
I'm fine with anything.

508
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,020
Take a look.

509
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,430
I don't know much about it.

510
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,270
How about this one?

511
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,900
(DASSAI 23: 1280 yuan)

512
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,460
Thank you.

513
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:23,830
Weicheng.

514
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:25,630
Weicheng.

515
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:28,750
You took care of the food.

516
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,750
I'll pay for the drinks.

517
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:32,790
No way.

518
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,100
That's not how it works.

519
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,620
That's so embarrassing.

520
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,620
Thank you, Weicheng.

521
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,750
I'll pay them all.

522
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,350
Thank you.

523
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:49,790
Weicheng.

524
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,470
This toast is to you.

525
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,750
Thank you for
taking care of me these days.

526
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,830
Honestly, I don't think I did anything.

527
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,950
Maybe I just appreciate

528
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,060
you, Ms. Lin.

529
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,580
Weicheng.

530
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,220
Maybe you think it's nothing.

531
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,220
But for me,

532
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,540
it's quite precious.

533
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,580
Because I've never met anyone

534
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,220
who's been so kind to me.

535
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,350
So,

536
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:25,700
thank you.

537
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:31,100
Is that a volcano tattoo

538
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,100
on your wrist?

539
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,620
It's to cover that...

540
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,460
Yes.

541
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,320
Just...

542
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,990
From some impulsive things I did before.

543
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,790
Looks like you have your own story.

544
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,100
Not a story.

545
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:52,390
Just

546
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:54,830
a tough life.

547
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,060
Weicheng, didn't I tell you

548
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,350
that I've been divorced?

549
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,870
I also lost my home.

550
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:03,350
But actually,

551
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,350
I've never felt

552
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,750
that I ever truly had a home.

553
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,270
My parents never liked me
when I was little.

554
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,870
They all counted on

555
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,870
my brother to
take care of them in old age.

556
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:17,580
To be honest, it's like

557
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,580
they never thought I'd live to grow up.

558
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,140
Because

559
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:25,790
I have

560
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,870
congenital heart disease.

561
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,430
Weicheng,
you won't look down on me, will you?

562
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,500
So,

563
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,620
- Hard fate.
- I don't believe in fate.

564
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,660
Then what do you believe in?

565
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,060
I believe in myself.

566
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,310
It depends on whether you can seize

567
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,430
the chances god gives you.

568
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,310
I wonder if you've read

569
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,270
Dale Carnegie?

570
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,460
Who?

571
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,580
A book, right?

572
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,540
Weicheng, sorry I...

573
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,020
- It's okay.
- I don't like reading.

574
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,750
Mr. Carnegie said,

575
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,220
"Everyone

576
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,540
may possess

577
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,950
abilities and opportunities
they are unaware of.

578
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,430
Everyone may also be able to achieve

579
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:16,180
things they have never dreamed of."

580
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,660
This quote

581
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,620
is so profound.

582
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:23,750
You're so insightful.

583
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,380
Ms. Lin.

584
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,500
Why did you come to Pingtan?

585
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,790
I like the sea.

586
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,390
Good.

587
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,500
I'll take you to see it.

588
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,870
I've already seen the sea.

589
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:45,790
But...

590
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,100
there's one place I really want to go.

591
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,100
Where?

592
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,220
Haizi Cliff.

593
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,660
I heard that

594
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,620
people go there to worship the Sea God.

595
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,660
If the Sea God accepts your offering,

596
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,180
you can change your luck.

597
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:02,220
I think I've heard of it.

598
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,020
But now the road is closed,
so we can't go.

599
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:06,670
Right.

600
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,430
A developer was building

601
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,790
the seaside houses there before.

602
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:10,700
Fenced off that area.

603
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,540
Weicheng.

604
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,830
How about we sneak over there now?

605
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:15,710
Now?

606
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,910
It's very cold at night.

607
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:19,660
Are you kidding?

608
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,750
No, I'm not kidding.

609
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:21,590
Really.

610
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:23,750
Not kidding.

611
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:25,180
Then you must be drunk.

612
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,790
Wine doesn't make you drunk,
you get drunk.

613
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,020
Come on, one more glass.

614
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,540
I think you've something on your mind.

615
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,790
What luck are you in such a hurry
to change?

616
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,100
I want to change my

617
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,140
love luck.

618
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,580
I can't always be alone, right?

619
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:55,750
Right.

620
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,230
I understand.

621
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,700
Being hurt by
the closest family and loved ones

622
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,910
is a very sad thing.

623
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,830
So you came to Pingtan

624
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,620
to escape.

625
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,700
I think you're actually pretending.

626
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,020
You pretend to be very happy,

627
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:23,990
like you're living well.

628
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:25,470
But that's not the case.

629
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,020
No one's ever

630
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,140
understood me like this before.

631
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,180
Don't worry.

632
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:44,980
With me,

633
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,310
you don't have to pretend.

634
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,620
Thank you, Weicheng.

635
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,790
It's really nice to meet you.

636
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:09,910
I have something to do, so I'll leave.

637
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:18,860
Are you okay?

638
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:24,910
It's alright.

639
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,020
I will be right behind you.

640
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,910
Luckily these shoes broke.

641
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:35,470
Otherwise I couldn't have kept acting.

642
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,660
I can barely hold it together.

643
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:39,390
Back when I worked

644
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:40,540
in the cosmetics store,

645
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,700
I suffered a lot because of high heels.

646
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,750
Never thought they'd come in handy here.

647
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,790
You have no idea.

648
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,310
His face at that time

649
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,430
was all twisted up.

650
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,790
So satisfying to see.

651
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:52,910
Why didn't I

652
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,180
think of that?

653
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,830
I actually fell for his tricks.

654
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,350
Because you're kind-hearted.

655
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,700
But I don't think that way anymore.

656
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:09,790
We're both out of that hell.

657
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,830
It's not too late, right?

658
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,100
(Message from Ma Weicheng)

659
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:28,700
He said he found a path into Haizi Cliff.

660
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,390
Construction site stopped,
we can enter.

661
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,750
We can't delay any longer.

662
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,140
There's only one month left.

663
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,270
Then you need to be prepared.

664
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,990
You might have to
endure some grievances.

665
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:48,790
Being beaten is very painful.

666
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,430
So you must not resist.

667
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:52,060
As long as you don't resist,

668
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,660
you can minimize the harm.

669
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:01,500
It hurts a lot, right?

670
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:45,630
What's wrong?

671
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,180
Danshun.

672
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,500
What's wrong?
