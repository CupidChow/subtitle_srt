Kaifu.

00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,820
Stop the music.

10
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,450
It's fine, no worries.

11
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,540
Let me introduce someone.

12
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,980
This is one of my good buddies.

13
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,860
Kaifu.

14
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,730
Come on, Kaifu.

15
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:29,610
Have a seat.

16
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,290
Sit down.

17
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,220
I'm honored to have you here.

18
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,700
What would you like to drink?

19
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,610
Let me introduce you.

20
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,180
This is Mr. Li.

21
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,580
Someone broke Liu Mingyi's leg

22
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,020
last night at the market.

23
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,580
He's a merchant.

24
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,020
Really?

25
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,070
Why didn't I hear about it?

26
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,660
Who did it? Step forward.

27
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,100
Shuquan.

28
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,640
I sent someone to do it.

29
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,700
How many times have I told you?

30
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,140
We live under the rule of law now.

31
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,620
Stop using those old street tactics.

32
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,020
You're acting like thugs.

33
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,420
Sorry, Shuquan.

34
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,260
Why hit him anyway?

35
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,420
He refused to negotiate with us.

36
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,780
In that case,

37
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,260
Kaifu is here.

38
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,420
Kaifu.

39
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,820
Let's have a talk.

40
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,260
There's nothing to talk about.

41
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,140
Huang Shuquan.

42
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,800
Did you forget how I got you locked up

43
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,320
six years ago?

44
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:04,820
No, I didn't.

45
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,600
You haven't changed at all.

46
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,100
You did this?

47
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,660
You guys keep singing.

48
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,600
I'm taking him with me.

49
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,940
Come here.

50
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,260
Make way!

51
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,300
Let's go home.

52
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,740
Hong.

53
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,540
Making such a big scene?

54
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,140
Just leaving like that?

55
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,980
Move aside.

56
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,000
I told you to move aside.

57
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,180
Move aside!

58
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,100
Don't move!

59
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,460
What are you doing?

60
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,700
Playing gangster now?

61
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,180
Take everyone away.

62
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,900
- Go.
- Move.

63
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,540
- Go.
- Move!

64
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:46,940
(Chencang Detention Center)

65
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,900
Why are you here?

66
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,180
Where's Qin Hong?

67
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,020
She doesn't want to see you.

68
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,900
You shouldn't have done this.

69
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,000
Why didn't you call the police?

70
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,460
You could've at least called me.

71
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,860
You don't know the full story.

72
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,780
Huang Shuquan

73
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,260
bullied a merchant.

74
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,980
They broke his leg.

75
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,220
I lost my temper, too.

76
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,100
Lost your temper?

77
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,900
Are you a gangster?

78
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,020
If Hong hadn't called me,

79
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,620
you'd be locked up with them.

80
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,140
Hong is brave and smart

81
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,540
as ever.

82
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,540
You can never cross a woman.

83
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,660
How's Huang Shuquan?

84
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,340
His lackey wouldn't talk,

85
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,140
insisting no one told him to do it.

86
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,100
Huang Shuquan also denied it.

87
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,340
We had to let him go after a few days.

88
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,540
He's pretty sly.

89
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,540
It'll be hard to catch him next time.

90
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,380
Be careful.

91
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,020
That's my problem.

92
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,740
You should figure out

93
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,160
how to make things right with Hong.

94
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,380
It's fine.

95
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,500
It's nothing serious.

96
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,980
(Tian Cai)

97
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:28,900
Hong?

98
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:30,980
Hong?

99
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,700
Kaifu.

100
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,020
Second floor.

101
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,500
Ms. Qin.

102
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,020
Ms. Qin?

103
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,140
Hong.

104
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,300
Hong?

105
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,540
I didn't bring my keys, Hong.

106
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,740
I didn't bring my keys.

107
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,780
I passed by a cake shop just now.

108
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,620
They had cakes fresh out of the oven.

109
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,860
They said it tastes amazing,

110
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,840
so I bought you a piece.

111
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,380
Where are you going?

112
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,020
Take a look.

113
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,900
This is your stuff.

114
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,540
Wait, where am I going?

115
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,900
Don't act clueless with me.

116
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,020
Go wherever you want.

117
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,260
Let's break up.

118
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,940
What are you doing?

119
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,180
What are you doing, Zhao Kaifu?

120
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,780
I won't do this again.

121
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,180
- Don't be mad.
- I'm not mad.

122
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,520
Why would I be mad?

123
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,500
I just want to break up.

124
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,780
It's over between us.

125
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,660
Got it?

126
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,900
Is this really necessary?

127
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,140
You think it isn't?

128
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,260
When you went there,
did you even think about me?

129
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,420
What if something

130
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,260
had happened to you?

131
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,480
Did that ever cross your mind?

132
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,460
Did you even think about that?

133
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:29,900
It's not necessary?

134
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,260
I promise you.

135
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,140
I won't do that again.

136
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,060
How are you going to prove that?

137
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,260
I know you too well.

138
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,500
If the same thing happens again,

139
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,420
you'll still go.

140
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,780
That's so you, Zhao Kaifu.

141
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,300
Back in the day, I would've gone.

142
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,900
But not anymore.

143
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,540
Because I have you now.

144
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,180
You mean a lot to me.

145
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,310
When you went there,

146
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,420
didn't you ever think
about how much I mean to you?

147
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,020
Did you just forget me
when you decided to go?

148
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,140
This time, I was really scared.

149
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,340
These days in detention,

150
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,600
the more I thought about it,
the more frightened I felt.

151
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,850
I was afraid

152
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,900
that if something happened to me,

153
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,260
I'd never get to see you again.

154
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,260
Qin Hong,

155
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,780
I swear to you.

156
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,180
I will never do anything
that would make Qin Hong

157
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,500
live like a widow.

158
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,780
Let's get married.

159
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,180
Will you marry me?

160
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,780
You don't want to?

161
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,380
Of course not.

162
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,120
Kaifu.

163
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,180
How can you like someone like me?

164
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,060
Honestly,

165
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,420
I've never had hope

166
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,060
for marriage

167
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,260
or who I'd spend my life with.

168
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,260
Besides, I feel

169
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,860
like marriage

170
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,660
is far away from me.

171
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,740
Maybe

172
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,500
it's because of my parents.

173
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,340
So,

174
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,540
I never once thought

175
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,600
about marrying anyone.

176
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,140
But I met you.

177
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,420
You changed that.

178
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,940
After meeting you, I realized

179
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,140
being with you makes me feel so secure.

180
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,060
Sometimes, I even think

181
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,540
I could just spend my days

182
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,620
with you like this.

183
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,540
Sometimes,

184
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,780
I even start to imagine

185
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,420
that I can just

186
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,620
spend my whole life with you.

187
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,300
Maybe that wouldn't be so bad.

188
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,540
Do you know

189
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,020
how it feels

190
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,380
when suddenly there's hope?

191
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,740
But when you do things like this,

192
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,620
it makes me realize all at once

193
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,900
that you could suddenly die.

194
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,900
That terrifies me.

195
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,780
Do you understand?

196
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,060
I do.

197
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,900
I do.

198
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,300
I didn't expect

199
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,260
you to think about us

200
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,900
so deeply.

201
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,660
I'm really sorry.

202
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,020
I'm sorry.

203
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,860
I hope you'll give me a chance.

204
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,540
I won't let you live

205
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,740
in fear and worry.

206
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,780
Okay?

207
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,020
Marry me.

208
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,900
Who are you kneeling to?

209
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,180
Who proposes with both knees
on the ground?

210
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,660
Is this okay?

211
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,540
Marry me.

212
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,380
Please, marry me.

213
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,980
Try it on.

214
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,180
You're being way too pushy.

215
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,540
You've prepared a wedding suit for me?

216
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,020
Are you crazy?

217
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,220
Try it on.

218
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,420
It's for a formal meeting.

219
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,780
A formal meeting?

220
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,540
I've asked around recently.

221
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,260
The property developer agreed to meet

222
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,780
with the head
of our demolition committee.

223
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,020
If you're going to meet him,
you have to dress decently.

224
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,260
Right?

225
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,740
As expected of Hong.

226
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,780
What could I do without you?

227
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,260
Let's get married asap,

228
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,780
lest someone takes you away.

229
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,260
I'll think about it.

230
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,380
Oh, right.

231
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,060
What if they demolish this area?

232
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,020
So what?

233
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,060
We can go to Pingtan.

234
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,020
Where?

235
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,900
Pingtan.

236
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,420
Pingtan?

237
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,380
Didn't you always say

238
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,540
you wanted to go to Pingtan?

239
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,940
You said the winter there is warmer.

240
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,020
Then let's go and see

241
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,360
if it's really always like spring.

242
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,500
While you're there,

243
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,340
you can open another Tian Cai.

244
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,300
I'll work for you.

245
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,140
Alright.

246
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,460
- Is that okay?
- Okay.

247
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,140
Hong.

248
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,340
The talk's done.

249
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,820
I've told them all our requests.

250
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,380
Things don't look bad.

251
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,420
That's great news.

252
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,460
Hurry back.

253
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,620
I'm making dumplings for you.

254
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,600
Wait for me to get home.

255
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,800
I've got something to tell you.

256
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,500
Alright, stop talking so much.

257
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,340
Bye-bye.

258
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,660
Good afternoon, sir.

259
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,060
Is there anything you'd like to see?

260
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,400
I'd like to buy a ring.

261
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,780
Sure, please come with me.

262
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,060
Take a look at these.

263
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,100
Which one best represents
everlasting love?

264
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,060
Everlasting love...

265
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,220
How about this one?

266
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,940
This one looks good.

267
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,100
I'll have this.

268
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:47,940
Alright.

269
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,780
Hong,

270
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,740
please marry me.

271
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,860
Marry me, Hong.

272
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,700
Marry me.

273
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,300
Why are you only back now?

274
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,340
Go wash your hands.

275
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,820
(Tian Cai)

276
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,740
This was found

277
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,940
at the scene.

278
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,460
Kaifu bought it for you.

279
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,140
Yes, I'll marry him.

280
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,900
He even bought the wrong size.

281
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,140
What's going on?

282
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,620
What happened?

283
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:47,420
Can we still save him, Wang?

284
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,940
Try again, please.

285
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,660
Wang, what happened?

286
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,300
Chief Liu.

287
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,740
I don't get it.

288
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,640
That driver's name is Zhao Chen, right?

289
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,910
He hit Zhao Kaifu with his car.

290
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,980
How's that connected to me?

291
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,220
Zhao Chen and Zhao Kaifu
aren't even related.

292
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,460
Why would Zhao Chen
want to kill Zhao Kaifu?

293
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,660
Then you should ask Zhao Chen.

294
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,630
Why ask me?

295
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:11,470
How would I know?

296
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:12,460
You definitely know.

297
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,960
Zhao Chen delivers drinks
to your Rose City, right?

298
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,810
Yeah.

299
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,300
You held a grudge against Zhao Kaifu

300
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,340
because of the demolition, right?

301
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,700
Chief Liu, that's not true.

302
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,940
I'd always respected Kaifu.

303
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,520
He said he didn't want to talk about it,

304
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,600
so I let it go.

305
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,620
We've been detained once

306
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,660
for that matter.

307
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,420
What grudge can I have?

308
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,900
Plus, my guy's been taken in.

309
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,660
Why think I'm the one who killed him?

310
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,860
Doesn't that sound far-fetched?

311
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,140
Huang Shuquan,

312
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,140
still pretending here, huh?

313
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,980
Answer me.

314
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,900
You gave Zhao Chen 300,000.

315
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,900
How do you explain that?

316
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,420
I'll be straight with you.

317
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,900
Zhao Chen has confessed to everything.

318
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,660
You won't get away from this.

319
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,100
Honestly,

320
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,460
you're so perceptive.

321
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,580
Nothing ever gets past you.

322
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,140
Two months ago,

323
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,420
Zhao Chen came to me.

324
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,140
He said he had a batch of cheap liquor.

325
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,140
Normally, I buy it at 4 per bottle.

326
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,260
He told me he'd sell it
for half the price,

327
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,180
so I bought 300,000 yuan worth from him.

328
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,620
I admit it.

329
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,980
I was being greedy.

330
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,820
I should've realized sooner.

331
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,700
There had to be

332
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,300
something shady with cheap goods.

333
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,040
Wishful thinking.

334
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,960
Such wishful thinking.

335
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:48,900
Huang Shuqian.

336
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,740
Chief Liu.

337
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,710
Still acting, huh?

338
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,620
You're still acting?

339
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,660
I'm admitting my mistake.

340
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,590
Nice performance.

341
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,900
Punish me however you want.

342
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,500
Fine me as much as I deserve.

343
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,460
I'll accept it.

344
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,140
But as far as I know,

345
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,660
this is

346
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,380
beyond the CIU's jurisdiction.

347
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,500
Come in.

348
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,200
Chief Liu, it's been verified.

349
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,060
The money in Zhao Chen's account
is indeed payment for goods.

350
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,580
Why did you release him?

351
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,140
He's a murderer.

352
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,860
Calm down first.

353
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,240
Let me explain.

354
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,480
I don't want your explanation.

355
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,340
Arrest him.

356
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,700
Hong,

357
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,740
sorry for your loss.

358
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,140
Get lost.

359
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,660
Wang.

360
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,980
You told me you were sure about this.

361
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,180
Sorry. Give me more time.

362
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,700
Don't say that to me.

363
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,620
Say that to Kaifu.

364
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,660
Uncle Liu.

365
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,740
Danshun.

366
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,860
You're moving out, too?

367
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:43,980
After Kaifu's death,

368
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,900
everyone's spirits just fell apart.

369
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,140
Most folks

370
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,180
have signed the papers.

371
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,580
If I stay,

372
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,140
I'll just keep getting pushed around
by Huang Shuquan.

373
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,860
Forget it. I'm done fighting.

374
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,140
Hong.

375
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:47,040
Uncle Liu said you haven't opened
the store for half a month.

376
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,380
How about this?

377
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,900
I'll help you look after the store.

378
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,420
Go home.

379
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,460
I won't reopen this store.

380
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,660
Kaifu would want you to live well.

381
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,860
Don't mention him again.

382
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,140
It's all in the past.

383
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,140
You should go now.

384
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,340
Let's pretend we never met.

385
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:41,740
(Tian Cai)

386
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,420
Hello?

387
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,460
Shuquan.

388
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,580
Hong.

389
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,260
Please, have a seat.

390
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,920
Are you sure about this?

391
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,060
Yes.

392
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,380
You're not gonna ask
for ten million again, right?

393
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,220
Definitely not.

394
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,380
But, Shuquan,

395
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,900
the price you offer me

396
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,500
should be a bit higher than others,

397
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,500
right?

398
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,740
Listen to yourself.

399
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,380
With the friendship we've got,

400
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,620
even if you didn't say it,

401
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,700
I'd still make sure
you get the best offer.

402
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,460
With the same area,

403
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,660
someone else got 2.2 million.

404
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,380
I'll give you 2.6 million.

405
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,300
Here's 600,000.

406
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,900
Consider it a deposit.

407
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,700
Once we sign the contract,

408
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,220
I'll pay the rest in full.

409
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,660
Alright.

410
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,140
But once you agree, no backing out.

411
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,940
Do I look like someone who backs out?

412
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,660
There was just

413
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,060
a misunderstanding between us before.

414
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,380
I've been wanting to find a chance

415
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,140
to explain it to you.

416
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,180
But it seems I don't need to now.

417
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,860
You've thought it through.

418
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,500
Of course not.

419
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,860
It's such a simple matter.

420
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,700
What's there to be confused about?

421
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,660
Back then,

422
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,980
someone always came

423
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,420
to cause trouble in my store.

424
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,860
It was always Kaifu

425
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:50,980
who helped me sort things out.

426
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,980
Kaifu

427
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,180
was a good man

428
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,860
and treated me well, too.

429
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,740
So, I stuck with him.

430
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,580
But now,

431
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,620
Kaifu's gone.

432
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,820
Tell me. What should I do?

433
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,500
Hong,

434
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:14,980
from now on,

435
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,900
whatever you need,

436
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,140
just come straight to me.

437
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,740
I'm not any worse than Kaifu.

438
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,420
I can tell.

439
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,420
Now,

440
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,900
let me introduce myself.

441
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:45,900
My name is Qin Hong.

442
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,260
Okay.

443
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,740
(Tian Cai)

444
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,340
Why not go in and take a look?

445
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,100
It's worth 2.6 million.

446
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,260
Sure.

447
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,060
Last time, you kicked me out.

448
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,980
This time, I'm checking every detail.

449
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,420
You go back first.

450
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,140
Figure out

451
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,900
another price.

452
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,940
I want

453
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,900
your store

454
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,900
and you.

455
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,300
Go wait for me on the sofa.

456
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,940
Shuquan's not going
to Rose City tonight?

457
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,120
Guess where he went instead.

458
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,020
How would I know?

459
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,220
Let me give you a hint.

460
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,460
Someone he's been longing for.

461
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,500
The boss lady from Tian Cai?

462
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,500
I don't even know
if I should go see him tonight.

463
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,060
Do you really think I believe you?

464
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,940
I use drugs all the time.

465
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,700
This is nothing to me.

466
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,820
Let me go!

467
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,340
When you hit me on the head,

468
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,620
I wanted to mess with you.

469
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,900
Now, you walk right up to me.

470
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,740
Come on.

471
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,420
Let me go!

472
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,260
Danshun!

473
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,580
Leave now.

474
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,180
If anyone asks,

475
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,740
you were never here today.

476
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,380
You don't know anything.

477
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,460
Got it?

478
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,420
What about you?

479
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:38,900
I can turn myself in.

480
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,140
I'll say I did it.

481
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,180
Turn yourself in?

482
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,700
All his people know he came to see me.

483
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,900
There's no way I can get away.

484
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,180
You have to run.

485
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,180
So,

486
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,420
you kept me from coming to you.

487
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,860
You had planned to kill him all along.

488
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,580
I can't drag you into this.

489
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,740
I'm already in it, Hong.

490
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,780
Let's go together.

491
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,260
Danshun.

492
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,100
Listen to me.

493
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,900
I just killed someone.

494
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,460
I'm a murderer now.

495
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,980
This isn't something to joke about.

496
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,060
Hong.

497
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,940
You've protected me since I was a kid.

498
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,540
Now, it's my turn to protect you.

499
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:01,260
(Tian Cai)

500
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:04,420
(Police)

501
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,420
Make way, please!

502
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,380
Move aside!

503
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:12,720
Stop looking and leave.

504
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,370
Go home.

505
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,180
Chief Liu.
