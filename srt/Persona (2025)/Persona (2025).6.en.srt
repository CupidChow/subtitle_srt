Slow down.

00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,870
Morning.

10
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,580
Feeling any better?

11
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,190
Mengmeng.

12
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,390
Listen to your teacher today at school.

13
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,700
Find your seat in the classroom.

14
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,260
Mengmeng.

15
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,430
Feeling better?

16
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,870
A bit better.

17
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,590
Come into the classroom.

18
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,740
- She's at a key stage of recovery.
- Slowly.

19
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,860
Ideally, she should come
four times a week for rehab.

20
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,220
Teacher.

21
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,300
Can we start with two sessions
a week first?

22
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,710
That brings totally different results.

23
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,150
Without reinforcements,

24
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,020
she probably won't improve
even after a month.

25
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,300
The golden recovery period
is really short.

26
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,260
If you miss it and start later,

27
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,820
it'll take a lot more time and effort.

28
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,060
Can we do the sessions at home?

29
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,620
Mengmeng and I will work really hard.

30
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,820
If you really can't make it,

31
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,060
you can get an affordable machine

32
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,180
and practice at home.

33
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,470
But you have to stick with it.

34
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,550
Okay.

35
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,740
If the situation allows,

36
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,820
it's best to come here for the therapy.

37
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,860
If you can help her develop
some hobbies,

38
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,280
like painting

39
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,380
and playing an instrument,

40
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,620
it'll really help

41
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,060
with her cognitive growth.

Late again.

44
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,380
How many times this month?

45
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,620
Didn't I tell you

46
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,060
to be on time today?

47
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,500
Manager,

48
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,710
I had to drop Mengmeng off
at kindergarten.

49
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,060
Please cut me some slack.

50
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,710
I won't be late again this month.

51
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,590
Alright, you're our top seller.

52
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,380
Go on then.

53
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,340
Okay.

54
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,870
Hello.

55
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,300
Do you like how it looks?

56
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,740
Zhang Yan, bring the tableware.

57
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,500
Tidy up those tables now.

58
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,520
- Okay.
- They've left.

Mengmeng.

63
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,380
Wait a bit longer.

64
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,920
- We'll go home soon.
- Waiter.

65
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,480
Where's my beer? It's taking forever.

66
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,340
Coming.

67
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,810
Thanks for helping out the other day.

68
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,280
Are you feeling better now?

69
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,380
I just wasn't used to the place.

70
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,260
Nothing serious.

71
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,380
I don't think I've seen you before.

72
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,940
I just moved here.

73
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,380
Let me buy you dinner sometime

74
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,500
to thank you.

75
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,180
If you want to thank me,

76
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,740
teach my daughter how to paint.

77
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,740
You know I can paint?

78
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,940
I saw an art book at your place.

79
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,500
Those drawings were yours, right?

80
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,260
I'm not good enough

81
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,860
to be a teacher.

82
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,990
It's okay.

83
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,260
I just want her to develop a hobby.

84
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,740
When people have something they enjoy,

85
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,620
they're usually a lot happier.

86
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,820
Then I'll give it a try.

87
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,710
My name's Zhang Yan.

88
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,300
Just call me Danshun.

89
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,860
I'm full.

90
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:41,830
You're full?

91
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,190
There are so many carrots left.

92
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,140
The bunny won't come
and play with you tonight.

93
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,670
Mengmeng.

94
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,070
The painting teacher will be here soon.

95
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,950
Let's get ready, okay?

96
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,310
No.

97
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,830
Learning to paint is fun.

98
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,710
Mengmeng.

99
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,830
Sorry about that.

100
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:25,950
She's a bit moody today.

101
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,190
Your name is Mengmeng, right?

102
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,830
Look what I brought for you.

103
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,780
A little fish.

104
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,070
It started swimming in spring

105
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,710
and kept going until winter.

106
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,570
Then it got trapped in the ice.

107
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,470
When spring returned,

108
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,430
the ice melted away.

109
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,590
Do you like it?

110
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:25,830
Why not watch it again?

111
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,070
Sure.

112
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,230
It started swimming in spring

113
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,710
and kept going until winter.

114
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,930
Then it got trapped in the ice.

115
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,780
One more time.

116
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,230
Mengmeng, do you like it?

117
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,350
I do.

118
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,110
How about I teach you to make one?

119
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:40,950
Okay.

120
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,430
Come on.

121
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,830
Can I borrow your paintbrush?

122
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,710
Start with the duck's round little head.

123
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,900
This part is the beak.

124
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,590
Then the body.

125
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,310
Don't forget its tiny wings.

126
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,210
Mengmeng, give it a try.

127
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,310
Here, have some fruit.

128
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:47,790
Thank you.

129
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,070
I'm heading out.

130
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,470
I'll be back soon.

00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,660
(Inpatient Building)

132
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,710
The last payment is almost used up.

133
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,230
Should I ask her son to pay or you?

134
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,590
I'll handle it later.

135
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,350
What's the point

136
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,230
of raising a son?

137
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,950
He just dropped her off,

138
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,470
leaving everything to you.

139
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,990
You're not even her daughter.

140
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,350
She once saved my life.

141
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,780
That was a long time ago.

142
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,350
You've already repaid that debt.

143
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,070
Mom.

144
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,950
Take it slow.

145
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:40,710
Here.

146
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,380
Let's go.

147
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,830
Take your time.

148
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,670
No hurry.

149
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,310
Did you draw this?

150
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:50,910
It's amazing.

151
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,310
Have a seat.

152
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:54,950
Mengmeng.

153
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,540
Class is over for today.

154
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,590
Time to do some exercise.

155
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,070
I don't want to exercise.

156
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,590
I want to keep drawing.

157
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,310
Uncle Danshun can come next time.

158
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,660
No.

159
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,830
Mengmeng.

160
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,070
Listen to your mom;
it's time to exercise.

161
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,110
Good girl.

162
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,230
I'll teach you to draw something else.

163
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,070
Okay?

164
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,030
Come on.

165
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,590
Let's take the stairs.

166
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,590
Thanks.

167
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,110
I left the class fee by the door.

168
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:31,790
Take it slow.

169
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,310
Take off your shoes.

170
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,950
That's the last one.

171
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,230
Bye, Mengmeng.

172
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,710
Bye, Uncle.

173
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,590
Come on.

174
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,830
Go slower. Yeah.

175
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,860

194
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,470
Mom! Mom!

195
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,190
What's wrong?

196
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,020
What's wrong?

197
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:07,753
What's wrong?

198
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,430
What happened?

199
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:10,900
Just now,

200
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:11,950
I was cooking.

201
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,990
She was beside me
and seemed to get splashed by oil.

202
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,430
- Where is it?
- Let me look.

203
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,820
She got burned.

204
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,580
Zhang Yan, come here.

205
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,820
Take her to the hospital now.

206
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,570
No need.
I'll just put some sesame oil on it.

207
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,910
Zhang Yan, I'm not blaming you.

208
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,810
But it's really risky keeping her here.

209
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,390
There's either hot oil or open flames.

210
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,950
And cars keep passing by.

211
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,230
If something happens to the kid,

212
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,740
I can't take that responsibility.

213
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,710
Hurry up.

214
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,260
Take the kid to get checked.

215
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:40,910
It's fine.

216
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:41,950
Everyone, enjoy.

217
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:42,790
It's okay.

218
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,780
Go on, go on.

219
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,100
Danshun,

220
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,710
do you have plans tonight?

221
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,860
No.

222
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,470
I need a favor,

223
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,950
but I'm not sure.

224
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,230
What's wrong?

225
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,430
Can you give Mengmeng
another lesson tonight?

226
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,190
I won't be back until 11 pm.

227
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,340
No problem.

228
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,910
You didn't take the fee
for the last lesson.

229
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,430
Plus this time.

230
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,270
Here.

231
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,540
I'm not in a rush for money.

232
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,430
Just keep it for me.

233
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,160
Come on, cheers!

234
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,020
- Cheers!
- Drink!

235
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,860
Come on.

236
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:00,990
Right.

237
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,540
Left.

238
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,430
Right.

239
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,190
I'll join you, okay?

240
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:13,830
Someone's back.

241
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,430
Mom.

242
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,740
After class, I thought I'd help her
with some rehab exercises.

243
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,640
You know how to do that, too?

244
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,020
I looked it up online.

245
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,260
No extra charge for this part.

246
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,260
The stir-fried noodles are free, either.

247
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,950
Your accent doesn't sound local.

248
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,500
I'm from Chencang.

249
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,950
Oh, from the north.

250
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:06,990
It snows

251
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,950
in winter there, right?

252
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,230
Yes, every winter.

253
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,910
It snows almost every day.

254
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,990
I've never seen real snow before.

255
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,710
If I ever get the chance
to visit in winter,

256
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,710
I'll take Mengmeng to see the snow.

257
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,740
It gets freezing cold in my hometown.

258
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,390
A friend of mine
has been to Pingtan before.

259
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,740
She told me

260
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,950
it always feels like spring here.

261
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,100
There's no real winter.

262
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,190
Who said that?

263
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,710
Winters here are tough.

264
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,810
There's no heating at all.

265
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,830
Even the blanket feels damp
and cold when you sleep.

266
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,470
Seems no place has

267
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,390
an easy winter.

268
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,710
What brought you to Pingtan?

269
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,670
I'm here looking for someone.

270
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:56,910
Have you found them yet?

271
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,260
We haven't gotten in touch.

272
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,710
Are you from around here?

273
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,630
I'm from Shimen.

274
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:07,870
That's the outskirts of Pingtan.

275
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,950
The medical care is better in the city,

276
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,570
so it's easier for me to treat Mengmeng.

277
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,260
Was Mengmeng born with it?

278
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,180
No.

279
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,950
She had a high fever
when she was just over one.

280
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,430
It lasted for three days.

281
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,990
When she finally recovered,

282
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,230
I felt like her movements
weren't coordinated.

283
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,690
She also developed more slowly
than other kids.

284
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,810
The doctor said
it was due to a brain injury.

285
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,190
What about Mengmeng's father?

286
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,740
He was a sailor.

287
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,150
He passed away while out at sea.

288
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,870
The doctor told me

289
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,150
that Mengmeng's condition

290
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,910
can be recovered
if we keep up with rehab.

291
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,990
So, there's still hope.

292
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,140
I keep thinking

293
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,260
that if there's hope,

294
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,100
life can keep moving forward.

295
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,710
People just need something
to hold on to.

296
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,230
Once you have that, life can go on.

297
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,780
Mengmeng is what I hold on to.

298
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,190
If there's hope,

299
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,950
life can keep moving forward.

300
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,710
Hello?

301
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:47,450
Hello, Zhang Yan.

302
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,290
Li Bingmei's condition
isn't looking good.

303
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,200
Come here now.

304
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:51,950
Okay.

305
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,020
I'm on my way now.

306
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,950
Keep monitoring her.

307
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:11,790
Got it.

308
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,540
Doctor, how is she?

309
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,950
Her organs are failing.

310
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,500
She might not make it through the night.

311
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,390
You should prepare yourself.

312
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,950
Can you try something else?

313
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,910
It's already a miracle
she's made it so far.

314
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,990
If it weren't for your determination,

315
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,950
she wouldn't have lasted until now.

316
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,100
Really.

317
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,630
If this continues,

318
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,340
it's just unbearable

319
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,910
for both you and her.

320
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,670
Try to let go.

321
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,230
Hey.

322
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,950
I can't pick up Mengmeng now.

323
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,470
Can you do that for me?

324
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,340
Sure, don't worry about it.

325
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:36,710
Thanks.

326
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:37,790
No problem.

327
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:01,790
Zhang Yan.

328
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,290
You've got the nerve to show up here.

329
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,470
Stop pretending to be nice.

330
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,230
Listen. If my mom dies today,

331
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,260
I won't let this go.

332
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,740
Please, keep it down.

333
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,740
- Patients are resting.
- Stop playing the victim.

334
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,710
- Let go.
- Where's my mom's money?

335
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,260
My mom ended up like this

336
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,110
because she tricked

337
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,630
my mom out of all her savings.

338
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,340
If you don't return her money today,

339
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,870
- you can't leave.
- Lower our voices.

340
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:23,810
My voice is low enough!

341
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,190
Where's the money you took?

342
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,430
Where's my mom's money?

343
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,540
What are you trying to do?

344
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,190
What am I doing?

345
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,260
Ask her what she's doing.

346
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:32,790
Say it yourself.

347
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:34,710
You won't talk, huh?

348
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,740
I'll say it for you.

349
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,340
My mom ended up like this

350
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,500
because she scammed

351
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,710
my mom out of all her savings.

352
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,260
She's a total fraud.

353
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,190
Why still defend her?

354
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,710
She's a con artist.

355
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,150
Say something!

356
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,540
Doctor, the patient's dying!

357
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:57,670
Mom.

358
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,070
Mom! How is she?

359
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,540
Nurse, how's my mom doing?

360
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,710
Continue CPR.

361
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,780
Doctor, please save my mom!

362
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,310
Mom.

363
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,100
Try to stay calm.

364
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:07,940
Take it easy.

365
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,590
Doctor, please save my mom!

366
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,230
Take it easy.

367
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,070
Mom.

368
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,390
1 mg of adrenaline, now!

369
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,740
Go home now.

370
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:42,550
Mengmeng.

371
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,340
Time to head home.

372
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:07,910
I keep thinking

373
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,340
that if there's hope,

374
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,710
life can keep moving forward.

375
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:55,710
Mom.

376
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,950
You're up so early.

377
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,950
Mom, will Uncle Danshun

378
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:10,910
give me another class today?

379
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,230
He's got things to take care of.

380
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,500
He can't come to teach you often now.

381
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,430
Mengmeng.

382
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,470
Let me take a look.

383
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:28,510
Okay.

384
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,470
I want to take you somewhere.

385
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:46,340
Uncle Danshun.

386
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:53,990
Mengmeng.

387
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,670
I'm taking you out to have some fun.

388
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,620
Okay?

389
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,870
Sure.

390
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,870
I once made a promise with a friend

391
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,370
that we'd come here to watch the sea.

392
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,230
Unexpectedly, I came alone later.

393
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,870
I've been in Pingtan for so long.

394
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,740
Honestly, life here hasn't been hopeful.

395
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,390
If not for you and Mengmeng,

396
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,950
I'd probably still be living aimlessly.

397
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:46,470
Danshun.

398
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,470
I've done some things I'm not proud of.

399
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,230
I may not be as good as you think.

400
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,470
I'm not perfect, either.

401
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,430
But didn't you once say

402
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,190
that sometimes, to keep going,

403
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,670
you just need something to hold on to?

404
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,020
That is right here for you.

405
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,780
Look ahead.

406
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,390
I've also found something new
to hold on to.

407
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,820
(Huayan Hall)

408
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,580
(Solemn and Serene)

409
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:02,190
I think I've been to this temple before.

410
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:19,620
(Afterlife Tablet of the Departed:
Li Bingmei)

411
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,470
Let me carry her instead.

412
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,310
It's fine.

413
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,340
(Prayer ribbon; Name: Chen)

414
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,100
Thanks.

415
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:13,300
(Prayer ribbon;
Chen Yiting, Lyu Danshun)

416
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:59,660
(Chen Yiting, Lyu Danshun;
Peace and good fortune)

417
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:04,300
(Fraud suspect: Zhang Yan)

418
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:08,710
Chief Liu.

419
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,180
Eat something first.

420
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,500
You mean

421
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,270
Zhang Yan is

422
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,950
at the center of the whole thing?

423
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:31,020
Not completely sure.

424
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,180
But look at this.

425
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,540
She's the only one
connected to everyone.

426
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,790
In Ma Weicheng's account,

427
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:42,390
Zhang Yan is a con artist.

428
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,660
She's good at using
romantic relationships

429
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,310
to get what she wants.

430
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,100
When she got close to Lyu Danshun,

431
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:50,140
it was for the same reason.

432
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:57,900
(Zhang Yan)

433
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,840
(Qin Hong; Accomplice)

434
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,100
(Money)

435
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,830
What if Zhang Yan

436
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:06,430
noticed this stash of money

437
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,140
and that was why she dated Lyu Danshun?

438
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,910
If Lyu Danshun

439
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,870
found out about that,

440
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:14,500
could that be Qin Hong

441
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,350
and his motive

442
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,500
(Zhang Yan)
to kill her?

443
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:25,830
Ms. Sun.

444
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,100
(Accommodation)

445
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,580
(Police)

446
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,470
Is it them?

447
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,470
Yes.

448
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:16,910
Are they still here?

449
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,470
I think so.

450
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,310
Have two people guard the door.

451
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,580
Take us there to check.

452
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,380
(Guest Room)

453
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,270
This is the room.

454
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,950
Uncle Danshun.

455
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,090
Xiaoxiao.

456
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,220
Block him over there!

457
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,100
Stop!

458
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:10,950
Don't run!

459
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,140
Stop!

460
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,220
Xiaoxiao!

461
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:21,910
Stop!

462
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,580
Hong, go! There's no time.

463
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,830
- What about you?
- Go!

464
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:29,670
Stop right there!

465
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:31,710
Go!

466
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,470
Lyu Danshun!

467
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,390
Lyu Danshun, open the door!

468
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,850
Xiaoxiao, catch Qin Hong!

469
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,790
Got it!

470
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:54,230
Let go!

471
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:56,950
Lyu Danshun!

472
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,950
What a surprise.

473
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,990
The one I was waiting for
in Chang'an Town

474
00:38:58,990 --> 00:38:59,990
was Qin Hong.

475
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:01,310
It was Zhang Yan.

476
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,060
Stop twisting the truth.

477
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,990
What shocked me even more is

478
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:18,220
that to clear Qin Hong's name,

479
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:21,950
you killed an innocent girl

480
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,660
and made her your scapegoat.

481
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,470
Zhang Yan was never a scapegoat.

482
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,270
Why did you kill her?

483
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,060
If it was not because you wanted

484
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,660
to find a scapegoat for Qin Hong

485
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,870
and approached her,

486
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:42,470
it must be because you knew
she had deceived you.

487
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,350
When you were in Chang'an Town,

488
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,310
you used Zhang Yan's name

489
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:52,140
and transferred 200,000
to Qin Hong's mother, Wei Tinglan.

490
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,540
You said it was money
you'd saved from working.

491
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,830
But after investigating in Pingtan,

492
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,750
we found you only had one job
at a tattoo studio,

493
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,350
earning 5,500 a month.

494
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:04,150
You couldn't possibly save
200,000 in a year.

495
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,700
Where did that money come from?

496
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,630
I saved it myself.

497
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,950
Still lying, huh?

498
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:14,220
Lu Danshun,

499
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,100
you're still lying now?

500
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,580
After Huang Shuquan was killed,

501
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,310
one of his men gave us a statement.

502
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:22,140
That night, there was 600,000

503
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,470
in cash at Tian Cai.

504
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:26,060
But we never found that money.

505
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,430
Qin Hong was on the run.

506
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,470
She couldn't have carried
that money around.

507
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,660
If you were involved in the murder

508
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,620
of Huang Shuquan,

509
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,950
you must be the one keeping the cash.

510
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:41,350
Where's my stuff?

511
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,750
You lied to me,

512
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,500
saying Qin Hong never contacted you.

513
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:49,220
But actually,
you helped her bring that money

514
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,950
from Chencang to Pingtan, right?

515
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:55,450
The funds sent to Wei Tinglan
came from that money.

516
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,270
You also killed Zhang Yan

517
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,830
because of that money, right?

518
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:05,580
Where did you hide Zhang Yan's body?

519
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,220
Officer Liu,
I don't understand what you're saying.

520
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,620
Lyu Danshun.

521
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:29,020
I'm giving you a chance now.

522
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:33,140
Look at you now.

523
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,200
Was it really worth it?

524
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,540
(Chief Chen is calling)

525
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,470
Got it, Chief Chen.

526
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,110
What happened?

527
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:08,740
Ma Weicheng changed his statement.

528
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:10,990
He changed his statement?
