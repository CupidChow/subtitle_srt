You released Ma Weicheng?

00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,580
The case isn't solved yet.

9
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,460
We haven't found the body, Chief Chen.

10
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,900
Ma Weicheng insists

11
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,740
that on that night,

12
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,060
the suitcase he threw into the sea

13
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,300
didn't contain a body

14
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,860
but some old clothes he didn't want.

00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,150
Do you believe that?

18
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,470
I don't.

19
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,860
Chief Liu, tell me:

20
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,300
What charge did we use
to arrest Ma Weicheng?

21
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,060
Murder. The murder of Qin Hong.

22
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,300
But Qin Hong is still alive.

23
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,610
Yeah, I know she's alive.

24
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,060
But it might be Zhang Yan who died.

25
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,350
Where's the evidence?

26
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,860
You've got nothing concrete.

27
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,590
Is that why you released the suspect?

28
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,260
Ma Weicheng's lawyer somehow

29
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,500
got word that Qin Hong is still alive,

30
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,030
so they press us to release him.

31
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,260
The higher-ups also asked

32
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,710
about what charge

33
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,060
we've been holding him under.

34
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,940
What else could I do?

35
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,660
Chief Chen,

36
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,620
I just have one request.

37
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,620
Please send someone

38
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,460
to keep an eye on Ma Weicheng.

39
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,030
Chief Liu, don't worry.

40
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,710
I've arranged surveillance.

41
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,260
Our priority now is

42
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,180
to push Lyu Danshun harder.

43
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,180
Only he can help us

44
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,030
uncover the truth now.

45
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,260
Officer,

46
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,820
I've explained everything.

47
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,500
I didn't kill anyone.

48
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,820
If you don't believe me,

49
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,020
why keep asking the same thing?

50
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,180
She framed me

51
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,500
for fraud.

52
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,300
Have you examined the body carefully?

53
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,550
Come on.

54
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,940
Lyu Danshun is determined to hide this.

55
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,820
What can we do?

56
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,140
I'd never seen a dead person before.

57
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,500
I was really scared.

58
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,380
What are you looking for?

59
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,710
Do you know this person?

60
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,820
No.

61
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,710
Ma Weicheng...

62
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:25,990
What about her?

63
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,700
He's been locked up for so long.

64
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,800
He didn't change his statement before.

65
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,240
Why change it now?

66
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,590
Her name is Zhang Yan.

67
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,710
Are you suggesting

68
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,940
that he might've noticed something

69
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,620
during the last interrogation?

70
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,710
I get it now.

71
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,620
Get what exactly?

72
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,620
What do you mean?

73
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,590
She set me up.

74
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,710
Could it be

75
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,620
because I asked him about Zhang Yan?

76
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,820
So, he suddenly realized

77
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,490
the victim was Zhang Yan.

78
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,060
He figured out Qin Hong wasn't dead,

79
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,310
so the murder charge doesn't hold.

80
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,300
Could he tell
it was Zhang Yan who died?

81
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,660
Exactly.

82
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,260
How did he realize the one
who died was Zhang Yan?

83
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,550
Unless

84
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,180
his relationship with Zhang Yan

85
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,620
isn't what he told us it was.

86
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,820
In our past investigations,

87
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,180
we always focused on the victim.

88
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,300
Everything revolved around the motive.

89
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,060
Maybe this case is the opposite.

90
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,180
Maybe the key lies
with the killer instead.

91
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,120
Do you remember the first time we went

92
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,360
to the crime scene?

93
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,860
I found it really strange.

94
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,180
The evidence was almost so perfect

95
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,620
that it felt staged.

96
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,590
If all of this was meant

97
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,260
to frame Ma Weicheng,

98
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,740
everything would make sense.

99
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,710
You just reminded me of something.

100
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,380
When we were in Chang'an Town,

101
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,590
I saw a drawing by Zhang Yan's daughter.

102
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:32,550
Let's say

103
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,830
the one with long hair is Zhang Yan.

104
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,620
What if the short-haired one
in the dress

105
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,190
is Qin Hong?

106
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,470
From the painting,

107
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,190
they seemed really close.

108
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,830
Officer Liu, I admit it.
Hong and I used to be close.

109
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,070
But I've moved on with my life now.

110
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,960
There's nothing between us anymore.

111
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,470
Qin Hong is dead.

112
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,470
Have you figured out Kaifu's case?

113
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,830
Zhao Chen, the driver,

114
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,590
confessed that Huang Shuquan

115
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,540
had ordered him to kill Kaifu.

116
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,710
But it was too late.

117
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:12,910
Danshun,

118
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,430
I came today

119
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,830
to apologize to you.

120
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,070
Back then, you blamed me

121
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,270
for not finding out the truth
about Zhao Kaifu's death.

122
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,710
So, Qin Hong committed murder.

123
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,540
I've always remembered that.

124
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,110
So, about this case today,

125
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,710
I don't want

126
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,710
my inadequate investigation

127
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,780
to mislead everyone again,

128
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,530
getting farther from the truth.

129
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:53,790
Danshun,

130
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,070
only by telling the truth

131
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,830
can you actually help Qin Hong.

132
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,430
Of course,

133
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:11,830
I'm not here

134
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,830
to talk to you about Qin Hong today.

135
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,950
I want to talk about someone else.

136
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,190
Ma Weicheng.

137
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,710
Do you know Ma Weicheng?

138
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,550
No.

139
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,830
He's been released on bail.

140
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,220
Why?

141
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,070
Why?

142
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:55,070
Ma Weicheng was arrested
for killing Qin Hong.

143
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,950
But Qin Hong is still alive.

144
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,310
We suspect the one who died
was Zhang Yan,

145
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,540
but we never found her body.

146
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,190
And you refuse to admit

147
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,070
that she's dead.

148
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,780
So, the case doesn't hold up.

149
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,470
We had to release Ma Weicheng.

150
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,710
You can't let him go!

151
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,070
Why not?

152
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,590
He's a killer! That's why!

153
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,710
How do you know he's a killer?

154
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,470
Who did Ma Weicheng kill?

155
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,190
Say it.

156
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:45,230
Ma Weicheng killed Zhang Yan.

157
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,110
Ma Weicheng killed Zhang Yan?

158
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,710
You were her boyfriend.

159
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,830
Why didn't you call the police?

160
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,230
Not only did you keep quiet,

161
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,990
but you even let Qin Hong
take Zhang Yan's identity.

162
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,660
Do you know
what all the evidence points to?

163
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,950
Qin Hong and you conspired
to kill Zhang Yan

164
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,780
and framed the innocent Ma Weicheng!

165
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,350
Isn't that exactly what I said?

166
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,660
Because you found out Zhang Yan
was a fraud.

167
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,990
She was not a fraud.

168
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,190
Zhang Yan wasn't a fraud.

169
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,310
She's the kindest person
I've ever known!

170
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,830
I knew about her past from the start.

171
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,660
So what?

172
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,310
I have a past, too.

173
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,870
I didn't tell her from the start

174
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,000
why I came to Pingtan

175
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,590
and why I chose to stay.

176
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,210
We just followed what love led us to.

177
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,570
And that brought us together.

178
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,270
Who is it?

179
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,070
It's urgent. Let me take this call.

180
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,830
Hello?

181
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,500
It's me.

182
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,470
I'm in Pingtan.

183
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,590
Is my package still with you?

184
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,190
Is it damaged?

185
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,230
It's untouched.

186
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,950
When will you come for it?

187
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,470
When are you free?

188
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,830
I'm free anytime.

189
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,310
Then let's do it now.

190
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,190
I'll send you the address.

191
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,150
Okay.

192
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,070
What happened?

193
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,190
A friend of mine ran into some trouble.

194
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,470
I need to go check on her.

195
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,290
You can go back to sleep.

196
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:24,950
Hong?

197
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:26,890
Hong?

198
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:03,470
Danshun.

199
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:04,990
Hong.

200
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,190
Come home with me.

201
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,630
Did you bring my stuff?

202
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:27,790
Yes.

203
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,230
Here, take it.

204
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,670
I can't let you help me for nothing.

205
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,260
I didn't help you for this.

206
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,340
You're out here alone.

207
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,230
Money always makes things easier.

208
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,470
Hong.

209
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,710
What's your plan from now on?

210
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:57,940
What will you do?

211
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,190
Are you trying to go abroad?

212
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,470
I've been in Pingtan for a year.

213
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,370
I know the place well.

214
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,850
I can handle things that you can't.

215
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:05,690
Danshun,

216
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,990
I have to do some things alone.

217
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,390
Stop following me.

218
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,870
It draws too much attention.

219
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,710
For the two of us,

220
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:19,910
it's just not convenient.

221
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,100
Boss, she's here.

222
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,430
Did you bring the money?

223
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,020
Is this route safe?

224
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,950
My way is definitely safe.

225
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,740
Boss, look at the money.

226
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,190
Grab her; don't let her get away!

227
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,030
Stop running!

228
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,910
Stay right there!

229
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,030
- Don't run!
- Stop!

230
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:35,710
Don't run!

231
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,230
- Don't run!
- Stop!

232
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,190
Bring her back to me!

233
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:53,590
Hong.

234
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,550
Hop on.

235
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,710
- Stop!
- Don't run!

236
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,190
Catch her!

237
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,780
You've been following me?

238
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,540
I couldn't just leave you alone.

239
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,430
When I first left Chencang,

240
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,430
I thought I'd get here in no time.

241
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,290
I didn't expect this at all.

242
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,540
In the past year,

243
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,340
so much has happened.

244
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,570
But I've learned something important.

245
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,740
Apart from myself,

246
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,230
I shouldn't trust anyone.

247
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,990
So, don't blame me
for being cautious with you.

248
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,020
Before I met you that day,
I was thinking:

249
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,470
If Danshun betrayed me,

250
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:14,950
what would I do?

251
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,230
If that happened, it wouldn't be so bad.

252
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,470
I wouldn't have to keep running.

253
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,540
I'm just so tired.

254
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,190
Come home with me.

255
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,670
Don't joke around.

256
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,190
What home?

257
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,710
Look at you.

258
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,950
You must've started a new life.

259
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,990
Since you've got a fresh start,

260
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,190
make the most of it.

261
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,910
Don't let my mess hold you back anymore.

262
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:17,950
I've got a girlfriend now.

263
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,710
Finally, someone wants you.

264
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,100
She's got a daughter.

265
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,020
She's really kind.

266
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,790
That's nice.

267
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,710
That's why

268
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,190
I can't be a burden to you three.

269
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,780
At least

270
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,710
one of us deserves

271
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,950
to be happy.

272
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,230
If I don't say anything,
she won't find out.

273
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,630
I'll tell her you're my cousin
here for business.

274
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,780
I've thought it all through.

275
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,670
Why can't we just go our separate ways?

276
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,430
You've done so much for me.

277
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,780
I'm really grateful for that.

278
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,340
When my dad beat me nearly to death,

279
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,340
didn't you step in anyway?

280
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:34,710
That was different.

281
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:35,550
Hong.

282
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,150
If you don't want to drag me into this,

283
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,710
then come home with me.

284
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,710
I'll help you go abroad.

285
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,780
The sooner I get you out,
the better I'll feel.

286
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,190
Then I'm staying with you.

287
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,180
If you're in trouble,
I'm in trouble, too.

288
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,230
I'm Qin Hong.

289
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,710
What's your name?

290
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,150
I'm Lyu Danshun.

291
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,910
This is my cousin, Lin Chang.

292
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,190
This is my girlfriend, Zhang Yan.

293
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,180
Nice to meet you.

294
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,570
Nice to meet you, too.

295
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,710
My cousin came here for business.

296
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,710
But she ran into a fraud,

297
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,340
so she's staying with us for a few days.

298
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,430
Chang,

299
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,970
I'll change your bed sheets and cover.

300
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,230
Just leave them there;
I'll do it myself.

301
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,150
Thanks.

302
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,340
Okay.

303
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,870
This room is a bit small.

304
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,120
It used to be Mengmeng's room.

305
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,600
You'll have to make do for now.

306
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,670
I'm happy to have a place to sleep.

307
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:03,780
Sorry for the trouble.

308
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,550
No worries.

309
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,190
If I take Mengmeng's room,

310
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,190
Mengmeng

311
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,470
won't mind, will she?

312
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,470
Of course not.

313
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,390
Chang.

314
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:20,780
I heard from Danshun

315
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,430
that you came here for business.

316
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:23,910
What kind of business?

317
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,270
Clothing.

318
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,100
How nice.

319
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,910
Danshun said you're
a few years older than him.

320
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,780
So, you must be married already?

321
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,100
I am.

322
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,710
My husband

323
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,180
passed away.

324
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,840
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

325
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,670
It's all in the past now.

326
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:03,670
Chang, you're still young.

327
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,870
Have you thought
about finding someone new?

328
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,550
No.

329
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,570
I've never thought about it.

330
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,100
Nor do I want to.

331
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,230
What about you?

332
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:26,150
When did Danshun and you meet?

333
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:31,190
It's been a year and 28 days.

334
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,670
How precise.

335
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,310
That's sweet.

336
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,150
My silly cousin is always lucky.

337
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:40,150
He found a pretty
and thoughtful girlfriend.

338
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,780
I think I'm the lucky one here.

339
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,740
I have a kid.

340
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,390
He never minds that.

341
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,780
I just think if we can

342
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,190
just live our days well,

343
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,470
I'd be more than content.

344
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,550
Alright.

345
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,430
I'll head out then.

346
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,630
I won't disturb your rest.

347
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,540
Stop right there!

348
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,580
Don't run!

349
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,430
Mom.

350
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:58,100
Auntie, why are you wearing
Mom's clothes?

351
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:02,870
Yeah.

352
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,430
Your mom lent them to me.

353
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:12,870
Where did Mom and Uncle go?

354
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,430
They went to work.

355
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,910
Work?

356
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,990
What are you drawing?

357
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:23,630
I'm drawing Mom, Uncle, and myself.

358
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,230
That's really good.

359
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,230
What's this?

360
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,190
It's a ring.

361
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:38,710
Why aren't you wearing it on your hand?

362
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,950
Because it's the wrong size.

363
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,260
Auntie.

364
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:05,870
I need to go to the restroom.

365
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,470
Do you need me to help you?

366
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,020
Here.

367
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,270
Your mom is here.

368
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:27,220
- Mengmeng's mom.
- Thanks.

369
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,060
Alright.

370
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,540
Let's go, Mengmeng.

371
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,220
Let's go pick up Uncle Danshun
from work.

372
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:51,500
How about this?

373
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:52,950
I'll help you look.

374
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,150
Don't worry.

375
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:56,830
Let me check again.

376
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,540
Everyone is saying
it's the fishing ban season.

377
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,470
So, no way to go.

378
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,620
Then what to do?

379
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,350
I can't stay here forever.

380
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,570
It's not convenient like this.

381
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,230
You...

382
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,470
You're back.

383
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,620
Mengmeng is back, too.

384
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,870
Mom and I went to your workplace.

385
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:29,140
They said you didn't go to work.

386
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,660
I had something to do this afternoon.

387
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,020
A friend asked me for a favor.

388
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,100
Which toy do you want?

389
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,950
I want the bunny.

390
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,390
Chang?

391
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,180
(Name: Qin Hong)

392
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,700
(Name: Qin Hong)

393
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,500
Chang.

394
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,220
I'm finding a toy for Mengmeng.

395
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:30,380
(Wanted Notice: Qin Hong)

396
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:56,350
Where have you been
taking Mengmeng lately?

397
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,430
I couldn't reach you at all.

398
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:59,910
I was so worried.

399
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,780
(Wanted Notice: Qin Hong)

400
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:20,790
When I first met you,

401
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,140
I knew you had some money.

402
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,570
Even when things were toughest,
you never touched that money.

403
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,010
So, I figured it must be

404
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,370
really important to you.

405
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:33,830
It belongs to her, right?

406
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,990
There are things
I've never asked you about.

407
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,470
Because I felt if you wanted me to know,

408
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,540
you'd tell me yourself.

409
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,310
But you never did.

410
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,470
Hong has watched me grow up.

411
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,370
I've always seen her as my real sister.

412
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,620
Before she ran away, she told me

413
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,980
she'd come to Pingtan to go abroad,

414
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,660
asking me to bring the money here first.

415
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,580
We were supposed to meet
two months later.

416
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:18,620
Time passed, and she never showed up.

417
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,540
That's when I met you.

418
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,350
I never meant to keep it from you.

419
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,350
I just wanted you all to be safe.

420
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,820
But I'm scared
that if cops found us one day

421
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,960
and started asking questions,

422
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,430
they'd say you covered for Hong.

423
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,390
If I kept it from you,

424
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,750
you wouldn't be dragged into this.

425
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,660
But she's a murderer.

426
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,430
You told her everything.

427
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:57,450
Weren't you afraid Zhang Yan
would call the police?

428
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:03,870
I decided to understand

429
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,140
and accept

430
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:08,370
whatever choice she made.

431
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,500
From the very start, I owed her that.

432
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,020
So, that day,

433
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,430
did Zhang Yan come back with you?

434
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:38,060
Both Hong and I thought

435
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,270
she would never come back,

436
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:43,620
and it'd be our last meeting.

437
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,470
Hong felt guilty about it.

438
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,870
She decided to leave that very day.

439
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:55,140
But Zhang Yan came back.

440
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,430
And her reaction

441
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,540
was nothing like what Hong
and I imagined.

442
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,870
I'd like to talk to you.
