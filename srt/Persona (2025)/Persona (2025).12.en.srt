00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,190
Mengmeng,

3
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,630
do you know?

4
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,270
Everyone is a star in the sky.

5
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,340
Then which one are you?

6
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,110
The brightest one is me.

7
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,990
When I'm not by your side,

8
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,830
the brightest star
will keep you company.

9
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,180
What if I want to talk to you?

10
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,420
Just call out my name

11
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,550
to the brightest star.

12
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,270
If it is twinkling,

13
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,740
it means I've heard you.

14
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,830
Then you can talk to me.

15
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,830
Mom, is that you?

16
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,300
Yes.

17
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,140
Mom,

18
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,110
is it you?

19
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,670
Mom,

20
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,700
I don't want you to turn into a star,

21
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,700
but I'll be good.

22
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,020
Good girl.

23
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,580
Mengmeng,

24
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,300
promise me one thing.

25
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,580
What is it?

26
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,270
Treat Auntie Hong as your mom.

27
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,270
Why?

28
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,990
When I'm not by your side,

29
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,510
Aunt Hong will take care of you.

30
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,110
She will treat you as well as I do.

31
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,830
Can you also treat her as your mom?

32
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,990
What if I want you to promise that?

33
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,550
I hope you will grow up happily,

34
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,580
meet good people,

35
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,700
and live a long life,

36
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,140
okay?

00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,790
Danshun.

39
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,260
What's wrong?

40
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,670
I want to eat cotton candy.

41
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,470
Will you buy it for me?

42
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,420
Now?

43
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,590
Okay.

44
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,350
I'll go now.

45
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,550
Danshun.

46
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,030
The keys.

47
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,590
You'll be at home, right?

48
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,420
Go back and rest.

49
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:12,790
Here, take it.

50
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,910
You can only have one more.

51
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,230
Two cotton candies.

52
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,590
Okay, one for five yuan.

53
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,590
Does it stick to your teeth?

54
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,230
- Tasty.
- Is it sweet?

55
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,670
Try mine.

56
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,350
You can't eat anymore, okay?

57
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,190
Okay.

58
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,590
Look, you've eaten this down so small.

59
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,230
Shall we lift you?

60
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:52,870
Sure.

61
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,530
Hold my hand.

62
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,350
Let me lift you high.

63
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,790
One, two, three, fly.

64
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,060
Are you happy?

65
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,620
Did you eat it today?

66
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:07,990
Hurry up.

67
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:08,950
Okay.

68
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,910
I'm back, Zhang Yan.

69
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,110
Zhang Yan?

70
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,660
Zhang Yan.

71
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,430
Zhang Yan.

72
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,430
Danshun,

73
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,070
please forgive me.

74
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,310
I don't have the courage
to leave in front of you,

75
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,800
so I chose to leave
without saying goodbye.

76
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,070
The first time you took me
to Zhuyun Temple,

77
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,430
you bought cotton candy for each of us.

78
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,950
You treat yourself

79
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,020
and others like a child.

80
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,190
It makes me feel very special

81
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,310
and happy.

82
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,950
That was actually
the first time I tasted

83
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,310
the flavor of cotton candy.

84
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,740
I will never forget it.

85
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,780
Later, we fell in love.

86
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,900
I realized you truly have
a loving heart.

87
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,380
To this day, I still feel

88
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,900
I'm so lucky to have met you

89
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,020
and fallen in love with you.

90
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,660
A monk from Zhuyun Temple once told me

91
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,190
that people in this world

92
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,430
can't let go of many things.

93
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,380
But the journey of life

94
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,190
is about letting go little by little,

95
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,780
or the burden will be too heavy
for them to go on.

96
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,430
What you and Hong did for me

97
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,430
was help a dying person
lay down a heavy burden

98
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,530
and let go of attachment
to the mortal world,

99
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,780
so I can go on living

100
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:28,860
and loving others

101
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,780
as Mengmeng's mother.

102
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,500
I am very grateful.

103
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,500
Danshun,

104
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,020
those cotton candies are for you.

105
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,380
Your days are still long.

106
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,020
(Alprazolam Tablets)
Whether you remember me or forget me

107
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,020
doesn't matter.

108
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,430
No matter what,

109
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,950
keep going.

110
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,540
If it feels too bitter,

111
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,430
have a bite of cotton candy.

112
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,950
What day is it today?

113
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,380
Why make it so grand?

114
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,780
The 150,000 you lent me

115
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,900
is all on the card.

116
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,430
You can have it back.

117
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,900
What about the surgery?

118
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,740
I'll still have one,

119
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,540
but I won't be using your money.

120
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,780
What does this mean?

121
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,620
It doesn't mean anything.

122
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,780
Ma Weicheng,

123
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,430
let's break up.

124
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,140
I've given the money back to you.

125
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,950
We're even now.

126
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,630
You don't have to look at me like that.

127
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,430
I know that in your heart,
I'm a casual woman

128
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,380
who doesn't deserve love.

129
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,020
What are you talking about?

130
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,620
I've never said that.

131
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,660
But that's exactly what you think.

132
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,140
Do you still love me?

133
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,070
I love you.

134
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,620
I've always loved you.

135
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,660
What do you love about me?

136
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,140
Lin Chang,

137
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,900
on the first day
you appeared in this alley,

138
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,070
you were drenched all over.

139
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,780
I felt that you were very pitiful.

140
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,380
Then you said you wanted
to go to Haizi Cliff.

141
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,780
I didn't even tell you

142
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,540
that I pulled some strings.

143
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,140
Only then were we able to walk in
through that small path.

144
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,620
On that cliff, you said

145
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,600
you wanted to find someone to rely on.

146
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,140
At that moment, I made up my mind.

147
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,900
I really wanted to protect you.

148
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,740
You told me you have heart disease.

149
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,540
I tried every possible way

150
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,660
to find the best doctor to treat you.

151
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,070
I even managed to find 150,000 yuan.

152
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,900
It wasn't easy for me.

153
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,190
I think loving someone

154
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,430
means giving everything I have to them.

155
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,900
That's exactly how I treated you.

156
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,140
So, that's what you've been thinking.

157
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,780
I know

158
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,140
you've been mad lately.

159
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,310
Let's just be open about it.

160
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,740
Don't be upset.

161
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,580
Okay?

162
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,740
So touched.

163
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,310
You won't end up

164
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,020
moving yourself while acting, right?

165
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,500
I really want to ask you:

166
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,140
Every time you talk to me

167
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,190
so affectionately,

168
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,500
do you think you are

169
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,260
especially affectionate,

170
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,860
handsome,

171
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,430
and charming?

172
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,900
Any woman would be
completely captivated by you,

173
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,380
right?

174
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,430
What do you mean
by giving unconditionally?

175
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,770
Wasn't this 150,000 lent to me?

176
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,260
If it's lent, shouldn't it be repaid?

177
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,740
How is that unconditional?

178
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,900
The things you did

179
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,260
were just to make me listen to you,

180
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,460
so you can control me, right?

181
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,150
Also,

182
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,310
you love me?

183
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,950
You love me, so you hit me?

184
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,500
What kind of nonsense is that?

185
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,430
Don't lie to me

186
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,020
in the name of love, okay?

187
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,900
- Stop talking.
- Why should I?

188
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,780
You can't handle it now?

189
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,020
Do you really think women are

Listen.

192
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,430
They didn't get fooled
because of stupidity

193
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,620
but kindness.

194
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,260
But I'm not kind.

195
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,430
What can you do?

196
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,380
What else can you do
besides hitting women?

197
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,430
When you were punched by Mr. Wang,

198
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,580
you didn't even dare to fart.

199
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,150
I told you to stop talking.

200
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,260
Let me talk!

201
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,020
You're nothing outside.

202
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,020
All you do is hit women at home.

203
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,740
What right do you have
to look down on me?

204
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,070
Why can't you just listen to me?

205
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,430
Ma Weicheng,

206
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,260
you're a useless man.

207
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,190
My medicine.

00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,310
My heart disease medicine.

210
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,660
Don't pretend with me.

211
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,020
My medicine.

212

214
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,500

you

216
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,340
will be

217
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,620
a murderer.

218
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,190
Give me the medicine.

219
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,780
Where is your medicine?

220
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,860
Wait here.

221
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,620
I'll go get the medicine.

222
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,780
Just wait here.

00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,260
There is a back door
at Ma Weicheng's house.

00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,870
After he leaves,

226

choose the path we want him to take.

Here.

Too easy.

Ma Weicheng will definitely make.

236
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,390
Zhang Yan knew him too well

237
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,190
and predicted his every move,

238

never found Zhang Yan's body.

241
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,060
Is it because Ma Weicheng

242
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,060
disposed of the body at Haizi Cliff?

243

Haizi Cliff

by Zhang Yan.

Anything thrown down there

247
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,630
will sink into the sea.

You told me you ran into some trouble

278
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,430
and had to leave.

279
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,100
You never said this was about a murder.

Don't talk nonsense.

281

and sleep first, okay?

Alright?

338
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,430

Come on, let's pinky swear.

340
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:24,710
Go to sleep.

341

How did I not think of that?

342
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,150

00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,430
You must be tired, too.

382
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,270
Fortunately,

383
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,700

Mengmeng,

385
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,910
I couldn't fulfill the promise

386
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,430
I made to your mom.

387
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:02,020
I'm sorry.

388
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,430
I can't be there to watch you grow up.

389
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,270
This is the place.

(could gain a moment of peace,)

397

401
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:49,750
(a tragedy that'd burn everything.)

402
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,710

Dad,

410
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:29,780
there's not much left
in our old home in Chencang.

411
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:32,150

in the sun here.
