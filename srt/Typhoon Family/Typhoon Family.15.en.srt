00:00:42,772 --> 00:00:45,066
TYPHOON FAMILY

2
00:01:16,556 --> 00:01:17,390
Dad.

3
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:19,684
I'm back.

4
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:24,564
I offer myself.

5
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:27,650
To be exact, my position.

6
00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:30,194
You can't come crying to me later.

7
00:01:30,278 --> 00:01:33,239
3. IF THE PROMISSORY NOTE IS NOT RETURNED,

8
00:01:33,323 --> 00:01:36,826
KANG TAE-POONG SHALL RESIGN
FROM TYPHOON TRADING

9
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:48,713
HOWEVER, OTHER EMPLOYEES
OF TYPHOON TRADING

10
00:01:48,796 --> 00:01:54,010
SHALL NOT BE IMPACTED IN ANY WAY
THROUGH THE CONTENTS OF THIS CONTRACT

11
00:01:57,138 --> 00:01:58,097
Dad must have…

12
00:01:58,181 --> 00:01:59,349
KANG TAE-POONG

13
00:01:59,432 --> 00:02:00,975
protected his employees like this too.

14
00:02:01,059 --> 00:02:05,396
PYO BAK-HO

15
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:14,322
EPISODE 15
THE LAST MATCH

16
00:02:15,198 --> 00:02:16,324
Typhoon Trading!

17
00:02:16,407 --> 00:02:18,034
We can do it!

18
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:27,377
Anyway.

19
00:02:28,086 --> 00:02:30,088
Where did Pyo Bak-ho go?

20
00:02:30,171 --> 00:02:33,007
Forget about him on a good day like this.

21
00:02:33,716 --> 00:02:35,802
I can't wait to find the promissory note,

22
00:02:36,427 --> 00:02:37,971
and be done with those people.

23
00:02:38,554 --> 00:02:40,807
Why won't you use the CEO's office?

24
00:02:43,643 --> 00:02:47,522
I want to leave the place as is.
I also like it out here.

25
00:02:49,774 --> 00:02:51,234
Anyway, where's Mr. Bae?

26
00:02:51,317 --> 00:02:53,152
He went out to pick up a call.

27
00:02:53,236 --> 00:02:56,406
What? He's been on the phone
for half a day now.

28
00:02:57,699 --> 00:02:58,908
-He's back.
-Mr. Bae.

29
00:03:00,368 --> 00:03:02,036
Have some rice cake, Mr. Bae.

30
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,371
Have some.

31
00:03:04,455 --> 00:03:06,040
-Mr. Bae.
-Hey, what's wrong?

32
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:08,543
Is something going on?

33
00:03:10,837 --> 00:03:12,088
Hey, what's wrong?

34
00:03:13,464 --> 00:03:14,465
Mr. Bae.

35
00:03:18,636 --> 00:03:20,471
Mr. Bae, what's going on?

36
00:03:23,307 --> 00:03:24,642
It's my dad.

37
00:03:32,483 --> 00:03:33,860
He's going to kill himself.

38
00:03:36,612 --> 00:03:38,656
What am I going to do?

39
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:49,208
-Oh, my goodness!
-Look up there!

40
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:52,337
-My goodness!
-Oh, no!

41
00:04:01,846 --> 00:04:02,889
-What on earth?
-Mom.

42
00:04:02,972 --> 00:04:06,100
What do we do, Song-jung?
Your father climbed up there and…

43
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,853
-Oh, heavens…
-It's going to be okay, Mom.

44
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,397
-I'll go talk to him, Mom.
-Song-jung…

45
00:04:13,858 --> 00:04:15,318
-Mi-seon.
-Okay, go.

46
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:16,486
Go on up.

47
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,412
-Stay right here.
-Sure. Off you go!

48
00:04:26,496 --> 00:04:28,247
To the left! It's that way.

49
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,460
STORAGE ROOM

50
00:04:40,927 --> 00:04:43,971
-Oh, my goodness!
-Open up!

51
00:04:44,555 --> 00:04:46,808
For goodness' sake, Mr. Bae!
What's gotten into you?

52
00:04:46,891 --> 00:04:48,601
Seriously, don't do this.

53
00:04:50,103 --> 00:04:52,230
Dad… Dad!

54
00:04:52,313 --> 00:04:53,648
I'm here, Dad.

55
00:04:54,357 --> 00:04:56,192
Dad, can we please talk?

56
00:04:57,193 --> 00:04:58,152
Dad!

57
00:04:59,237 --> 00:05:01,697
It's me. Please talk to me.

58
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:02,865
Dad!

59
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:04,534
Come on. Open the door, Dad!

60
00:05:04,617 --> 00:05:06,202
That won't work.

61
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:08,996
We've cried and begged,
but your father wouldn't budge.

62
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,708
You know what he's like.
Forcing the door open won't help!

63
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:14,627
-Don't agitate him further!
-Mr. Bae.

64
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,712
Is there another way to the rooftop?

65
00:05:17,713 --> 00:05:19,090
The fire escape ladder!

66
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:22,176
-You startled me!
-It's just…

67
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,970
-I'm going to take the door down!
-No!

68
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:27,306
Jeez, Mr. Bae! Please open the darn door!

69
00:05:42,363 --> 00:05:44,157
We should be able to climb up.

70
00:05:46,284 --> 00:05:47,702
DANGER!
DON'T CLIMB UP THE LADDER

71
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:01,299
Mr. Bae.

72
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,843
I'll go in your place.

73
00:06:03,926 --> 00:06:06,179
But it looks so dangerous.

74
00:06:06,262 --> 00:06:09,557
-Call an ambulance for me if I fall.
-Still, Mr. Kang. I just don't think--

75
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,850
We're family.

76
00:06:14,812 --> 00:06:17,106
Watch your step, Mr. Kang.

77
00:06:17,857 --> 00:06:18,816
Mr. Kang.

78
00:06:49,055 --> 00:06:50,306
Who are you?

79
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:51,224
Oh, well…

80
00:06:52,725 --> 00:06:56,687
I'm Mr. Bae Song-jung's colleague.
My name is Kang Tae-poong.

81
00:06:58,022 --> 00:06:59,398
You must be his boss.

82
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,654
-This isn't right, Mr. Bae.
-Please, Mr. Bae!

83
00:07:04,737 --> 00:07:06,405
-Don't do this!
-Please…

84
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:08,241
-Think of your family!
-Please stop!

85
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,868
Excuse me, sir.

86
00:07:12,036 --> 00:07:13,496
Everyone is worried sick.

87
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:16,832
Mr. Bae!

88
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,794
-It's dangerous!
-Please, Mr. Bae…

89
00:07:23,005 --> 00:07:26,384
DEMAND NOTICE

90
00:07:34,517 --> 00:07:36,644
-Is this why--
-I only have two days.

91
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,355
Isn't it so strange?

92
00:07:41,023 --> 00:07:44,443
Who would've thought I wouldn't be able
to pay back a mere 30 million won

93
00:07:44,527 --> 00:07:47,238
when I have this huge facility?

94
00:07:48,072 --> 00:07:49,907
The IMF crisis is to blame.

95
00:08:01,794 --> 00:08:04,672
Look, my employees gave me this last night

96
00:08:06,382 --> 00:08:08,050
to help me repay the debt.

97
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:12,722
I've been withholding their wage
for three months now,

98
00:08:13,431 --> 00:08:14,640
but they chipped in

99
00:08:16,183 --> 00:08:17,393
to help me out.

100
00:08:22,398 --> 00:08:24,817
I'm sure you get it
since you run a company too.

101
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,528
This isn't right.
I'm a sorry excuse for a CEO.

102
00:08:29,322 --> 00:08:33,701
The sooner I die,
the sooner they'll be free from my debt.

103
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:38,331
I thought that was the last thing
I could do for everyone,

104
00:08:38,414 --> 00:08:39,790
so I came up here at dawn.

105
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:42,918
But I got cold feet.

106
00:08:44,587 --> 00:08:45,880
Pretty ridiculous, right?

107
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:50,217
If I had gritted my teeth and jumped,
we could've avoided this mess.

108
00:08:52,261 --> 00:08:53,679
There's only one option now.

109
00:08:55,222 --> 00:08:56,390
Will you

110
00:08:57,725 --> 00:08:59,644
help me get down there

111
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:02,396
with a push?

112
00:09:15,326 --> 00:09:16,994
When my father passed away…

113
00:09:19,455 --> 00:09:22,625
people advised me
to file for business closure…

114
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:26,629
and disclaim my inheritance

115
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:29,965
to cancel all his debt.

116
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:33,135
But I didn't follow their advice…

117
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:37,306
because it felt like…

118
00:09:40,101 --> 00:09:42,311
that would erase my father as well.

119
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:47,316
I may be a CEO…

120
00:09:50,236 --> 00:09:51,320
but before that,

121
00:09:52,905 --> 00:09:54,323
I'm my father's son.

122
00:10:01,038 --> 00:10:04,542
Whenever something good
happens to my company,

123
00:10:05,584 --> 00:10:06,711
I miss my father.

124
00:10:08,921 --> 00:10:10,256
Whenever something sad happens,

125
00:10:12,174 --> 00:10:13,676
I miss him even more.

126
00:10:14,844 --> 00:10:17,972
No, that's not the best way to put it.

127
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:22,810
Even when I'm deep in sleep
or when I'm having a meal…

128
00:10:26,522 --> 00:10:28,607
To be perfectly honest, I miss my father…

129
00:10:30,818 --> 00:10:32,111
just about every day.

130
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:56,552
I miss him every single day.

131
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:13,110
-Dad!
-Mr. Bae!

132
00:11:13,194 --> 00:11:14,612
Come on, open the darn door!

133
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:20,743
-Please don't do this!
-Mr. Bae!

134
00:11:21,368 --> 00:11:22,786
Mr. Bae!

135
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:33,088
Dad.

136
00:11:34,048 --> 00:11:35,049
Song-jung.

137
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,635
Dad…

138
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,018
Dad.

139
00:11:56,153 --> 00:11:56,987
Dad.

140
00:11:57,947 --> 00:11:58,989
To me,

141
00:12:00,157 --> 00:12:01,325
the debt is nothing…

142
00:12:04,161 --> 00:12:06,080
compared to the thought of losing you.

143
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:10,334
So please, don't think of dying.

144
00:12:18,425 --> 00:12:20,177
Good thing their boss survived.

145
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:27,226
If only our boss could've stayed
with us a little longer…

146
00:13:22,823 --> 00:13:26,619
Dad, I brought you fabulous news.

147
00:13:30,706 --> 00:13:32,875
Can you guess what this is, Dad?

148
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,545
See this?

149
00:13:37,546 --> 00:13:38,631
Come on, take a look.

150
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,593
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

151
00:13:46,513 --> 00:13:49,016
I'm going to play in the big leagues now.

152
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,101
You crazy fool.

153
00:13:52,436 --> 00:13:54,813
Pampered brats
who never had a taste of hardship

154
00:13:55,939 --> 00:13:57,191
always talk big.

155
00:13:58,025 --> 00:14:01,070
I'm not pampered.
Do I have to starve to call it hardship?

156
00:14:03,405 --> 00:14:05,324
Let's cut out the nonsense, Dad.

157
00:14:06,533 --> 00:14:09,286
I've showed you my cards.
It's time you showed me yours.

158
00:14:13,082 --> 00:14:14,625
That bastard, Tae-poong,

159
00:14:15,876 --> 00:14:17,086
came to the office.

160
00:14:17,169 --> 00:14:18,754
But he kept asking for you.

161
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:20,422
Where's the CEO?

162
00:14:20,506 --> 00:14:23,258
Hey. Where's your dad?

163
00:14:29,848 --> 00:14:31,433
All of you saw me here.

164
00:14:32,267 --> 00:14:34,269
There's something going on.

165
00:14:34,895 --> 00:14:36,230
I bet it's something huge.

166
00:14:37,356 --> 00:14:38,399
What could it be?

167
00:14:43,904 --> 00:14:44,780
Sorry, Dad.

168
00:14:45,614 --> 00:14:47,199
What's that date, Dad?

169
00:14:50,244 --> 00:14:52,121
What are you planning with that jerk?

170
00:14:57,251 --> 00:14:59,253
It wasn't in the office.
Where's that darn thing?

171
00:15:22,192 --> 00:15:23,152
LETTER OF GUARANTEE

172
00:15:23,235 --> 00:15:25,279
3. IF THE PROMISSORY NOTE IS NOT RETURNED,

173
00:15:25,362 --> 00:15:27,448
KANG TAE-POONG SHALL RESIGN
FROM TYPHOON TRADING

174
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:29,283
So this was it.

175
00:15:49,803 --> 00:15:52,014
FOCUS ASSEMBLY DEPARTMENT

176
00:15:57,311 --> 00:15:59,104
This is my father's office.

177
00:16:15,496 --> 00:16:17,122
Oh, wow.

178
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,293
You're distracting me. Stay put, will you?

179
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:26,673
What on earth?

180
00:16:26,757 --> 00:16:27,841
It's voice-activated.

181
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:38,894
Can it follow my movements?

182
00:16:41,105 --> 00:16:44,191
It follows the source of the sound.
My father had it patented.

183
00:16:46,401 --> 00:16:47,444
Oh, man.

184
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:50,364
Here.

185
00:16:50,447 --> 00:16:52,491
Hey, this is incredible.

186
00:16:53,075 --> 00:16:55,410
My father holds more than 20 patents.

187
00:16:56,161 --> 00:16:58,080
Inventing stuff is his hobby.

188
00:16:58,956 --> 00:17:01,792
Why does he keep doing things
that don't even make money?

189
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,129
That's quite a lot.

190
00:17:05,212 --> 00:17:09,800
Oh, man.
"Lenses, cameras, security alarms…"

191
00:17:12,219 --> 00:17:16,223
"Micro cooling fan for cameras."

192
00:17:16,306 --> 00:17:17,683
What's this--

193
00:17:17,766 --> 00:17:20,769
Small cameras won't function
without devices to cool them down.

194
00:17:29,945 --> 00:17:31,071
Oh, wow.

195
00:17:31,738 --> 00:17:32,948
Try it over there.

196
00:17:37,578 --> 00:17:38,537
Jeez.

197
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,831
You two are making my head whirl.

198
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,085
DABONTECH, LET'S GO!

199
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:47,671
-This factory isn't small.
-Not at all.

200
00:17:47,754 --> 00:17:49,464
-Goodness.
-It's huge.

201
00:17:51,383 --> 00:17:52,676
-Oh, my.
-Look.

202
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:54,970
Are all these products ready for sale?

203
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:58,307
You must have made all of this
because there's demand.

204
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,975
Well, that's true.

205
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:04,396
But our buyers are limited to banks,
government offices, or major corporations.

206
00:18:04,479 --> 00:18:06,899
But who has the mind to buy this now?

207
00:18:06,982 --> 00:18:09,443
Even machines
are subject to restructuring.

208
00:18:11,653 --> 00:18:12,988
What about exporting them?

209
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:15,991
Engineers like us
don't know anything about them.

210
00:18:16,074 --> 00:18:18,952
This won't bring in much
for big companies,

211
00:18:19,036 --> 00:18:20,537
so they never cared.

212
00:18:21,747 --> 00:18:23,665
Security cameras…

213
00:18:26,168 --> 00:18:27,711
I think it's promising.

214
00:18:29,546 --> 00:18:30,547
Mr. Kang.

215
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:32,966
Which country leads
the security camera market?

216
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,010
When it comes to cameras,
Japan is the best.

217
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:37,596
But our technology and quality
doesn't fall behind.

218
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,598
The price is competitive now, too.

219
00:18:40,766 --> 00:18:42,935
Yes, it will be neck and neck.

220
00:18:43,018 --> 00:18:44,519
We've got an edge for sure.

221
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,941
-That glint's back in his eyes.
-I know.

222
00:18:50,442 --> 00:18:51,818
Tell me, Mr. Kang.

223
00:18:52,611 --> 00:18:54,905
What do you say, want to give it a shot?

224
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,074
Gosh.

225
00:18:57,157 --> 00:19:00,244
Considering our finances,
I think we can make a down payment.

226
00:19:00,827 --> 00:19:03,372
Money will go to waste if we don't use it

227
00:19:03,997 --> 00:19:04,957
the right way.

228
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,458
Seriously, guys.

229
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:09,920
I'll cherish you as my siblings.

230
00:19:12,047 --> 00:19:14,841
I've always believed
that you should go big or go home.

231
00:19:16,718 --> 00:19:18,971
-Going big, it is.
-Okay.

232
00:19:19,054 --> 00:19:20,222
Dad.

233
00:19:20,305 --> 00:19:22,266
-Go big or go home!
-Go big or go home!

234
00:19:22,349 --> 00:19:23,684
-Let's go big!
-Dad.

235
00:19:23,767 --> 00:19:25,394
-Let's go big!
-Let's do this!

236
00:19:25,477 --> 00:19:26,353
All right!

237
00:19:26,436 --> 00:19:28,063
-You made a fine choice.
-Great!

238
00:19:29,064 --> 00:19:30,524
You can relax now.

239
00:19:38,532 --> 00:19:40,617
I'm home. Where's Mi-ho?

240
00:19:49,459 --> 00:19:52,212
What are you doing, Mi-ho?
Come out for some watermelon.

241
00:19:53,005 --> 00:19:54,381
No thanks, I'm good.

242
00:19:55,424 --> 00:19:57,384
Aren't you hot at all? Come on, get up.

243
00:19:57,467 --> 00:19:59,428
I said I'm good. Just leave me be.

244
00:19:59,511 --> 00:20:01,555
-What's going on?
-For goodness' sake!

245
00:20:02,723 --> 00:20:05,392
Hey, have you been crying?

246
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:08,353
Who did this to you?
Hurry and spill everything!

247
00:20:08,437 --> 00:20:09,604
Mi-seon.

248
00:20:10,605 --> 00:20:12,524
Wang Nam-mo…

249
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:16,486
Wang Nam-mo broke up with me.

250
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:19,698
-What?
-He said it was all over!

251
00:20:20,615 --> 00:20:22,159
What? That ugly guy said that?

252
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:26,788
When did he say that?
After our outing to the beach?

253
00:20:26,872 --> 00:20:29,458
This is on you
for reaching out to your ex!

254
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,793
We barely dated for a week.
He hardly counts as one!

255
00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:33,295
Stop being so silly!

256
00:20:34,338 --> 00:20:36,256
No one's interested in hearing me out.

257
00:20:37,007 --> 00:20:39,259
I'm saying it's not what it seems, okay?

258
00:20:39,343 --> 00:20:41,303
I had a plan and everything.

259
00:20:41,386 --> 00:20:44,681
That jerk made the first move,
saying that he had a crush on me.

260
00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:47,976
Then he had the audacity to dump me!

261
00:20:50,228 --> 00:20:53,190
Why are you crying?
Can't you live without him or something?

262
00:20:53,273 --> 00:20:54,358
Whatever, I don't know!

263
00:20:54,441 --> 00:20:55,942
-You foolish girl!
-That hurts!

264
00:20:56,026 --> 00:20:58,195
What was that for, Grandma?

265
00:20:58,278 --> 00:21:00,530
Serves you right for blindly trusting men!

266
00:21:00,614 --> 00:21:02,532
You'd be better off trusting a cow!

267
00:21:03,575 --> 00:21:06,661
It helps out with the fieldwork
and never grumbles over food.

268
00:21:06,745 --> 00:21:08,163
She's right.

269
00:21:08,246 --> 00:21:11,124
Nam-mo's a good-for-nothing windbag.

270
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,502
But all men are like that.

271
00:21:13,585 --> 00:21:15,003
My son's the only exception.

272
00:21:19,591 --> 00:21:21,760
I know that, okay?

273
00:21:22,427 --> 00:21:25,472
But I like him so much.

274
00:21:26,431 --> 00:21:28,141
Do you know what he said, Mi-seon?

275
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,603
He told me never to go see him again.

276
00:21:31,686 --> 00:21:34,064
He even turned his phone off!

277
00:21:34,147 --> 00:21:36,233
Where is he? Lead the way. Get dressed.

278
00:21:36,316 --> 00:21:39,027
-Get changed. Let's go see him.
-Yes, lead the way.

279
00:21:39,111 --> 00:21:41,947
We're going after the rascal
who broke her heart!

280
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,032
Taekwon!

281
00:21:44,116 --> 00:21:47,744
I could've been green belt by now.
I kept asking to sign me up, didn't I?

282
00:21:47,828 --> 00:21:49,287
-Let's go!
-Come on out.

283
00:21:49,371 --> 00:21:51,957
-Get changed and join us.
-Come on, I'm not going!

284
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,125
I said what I said.

285
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,793
Come on out and take us to him.

286
00:21:54,876 --> 00:21:58,004
For goodness' sake,
don't go see him, okay?

287
00:21:59,131 --> 00:22:00,715
I think we should, though.

288
00:22:03,093 --> 00:22:03,927
Jeez.

289
00:22:04,636 --> 00:22:07,180
MOMO'S PUB

290
00:22:09,641 --> 00:22:11,268
You're the realtor, aren't you?

291
00:22:11,351 --> 00:22:12,436
This way, please.

292
00:22:13,478 --> 00:22:15,730
You're Mr. Wang Nam-mo, correct?

293
00:22:16,356 --> 00:22:18,900
-Why didn't you answer your phone?
-Pardon?

294
00:22:18,984 --> 00:22:20,277
I'm Woo Tae-min.

295
00:22:21,695 --> 00:22:23,363
Didn't Mi-ho tell you?

296
00:22:23,447 --> 00:22:24,906
XDG ENTERTAINMENT
MANAGER WOO TAE-MIN

297
00:22:26,116 --> 00:22:29,077
She was so insistent
that I give you a shot.

298
00:22:29,161 --> 00:22:31,121
I don't get why she didn't tell you.

299
00:22:31,788 --> 00:22:35,625
I'm in charge of album production,
and Mi-ho filled me in on the backstory.

300
00:22:35,709 --> 00:22:37,752
We go way back.

301
00:22:38,461 --> 00:22:40,839
Just so you know,
we're not involved in any way.

302
00:22:43,425 --> 00:22:46,595
Can you sing for me?

303
00:22:57,314 --> 00:22:59,441
PURCHASE AGREEMENT

304
00:23:01,651 --> 00:23:03,945
We'll purchase 500 units for starters.

305
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:07,324
We're new to this market,
so we'll ramp up gradually.

306
00:23:08,158 --> 00:23:11,161
We'll wire you the down payment
specified here by tomorrow.

307
00:23:11,244 --> 00:23:14,706
That way, you can clear your debt
and keep the factory and the goods.

308
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:17,876
I wonder what we could possibly do
to repay your kindness.

309
00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:21,922
Thanks to you, I won't have
to file for bankruptcy.

310
00:23:22,005 --> 00:23:23,506
I don't know how to thank you.

311
00:23:43,276 --> 00:23:44,277
We'll get going.

312
00:23:44,361 --> 00:23:45,654
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

313
00:23:49,783 --> 00:23:52,452
-Take care.
-We'll see you later. Goodbye.

314
00:23:52,535 --> 00:23:53,536
See you.

315
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,789
Goodbye. Drive safely.

316
00:23:57,249 --> 00:23:59,668
PAYMENT APPROVAL REQUEST

317
00:23:59,751 --> 00:24:00,835
STAFF IN CHARGE: OH MI-SEON

318
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:02,545
When's the promissory note due?

319
00:24:02,629 --> 00:24:04,172
Tomorrow.

320
00:24:05,924 --> 00:24:07,842
MANAGER: GO MA-JIN

321
00:24:07,926 --> 00:24:09,761
Now, we just have to sell them.

322
00:24:12,764 --> 00:24:14,724
-Are we all set?
-Well, yes.

323
00:24:14,808 --> 00:24:15,934
All right, then.

324
00:24:16,851 --> 00:24:18,103
It's up and running now.

325
00:24:19,854 --> 00:24:21,982
-Mr. Go has approved the payment plan.
-Okay.

326
00:24:25,026 --> 00:24:28,822
Products like this
have a set pool of potential buyers.

327
00:24:28,905 --> 00:24:33,034
Yes, I suggest we sign up for a trade fair
if there's one that suits us.

328
00:24:33,118 --> 00:24:36,204
I did find a security trade fair
that will be held in Germany.

329
00:24:36,288 --> 00:24:37,372
-Oh, yeah?
-Sure.

330
00:24:37,455 --> 00:24:40,500
The International Trade Association
might have more information.

331
00:24:41,084 --> 00:24:42,711
Okay, in that case…

332
00:24:42,794 --> 00:24:45,547
Come on, Mr. Kang.
That's just too distracting.

333
00:24:46,548 --> 00:24:50,302
Didn't you say your father held
many more patents on similar inventions?

334
00:24:50,385 --> 00:24:53,471
Sure, he has plenty,
but I don't know the details.

335
00:24:53,555 --> 00:24:54,848
Why would he

336
00:24:55,724 --> 00:24:56,891
just sit on the patents

337
00:24:57,684 --> 00:24:58,893
and not put them to use?

338
00:24:58,977 --> 00:25:01,187
What can you do with patents
during the IMF?

339
00:25:01,271 --> 00:25:03,064
Small businesses are lucky
just to survive.

340
00:25:03,148 --> 00:25:06,026
Because patents are hard
to turn into something practical.

341
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:09,821
Technology alone isn't enough.
You need a marketable item to go with it.

342
00:25:09,904 --> 00:25:11,865
Only big companies launch new products.

343
00:25:11,948 --> 00:25:13,450
They have a monopoly there.

344
00:25:13,533 --> 00:25:15,535
Let them take the whole market, jeez!

345
00:25:15,618 --> 00:25:16,828
You're brilliant.

346
00:25:19,497 --> 00:25:21,499
-Who are they to barge in?
-What on earth?

347
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,337
What the heck?

348
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,507
What's going on?
We never ordered any furniture.

349
00:25:29,591 --> 00:25:31,593
Excuse me. Which company are you with?

350
00:25:31,676 --> 00:25:32,719
Who do you work for?

351
00:25:32,802 --> 00:25:34,554
-Just a minute.
-Hello.

352
00:25:36,389 --> 00:25:38,266
Greetings, everyone.

353
00:25:41,144 --> 00:25:42,520
It's nice to see you again.

354
00:25:43,355 --> 00:25:45,482
Tae-poong. You know why I'm here.

355
00:25:46,191 --> 00:25:47,859
You had a deal with my father.

356
00:25:47,942 --> 00:25:50,528
-What are you doing here?
-Where's Tae-poong's seat?

357
00:25:51,112 --> 00:25:52,322
Hold on.

358
00:25:52,405 --> 00:25:55,075
Who are these people?
And what's this furniture?

359
00:25:55,158 --> 00:25:56,534
Pack up, everyone.

360
00:25:56,618 --> 00:25:58,244
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

361
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:04,084
Hang on. What are you doing?

362
00:26:05,085 --> 00:26:07,962
-You can't just barge in like this.
-Move out of the way.

363
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,132
-Move out of the way.
-You can't do this.

364
00:26:14,928 --> 00:26:16,971
You can't come in like this!

365
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,188
This isn't right!

366
00:26:26,231 --> 00:26:27,899
You have no right to do this!

367
00:26:29,192 --> 00:26:31,403
You can't come crying to me later.

368
00:26:31,486 --> 00:26:32,904
I offer myself.

369
00:26:32,987 --> 00:26:34,614
To be exact, my position.

370
00:26:36,116 --> 00:26:39,786
You'll give up everything
and leave the business alone?

371
00:26:41,037 --> 00:26:44,124
The position of CEO
at Typhoon Trading, you say?

372
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:46,167
Is it a balanced deal now?

373
00:26:47,585 --> 00:26:49,212
Get the hell out!

374
00:26:52,173 --> 00:26:54,509
Mr. Ha, what's taking
my attorney this long?

375
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,511
Oh, Mr. Choi is just on his way.

376
00:26:56,594 --> 00:26:59,347
Get to work, everyone.
We're moving into our new office!

377
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:01,141
-Remove junk like this!
-How dare you?

378
00:27:01,975 --> 00:27:03,184
I work here!

379
00:27:04,144 --> 00:27:05,228
Jeez.

380
00:27:07,397 --> 00:27:09,649
Jeez, you crass punk.

381
00:27:10,442 --> 00:27:13,278
Dude, let's take a civilized approach.

382
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:16,614
Hey.

383
00:27:17,574 --> 00:27:19,451
What a fine office, huh?

384
00:27:20,201 --> 00:27:21,411
Would you look at that?

385
00:27:29,752 --> 00:27:32,130
What was your father like?

386
00:27:33,465 --> 00:27:35,633
I just suddenly got curious.

387
00:27:35,717 --> 00:27:37,135
What set him so apart?

388
00:27:45,018 --> 00:27:47,145
You love your old man to death, don't you?

389
00:27:47,228 --> 00:27:49,772
Cut out the crap
and get to the point, punk.

390
00:27:49,856 --> 00:27:51,191
I was getting there, punk.

391
00:27:53,026 --> 00:27:54,819
Take a look here.

392
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,113
You wrote it yourself.

393
00:27:57,864 --> 00:27:59,407
LETTER OF GUARANTEE

394
00:27:59,491 --> 00:28:00,825
PYO BAK-HO
KANG TAE-POONG

395
00:28:02,243 --> 00:28:05,121
But I didn't miss the meeting.
Your father didn't show up.

396
00:28:05,205 --> 00:28:06,080
You saw it yourself.

397
00:28:06,164 --> 00:28:08,875
You got it wrong.
Let me tell you the cold, hard fact.

398
00:28:09,626 --> 00:28:11,628
You didn't present the promissory note.

399
00:28:11,711 --> 00:28:14,464
-You only filched my surgical gloves.
-Are you for real?

400
00:28:15,256 --> 00:28:17,759
Your family borrowed from mine
and never repaid us.

401
00:28:18,384 --> 00:28:19,219
Do you have proof?

402
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,263
Well, I have mine.

403
00:28:23,056 --> 00:28:23,890
Proof?

404
00:28:25,934 --> 00:28:27,018
Proof?!

405
00:28:27,894 --> 00:28:31,022
Have you forgotten how you lot ruined
someone for that scrap of paper?

406
00:28:32,941 --> 00:28:34,025
The green juice lady?

407
00:28:37,445 --> 00:28:40,073
I'm going to go get rid of those bastards.

408
00:28:41,866 --> 00:28:45,078
If you think about it,
you're a selfish jerk.

409
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,456
If you got lost without a fuss,

410
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:51,751
everyone outside
could at least keep their jobs.

411
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:54,462
If you keep being stubborn,

412
00:28:55,713 --> 00:28:57,382
what do you think will happen?

413
00:28:58,424 --> 00:29:00,468
"Shall not be impacted in any way."

414
00:29:00,552 --> 00:29:04,472
Screw that. I'll kick everyone
out on the street.

415
00:29:04,556 --> 00:29:05,515
Hey.

416
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,268
It's your choice.

417
00:29:21,072 --> 00:29:24,742
So, you'll be satisfied once I'm gone?

418
00:29:26,327 --> 00:29:27,829
Don't make me waste my breath.

419
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:29,581
Mr. Choi!

420
00:29:30,331 --> 00:29:31,291
Come in.

421
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:34,294
It's just a standard resignation letter.

422
00:29:34,377 --> 00:29:35,795
Please sign it.

423
00:29:38,923 --> 00:29:40,550
When is my last working time?

424
00:29:40,633 --> 00:29:42,385
Right this moment.

425
00:29:42,969 --> 00:29:44,387
It's 4:57 p.m.

426
00:29:51,686 --> 00:29:52,854
Let's make it 5:00 p.m.

427
00:29:55,648 --> 00:29:57,108
That'd be 17:00, correct?

428
00:29:58,067 --> 00:29:59,736
Look at you, minding the details.

429
00:29:59,819 --> 00:30:03,406
FINAL WORKING DAY AND TIME:
AT 17:00 ON JUNE 30, 1998

430
00:30:09,579 --> 00:30:11,748
CEO: KANG TAE-POONG
COMPANY: TYPHOON TRADING

431
00:30:11,831 --> 00:30:13,499
We need your company's seal.

432
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,781
Stop staring and get the hell out.

433
00:30:44,864 --> 00:30:47,241
Not a speck of dust here belongs to you.

434
00:30:47,325 --> 00:30:48,284
I know that.

435
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,829
You'd better keep your word.

436
00:30:53,498 --> 00:30:55,333
Don't mess with anything here.

437
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:57,543
Leave everyone alone
and uphold their contracts.

438
00:30:58,544 --> 00:31:00,380
Don't you dare make a single change.

439
00:31:01,381 --> 00:31:02,340
Got that?

440
00:31:02,966 --> 00:31:04,258
I'm a CEO too.

441
00:31:05,093 --> 00:31:08,054
The CEO of Typhoon Trading.

442
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:13,226
Why, you little bastard!

443
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:14,894
Get me the sign-off binder!

444
00:31:17,522 --> 00:31:19,107
-What are you doing?
-Stop him!

445
00:31:42,171 --> 00:31:44,799
WE SEEK YOUR APPROVAL ON THIS PAYMENT
JUNE 30, 1998

446
00:31:47,343 --> 00:31:48,219
No!

447
00:31:49,929 --> 00:31:50,805
Hey.

448
00:31:50,888 --> 00:31:52,640
I stamped the seal before 5:00 p.m.

449
00:31:53,808 --> 00:31:55,018
Out of my way, darn it.

450
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,283
Ms. Oh.

451
00:32:12,618 --> 00:32:14,120
Thank you for your hard work.

452
00:32:15,329 --> 00:32:16,330
What?

453
00:32:19,584 --> 00:32:20,585
-Mr. Kang.
-Mr. Kang.

454
00:32:20,668 --> 00:32:23,004
Hey, what's happening? What's going on?

455
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:36,684
-Mr. Kang.
-Tell us what's up.

456
00:32:36,768 --> 00:32:38,144
No, I'm not letting you go.

457
00:32:39,103 --> 00:32:41,481
Get back and take your seat
in the CEO's office.

458
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:44,108
You're the CEO here!

459
00:32:44,192 --> 00:32:45,777
The CEO of Typhoon Trading!

460
00:32:51,407 --> 00:32:53,409
-I'm sorry.
-For what?

461
00:32:53,493 --> 00:32:55,286
Just why…

462
00:32:55,828 --> 00:32:57,288
Why are you making that face?

463
00:32:57,872 --> 00:33:00,124
It's all good. Just get inside already.

464
00:33:03,586 --> 00:33:04,796
I'm sorry, I can't.

465
00:33:14,138 --> 00:33:16,140
Please don't go.

466
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,981
Please.

467
00:33:36,786 --> 00:33:39,288
Today is going to be…

468
00:33:43,126 --> 00:33:44,961
the last day of work for me.

469
00:33:46,003 --> 00:33:47,004
Wait.

470
00:33:49,465 --> 00:33:50,550
Please stay on

471
00:33:51,592 --> 00:33:52,927
until the very end…

472
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,849
and protect the company.

473
00:33:59,851 --> 00:34:00,768
But…

474
00:34:07,358 --> 00:34:08,860
I'll leave it in your hands.

475
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:19,537
-Wait.
-No, Mr. Kang!

476
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,165
-Tae-poong!
-Let me go talk to him.

477
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:26,002
Wait. Hold on, Mr. Kang.

478
00:34:26,085 --> 00:34:27,086
Just a second.

479
00:34:28,588 --> 00:34:30,798
Why are you just taking off?

480
00:34:30,882 --> 00:34:31,841
Ms. Oh.

481
00:34:32,717 --> 00:34:34,135
Please see our deal through.

482
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:36,470
Get back there. Everyone's waiting.

483
00:34:36,554 --> 00:34:39,432
No, I won't.
That's not the issue right now.

484
00:34:54,947 --> 00:34:56,240
Please don't go.

485
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:00,119
That was all I could do
as the CEO of our company.

486
00:35:00,953 --> 00:35:02,955
Stay and talk to me for one moment.

487
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:04,874
That's all I ask. Please.

488
00:35:04,957 --> 00:35:06,751
Please…

489
00:35:07,418 --> 00:35:08,586
I'd better get going.

490
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,382
Oh, no.

491
00:35:26,562 --> 00:35:27,521
What do I…

492
00:35:31,984 --> 00:35:35,196
How will the family
go on without their breadwinner?

493
00:35:36,864 --> 00:35:39,867
He's had a fine life
as the little prince of Gangnam.

494
00:35:41,494 --> 00:35:42,703
Well…

495
00:35:43,913 --> 00:35:46,123
I want to learn how to do my job.

496
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,545
You're the only one I can ask for help.

497
00:35:52,171 --> 00:35:53,089
Please help me.

498
00:35:53,172 --> 00:35:55,591
Hello, I'm Kang Tae-poong
from Typhoon Trading.

499
00:35:56,217 --> 00:35:57,468
Is it working?

500
00:35:57,551 --> 00:35:58,803
-Tae-poong?
-Yes?

501
00:35:58,886 --> 00:36:01,430
-Have you called Pusan?
-I'm doing it now.

502
00:36:07,103 --> 00:36:09,021
Are you okay, Mr. Go?

503
00:36:10,147 --> 00:36:12,984
"Burned it all… down to pure white."

504
00:36:13,067 --> 00:36:14,652
You're the CEO now.

505
00:36:15,361 --> 00:36:16,570
But I have no employees…

506
00:36:18,489 --> 00:36:19,657
or any money…

507
00:36:22,285 --> 00:36:23,995
or any things to sell.

508
00:36:24,537 --> 00:36:26,330
But what I'm trying to say is,

509
00:36:26,414 --> 00:36:27,540
Ms. Oh Mi-seon.

510
00:36:30,626 --> 00:36:31,877
Will you come and work…

511
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,715
for Typhoon Trading…

512
00:36:37,758 --> 00:36:39,343
as a trader?

513
00:36:49,854 --> 00:36:53,899
Shoe Park's Safety Shoes.

514
00:37:00,323 --> 00:37:02,950
I smell, don't I?

515
00:37:06,495 --> 00:37:07,913
Play the CD.

516
00:37:07,997 --> 00:37:09,832
-Our Prophet is--
-Mr. Koo!

517
00:37:11,334 --> 00:37:13,169
Please help us out.

518
00:37:13,252 --> 00:37:14,962
Please help Typhoon Trading.

519
00:37:20,217 --> 00:37:21,510
Mi-seon.

520
00:37:26,682 --> 00:37:28,059
-What did you say? Ouch!
-Wait.

521
00:37:28,142 --> 00:37:30,895
-Are you okay? What happened?
-Wait. Darn it.

522
00:37:30,978 --> 00:37:33,814
Are you okay… Is the car okay?

523
00:37:35,608 --> 00:37:37,818
Give up what? Your position as the CEO?

524
00:37:37,902 --> 00:37:39,862
What are you talking about?

525
00:37:39,945 --> 00:37:43,616
Well, I couldn't sit around
and let the business go bankrupt.

526
00:37:44,533 --> 00:37:45,826
I can't help it.

527
00:37:46,494 --> 00:37:47,370
This is who I am.

528
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,166
That was all I could do
as the CEO of our company.

529
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:54,877
The one you really like?

530
00:37:56,379 --> 00:37:57,588
The one I love.

531
00:38:40,005 --> 00:38:41,382
Where do I go now?

532
00:38:48,431 --> 00:38:51,642
I am rooting for your dream.

533
00:38:51,725 --> 00:38:52,852
Dad…

534
00:38:52,935 --> 00:38:53,853
You are always

535
00:38:53,936 --> 00:38:56,147
my most beloved person.

536
00:38:57,481 --> 00:38:58,691
Remember.

537
00:38:59,316 --> 00:39:01,610
People are more important than results.

538
00:39:02,611 --> 00:39:04,738
We are more fragrant than flowers

539
00:39:05,531 --> 00:39:07,283
and more valuable than money.

540
00:39:08,826 --> 00:39:10,161
This is my wish.

541
00:39:30,598 --> 00:39:31,891
Okay, first things first.

542
00:39:32,683 --> 00:39:36,061
Even on his way out,
the guy stamped the seal

543
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:39,190
and signed our payment request.

544
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,444
Mr. Kang did so much for me.
I feel so terrible.

545
00:39:44,069 --> 00:39:46,322
That's the man Mr. Kang is.

546
00:39:46,405 --> 00:39:47,323
You're right.

547
00:39:49,158 --> 00:39:50,326
As for us,

548
00:39:52,244 --> 00:39:53,829
we'll protect the company at all costs.

549
00:39:53,913 --> 00:39:55,206
I'm so touched.

550
00:39:57,958 --> 00:39:58,876
Let's go.

551
00:39:59,502 --> 00:40:00,669
Move the sofa inside.

552
00:40:00,753 --> 00:40:02,129
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

553
00:40:20,981 --> 00:40:21,815
Hey, Mi-ho.

554
00:40:25,653 --> 00:40:27,488
Take this. I don't need it anyway.

555
00:40:28,989 --> 00:40:31,534
XDG ENTERTAINMENT
MANAGER WOO TAE-MIN

556
00:40:32,576 --> 00:40:33,410
Why not?

557
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:37,164
This is a solid company,
and he's a hotshot over there.

558
00:40:37,248 --> 00:40:41,001
Hey, do you take me for a pathetic loser
who'd gladly accept help from your ex?

559
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,755
Do you think I'm an idiot
because I keep on smiling?

560
00:40:44,838 --> 00:40:46,465
You got it all wrong.

561
00:40:46,549 --> 00:40:48,551
I only wanted to help you
realize your dream.

562
00:40:48,634 --> 00:40:50,177
My dream

563
00:40:51,011 --> 00:40:52,930
is to make you happy.

564
00:40:54,056 --> 00:40:55,224
That's all I wanted.

565
00:40:57,017 --> 00:40:57,851
I'm off.

566
00:41:00,104 --> 00:41:00,938
Hey.

567
00:41:01,605 --> 00:41:02,606
Hey, Wang Nam-mo!

568
00:41:08,112 --> 00:41:10,155
Do you honestly think you can be happy

569
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:14,535
when you are begrudgingly slogging away
after giving up your dream?

570
00:41:16,829 --> 00:41:19,290
Aren't you the one
who thinks I'm an idiot?

571
00:41:19,373 --> 00:41:20,958
I walk on eggshells around you too!

572
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:22,751
When did I ever make you do that?

573
00:41:22,835 --> 00:41:25,462
You always play the guitar
and sing at the pub.

574
00:41:25,546 --> 00:41:28,591
I know that's your real passion.
Don't use me as your excuse!

575
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,260
That's a huge turnoff.

576
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:36,640
I've had enough. Let's end it for real.

577
00:41:38,392 --> 00:41:40,227
I dumped you, got it? Don't call me.

578
00:42:25,731 --> 00:42:27,024
Tae-poong.

579
00:42:36,784 --> 00:42:39,828
Why didn't you answer your phone?
You had me worried.

580
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,457
Have you had dinner?

581
00:42:45,084 --> 00:42:46,001
I'm sorry.

582
00:42:50,756 --> 00:42:53,342
What were you doing out here?
What was on your mind?

583
00:42:54,885 --> 00:42:55,719
Well…

584
00:42:57,513 --> 00:42:58,681
I couldn't come up with

585
00:43:00,516 --> 00:43:01,809
what I should do

586
00:43:03,102 --> 00:43:04,520
or where I should go.

587
00:43:05,354 --> 00:43:06,313
That's all.

588
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:12,569
It's really tricky.

589
00:43:12,653 --> 00:43:15,030
You're officially unemployed, Tae-poong.

590
00:43:17,074 --> 00:43:18,742
You're right.

591
00:43:27,501 --> 00:43:29,878
This time, you really have no employees

592
00:43:29,962 --> 00:43:32,798
or any money or any things to sell.

593
00:43:34,299 --> 00:43:35,175
And now,

594
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,302
no company.

595
00:43:40,097 --> 00:43:42,266
Still, hear me out, Tae-poong.

596
00:43:45,853 --> 00:43:46,937
Even if

597
00:43:48,105 --> 00:43:49,606
things look very bleak…

598
00:43:50,524 --> 00:43:52,151
we will always

599
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:55,320
be waiting for your return.

600
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,118
So would you…

601
00:44:03,537 --> 00:44:06,206
continue to be the CEO of Typhoon Trading?

602
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:18,802
TYPHOON TRADING
CEO KANG TAE-POONG

603
00:44:32,441 --> 00:44:33,484
I would gladly do so

604
00:44:35,694 --> 00:44:37,279
if I ever get that honor again.

605
00:45:39,758 --> 00:45:41,677
Wait for me, Dad.

606
00:45:43,637 --> 00:45:45,347
I won't ever give up.

607
00:46:00,153 --> 00:46:02,364
CEO PYO HYUN-JUN

608
00:46:02,447 --> 00:46:04,366
Could I get approval
to take out the bankbook?

609
00:46:05,826 --> 00:46:07,536
For Dabontech?

610
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:11,164
It's the last day for bill repayment,
so let's move quickly.

611
00:46:11,248 --> 00:46:14,710
Okay, give me a moment.

612
00:46:19,339 --> 00:46:23,343
BANKBOOK RELEASE REQUEST

613
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,013
What are you doing?

614
00:46:26,096 --> 00:46:29,349
I'm drawing up the form
for the bankbook release.

615
00:46:29,433 --> 00:46:30,267
What?

616
00:46:30,851 --> 00:46:32,102
You need approval first.

617
00:46:32,811 --> 00:46:35,105
Why are you making a new form?

618
00:46:35,188 --> 00:46:37,441
I told you we were in a hurry,

619
00:46:37,524 --> 00:46:39,568
and that's how you go about it.

620
00:46:39,651 --> 00:46:41,903
STAFF IN CHARGE, MANAGER,
GENERAL MANAGER, DIRECTOR, CEO

621
00:46:50,287 --> 00:46:51,955
-All set.
-You done?

622
00:46:52,039 --> 00:46:53,373
-I'm done.
-Okay.

623
00:46:58,754 --> 00:47:01,673
We need five signatures now?
They're doing this on purpose.

624
00:47:02,341 --> 00:47:03,717
I'll go get his signature.

625
00:47:14,936 --> 00:47:16,855
BUSINESS LICENSE

626
00:47:16,938 --> 00:47:18,523
TYPHOON TRADING
PYO HYUN-JUN

627
00:47:18,607 --> 00:47:19,566
Hey, Freckles.

628
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:21,693
What do you think? Is it hanging straight?

629
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:25,739
I need your approval
to take out our bankbook.

630
00:47:27,282 --> 00:47:28,283
Really?

631
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:36,833
All right, then.

632
00:47:40,379 --> 00:47:44,299
Why don't you go get me
a refreshing chilled coffee?

633
00:47:46,343 --> 00:47:48,136
You look like you're ready
to throw a punch.

634
00:47:48,637 --> 00:47:50,347
Did I ever say I wouldn't sign it?

635
00:47:52,516 --> 00:47:56,687
Let's take it easy
and relax a little, okay?

636
00:47:57,771 --> 00:48:00,982
Go get me that coffee already
if you want the bankbook.

637
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:19,459
Here. Hope it helps with your repayment.

638
00:48:26,967 --> 00:48:30,804
BUHO MUTUAL SAVINGS BANK

639
00:48:57,956 --> 00:49:00,083
Hello? Did Mr. Bae enter the bank?

640
00:49:02,043 --> 00:49:04,796
-Yes, just now.
-All right.

641
00:49:06,214 --> 00:49:07,758
I'll return to the office now.

642
00:49:07,841 --> 00:49:08,800
Okay.

643
00:49:10,594 --> 00:49:11,845
He's reached the bank.

644
00:49:16,224 --> 00:49:18,059
-Let's go!
-All right!

645
00:49:22,272 --> 00:49:23,648
Did it go well?

646
00:49:23,732 --> 00:49:26,276
It did. It's all sorted out.

647
00:49:32,824 --> 00:49:35,160
MR. BAE OF DABON

648
00:49:36,495 --> 00:49:38,497
Mr. Kang, we've got a problem.

649
00:49:39,664 --> 00:49:42,542
The bank closed early,
and I couldn't make the payment.

650
00:49:42,626 --> 00:49:44,753
What do I do now?

651
00:49:56,139 --> 00:49:59,893
APPLICATION FOR DESIGNATION
OF BUHO BANK AS PRINCIPAL BANK

652
00:50:03,146 --> 00:50:05,398
APPLIED BY: MARK CHOI

653
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,071
Dominion Rex Group could've partnered
with any other commercial banks.

654
00:50:11,655 --> 00:50:15,742
And yet, you chose our mutual savings bank
as your principal bank.

655
00:50:16,868 --> 00:50:17,994
It's an honor.

656
00:50:18,078 --> 00:50:20,664
Foreigners tend to be
more well-informed in finance.

657
00:50:20,747 --> 00:50:22,582
-You know how they are.
-Of course.

658
00:50:22,666 --> 00:50:25,502
I hope we can attract
more foreign customers.

659
00:50:25,585 --> 00:50:27,587
By the way, Mr. Kim…

660
00:50:28,505 --> 00:50:31,383
Remember Dabontech,
the company I asked you about earlier?

661
00:50:32,133 --> 00:50:34,511
How are things going for them?

662
00:50:34,594 --> 00:50:36,930
Their promissory note is due today.

663
00:50:38,557 --> 00:50:40,433
Unfortunately,

664
00:50:40,517 --> 00:50:45,647
the internal affairs of our branch
forced us to close a bit earlier today.

665
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:47,566
What a pity.

666
00:50:48,733 --> 00:50:50,402
They're in for big trouble.

667
00:50:55,782 --> 00:50:56,700
Mr. Bae.

668
00:50:57,784 --> 00:50:58,660
What do I do?

669
00:50:58,743 --> 00:51:00,662
-They won't take the money.
-What?

670
00:51:01,997 --> 00:51:03,498
You couldn't make the payment?

671
00:51:03,582 --> 00:51:09,754
The official business hours
of this bank are until 4:30 p.m.

672
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:13,717
They apparently closed an hour early.

673
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,802
That means

674
00:51:16,469 --> 00:51:17,846
it's all over.

675
00:51:17,929 --> 00:51:19,055
So they're closed?

676
00:51:21,349 --> 00:51:22,267
They

677
00:51:23,393 --> 00:51:25,103
declared my company bankrupt.

678
00:51:26,396 --> 00:51:27,480
How could this happen?

679
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:30,483
-How heartless.
-Mr. Bae.

680
00:51:30,567 --> 00:51:33,194
Stay put and don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

681
00:51:33,278 --> 00:51:34,571
Stay right here.

682
00:51:38,116 --> 00:51:39,659
-We're closed for the day.
-Oh…

683
00:51:40,285 --> 00:51:41,369
I won't take long.

684
00:51:41,453 --> 00:51:42,871
-I only need a minute.
-I'm sorry.

685
00:51:42,954 --> 00:51:44,539
I'm only following orders.

686
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:06,227
Let's head back, sir.

687
00:52:06,311 --> 00:52:08,730
Excuse me.
Are you from Buho Mutual Savings Bank?

688
00:52:08,813 --> 00:52:10,231
Yes, we are.

689
00:52:10,315 --> 00:52:11,942
Dabontech was declared bankrupt

690
00:52:12,025 --> 00:52:14,235
because they couldn't
honor their promissory note today.

691
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:15,654
It's still during business hours.

692
00:52:15,737 --> 00:52:18,281
If you let us in,
we can make the payment right away.

693
00:52:18,865 --> 00:52:20,742
We're closed for the day.

694
00:52:20,825 --> 00:52:22,535
-Excuse us.
-Wait.

695
00:52:24,245 --> 00:52:26,623
One company's fate hangs in the balance.

696
00:52:27,499 --> 00:52:30,919
If a factory worth hundreds of millions
of won is lost over just 30 million,

697
00:52:31,002 --> 00:52:33,922
all its employees and their families
will end up suffering.

698
00:52:36,633 --> 00:52:38,176
Please help us just this once.

699
00:52:38,802 --> 00:52:40,261
I humbly ask for your help.

700
00:52:40,345 --> 00:52:43,014
Don't let them bother you, Mr. Kim.
Let's go inside.

701
00:52:44,265 --> 00:52:48,269
Businesses with improper management
dragged the country into the IMF crisis.

702
00:52:48,353 --> 00:52:51,231
You shouldn't be running a factory
worth hundreds of millions of won

703
00:52:51,314 --> 00:52:52,899
when you don't have 30 million.

704
00:52:52,983 --> 00:52:55,527
You brought on the economic bubble,
crippled our society,

705
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:57,070
and ruined our country.

706
00:52:57,654 --> 00:52:59,781
-You should be ashamed.
-After you, sir.

707
00:53:00,407 --> 00:53:01,783
You're talking about shame?

708
00:53:01,866 --> 00:53:02,742
Shame?

709
00:53:03,284 --> 00:53:04,744
Listen, mister!

710
00:53:05,328 --> 00:53:07,497
Our society has indeed been crippled,

711
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:10,333
but that's not because
of the hard-working people.

712
00:53:10,417 --> 00:53:14,045
It's because of opportunistic crooks
who prey upon them for easy money!

713
00:53:15,547 --> 00:53:17,799
For your information,
the country is still standing tall.

714
00:53:27,892 --> 00:53:32,147
-What do you think you're doing?!
-Stick to your business hours first!

715
00:53:37,152 --> 00:53:38,236
Listen.

716
00:53:38,903 --> 00:53:40,155
Things sure look fishy.

717
00:53:40,822 --> 00:53:43,992
The factory site belongs
to the company as well, right?

718
00:53:44,075 --> 00:53:46,036
That alone is a huge sum.

719
00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:49,456
And yet, they proceeded
to declare bankruptcy right away.

720
00:53:49,539 --> 00:53:50,874
I don't get it either.

721
00:53:50,957 --> 00:53:53,460
We have the machines
and countless products inside.

722
00:53:53,543 --> 00:53:54,669
That does seem fishy,

723
00:53:55,462 --> 00:53:58,506
but what I find odd
is that I ran into Hyun-jun there.

724
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:01,926
Why would they harass
a small company like my father's?

725
00:54:02,969 --> 00:54:03,928
Don't cry.

726
00:54:07,182 --> 00:54:08,933
Where's Mr. Koo, by the way?

727
00:54:09,017 --> 00:54:11,603
-Mr. Kang! Ms. Oh!
-Hello, Mr. Koo.

728
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:17,275
I'm sorry to keep you all waiting.

729
00:54:17,817 --> 00:54:20,153
Goodness, what's with the getup?

730
00:54:20,236 --> 00:54:24,032
They reassigned this guy
to Pyo Merchant Marine's security team.

731
00:54:24,115 --> 00:54:25,867
-What?
-What a load of jerks.

732
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:27,869
His uniform doesn't even fit him.

733
00:54:27,952 --> 00:54:29,746
Are those capri pants or what?

734
00:54:29,829 --> 00:54:33,541
He's not the most affluent-looking guy,
and they made him look shabbier.

735
00:54:33,625 --> 00:54:36,920
How did your father's company
end up going bankrupt anyway?

736
00:54:42,967 --> 00:54:43,968
-What the…
-They're here!

737
00:54:44,052 --> 00:54:45,428
-Come on out!
-Join us!

738
00:54:45,512 --> 00:54:46,638
Quickly!

739
00:54:46,721 --> 00:54:48,598
My gosh. What do we do?

740
00:54:49,724 --> 00:54:51,392
Let's all link arms.

741
00:54:52,811 --> 00:54:54,270
Oh, no…

742
00:54:57,524 --> 00:55:00,193
-Move out of the way.
-Wait.

743
00:55:11,079 --> 00:55:12,413
What is all this?

744
00:55:12,497 --> 00:55:14,124
Stop it, will you?

745
00:55:14,666 --> 00:55:15,917
-Who are you with?
-Move!

746
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,002
At least state where you're from first!

747
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:21,172
I'm an officer of the district court.

748
00:55:21,673 --> 00:55:22,882
What about these people?

749
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:26,302
I want anyone who's not here
on official duty off our property.

750
00:55:26,386 --> 00:55:29,514
We wouldn't need extra help
if you didn't get in my team's way.

751
00:55:30,598 --> 00:55:32,433
Sirs, please stay in the courtyard.

752
00:55:33,601 --> 00:55:36,479
As of this moment,
all items inside this factory

753
00:55:36,563 --> 00:55:40,400
shall not be moved, taken out,
or used without proper authorization.

754
00:55:40,483 --> 00:55:45,113
We'll now begin the seizure
and the appraisal for auction.

755
00:55:46,197 --> 00:55:47,365
Let's get to work.

756
00:55:50,577 --> 00:55:52,704
-Please keep an eye on them, Mr. Bae.
-Understood.

757
00:55:52,787 --> 00:55:53,997
It's going to be fine, sir.

758
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,373
Goodness.

759
00:55:55,456 --> 00:55:56,624
Take it slow, will you?

760
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:03,214
-You've got something to say, huh?
-No, not exactly.

761
00:56:05,049 --> 00:56:06,759
EXERCISING RIGHT OF RETENTION

762
00:56:07,635 --> 00:56:08,928
Is this really necessary?

763
00:56:10,138 --> 00:56:11,306
Don't take it down.

764
00:56:11,389 --> 00:56:12,682
Step aside.

765
00:56:12,765 --> 00:56:13,975
Don't touch it.

766
00:56:20,273 --> 00:56:21,733
You can't touch this anymore.

767
00:56:21,816 --> 00:56:24,485
If we can't keep the machines running,
they'll get rusty.

768
00:56:26,029 --> 00:56:27,572
Don't tag every item.

769
00:56:27,655 --> 00:56:29,699
The downtime will damage these machines.

770
00:56:30,283 --> 00:56:31,784
Excuse me, Officer.

771
00:56:31,868 --> 00:56:34,370
Can't we let them run
for the sake of maintenance?

772
00:56:34,996 --> 00:56:35,997
That's not possible.

773
00:56:40,293 --> 00:56:43,213
You can always count on Tae-poong
to meddle when he's not wanted.

774
00:56:43,296 --> 00:56:47,508
Dude, everything here will belong to me
once the company assets are auctioned off.

775
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:50,428
You're buying them?

776
00:56:50,511 --> 00:56:52,847
Don't leave anything out of the appraisal.

777
00:58:07,005 --> 00:58:09,424
SEIZED

778
00:58:14,053 --> 00:58:16,139
-Wait, Mr. Kang. Give me some room.
-Okay.

779
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:28,484
It's just odd whichever way I look at it.

780
00:58:28,568 --> 00:58:29,527
I agree.

781
00:58:30,069 --> 00:58:32,155
Why are we scrubbing the parts
in the dead of night?

782
00:58:32,238 --> 00:58:34,824
You heard how the idling machines
could easily break down.

783
00:58:34,907 --> 00:58:35,908
This is maintenance.

784
00:58:35,992 --> 00:58:39,120
I get that it's necessary,
but why are we the ones…

785
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:42,373
We should take it on, I guess?

786
00:58:42,457 --> 00:58:45,126
Of course. We're family.

787
00:58:45,209 --> 00:58:46,461
-Of course.
-Look.

788
00:58:47,086 --> 00:58:50,923
I still don't get why Hyun-jun
is participating in the auction.

789
00:58:51,674 --> 00:58:53,009
Why is he taking part?

790
00:58:53,092 --> 00:58:56,387
He lost interest and spent his time
in the back of his car later on.

791
00:58:56,471 --> 00:58:57,639
What's his name…

792
00:58:58,598 --> 00:59:01,517
Was it Mark? That guy came in
and spent a while in the office.

793
00:59:01,601 --> 00:59:02,935
Yes, right there.

794
00:59:03,019 --> 00:59:06,606
Why did Hyun-jun bring people
from a foreign company?

795
00:59:13,613 --> 00:59:14,947
There you go.

796
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:26,751
Why do you keep
scratching your hands, Mr. Go?

797
00:59:26,834 --> 00:59:29,253
-It's all because of me.
-Not at all.

798
00:59:29,837 --> 00:59:30,922
Don't get me started.

799
00:59:31,547 --> 00:59:37,512
Those jerks kept badgering Ms. Oh
to get them coffee or wash their dishes.

800
00:59:38,179 --> 00:59:40,264
-I couldn't stand it.
-He took care of everything.

801
00:59:40,348 --> 00:59:42,016
So I took care of everything.

802
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:43,518
I'm doing fine.

803
00:59:43,601 --> 00:59:45,103
-Are your hands okay?
-Mine are fine.

804
00:59:45,186 --> 00:59:46,896
-He did all the work.
-I developed eczema.

805
00:59:46,979 --> 00:59:48,898
-I didn't do any of the work.
-Still…

806
00:59:48,981 --> 00:59:51,150
I'm the one who got dermatitis eczema.

807
00:59:51,734 --> 00:59:52,652
I did.

808
00:59:52,735 --> 00:59:54,278
-Will you scratch them for me?
-Sure.

809
00:59:57,365 --> 00:59:58,533
I actually feel better.

810
00:59:58,616 --> 00:59:59,659
It's actually helpful…

811
00:59:59,742 --> 01:00:00,910
Hey, Seon-taek.

812
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,623
-Ms. Cha.
-How…

813
01:00:08,376 --> 01:00:12,588
Song-jung's mother asked me
to bring you some snacks.

814
01:00:12,672 --> 01:00:15,883
Why are you even here, lady?

815
01:00:15,967 --> 01:00:16,968
Mr. Bae!

816
01:00:17,969 --> 01:00:21,180
-It's not what you think. I just--
-No.

817
01:00:21,806 --> 01:00:23,850
I asked him for a favor.

818
01:00:25,977 --> 01:00:27,770
-Ms. Cha.
-Thank…

819
01:00:35,862 --> 01:00:36,946
Thank you for these.

820
01:00:37,739 --> 01:00:39,991
Please don't misunderstand, Mr. Koo.

821
01:00:40,074 --> 01:00:41,284
-We all know--
-Why, you!

822
01:00:41,367 --> 01:00:44,036
-We know things are rough for her.
-That's enough.

823
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:48,916
Our priority is handling the obstacle
right in front of us.

824
01:00:49,792 --> 01:00:52,336
Let's circle back to what you were saying.

825
01:00:52,879 --> 01:00:56,257
That Mark guy seems to be the one
eyeing this company.

826
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:59,177
It's even odder that a foreigner
would take an interest.

827
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:01,721
Right, when we visited
Pyo Merchant Marine's office,

828
01:01:01,804 --> 01:01:05,057
weren't those guys shaking hands
with a contract between them?

829
01:01:06,058 --> 01:01:06,893
What?

830
01:01:08,102 --> 01:01:09,103
Where's Mr. Pyo?

831
01:01:10,396 --> 01:01:12,648
You're right.

832
01:01:12,732 --> 01:01:14,859
In that case, that document
will give us an answer.

833
01:01:15,818 --> 01:01:17,153
How would we find it?

834
01:01:17,236 --> 01:01:19,197
Are you suggesting we commit burglary?

835
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,240
Let's not stoop so low
as to become criminals.

836
01:01:21,324 --> 01:01:24,535
What do you mean? All we'll be doing
is taking a tour of the place.

837
01:01:24,619 --> 01:01:25,870
Mr. Koo's right.

838
01:01:25,953 --> 01:01:28,664
Technically, we're an affiliate
of Pyo Merchant Marine.

839
01:01:29,624 --> 01:01:32,877
All right, fine. Then…

840
01:01:33,711 --> 01:01:34,962
Why don't we make a move?

841
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:37,215
We'll have to take a look.

842
01:01:37,757 --> 01:01:39,842
Let's start by looking for the key.

843
01:01:40,426 --> 01:01:41,928
I know where the key is.

844
01:01:45,097 --> 01:01:45,932
Where's Myung-gwan?

845
01:01:46,015 --> 01:01:48,351
Oh, Mr. Koo?
He's on the night shift tonight.

846
01:01:48,434 --> 01:01:50,269
He was running late and dashed away.

847
01:01:50,353 --> 01:01:52,230
-Are you sure you're fine?
-Of course.

848
01:01:52,313 --> 01:01:54,482
If that jerk, Hyun-jun,
harasses you again--

849
01:01:54,565 --> 01:01:57,109
-I'll tell you right away.
-I'm being serious.

850
01:01:57,193 --> 01:01:58,694
This is nerve-racking for me.

851
01:01:58,778 --> 01:02:00,822
You're worrying over nothing.

852
01:02:08,538 --> 01:02:11,332
You two are walking
unusually close together.

853
01:02:11,415 --> 01:02:12,792
The alley's too narrow.

854
01:02:13,292 --> 01:02:14,961
-It's broad as it can be.
-Really?

855
01:02:15,545 --> 01:02:17,338
-Keep some distance, okay?
-Okay.

856
01:02:17,421 --> 01:02:18,631
Move away some more.

857
01:02:20,842 --> 01:02:23,469
Be careful, okay?
You could end up catching feelings.

858
01:02:24,178 --> 01:02:26,347
Your focus should be
on your career, Ms. Oh.

859
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:27,723
We can't have you fall in love.

860
01:02:28,558 --> 01:02:30,351
-Let's be careful, okay?
-Of course.

861
01:02:30,434 --> 01:02:32,478
All right, then. After you.

862
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,983
-This isn't the time for romance, okay?
-Of course.

863
01:02:37,942 --> 01:02:38,985
What's wrong?

864
01:02:39,485 --> 01:02:41,988
I wondered if you were feeling okay
because you kept fidgeting.

865
01:02:42,613 --> 01:02:43,531
Never mind.

866
01:02:46,534 --> 01:02:49,245
Mr. Kang seems to be in a strange mood.

867
01:03:07,763 --> 01:03:09,682
Freckles, fetch us some iced coffee.

868
01:03:11,851 --> 01:03:12,935
No, stay put.

869
01:03:13,019 --> 01:03:14,270
-Oh, no.
-No, stay seated.

870
01:03:14,353 --> 01:03:15,605
-I'll do it.
-But your hands…

871
01:03:15,688 --> 01:03:17,231
Don't they sting?

872
01:03:54,101 --> 01:03:55,436
Jeez.

873
01:03:58,147 --> 01:04:03,110
I need iced coffee prepared by Freckles
to start my day in a great mood.

874
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:07,615
-We don't want your luxury suit stained--
-Give it a rest, can't you?

875
01:04:07,698 --> 01:04:09,992
-You're too much, Mr. Go.
-No, thanks.

876
01:04:11,494 --> 01:04:13,663
I told you he doesn't drink it.

877
01:04:14,956 --> 01:04:16,624
How many times must I remind you?

878
01:04:18,501 --> 01:04:19,377
Oops.

879
01:04:20,044 --> 01:04:22,463
-Ms. Oh!
-You did that on purpose, didn't you?

880
01:04:22,546 --> 01:04:23,589
What's the matter?

881
01:04:23,673 --> 01:04:25,049
-Ms. Oh, how could you…
-My gosh!

882
01:04:25,132 --> 01:04:26,884
-Oh, dear.
-You made me look like a clown.

883
01:04:26,968 --> 01:04:29,053
Seriously, Ms. Oh.
You shouldn't have done that.

884
01:04:29,136 --> 01:04:30,137
Darn it.

885
01:04:31,472 --> 01:04:33,140
-So annoying.
-Oh, no.

886
01:04:33,224 --> 01:04:34,809
Come on, Ms. Oh.

887
01:04:35,768 --> 01:04:36,936
I bet she did it on purpose.

888
01:04:39,563 --> 01:04:40,856
Hey, it's a drone!

889
01:04:42,358 --> 01:04:43,943
-North Korea!
-North Korea?

890
01:04:44,026 --> 01:04:45,361
-It must be them!
-What?

891
01:04:45,444 --> 01:04:47,488
Can it be the armed communists' doing?

892
01:04:47,571 --> 01:04:48,781
-Look!
-Armed communists…

893
01:04:49,365 --> 01:04:50,199
Look, everyone.

894
01:04:50,282 --> 01:04:52,743
North Korea! Look.

895
01:04:53,536 --> 01:04:55,496
-North Korea!
-My gosh!

896
01:04:55,579 --> 01:04:57,248
The communists…

897
01:04:57,832 --> 01:05:00,793
-North Korean spies?
-What's that?

898
01:05:02,712 --> 01:05:05,589
-Wait, was North Korea in that direction?
-That direction?

899
01:05:05,673 --> 01:05:09,468
My gosh, look at the beautiful harmony
of the leaves and flowers.

900
01:05:09,552 --> 01:05:10,511
It's almost summer.

901
01:05:12,221 --> 01:05:14,140
-What's his deal?
-Oh, boy.

902
01:05:29,989 --> 01:05:31,407
SEIZED

903
01:05:31,907 --> 01:05:33,784
MONITORING 24-7

904
01:05:44,712 --> 01:05:45,713
Great.

905
01:05:54,930 --> 01:05:56,807
Get a load of him, looking all sharp.

906
01:05:56,891 --> 01:05:58,476
We're only delivering justice.

907
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:01,479
All right, then. We'll see you in an hour.

908
01:06:02,438 --> 01:06:03,773
Team, to your positions!

909
01:06:28,964 --> 01:06:30,299
We'll go up.

910
01:06:31,217 --> 01:06:32,968
You two, go to that punk's room.

911
01:06:33,052 --> 01:06:34,720
-Be careful.
-Be careful.

912
01:06:42,978 --> 01:06:44,939
Keep a close eye on things, Mr. Bae.

913
01:06:45,022 --> 01:06:46,190
Where are you going?

914
01:06:47,566 --> 01:06:48,567
It's patrol time.

915
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:51,403
I should perform my duty.

916
01:06:52,571 --> 01:06:53,489
Okay.

917
01:06:54,448 --> 01:06:57,076
Man, long-timers sure
have a different mindset.

918
01:06:57,159 --> 01:06:59,829
PYO MERCHANT MARINE

919
01:07:06,168 --> 01:07:07,628
Okay, let's search the place.

920
01:07:09,255 --> 01:07:10,422
All right.

921
01:07:19,598 --> 01:07:20,766
What the heck?

922
01:07:21,642 --> 01:07:24,103
He never works.
Why does he have so many files?

923
01:07:27,398 --> 01:07:28,816
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

924
01:07:55,217 --> 01:07:56,343
Where am I?

925
01:07:57,052 --> 01:07:58,470
All corners look the same.

926
01:08:17,573 --> 01:08:19,241
Are they raising an animal?

927
01:08:26,665 --> 01:08:28,125
The whole pile…

928
01:08:28,709 --> 01:08:29,543
Darn it.

929
01:08:36,133 --> 01:08:38,344
-Why is this here?
-What?

930
01:08:42,264 --> 01:08:44,642
-That crazy bastard!
-What's wrong?

931
01:08:44,725 --> 01:08:46,435
-What's the matter?
-Look at this.

932
01:08:46,518 --> 01:08:48,062
-Seriously.
-What the…

933
01:08:48,145 --> 01:08:49,313
It's my dad's nameplate.

934
01:08:49,396 --> 01:08:50,397
CEO KANG JIN-YOUNG

935
01:08:51,148 --> 01:08:52,149
Is someone there?

936
01:08:53,275 --> 01:08:54,860
We have to hide.

937
01:08:54,944 --> 01:08:56,570
-Hide yourself.
-Let's lie down.

938
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:04,912
Break-in suspected in the main building.

939
01:09:05,496 --> 01:09:08,123
Break-in suspected in the main building.
Send backup.

940
01:09:08,624 --> 01:09:10,751
Break-in suspected in the main building.
Send backup.

941
01:09:17,383 --> 01:09:19,802
Security team,
report to the main building.

942
01:09:21,053 --> 01:09:23,597
Security team,
report to the main building.

943
01:09:25,557 --> 01:09:27,977
-We're in the clear.
-Really? Has he left?

944
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:29,103
I think he's gone.

945
01:09:40,239 --> 01:09:41,156
-What's wrong?
-Let's…

946
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:43,158
-Let's stop by at the CEO's office.
-Okay.

947
01:09:47,871 --> 01:09:49,707
Who's that? Who's there?

948
01:09:53,752 --> 01:09:54,962
Ms. Cha?

949
01:09:55,713 --> 01:09:58,674
-What are you doing here?
-I lied, saying I had to make a delivery.

950
01:09:58,757 --> 01:10:01,927
This is the CEO's office.
Anything of value should be here.

951
01:10:02,011 --> 01:10:03,554
The guards are coming. Let's leave.

952
01:10:03,637 --> 01:10:05,639
Never mind me. You two should get going.

953
01:10:05,723 --> 01:10:06,932
I can say I'm here for work.

954
01:10:07,016 --> 01:10:09,184
-Go on, leave.
-No, come with us.

955
01:10:09,268 --> 01:10:12,771
-Ms. Oh, let's head out first.
-Nonsense. We have to leave together.

956
01:10:12,855 --> 01:10:14,315
You should come too, Ms. Cha.

957
01:10:14,398 --> 01:10:15,691
We've got to leave.

958
01:10:15,774 --> 01:10:17,234
-Come on.
-Who's that?

959
01:10:17,318 --> 01:10:18,569
Wait!

960
01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:20,446
Mr. Kang!

961
01:10:20,529 --> 01:10:21,655
You bastard!

962
01:10:29,455 --> 01:10:31,206
Watch out, Mr. Kang! He's behind you!

963
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:33,667
Oh, no.

964
01:10:33,751 --> 01:10:34,877
Hey!

965
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:36,712
-What the…
-Ms. Cha!

966
01:10:39,256 --> 01:10:41,216
-Let go!
-Don't hurt her!

967
01:10:53,479 --> 01:10:55,230
-Mr. Kang!
-You bastards.

968
01:10:58,525 --> 01:11:01,904
I served with the 498th class
of the Korean Marine Corps. Get going.

969
01:11:01,987 --> 01:11:03,447
Go. Hurry!

970
01:11:04,114 --> 01:11:06,033
Is that a uniform? I can't believe it.

971
01:11:06,116 --> 01:11:06,950
Jeez.

972
01:11:07,034 --> 01:11:08,911
Count yourselves lucky.

973
01:11:10,788 --> 01:11:11,997
Hey, that's Mr. Go.

974
01:11:12,623 --> 01:11:15,751
DON'T TOUCH THE CONTROL PANEL

975
01:11:25,177 --> 01:11:26,178
Hey, they're downstairs!

976
01:11:26,261 --> 01:11:28,013
-Go after them.
-Hurry, Mr. Go!

977
01:11:39,483 --> 01:11:40,359
All right!

978
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:43,946
This way.

979
01:11:44,029 --> 01:11:45,155
Hurry up!

980
01:11:53,497 --> 01:11:55,332
This is why you need
quality security cameras.

981
01:11:55,416 --> 01:11:57,209
Your cheap cameras
can't catch a thing now.

982
01:11:57,292 --> 01:11:59,586
-What happened?
-Why did the lights go out?

983
01:11:59,670 --> 01:12:01,964
-Hurry.
-You damn bastards!

984
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:07,094
-Ms. Cha!
-What's going on?

985
01:12:18,439 --> 01:12:19,982
-Hey.
-Mr. Kang.

986
01:12:20,065 --> 01:12:22,067
-Hurry!
-Run!

987
01:12:22,151 --> 01:12:23,402
Quickly!

988
01:12:23,485 --> 01:12:25,320
-Ms. Cha!
-Run for your life!

989
01:12:27,614 --> 01:12:29,324
Hurry! Hurry up!

990
01:12:31,618 --> 01:12:34,079
Hurry up! Quickly!

991
01:12:40,836 --> 01:12:44,381
Just go. Move!

992
01:12:44,465 --> 01:12:45,466
Help her.

993
01:12:45,549 --> 01:12:46,967
-But they're…
-Darn it.

994
01:12:47,050 --> 01:12:48,635
Hey, wait for me. Oh, shoot.

995
01:12:55,058 --> 01:12:56,268
Are you okay?

996
01:12:58,103 --> 01:12:59,480
What about you?

997
01:13:02,566 --> 01:13:03,567
Gosh.

998
01:13:04,526 --> 01:13:06,361
Great work tonight.

999
01:13:06,445 --> 01:13:08,697
I brought some red ginseng drinks
to boost your energy.

1000
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:10,115
-That's lovely.
-Thank you.

1001
01:13:10,199 --> 01:13:11,617
Here, here.

1002
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:12,784
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

1003
01:13:12,868 --> 01:13:14,369
Your flying kick was amazing, Mr. Go.

1004
01:13:15,037 --> 01:13:17,164
-I sure showed them.
-Here you go, Ms. Cha.

1005
01:13:17,748 --> 01:13:18,749
I'll take a pass.

1006
01:13:20,209 --> 01:13:22,836
Come on, Seon-taek.
Drink this before you go.

1007
01:13:23,462 --> 01:13:24,379
Ms. Cha.

1008
01:13:54,952 --> 01:13:56,870
What's up? Did you find something?

1009
01:13:57,996 --> 01:13:58,830
What is it?

1010
01:14:00,832 --> 01:14:01,959
Tell us what it is.

1011
01:14:08,924 --> 01:14:10,759
"In exchange for a 40-million-won loan,

1012
01:14:10,842 --> 01:14:14,263
Pyo Bak-ho will transfer 30% of his shares
of Pyo Merchant Marine."

1013
01:14:15,222 --> 01:14:18,850
"He also pledges to return the full amount
in cash by August 16, 1990."

1014
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:21,895
"Written on August 16, 1989."

1015
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:24,314
"Creditor Kang Jin-young."

1016
01:14:25,357 --> 01:14:27,943
"Debtor Pyo Bak-ho."

1017
01:14:32,614 --> 01:14:33,448
This is it.

1018
01:14:34,741 --> 01:14:35,993
It's the promissory note.

1019
01:14:37,619 --> 01:14:38,787
Is it the real thing?

1020
01:14:39,413 --> 01:14:40,872
Yes, this is the one.

1021
01:14:42,583 --> 01:14:45,586
I finally found the promissory note.

1022
01:14:45,669 --> 01:14:47,963
CREDITOR: KANG JIN-YOUNG
DEBTOR: PYO BAK-HO

1023
01:14:48,046 --> 01:14:50,048
PROMISSORY NOTE

1024
01:14:53,468 --> 01:14:54,678
Mr. Koo.

1025
01:14:55,554 --> 01:14:56,388
Goodness.

1026
01:15:00,392 --> 01:15:01,226
Oh, dear.

1027
01:15:05,147 --> 01:15:06,565
Gosh, Ms. Cha!

1028
01:15:09,318 --> 01:15:11,153
We've come such a long way for this…

1029
01:15:13,614 --> 01:15:15,657
when I've had it with me the whole time.

1030
01:15:19,953 --> 01:15:21,955
-It's all good now.
-Oh, my goodness.

1031
01:15:25,834 --> 01:15:27,044
We found it!

1032
01:15:31,965 --> 01:15:38,805
THE LAST MATCH

1033
01:16:11,421 --> 01:16:14,341
TYPHOON FAMILY

1034
01:16:14,424 --> 01:16:17,386
The business and the people
will all go back to their places!

1035
01:16:17,469 --> 01:16:20,681
We'll all go back to our places!

1036
01:16:20,764 --> 01:16:24,476
Please welcome Contestant 13, Wang Nam-mo!

1037
01:16:24,559 --> 01:16:27,479
I will try my best without giving up.

1038
01:16:27,562 --> 01:16:29,856
Wait a second.
What are you two up to? What was that?

1039
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:33,568
Everyone in this world knows
except for you three here.

1040
01:16:33,652 --> 01:16:35,195
I need you to do something.

1041
01:16:35,278 --> 01:16:36,154
You crazy idiot.

1042
01:16:36,655 --> 01:16:38,532
I also kicked out that punk,
Kang Tae-poong,

1043
01:16:38,615 --> 01:16:40,200
and took over Typhoon Trading.

1044
01:16:40,283 --> 01:16:42,160
Stop talking nonsense!

1045
01:16:42,244 --> 01:16:47,207
I have never once given up
or abandoned this company.

1046
