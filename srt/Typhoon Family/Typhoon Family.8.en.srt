TYPHOON TRADING

3
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:51,050
My name is Kim Jeong-hyeon,
the director of sales at Kangseong Helmet.

4
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:56,055
-I'm Bae In-ho, the head of development.
-Nice to meet you.

5
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:59,184
My name is Go Ma-jin,
the sales team leader.

6
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,643
-Mr. Go Ma-jin.
-Yes.

7
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,983
And I am CEO Kang Tae-poong
of Typhoon Trading.

8
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,693
Please have some coffee.

9
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,987
-I am Oh Mi-seon, the senior staff.
-Hello.

10
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,490
Please have some coffee.

11
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,116
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,037
We should've been
the ones to visit you first.

13
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,371
Goodness, don't say that.

14
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,707
We came because we were curious.

15
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,834
We wanted to see the company

16
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:28,338
that wanted to sell our helmet
to another country.

17
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,341
Something like this rarely happens.

18
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,260
I wanted to taste your coffee too.

19
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,013
Now, about these…

20
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:39,891
This is a full-face helmet,
and this is an open-face one.

21
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:42,685
Doesn't the full-face helmet
already look sturdy?

22
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,105
But the open-face helmet is exposed,

23
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:50,276
so it's very easy to put on and take off,
and it's much cheaper too.

24
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,613
I see. But these seem a bit…

25
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,658
They seem like they'll break easily.

26
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:57,951
Helmets need to break.

27
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,788
If it doesn't break, your head will.

28
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,249
-I see.
-The impact will go to the head.

29
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,879
My goodness!

30
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,719
It's fine.

31
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:22,142
However, what you need to see
is the inside.

32
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:26,938
This is…

33
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,775
-Then, Director Kim.
-Yes?

34
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,653
What would be the minimum order?

35
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,655
We begin at 1,000 helmets,

36
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:38,825
but we can negotiate in this situation
and start at 500 pieces.

37
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,452
Is it possible to purchase on credit?

38
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,330
I'll have to see some documents,
but the amount isn't significant,

39
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,790
so it's probably possible.

40
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:47,834
Thank you for coming today.

41
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,003
-Sure.
-I'll see you next time. Thank you.

42
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,754
-Goodbye. Great meeting.
-Goodbye.

43
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,094
You don't have to see us off.

44
00:02:58,177 --> 00:02:59,679
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

45
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,222
We won't see you off then.

46
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,063
Now, we have the products.

47
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,572
Cut it out.
I was going to throw that helmet away.

48
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,034
Where do you want to sell it to?

49
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:24,370
They're already selling to America,
Europe, the Arab countries, Singapore,

50
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,206
Hong Kong, Taiwan,
and just about everywhere.

51
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,375
Where would you sell them?

52
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,802

-That sounds cold.
-Isn't that way up in the north?

ARGENTINA

60
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:03,701
Argentina?

61
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,620
Up here.

00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,330

00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,832
And how about here?

65
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,834
What are we going to do
in the middle of the sea?

66
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,002
This is Hawaii.

67
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,590
-How about this?
-Maybe Australia.

68
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,134
No, we can't go with Australia.

69
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,762
-We're moving again?
-Are you traveling around the world?

70
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,138
It's going to be…

71
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,272
THAILAND

72
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,606
…Thailand.

73
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,108
Thailand?

74
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,651
What do you mean, Thailand?

75
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,070
They've suffered
from the IMF crisis before us.

76
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,571
Exactly.

77
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,533
They've suffered first,
so they'll recover first too.

78
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,911
Haven't you ever taken the first blow?
It hurts like crazy.

79
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,497
I'm usually the one
who throws the punch first.

80
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,583
Do you think they'll buy these?
Is it even possible?

81
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,044
What's their current GNI?

82
00:04:56,587 --> 00:05:00,008
-I'm not a part of the company.
-It's $370 billion.

83
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,592
Here's the thing.

84
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:05,847
What's more important is
how much they spend, not earn.

85
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,350
You all know
about the expensive German cars, right?

86
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,937
What's the country that bought
those cars the most after Germany?

87
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,732
Where's the city with the most number
of department stores?

88
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:19,819
It's Thailand.

89
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,905
They have the highest purchasing power
in that region.

90
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,950
It's only been two years
since helmets became mandatory.

91
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,411
The law is going to be
much stricter this year.

92
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,331
-This year? Why?
-Why is that?

93
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,959
BASEBALL DREAM TEAM WILL LEAVE FOR BANGKOK

94
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,088
-Right, Park Chan-ho.
-The Bangkok Asian Games.

95
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,340
What do you say?

96
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,843
In my opinion, the exchange rate
is what matters the most.

97
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:47,638
The baht exchange rate hit the ATH
in January and began to go down.

98
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,016
The decline was rapid,
so the recovery is quick too.

99
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,309
It's a relief for us.

100
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:55,855
Even if we sign a deal now,
we'd get paid way past May,

101
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,358
so it wouldn't be too bad
if the rate rose this much.

102
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,403
Sure, okay. Nice speech.
The buyer is what matters the most.

103
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:06,157
Who in Thailand
will actually buy our helmets?

104
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,659
We must find a customer first
before we make a sales effort,

105
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,953
so let's find
a trustworthy local middleman,

106
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,916
someone like Typhoon Trading in Thailand.

107
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,258
Boss, the mango samples are here.

108
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,551
Hey, you're here.

109
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,765
-I wonder if the samples are any good.
-Hello, this is Sawaddee speaking.

110
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,309
Boss, you have a call.

111
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:34,519
Okay.

112
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:39,982
Who is it?

113
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,111
I guess I can't do that.

114
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:47,490
Who's calling me now?

115
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,575
Goodness.

116
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,204
Hello, Sawaddee Trading.

117
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,747
This is Go Ma-yong speaking.

118
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,751
Look who it is! You're Ma-jin!

119
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,378
Hey, it's been a while.

120
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,671
Are you doing all right?

121
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:07,260
Anyway, you aren't calling me
sitting down like a rude punk, are you?

122
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,429
What now?

123
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,557
Helmets?

124
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,976
Yes, exactly. All right. Okay.

125
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,103
All right. I'll reach out to you.

126
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,563
Bye.

127
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:23,025
He's still making me exhausted.

128
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,320
This guy is my second cousin,

129
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:30,116
who's been running a business
in Thailand for over 15 years now.

130
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,660
He seemed interested for now.

131
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,622
He asked for a sample first.

132
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,000
-A sample?
-Here's what we'll do.

133
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,752
I'll go to Kangseong and get the product.

134
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:45,715
-Okay.
-So let's send that as the sample.

135
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:50,178
-What else do we need?
-He also asked for pictures.

136
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,888
Old pictures of the company.

137
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,598
Old company pictures?

138
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:57,351
You can get that ready, Oh.
Get our visas ready.

139
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,811
-Business visa.
-Yes, right.

140
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,439
Mr. Go, she's no longer just Oh.
She's a senior staff member.

141
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:04,609
For the photos…
I'll look for the photos, Ms. Oh.

142
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,194
-Okay.
-It should be in my office.

143
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:11,073
-Hey, Oh, stay there for a moment.
-Okay.

144
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,913
All right.

145
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,583
Hey, Oh.

146
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,045
No, Senior Staff Ms. Oh.

147
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:25,796
Here's my thing.

148
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,176
This is how I'm built.

149
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:36,432
I'm not the type of guy who thinks badly
about women who join the workforce.

150
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,600
However, I…

151
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:42,772
Well, I'm bringing this up
for your sake, Ms. Oh.

152
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:48,569
But you getting directly involved
in sales doesn't seem…

153
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,448
-quite proper.
-Sorry?

154
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:56,244
You can relax and continue
to work as a bookkeeper.

155
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,663
And if you want to do more,

156
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,958
I guess you can pick up
some of Mr. Bae's work too.

157
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,043
But when it comes to sales,

158
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,629
please hold yourself back.

159
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,383
It's not that I don't like you,

160
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,844
and I'm not looking down on you
because of your education.

161
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,180
It's not like your diploma
will help you sell more.

162
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,723
My school isn't much, either.

163
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,060
In that case, only people like
Mr. Kang should be in sales.

164
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:27,984
Imagine a young woman like you
going abroad as the head of sales,

165
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,529
walking with your head up high.

166
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:35,533
What will our customers
think of our business?

167
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,994
It's obvious.

168
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,623
Sales isn't that easy.

169
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:48,421
Think about it. Why do they call us
a trader or salesman?

170
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:51,090
Because there are no women in the game.

171
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,390
Okay, Mr. Go. Thank you for your concern.

172
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,851
But you know,

173
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:05,396
I'll let the customers evaluate
how I am as a salesperson.

174
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:10,651
Then I'll prove myself with numbers.

175
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,364
I don't know. How can I put this?

176
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,496
I don't think it's about men or women.

177
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,046
I just really want to be

178
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,215
a trader.

179
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,307
-I gave you my advice…
-Okay.

180
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,643
Don't come crying to me later

181
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:47,688
and say things like,
"Why didn't you stop me?"

182
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,052
Hey, you're ruining the wheels!

183
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,431
I said I'd come alone.
You even had to leave your store.

184
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,934
It's okay. Business was slow anyway.

185
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:27,728
Hey.

186
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,773
Are you headed over there?

187
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,443
Yes, how did you know?

188
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,450
Hey.

189
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,913
-So this is your home?
-Yes.

190
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,333
Ms. Oh will be thrilled.
Come in for a second.

191
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,338
-You're back.
-Hi.

192
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,048
It's so cold.

193
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,391
What? This beautiful face,
even without half her brows,

194
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,435
is definitely my girlfriend, Mi-ho.

195
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,020
Why does that punk, Tae-poong, live here?

196
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:14,400
You didn't know? He lives with us.

197
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,193
He's the CEO of my sister's workplace.

198
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,781
Darn it. Why did he come now?

199
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:21,907
THAI FOR BEGINNERS

200
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,742
See you again.

201
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:30,124
Good luck.

202
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,500
See you again.

203
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,295
Good luck. See you again.

204
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:36,881
Good luck.

205
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:37,882
Ms. Oh?

206
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,929
-Ms. Oh?
-My gosh.

207
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,932
-Hey, Mr. Kang.
-I borrowed this.

208
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,809
We won't need to buy this anymore.

209
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:52,646
Gosh, you didn't have to do this.

210
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,815
-The handle should be sturdy.
-Okay.

211
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,902
Well, Mr. Kang.

212
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,280
By any chance,

213
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:06,035
if it's too inconvenient for me to go,
I can always stay here.

214
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,995
What's inconvenient about that?

215
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,705
You're Typhoon Trading's trader.

216
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,083
And you're studying so hard too.

217
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,045
This is just my hobby.

218
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,048
-Is that Thai? Sawasdee khap.
-Yes.

219
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,341
Sawasdee kha.

220
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,592
Hey, Tae-poong!

221
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,847
-I'm going to stay the night.
-What? All of a sudden?

222
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,309
Is that you, my son?

223
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:38,150
By any chance, are you Gap-sik's father?

224
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:45,115
How dare you enter a home
full of women without consent?

225
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,618
-Yes, man.
-Who's she?

226
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,956
-She's my grandma.
-We aren't going to buy anything!

227
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,707
Hello, Grandma.

228
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,086
Hey, you're here, Nam-mo.

229
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,797
So you're staying the night?
Should I sleep in Ms. Yeom's room?

230
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,174
-Have you eaten?
-Yes, I ate.

231
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,219
Do you know how to spin a top?
What about the striking trick?

232
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,470
He can't do any of those.

233
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,181
-Who are you?
-The youngest here.

234
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,103
He's my younger brother, Beom.

235
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,896
Beom? That means tiger.

236
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,483
You have a dog too.

237
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,038
Are you asleep, Tae-poong?

238
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,375
You are.

239
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,711
Hey, no. I'm not asleep.

240
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:43,883
Did I ever tell you
about the toilet that plays a melody?

241
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,010
Yes, you did. One too many times.

242
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,970
The toilet that plays music when you pee,

243
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,389
the number one helmet in America,

244
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,100
the thread that melts in your body,
and foldable bicycles too.

245
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,310
I've heard it too many times.

246
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,273
You have so many things you want to sell
that you can't even go to sleep.

247
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,902
I really hope you'll fall asleep soon.

248
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,445
-Are you sleepy?
-No.

249
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,656
There are way too many things
to sell in this world.

250
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,826
I even want to sell
the stones I see on the street.

251
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,829
Yes, sure. Sell them all.

252
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,092
How can this simple kid run a business?

253
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,512
Good night. I'm going out.

254
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,892
Seriously, I'm going to sell them all.

255
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,370
Cuckoo.

256
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,413
No, this isn't right.

257
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,166
How do cranes sing?

258
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,267
One, two…

259
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,272
Can you go alone?

260
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,858
-I'll be right out front.
-Okay.

261
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,698
-Why weren't you asleep?
-Why were you gasping?

262
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,950
I missed you too much. Let me see you.

263
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,537
You're this beautiful
even in the middle of the night,

264
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,832
and you're right next door.
How can I sleep with this racing heart?

265
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:41,917
I won't.

266
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,085
I just can't sleep.

267
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,755
What's with you?
Get out of my face. Cut it out.

268
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,301
That was a surprise.

269
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,930
Did you say your name was Beom?

270
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,517
May I call you my brother-in-law?

271
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,728
Beom, my brother-in-law.

272
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,815
Mi-ho, you should go back inside.

273
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,984
-What?
-Go back inside.

274
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,152
Oh, my. Okay.

275
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:18,328
It's Mr. Beom. Call me Mr. Oh Beom.

276
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,178
Let's go to sleep.

277
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,474
Good night.

278
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:44,354
-No, wait a second.
-Why? I'm late for school.

279
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,522
Eat before you go.

280
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,192
Open up. Good boy.

281
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,319
And take this. Here.

282
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,236
Okay.

283
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,696
Fire shot!

284
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:54,782
Stop it!

285
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,742
He surprised me.

286
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,456
-I'm going to school!
-Don't run. You might fall!

287
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,501
I'm leaving too.

288
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,087
-Little Ms. Oh.
-Yes?

289
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:16,804
Hold this.

290
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:23,018
Have this as you go.
You'll ruin your stomach if you don't eat.

291
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,940
Thank you.

292
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,192
What about my son?

293
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,611
-Is he not here yet?
-I wonder.

294
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,781
Something good must've happened.
He left early in the morning.

295
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,368
I'll make breakfast for you.

296
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,830
Okay. I'll take the picture.

297
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,207
One moment.

298
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,635
There you go.

299
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,595
It's for your passport.

300
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,472
You look beautiful.

301
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:06,228
All right, then. One, two, three.

302
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,690
Another one.

303
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,901
One, two, three.

304
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,585
-Ms. Oh Mi-seon of Typhoon Trading?
-Yes.

305
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,129
-A delivery for you.
-Okay.

306
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,716
-Please sign here.
-Sure.

307
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:41,930
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

308
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:01,867
It's here.

309
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,549
You're up.

310
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,343
Are you that worried?

311
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,640
You must be leaving home
for the first time, Ms. Oh.

312
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,267
Yes.

313
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,104
Your siblings are grown up enough.

314
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,231
They'll manage well without you.

315
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,733
And I'm here too.

316
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,863
Good night.

317
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,532
-Go to sleep.
-Okay.

318
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,383
-That way?
-Yes.

319
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,179
Thailand!

320
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,058
-It's all right.
-Come take a look.

321
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,148
Hello. You can take a look here.

322
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,899
All pretty and nice.

323
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,571
Is this it? Is it the second floor here?

324
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,282
Where is this guy?

325
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,993
Ma-jin! Go Ma-jin!

326
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,539
-Hey, Ma-jin!
-Ma-yong!

327
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,833
Hey, stay right there.

328
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,879
-Let's go.
-Okay.

329
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,382
Ma-yong!

330
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,720
Goodness, my little cousin.

331
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,556
It must've been one long trip.

332
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,142
Goodness, Ma-yong.

333
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:36,063
You've become quite friendly
while living abroad.

334
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:39,399
I hope the leaf mustard kimchi
hasn't over-fermented.

335
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,151
Goodness, what a shame.

336
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:45,489
Are you sure you brought everything
I told you to bring here?

337
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,825
-I had to pay an extra $700 for it.
-Hello.

338
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,452
-Hello.
-They were just too heavy!

339
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,369
Hello.

340
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,038
How's your father doing?

341
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,873
Now you want to know?

342
00:22:56,416 --> 00:23:00,212
Forget it. Come and meet
CEO Kang Tae-poong of our company.

343
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,963
Hello, my name is Kang Tae-poong.

344
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,800
I'm a former nominee of the 36th
and the 37th presidential elections

345
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,593
of the Korean-Thai Association

346
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:09,596
and the CEO of Sawaddee Trading,
and my name's Go Ma-yong.

347
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:12,849
-I see.
-You're one handsome man.

348
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,392
You're just like me!

349
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:18,563
-And she is?
-Yes, hello.

350
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,066
And as you can see, this is…

351
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,692
Who is she?
Why aren't you introducing her?

352
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,070
She's just one of our female staff.

353
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:29,908
No, tell me. Who is she? What does she do?

354
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,664
-Should we go?
-Yes.

355
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:39,126
He says he even rented out
an office for us.

356
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:44,172
You can't do your business
out on the streets.

357
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,090
Thank you.

358
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:47,425
That's enough with greetings
and formalities.

359
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,344
It's right here.

360
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,722
Come on in.

361
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:53,807
This is it.

362
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:00,856
Will this be our temporary office?

363
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,025
-It's not this one, right?
-Of course not.

364
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:07,195
Your office is just a part of the room,
just this area.

365
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,158
This? You expect the three of us
to sit on this tiny table and work?

366
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:14,494
Were you going to sit here
instead of going out to work?

367
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,329
That's why you're facing a crisis.

368
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,124
How lazy are you?

369
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,293
Let's see.

370
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:22,794
Kasem!

371
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,966
-Chairs. Three chairs.
-Okay.

372
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:33,597
I told you to bring old photos
that looked really ancient.

373
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:37,517
-What about these? These are pretty old.
-This is a good one.

374
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:41,646
You should put these ones out there.

375
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,231
-I have this one too.
-That's good.

376
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,150
It looks like you have tradition.

377
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:48,737
By any chance, do you have
a photo of anyone in a military uniform?

378
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,906
It's nice to keep one out front.

379
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,992
Soldiers have a lot of power in Thailand.

380
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,328
These are nice.

381
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:58,914
CELEBRATING THE DAY OF TRADE

382
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,708
Now, let's take a picture together.

383
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,168
TYPHOON TRADING UNITY EVENT

384
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:05,462
Okay. I'll take a few,
so strike a nice pose.

385
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,297
All right, then.

386
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,383
Okay, Mr. Kang.

387
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,677
You're kind of awkward.
You seem down-to-earth.

388
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,638
Act naturally. Let me take one first.

389
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:17,682
Looking great. One, two, three.

390
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,560
That's done. Any other pose?

391
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:23,146
That's good. "Typhoon Trading." Excellent.

392
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,856
One, two… I'll take one.

393
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,108
That's a nice pose. One, two, three.

394
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,569
Point your finger.

395
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,655
Yes, but they aren't aligned. Focus.

396
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,531
Ms. Mi-seon, what are you doing?

397
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:36,284
-You're covering Mr. Kang's eyes.
-I'm sorry.

398
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,662
Excellent. Make the same eyes.

399
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,330
Great pose. One, two, three.

400
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,165
That was great.

401
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,960
This time, look at the helmet. Good.

402
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,878
Let's sell the helmets!

403
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,256
Okay. One, two, three!

404
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,173
All done.

405
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,135
This place is huge.

406
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:57,555
Have you been here before?

407
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:01,768
I know this place
like the back of my hand.

408
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,063
I'm hungry.

409
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:06,982
This is delicious.

410
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,984
Tom yum is here!

411
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,487
This is great, Mama.

412
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,864
Enjoy your meal.

413
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,658
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

414
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,785
-Delicious. Try.
-Thank you.

415
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,665
The lady of this guest house
is an excellent cook.

416
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:27,502
She's the best when it comes to seasoning.
Everything is perfectly seasoned.

417
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,337
Looks delicious.

418
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,631
What are you doing, Ha-neul?

419
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,342
Come and say hello
to your uncle and the guests.

420
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,261
Ha-neul, you punk!

421
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,346
Come on out, kiddo.

422
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,764
Hello.

423
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:41,766
Hello.

424
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,934
Hey, son.

425
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,769
Hey, Dad.

426
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:49,232
Jeez. What kind of nonsense
is he up to this time?

427
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:08,543
-What's with the wink?
-He's not in a good headspace.

428
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:09,669
Don't mind him.

429
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,426
Come on.

430
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,222
It tastes like makeup.

431
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,683
Try it, Uncle. You're a man.

432
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,935
Go and get your food.

433
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,730
Leave that there.

434
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,565
-Fine.
-Okay.

435
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:32,442
Eat up.

436
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,361
-What's this?
-Tom yum soup.

437
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,654
-Thank you.
-Tom yum soup.

438
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:39,157
-It's very delicious.
-That's what I'm saying.

439
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,660
What's going on these days?
Men's and women's roles keep switching.

440
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,247
You can take this one.

441
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:52,212
See? This tastes like makeup too.
These all taste the same.

442
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:54,798
Anyway, everyone.

443
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:57,092
The country is in a mess.

444
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,969
The power of our country
equals our power as expats,

445
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:04,724
but this IMF crisis is going to make
the Korean residents here starve.

446
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:08,311
Only traders like myself
can barely make ends meet,

447
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,313
thanks to my connections.

448
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,190
Where do you make such connections?

449
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,234
I moved here a long time ago

450
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:17,445
and got to know people in high society
while teaching them taekwondo.

451
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,864
I hear younger people
meet at clubs these days.

452
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:23,118
You can go with my son one of these days.

453
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:26,204
But the clubs in this neighborhood
are so luxurious

454
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,331
that they only accept people

455
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,626
who have lots of money
and have great looks.

456
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:34,254
We have a great chance in that way.

457
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:38,383
Mr. Kang was a proud member
of the Orange Tribe in Korea,

458
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:41,886
so although he doesn't have much money,
he still has his looks left.

459
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,390
He always attracted people
whenever he went clubbing.

460
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,726
I'm not part of the Orange Tribe.

461
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,602
And I quit clubbing.

462
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:54,107
When you go there, you'll probably meet
Nihakham Group's chairman's daughter.

463
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,359
-Ha-neul is acquainted with her.
-Really?

464
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,779
When will the items arrive?

465
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:02,782
Was it called Lamchaya?

466
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,493
This young lady here
sounds like a workaholic.

467
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,913
I'm expecting a shipment,
so I'll go there tomorrow.

468
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:12,041
-Do you want to tag along?
-Yes, I'd love to.

469
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:17,422
Then can we go
and meet with the customs officer?

470
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,257
Can we do that?

471
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,469
Everything will go smoothly
once we get to know an officer.

472
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,471
Yes, I'd like to see the port too.

473
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:29,768
Getting there isn't a problem,
but my car is already loaded.

474
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,644
I don't think I can take all of you.

475
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:32,562
Who cares?

476
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:35,899
Mr. Kang and I will be going by ourselves,
so it doesn't matter.

477
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,610
Hey, she brought this up first.

478
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:40,487
Yes, I'll go.

479
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:45,074
Why would you go there, Ms. Oh?

480
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,494
Take a hint.

481
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:50,872
It's the CEO
and the salesman that should go.

482
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,751
I work in sales too.

483
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:57,003
Sure. So what?

484
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:01,758
What can you do there?

485
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:03,510
What will you do?

486
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,350
The three of us can
all squeeze in together.

487
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:13,478
Or I can stick around here
and see if there's anything else to do.

488
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,021
No, the CEO should go.

489
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:19,067
And she keeps acting like this

490
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,570
because you keep covering for her.

491
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,572
You shouldn't do this for her sake.

492
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,410
-Come on--
-I'm sorry.

493
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:36,084
But I am not feeling well right now,
so please excuse me.

494
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,377
Enjoy your dinner.

495
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,212
-But we have so much good food.
-Ms. Oh.

496
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:41,297
Go and get some rest.

497
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:45,885
This was why.

498
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,681
This was why I said
only you and I should've come.

499
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,475
That useless girl came for no reason.

500
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,270
-She only gets in our way--
-Mr. Go!

501
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,858
You two are both salespersons.

502
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,651
I didn't hire her.

503
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,864
And do you realize
how important it is to appoint people?

504
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,657
Wait, this is way too spicy.

505
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:12,787
-Was this served to kill me?
-Why did you eat it?

506
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:19,043
I mean, did I say something wrong?

507
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,729
Eat this before you sleep.
You didn't get to eat earlier.

508
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,692
Mr. Kang.

509
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,737
I'll handle my own business.

510
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:49,157
-What?
-You know…

511
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,035
He says those things
because of how you act.

512
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,748
What did I do?

513
00:31:56,831 --> 00:32:00,251
You keep treating me like this,
and it's honestly making me…

514
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:03,671
uncomfortable.

515
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:09,552
Like what?

516
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,348
Holding baggage and bringing food for you?

517
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,392
Even before this, you said--

518
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,644
That I liked you?

519
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,317
I was just expressing my feelings.
I'm not expecting anything.

520
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,027
Can't colleagues show each other

521
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,322
this kind of consideration?

522
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,701
If this feels uncomfortable,
that's just your insecurity.

523
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,497
My insecurity?

524
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,624
I've thought about it,
but I just don't get it.

525
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:45,088
Do you think you're not good enough?

526
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,425
-Mr. Kang--
-You still need to eat.

527
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,554
It's from the lady of the guest house.

528
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,265
Here.

529
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,001
What is wrong with her?

530
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:24,794
Good grief.

531
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,218
Darn it.

532
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,558
What's with you?

533
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,352
Let's go. You're being immature.

534
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,898
Man, she's really strong.

535
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,118
-Get out of my way. Jeez.
-Hey.

536
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:00,997
Gosh.

537
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,042
-There seems to be some tension today.
-Not at all.

538
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:05,835
-Hop in.
-Okay.

539
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,297
-You can get in first.
-Sure.

540
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:12,341
Goodness.

541
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,584
All right. We're here!

542
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:57,095
-Should I carry this for you?
-No, I'm fine. I got it.

543
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,140
-It's scorching hot here, isn't it?
-It's wonderful.

544
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,020
The sky is very high.

545
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,772
The sky is high everywhere.

546
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,899
-Let's go.
-Okay.

547
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,957
Where are these all from?

548
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,836
My gosh. These are huge.

549
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:38,511
-Gosh.
-This is Lamchaya Port.

550
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,902
You're so fussy.
Why are you taking photos?

551
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:56,988
It's for the record.

552
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:59,782
Focus on our business
instead of making records.

553
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,161
She keeps doing these things
for no reason.

554
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:06,205
Stop bickering.
Let me take a photo of you three.

555
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,082
This will be a good memory. Stand here.

556
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,084
Memories, my foot.

557
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,003
It's a hot day, so let's go.

558
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,546
Let's take a picture to remember.

559
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:16,799
Mr. Go, this way, please.
You can stand right here.

560
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,552
I'll stand here
and take a great photo for you.

561
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:21,387
-Like this.
-All right.

562
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,555
Here we go. Okay!

563
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:25,516
I'll make sure you can see
the Lamchaya Port.

564
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,642
Here we go.

565
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:30,229
Ma-jin and Ms. Oh, get in the picture.

566
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,899
You aren't in the frame.

567
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:36,652
You're not in the picture,
so try to be more enthusiastic.

568
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,323
What are you doing, Ma-jin? Get in there.

569
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,366
-Okay.
-You have to get closer to look good.

570
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,785
-Come in here.
-Okay, then. Say kimchi!

571
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,370
-I'll take one.
-Mustard leaf kimchi!

572
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:49,790
Ma-jin, this isn't a passport photo.
You look too rigid.

573
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,918
I'll take one now. Okay.

574
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,502
Wait, like this.

575
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:56,714
-One, two…
-Kimchi!

576
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:59,383
I'm not doing this.
I don't want to take this.

577
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,517
Why, that…

578
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,144
That punk.

579
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,146
That car blocked everything.

580
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,065
I only got your feet, Ms. Oh.

581
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:17,485
-Forget it. They're my best feature.
-What do you mean? Goodness.

582
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:19,779
Feet?

583
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:26,244
Whatever. Mr. Kang, let's go.
I was only trying to make this better.

584
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,082
This doesn't seem right.

585
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,545
Will this end well?

586
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,302
Mr. Go!

587
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:47,139
I want to take a tour of the port
instead of the customs office.

588
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,267
There's nothing to see there.

589
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:50,935
Goodness gracious.

590
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,860
I have to turn in some paperwork
to the customs office,

591
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,320
so it'll take a bit of time.

592
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:05,199
Arthit will come by later,
so you two should meet him.

593
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,742
He's good at English.

594
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,203
And yes, Ma-jin.

595
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,163
Did you prepare what I told you to?

596
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:13,207
Of course, I came prepared.

597
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,126
Okay, you can use those.

598
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:19,130
Cigarettes here are way too strong,
so these are very popular.

599
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,047
He'll be happy.

600
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,174
-Okay, then. I'll see you later.
-Sure.

601
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:28,431
-Hello. I'm here to submit a document.
-Document submission is this way.

602
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,561
Thank you.

603
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,396
-I'll get going.
-Yes, sure.

604
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:47,658
-What are you doing?
-It's hard to tell, isn't it?

605
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,744
What time is it now? It's 11:00 a.m.

606
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:52,288
I'm sliding this in
to let him enjoy a good lunch.

607
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:55,458
This is what I call
having a sharp knack for sales.

608
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:58,461
You can't give him
both cigarettes and cash. That's bribing.

609
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:01,130
-Give it back.
-Let go of this. Ms. Oh.

610
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,132
Mr. Go.

611
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,385
Just go all out casual
and call me by my name.

612
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,679
Casual? You're way too old for that.

613
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,057
At least leave the cash out.
What's with you?

614
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,976
Look at you. What do you think sales is?

615
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,145
It's winning our clients' hearts,

616
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:18,147
yet you haven't even won
your superior's heart.

617
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:21,150
You should reflect on yourself
and figure out where you should be.

618
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:22,401
Who are you?

619
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,913
-Why? Why are you coming? Go over there.
-Pardon?

620
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,581
There are lots of seats, so go.

621
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,195
All right?

622
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,913
Where's Mr. Kang?
Why isn't he coming back?

623
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,962
What is it?

624
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:25,548
What pictures do you keep taking?

625
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:30,010
Mr. Kang told me
to leave a record of everything,

626
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,762
and I have to write a report too.

627
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,890
But keep it moderate.
Don't you know you're being impolite?

628
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:38,227
You look like a war correspondent.

629
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:43,566
You have no idea what's important
and keep doing superficial things.

630
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:46,986
This is exactly why I'm saying
you aren't salesperson material.

631
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:48,904
Then what?

632
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:53,159
Is the sales process
sliding bribes in secret?

633
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,286
Yes, that's it.

634
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,956
Do you even know what sales is
when you say that?

635
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:03,085
-What do you think is the basics of sales?
-I don't know.

636
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,962
You never told me, so how would I know?

637
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:08,591
-What are the basics of sales, then?
-Why should I tell you?

638
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,676
Who do you think you are?

639
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:16,056
You've only traveled to Pusan a few times
and solved one incident.

640
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,850
Do you suddenly feel important?

641
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:22,730
Now, tell me.
Did you do that? Or was it Mr. Kang?

642
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,651
You can't call that sales
if you didn't do it yourself.

643
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,112
What you did would make you…

644
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,947
We call that an assistant.

645
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,493
Isn't that so, Oh?

646
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,964
I got some beverages here.

647
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:51,258
Have some.

648
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,594
What's wrong?

649
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:56,597
What's wrong?

650
00:41:58,849 --> 00:41:59,850
Ms. Oh, have some.

651
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,353
It's grape flavor.

652
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,277
Mr. Go!

653
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,321
I found some beverages.

654
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,115
Yes, let's go.

655
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,119
Okay. Let's go.

656
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,165
Goodness, here we go.

657
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:37,429
SAWADDEE TRADING

658
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:45,813
Great work, everyone.

659
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,898
You all should freshen up a little.

660
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:51,277
And you'll all go to the club, right?

661
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,572
No, you young people can go. I'll stay in.

662
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,448
I don't need to go, either.

663
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:58,409
Wait.

664
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:04,498
This is a part of your job,
so be here on time.

665
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:08,127
If not, you two can travel
by yourselves starting tomorrow.

666
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:14,883
In that case, I'll come by
to pick you up later.

667
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,802
-Okay. Thank you.
-All right. Thanks.

668
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:05,702
Mr. Kang, you're all dressed up.

669
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:10,290
Well, I feel more comfortable in this
than sweatsuits.

670
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:14,586
-You look a bit--
-A bit awkward, right?

671
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:17,798
The lady gave this to me.

672
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:21,635
-The shoes are uncomfortable too.
-No, it's not that.

673
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:28,976
Did you drop something?

674
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,943
Is that mine?

675
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:48,245
All done.

676
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:54,918
You definitely…

677
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:58,172
Definitely what?

678
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,023
It's not like
I don't know how to dress up.

679
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,817
I've been there and done it all.

680
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:34,458
Hello. Please come in.

681
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,505
Hello.

682
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,657
Over here, Mr. Kang.

683
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:09,993
Come on down.

684
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:13,830
Have a seat. You too, Ms. Oh.

685
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:16,208
Sit over here, Ma-jin.

686
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,838
And all the way in the back,

687
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:24,675
the girl in the classy black dress

688
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,345
is the youngest daughter
of Nihakham Group's chairman.

689
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:31,682
Ha-neul, make sure you mention
Mr. Kang to her, okay?

690
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:47,531
-Hello.
-Hello.

691
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:21,189
-This club is banging.
-Isn't it?

692
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,650
-What's this song?
-It'll be hard for you to pronounce.

693
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,319
"Pood eek tee dai rue plow."

694
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,738
It means, "Let us meet just this once."

695
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,948
-"Pood eek tee dai rue plow"?
-"Dai rue plow."

696
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,658
So why aren't you dancing? Get up.

697
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,493
-Go dance.
-Do you want to see my dance?

698
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,462
-Is she serious?
-Go out there and sing.

699
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,744
I feel like such a fool.

700
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:20,637
What are you doing here?
I wasn't done with my song.

701
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:24,182
I wanted a break. My feet hurt too much.

702
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:25,725
Really?

703
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,855
-Let me see it.
-No. Why? See what?

704
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:33,817
It's okay. What do you mean? I'm fine.

705
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:36,862
-Even your feet are pretty.
-What?

706
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:42,534
-I've been holding it in, but it came out.
-My gosh.

707
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:44,202
One moment.

708
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:47,455
-I'm okay, really.
-But I'm not okay.

709
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:51,167
I'm fine.

710
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:52,377
Your feet are chafed.

711
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,260
Thank you.

712
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:05,056
Okay.

713
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:22,616
Is the work hard?

714
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:27,037
No.

715
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,416
I wouldn't say it's hard.

716
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:37,047
I'm just wondering why I came here.

717
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:42,844
I'm not doing anything.
I only wasted money on the flight.

718
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,393
Ms. Oh.

719
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:52,562
I desperately wanted

720
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:56,191
my father's approval.

721
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:58,360
While I was growing flowers,

722
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:05,492
I kept telling myself I'd show them to him
when they grow bigger and prettier.

723
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:11,998
But the right timing doesn't come
just by sitting and waiting.

724
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:20,465
But I'm sure
the late Mr. Kang already knew.

725
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,094
Exactly.

726
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:30,225
So don't try too hard. I already know you.

727
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:42,487
Okay.

728
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:48,201
Anyway,

729
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:50,787
what were you going to say to me
back at the guest house?

730
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,081
You tried to say something
after "definitely."

731
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,710
I told you that you looked pretty.

732
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:01,339
You definitely look pretty today.

733
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:10,515
-Do you always say people are pretty?
-No, I usually get that compliment.

734
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:15,603
Well, I don't know.

735
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:21,443
I'm not sure if you're pretty,
but you're an excellent singer.

736
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:22,902
How do you sing so well?

737
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,238
-You think so?
-Yes.

738
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:27,115
When did you leave?

739
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:41,296
Yes, that part.

740
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:29,677
EPISODE 8
THE BRIGHT DAYS OF YOUTH

741
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:53,910
Nice.

742
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,791
That hit the spot.

743
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:04,587
I can't get used to the food here.

744
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:09,634
SPICY TUNA

745
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:39,205
Oh, right. I'm here alone.

746
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:03,665
Do I look like him?

747
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,252
I don't think so.

748
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:13,883
What is this?

749
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:16,636
Is that a gun?

750
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:19,180
What has my dad been doing?

751
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:24,978
Time for bed.

752
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,357
What? Who are you?

753
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,442
-Is he a Korean?
-Yes, he's a Korean.

754
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,695
-Wait, who are you?
-Typhoon Company?

755
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:37,532
What's going on?

756
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:39,033
Who are you?

757
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,410
Why are you arresting me?

758
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:42,954
-Ms. Oh!
-What?

759
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:44,831
Why?

760
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,249
Mr. Kang.

761
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:54,340
What?

762
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:55,466
Okay, I'm coming.

763
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:01,514
-What's going on? Hey!
-Are you okay, Ms. Oh?

764
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,266
Why are they doing this without a word?

765
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:04,225
I'll handle this.

766
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:06,519
But why, Mr. Kang?
They won't tell us the reason.

767
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,521
-Don't hold her too tightly.
-What's going on?

768
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,231
-Be gentle.
-Hey!

769
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:11,357
What is it?

770
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,651
-Why are you doing this?
-Ms. Oh!

771
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:16,529
What are you doing?
Did we do something wrong?

772
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:17,655
Wait a moment!

773
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:19,282
-They attacked me!
-So why?

774
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:20,950
-What are you doing?
-Where are we going?

775
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:23,953
-What is it?
-I didn't do anything!

776
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,413
What's going on?

777
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:29,417
Be careful.

778
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:31,919
No, wait!

779
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:39,344
-Okay, fine!
-Where are you taking us?

780
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:41,888
-Where are you taking us?
-Okay, I get it.

781
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:52,857
Are you okay, Ms. Oh?

782
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,026
-I'm fine.
-Are you?

783
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:56,235
Obviously not.

784
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,863
What's going on right now?

785
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:02,867
Just be quiet.
I'm sure there's a misunderstanding.

786
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:05,995
How did you manage
to put on decent clothes?

787
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,749
You need to be in good clothes
especially in these times.

788
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:12,168
Stay alert no matter where you are.

789
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:14,295
Watch what I do.

790
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:39,028
-Pass… What?
-He wants your passport.

791
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:40,363
Passport. Right.

792
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:47,787
No, it's not that.
First of all, why are we here?

793
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,630
What are you saying? Okay.

794
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:02,552
No!

795
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:03,845
Don't use it!

796
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:06,431
No, don't do it. He said no.

797
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:09,350
I'm understanding some of the language.

798
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:11,686
-You're so awesome.
-I'm glad I studied.

799
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:15,898
What are you two doing right now?
You aren't here to take a test. Okay?

800
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:19,944
You guys gave money to an officer.

801
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:22,989
Giving money is bribery.

802
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:26,659
Money? He's talking about money.

803
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,036
Giving money…

804
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,164
-Mr. Go!
-What? What is it?

805
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:34,083
I think that's it. The $50.

806
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:35,626
-Wait.
-What are we going to do?

807
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:37,253
Stop talking nonsense.

808
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:39,172
Why would the police do this over $50?

809
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:41,758
What is it? What about $50?

810
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:43,384
It's not even a big deal.

811
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:45,636
I gave an incentive
to the customs officer. No big deal.

812
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,013
An incense?

813
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:50,183
An incentive.
Incense? Incense is something you burn.

814
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:51,851
It's fine.

815
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:54,729
It was lunch, so I gave him
some lunch money.

816
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:57,398
-It's nothing wrong.
-Just for lunch?

817
01:02:57,482 --> 01:03:00,443
No, he's a civil servant,
so it's considered bribing.

818
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:02,904
Bribing? You can't do that!

819
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:07,200
-Why didn't you stop him?
-I did, but he never listens to me.

820
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,368
It really hurts
when you two are like this.

821
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:12,038
I didn't do this just for my own good.

822
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:12,997
It wasn't for my--

823
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,290
Could you please be quiet?

824
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:15,291
Okay.

825
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:16,209
Stupid ass!

826
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:19,420
-He said, "Be quiet, idiots."
-Yes, Ms. Oh. Please stop.

827
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:21,631
-Stop it.
-Okay. I just understood it.

828
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:27,553
He brought something.

829
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:28,679
-Is that for us?
-Yes.

830
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:37,563
Gosh, I don't think it looks like me.

831
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:42,235
Who's that?
Mr. Kang, it looks a little bit like you.

832
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:44,779
How does that look like me?

833
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:47,073
I mean, in these times,
take responsibility

834
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:49,200
and own up to this like the CEO you are.

835
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:50,743
I have two children to raise.

836
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:55,456
I am the boss, but wait.
This is your mistake.

837
01:03:58,835 --> 01:03:59,794
Is it this guy?

838
01:03:59,877 --> 01:04:01,546
No, it wasn't me.

839
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:04,841
How is this me?
His eyes are smaller than the nostrils.

840
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:07,552
-That's not me.
-You can't do that.

841
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:09,220
My pupils are huge.

842
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:11,514
Your eyes are longer.

843
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:14,767
Look at me, Ms. Oh.
They are sharp and long, yet big, right?

844
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,561
Are they saying this is me?
It's so suspicious.

845
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:17,687
Is it him?

846
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:18,646
This is so not me.

847
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:19,689
Yes. Take him in custody!

848
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:20,690
How is this me?

849
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:21,649
It has to be you.

850
01:04:21,732 --> 01:04:24,026
-Wait, what are they doing?
-What?

851
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,903
-What are you doing?
-Hey!

852
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:27,905
-Let go of him!
-Don't take him!

853
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:29,407
No, you can't take him!

854
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:32,618
-Wait!
-Don't take him!

855
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:34,996
Just me?

856
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:37,206
Come back!

857
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:38,916
What do we do?

858
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:54,098
THE BRIGHT DAYS OF YOUTH

859
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:30,343
TYPHOON FAMILY

860
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:33,429
It says you bribed $10,000, not $50.

861
01:05:33,512 --> 01:05:35,598
Wait, $10,000 equals over 15 million won.

862
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:36,599
Mr. Kang!

863
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:39,143
I saw it happen. This is not right.

864
01:05:39,226 --> 01:05:42,313
What about the meeting with Nihakham Group
as our potential client?

865
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:45,524
This must be why
we haven't received your helmets.

866
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,944
If you fail to explain,
they'll throw them out right away.

867
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:49,236
They'll destroy them.

868
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:51,781
Where did you get this jacket?

869
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:53,324
What are the basics of being a CEO?

870
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:55,952
What would my father tell me to protect?

871
01:05:56,035 --> 01:06:00,373
