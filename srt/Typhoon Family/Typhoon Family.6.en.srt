00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,548
Can you put your eyes on the line?

3
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:50,842
What's wrong?

4
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,302
You scared?

5
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,428
You have to swear

6
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,765
to leave us alone
once you get 100 million won.

7
00:00:58,641 --> 00:00:59,601
What's wrong?

8
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:01,936
You scared?

9
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,575
What's your name?

10
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,285
That's none of your business.

11
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,331
I'm just a trader…

12
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:25,710
from Typhoon Trading.

DEBT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FORM
COLLATERAL: TWO EYEBALLS

00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,150
Damn it!

15
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,245
This is tough.

16
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:20,765
Shall I…

17
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,602
start doing some business?

EPISODE 6
THE LEGEND OF AMBITION

19
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:43,913
Tae-poong!

20
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,457
Hey!

21
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,042
Hey, Tae-poong! You punk.

22
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,713
How the heck could you just run off
and leave me with this guy?

23
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:52,755
Gosh.

24
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:56,467
I got scared after seeing a loan shark
for the first time in my life.

25
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,427
Scared?

26
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,014
If you get scared twice,
you'll level the whole damn block!

27
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:04,767
-What now?
-What?

28
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:10,481
I'm sure he's thanking you.
No one on earth is like you.

29
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:12,775
You should've come yesterday.

30
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,778
I was beaten up badly yesterday.

31
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,948
Darn it! I'm so done with this!

32
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,743
Jeez.

33
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,745
Yesterday?

34
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:28,541
This is too much.
Why did I get caught up in this?

35
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,378
Hey, let's at least drop him off
at a hospital before we go.

36
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,379
I can't do this.

37
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,258
One, two, three!

38
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,971
Can you take me home
instead of to the hospital?

39
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,822
-Here?
-The lights are on.

40
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,325
One moment, please.

41
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,412
I got…

42
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,501
How do I look?

43
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:15,380
I don't look like
I've been beaten up, do I?

44
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:20,385
Even people about 100 m away from you
can clearly tell you were beaten up.

45
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,928
-You're all swollen.
-Yes.

46
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:22,971
Is that so?

47
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,556
That's not good.

48
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:30,144
By any chance,
do you have any makeup I can use?

49
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,897
I don't. I'm not wearing any makeup.

50
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,775
I may not look like it,
but I never use foundation.

51
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:38,319
Don't be so harsh, and let me borrow some.

52
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,822
I can probably scrape some off your face.

53
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:43,157
How dare you? I'll break your fingers.

54
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,701
Is she your daughter?

55
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,578
She's not asleep, is she?

56
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,915
I can't spend the night out tonight.

57
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,751
What do I do now?

58
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,255
-Give me a moment. Let's see.
-What?

59
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:02,093
If you had a kid,
you should've just said so.

60
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,638
-Careful.
-It must hurt.

61
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,308
-Be gentle. Okay.
-I'll put thick makeup on you.

62
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,530
Daddy!

63
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,366
Oh, gosh.

64
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:30,997
I'm so sorry
for leaving you here all alone, Bo-ram.

65
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,207
It's okay. I'm a brave girl.

66
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:38,463
Anyway, what is this?
Christmas has passed long ago.

67
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:43,593
I wanted to give you a present,
so I came here on Rudolph. Here it is.

68
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,472
Who did you take after
and become so smart?

69
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:50,683
-I took after my daddy.
-Hey, don't say that.

70
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,063
Do you want to blow this out, Bo-ram?

71
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,652
You're Uncle Crazy Tae-poong, right?

72
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:06,532
Uncle Crazy Tae-poong?
Yes, that's me, Uncle Crazy Tae-poong.

73
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,994
-You're good-looking.
-I am?

74
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,245
Thank you.

75
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:16,876
Thank you so much for this.

76
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,879
Sure.

77
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,256
Should we eat cake?

78
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,508
-Yes.
-Let's eat it.

79
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,718
Let's eat cake. Let me bring some dishes.

80
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,679
Daddy, this is so cute.

81
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,098
-Is it?
-Yes.

82
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:51,869
Hello?

83
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:53,621
Were you asleep?

84
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:54,664
No.

85
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,084
Are you done with work?

86
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:01,504
Yes, I'm taking the bus back now.

87
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,464
Good work.

88
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:06,425
Well…

89
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:09,804
Ms. Oh.

90
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,347
Yes, please speak.

91
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,015
Well…

92
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,979
Is there no sentiment in this work?

93
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,690
-What?
-You know, sentiment.

94
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:25,153
Like love, justice,

95
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,448
or faith, something of that sort.

96
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,743
Never mind.

97
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,831
Don't I sound like a fool for asking this?

98
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,417
Those can't even be seen.

99
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:41,836
Mr. Kang.

100
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,340
Will you look up at the sky?

101
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,180
Do you see the stars?

102
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:54,724
I don't.

103
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,768
It's way too cloudy.

104
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:02,148
Does that mean they don't exist
just because you don't see them now?

105
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,281
You're right.

106
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,367
Please return safely.

107
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,924
Why are you smiling?

108
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,594
-What?
-Why are you smiling alone?

109
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:32,970
Don't mind me. Oh, right.

110
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,765
Turn on the TV.
Let's watch the New Year's bell ceremony.

111
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:39,227
That ceremony happens every single year.
Why do you have to see it?

112
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,020
You always want to watch it!

113
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:56,118
TICKETS

114
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,537
Wait…

115
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,039
What?

116
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,250
EXPRESS BUS WINDOW CLOSED
FOR 1997 AS OF 23:00

117
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:16,514
-We're witnessing a historic moment.
-Telemarketing?

118
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,475
-We're at Bosingak for the ceremony.
-Make money while chatting?

119
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,394
Once the Bosingak Bell strikes 33 times…

120
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,273
-We will now welcome 1998.
-A skillful cook?

121
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:28,150
-There're 20 people from different fields.
-That's me.

122
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,819
-They'll help us ring the bell.
-What else?

123
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:35,491
Among them, there is a hero
who comforted us the most this year.

124
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,827
It's Coach Cha Bum-kun
of the national soccer team.

125
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,706
Look at you. Your handsome face is ruined.

126
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,083
We're about to say
goodbye to the awfully eventful 1997

127
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:48,921
as everyone here anticipates
and dreams of a better tomorrow.

128
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,593
May only warm laughter
and good things fill our new year.

129
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,261
Is that helpful?

130
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,555
-We're at Bosingak.
-This keeps moisture in my skin.

131
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,557
-It is full of passion here.
-Look.

132
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,058
I'm just hoping the bell rings soon.

133
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:04,103
-Grandma, they're striking the bell.
-Ten seconds left.

134
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,440
-Eight, seven, six…
-Eight, seven, six…

135
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,191
-Five, four…
-…five, four,

136
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,278
-three, two, one…
-Don't eat it, Grandma! It's dirty!

137
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:17,783
Happy New Year, Grandma!

138
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,662
-Wonderful.
-You always get excited about that.

139
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:25,166
Why can't they hit it harder?
It's always a very low ding.

140
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,251
-It's so frustrating.
-It's cold.

141
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,794
1998 CALENDAR
HAPPY NEW YEAR

142
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,546
1
JANUARY

143
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,465
Did you eat a piece of cucumber?

144
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,677
The nights seemed
especially longer this winter.

145
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:42,058
The deeper the night is, the sooner
the sun will rise in the morning.

146
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,886
It was so nearby.

147
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:20,679
The sentiment.

148
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:36,737
Ms. Oh!

149
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,794
-You should've gone home to get some rest.
-No, I had a good night's sleep.

150
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,504
-Did you?
-Yes. Oh, right!

151
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,096
Were the products not there?

152
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,099
-It's okay. We just--
-No.

153
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,436
I got the products.

154
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,273
Over there.

155
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,257
There's quite a bit.

156
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,926
-A bit?
-Yes.

157
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,187
Yes, just a bit.

158
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,606
How many is a bit?

159
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:58,569
-It should be about five…
-Five hundred pairs?

160
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,406
More like 6,500.

161
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,744
Is this it? It's not as bad as I thought.

162
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,121
-It's that way, the back alley.
-Is that so?

163
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,040
-Is there coffee?
-What now?

164
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,543
I always have coffee in the morning.

165
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,795
Wait, how many pairs?

166
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,298
-Hey, we brought 7,000. Let's go.
-If not, I'll buy some.

167
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,383
-No, there's coffee around here.
-It's 7,000?

168
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,802
I like the brand Rich Aroma,
but you don't drink that.

169
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,931
I like that because I'm a fan
of the actor, Ahn Sung-ki.

170
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:27,932
-Are you?
-Yes.

171
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,934
It may seem like a lot,

172
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,478
but we can sell everything
in three months, right?

173
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,190
We're going to be rich now.

174
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,488
You must be out of your mind!

175
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:48,452
Ms. Oh!

176
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,253
The more I get to know coffee,

177
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,715
the more I become drawn
to this rich aroma.

178
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:04,927
Rich Aroma.

179
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,682
Coffee is best in the American style.

180
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:14,478
-What's the ratio?
-Two coffee, four sugar, and four cream.

181
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,856
Americans take their coffee sweet.

182
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,569
-Is that so?
-Stop complaining. It's past due.

183
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,153
Pay me back by tomorrow, you punk!

184
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,950
All these infantile punks
are talking total bullshit to me.

185
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,081
Infantile…

186
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,876
I have no idea what she just said.

187
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:47,553
CPU, 116 MB. Memory, 1.2 GB. Hard disk…

188
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,889
You're running low on the hard disk space.

189
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,058
-How did you know?
-I was formerly an engineer.

190
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:54,935
Did you major in engineering?

191
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,688
I went to the Maritime University,
not engineering.

192
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:58,898
Maritime University?

193
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:04,862
I studied ships and boats,
mostly large vessels, like Captain Nemo.

194
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,866
Captain Harlock is the best captain.

195
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,828
No, the best captain out there
is Spock of Star Trek.

196
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,418
Live long and prosper.

197
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,338
Do you know this?

198
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,465
-Of course, I do!
-What about this?

199
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:32,139
-How do you know this?
-I'm a huge fan of Star Trek.

200
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:36,101
-By any chance, are you on Cheonrian?
-Just a little.

201
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,562
It's great to meet you.

202
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,688
What now?

203
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:44,944
How is 500 the same as 7,000?
This is such an absurd amount.

204
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:48,197
Construction projects have stopped,
including the airport. Who'll buy those?

205
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,491
We should export those.

206
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:53,035
That's even harder to do
than selling domestically!

207
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:57,998
Why do you think that way?
This means we have more opportunities.

208
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,418
-Opportunities?
-Yes, opportunities.

209
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,922
Good luck with that opportunity then.

210
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,549
-Wait.
-Hey.

211
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,259
-Mi-seon!
-Wait…

212
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,929
I knew this would happen.

213
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,723
Hey, Mi-seon!

214
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,732
I've never seen
Ms. Oh that furious before.

215
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,486
Let me know if there's anything I can do.

216
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,405
Close the door and leave.

217
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,739
Shall we?

218
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:39,957
-Anyway, when will others come to work?
-This is everyone.

219
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,960
-This is it?
-Yes.

220
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,546
It's just Mr. Kang and Ms. Oh.

221
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,299
-What about you?
-Me?

222
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:51,802
I'm family.

223
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:52,886
A freeloader.

224
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,852
Family.

225
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,771
Freeloader.

226
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:24,001
SELF-INSPECTION

227
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:46,023
You must've been a rich lady
who used to live in Gangnam.

228
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:52,279
-Well, I just look rich.
-You're really bad.

229
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,656
You're so bad at your job.

230
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,701
I've run this factory for 20 years,

231
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,039
and you were the first assistant who left
after finishing a box of bandages.

232
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,504
Are you firing me?

233
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:14,134
Come half an hour early starting tomorrow.

234
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:17,471
Even if you do, you still won't finish
half of what others can.

235
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,153
What can I get with this?

236
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:44,832
Hey.

237
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,876
Do you work here?

238
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,091
Hey, do you want me
to make you something delicious?

239
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,178
In return, you have to keep a secret
between you and me.

240
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,139
A secret?

241
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:08,313
Does that upset you that much?
Why are you so upset?

242
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,482
Worried the company will go under?

243
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,694
Then come and work for me.
I'll pay you twice as much.

244
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,156
Mr. Kang made this decision by himself.

245
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,241
So what?

246
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,493
-Do you think he disregarded you?
-No.

247
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,831
Gosh, Mi-seon.

248
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,463
What did you lose?

249
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,968
Tae-poong lost everything
except for the name of the business.

250
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:41,763
What did you bet in this business
to act like you're equal to him?

251
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:47,144
Yes, what he did was wrong.

252
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,147
However, work is different.

253
00:19:55,402 --> 00:20:00,282
SAVING ENERGY WILL TURN INTO ABUNDANCE

254
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,993
Gosh, come on.

255
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,833
Where did Ms. Oh go?

256
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,553
Yes?

257
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:35,275
-You should go if you're that worried.
-I'm not.

258
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,031
Anyway, are you sure about this?

259
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:45,494
-It gets freezing cold here.
-I even slept at the factory.

260
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,579
This feels like a hotel in comparison.

261
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:53,627
I think it'll be better
if you came home with me.

262
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,087
Gosh.

263
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:59,716
If I impose on you any more,
I won't be able to face you again.

264
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,927
I'll be fine. You should go.

265
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,061
Please use this if it gets colder.
You'll find what you need in the pantry.

266
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,399
Hey…

267
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,530
Never mind. Goodbye.

268
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,324
Good night.

269
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,034
-I'll turn the lights off.
-Okay.

270
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,397
So why do you work?

271
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,030
Be honest.

272
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,451
-For a man?
-No.

273
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,370
I work…

274
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,916
for my dream.

275
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,001
Your dream?

276
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:24,926
Dream.

277
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:30,182
-Make sure you achieve it.
-Okay.

278
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,267
-Move it.
-Right. I'm sorry.

279
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,354
-Goodbye, then.
-Bye.

280
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,860
Keep driving straight.

281
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,082
Ms. Oh!

282
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,301
Where have you been?
I was worried. Are you all right?

283
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,512
I'm not.

284
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,514
I'm sorry.

285
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,017
I promised not to make you mad, but…

286
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,360
Wait, I have to use that.

287
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,362
-What?
-My wish coupon.

288
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,696
Sorry?

289
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:33,954
WISH COUPON

290
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:55,600
I wish Ms. Oh wouldn't be mad… No.

291
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:01,231
I wish she would accept the apology
of Kang Tae-poong.

292
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:06,653
You can't take it back.

293
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,160
Fine.

294
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:19,791
But promise me
you'll never act on your own again.

295
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:21,710
I promise.

296
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,297
Jeez.

297
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:30,093
Is there anything else
you haven't told me yet?

298
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,013
Are you going to pull out
30,000 pairs of shoes tomorrow?

299
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,432
Goodness, hardly.
I have nothing like that now.

300
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,394
Well…

301
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,152
Actually, I…

302
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,571
Can you put your eyes on the line?

303
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,490
Leave us alone
once you get 100 million won.

304
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:58,663
I signed off my eyes to a loan shark--

305
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,290
One more thing.

306
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,793
You cannot get hurt.

307
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,923
That's all I need from you.
If you remain healthy and well,

308
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,300
I promise I won't flip out.

309
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,680
I'm sorry. What about your eyes?

310
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:18,308
I did a staring contest with a loan shark.

311
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,185
I see.

312
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,104
-Did you win?
-Yes, of course, I did.

313
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,564
-I never lose.
-Is that so?

314
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:27,901
Hey…

315
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:34,366
Never mind. Goodbye.

316
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:39,496
Ms. Oh, you should go first.
I left something in the office.

317
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,581
-You should go, okay?
-Yes, okay.

318
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,793
-Thanks a lot.
-Sure.

319
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,796
Be careful. Don't run! Good grief.

320
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,006
I just told him not to run.

321
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:05,730
Oh, man.

322
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,594
Darn it. Come on!

323
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,687
SEOUL EXPRESS BUS TERMINAL

324
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:55,905
Mr. Park.

325
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,449
I'm sorry.

326
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:08,752
Mr. Park!

327
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,047
I knew it.

328
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:17,093
It's not even for Pusan, but Wando Island.

329
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:18,553
Wando Island?

330
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:20,347
Come with me.

331
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,141
-Mr. Park!
-Get him!

332
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,727
I'll pay for him later!

333
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,022
Darn it!

334
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,112
Jeez. Come on.

335
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,621
Seriously?

336
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:57,342
I was the fastest runner in my class!

337
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,058
-Hey!
-Wait!

338
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,434
-Let go of me, you punk.
-No!

339
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,436
-We need to talk.
-Let go.

340
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,896
Let go of me!

341
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:16,194
So? Where are you going?

342
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:26,371
I couldn't ask you before,
but come with me, Mr. Kang.

343
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:30,708
There are so many isles
down in the Wando Island area

344
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,711
that people can't find you
once you decide to hide.

345
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:38,007
The world would've changed
after we spent a few years there.

346
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,218
Why would I hide?

347
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,263
I didn't do anything wrong.

348
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:45,598
My goodness.

349
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:51,938
I saw that Typhoon Trading
is also about to go under.

350
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,526
So why did you get so nosy?

351
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:59,279
I thought you had some money
when you blurted out something

352
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,739
about 100 million won or whatever.

353
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,241
But all you have is that one female staff.

354
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,118
How is that a decent business?

355
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,537
At the very least,
I had 50 people on my payroll,

356
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,372
and I still couldn't make it.

357
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:10,832
Exporting?

358
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,877
Do you think I haven't thought of that?

359
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,338
We can't compete
with China in this day and age!

360
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:21,217
They sell whatever they have
at less than half our price in the market.

361
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:24,095
How will you sell those in three months
and make 100 million won?

362
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,184
Forget everything else.

363
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,522
What about Bo-ram?

364
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:43,823
I sent her to my wife's family.
She'll be safer there.

365
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,325
What about your staff at Shoe Park?

366
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:50,079
So? What about them
who're working hard in this cold season?

367
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,498
What can I do?

368
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,126
Pusan is full of the unemployed.

369
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,587
What about Shoe Park?

370
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,674
What about 30 years of your life?

371
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,345
What about your patents?!

372
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,516
Mr. Kang.

373
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,395
Do you know
what those loan sharks are like?

374
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,856
You saw me that day.

375
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:21,444
They run their business
by selling people's bodies.

376
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:24,489
I'd rather die
than to get dragged back there.

377
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:28,535
Gosh, then just go and die!

378
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:30,995
What?

379
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:34,332
But before you do that,
we should try to sell these first!

380
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,793
You haven't tried anything yet!

381
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,380
Right? I'm going to sell these!

382
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,926
Are you not confident? But I am!

383
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:46,553
Confidence?

384
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,681
Confidence isn't enough to pull this off.

385
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:52,433
Everyone is shutting down
construction sites.

386
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,979
And you can't make 100 million won
by selling these to China or Saudi Arabia.

387
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:58,648
Who will you sell them to?

388
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,318
Where will you sell them?

389
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,030
That's…

390
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,659
IMPORTED FLOWERS FROM EUROPE

391
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,744
-Over there. Look.
-Where?

392
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,830
It went by.

393
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:15,999
What went by?

394
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,253
Ready?

395
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:21,629
-Yes, I'm ready.
-Okay.

396
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,132
Mr. Kang, you can just walk up on the top.

397
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,889
Get ready.

398
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,356
Press the red button.

399
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,484
Don't worry. I'm a veteran
in the Cheonrian Quiz Room.

400
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:47,739
What did Mak-dong
give to Mi-ae in Green Fish?

401
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,699
-A scarf.
-I knew it.

402
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:50,992
-And the color?
-Red.

403
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:59,584
Why did you suddenly jump off?
I haven't even taken the lens cover off.

404
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,252
-What?
-One more time.

405
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,129
Jump off after I say, "Ready, cue."

406
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:04,547
All right. Here we go.

407
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:11,429
I haven't even pressed the record button.

408
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,890
What's with you?

409
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:17,852
-Give that to me. I'll do it better.
-No, this is my personal camcorder.

410
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,272
KITT, let's do it over.

411
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,316
-We can do this.
-From the top.

412
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:24,984
Get ready.

413
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,320
All right. Get ready.

414
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,366
-Cue!
-Shoe Park Pro!

415
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,052
-Did it go well?
-Yes!

416
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:56,307
Hey, are you hurt? You're hurt!

417
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:57,934
Let me see.

418
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,144
You're bleeding.

419
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,233
-Let me get some medicine.
-Why didn't you press stop sooner?

420
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:08,069
-You ended up getting him hurt.
-People can make mistakes.

421
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,904
It's all right. Great job.

422
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,572
He did a great job. Don't be harsh.

423
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,536
-Just hold on for a second.
-Okay.

424
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,666
-One moment.
-Okay.

425
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,546
Hold on a little more.

426
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,050
-You pressed it.
-I'm sorry.

427
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:39,267
-You need to be careful.
-Okay, I'll be careful.

428
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,436
Aren't you hungry?

429
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,312
-I'm starving.
-Right?

430
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,273
-Buns.
-I got some steamed buns.

431
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:56,200
I really like this flavor.
Thank you so much.

432
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:00,997
Wait, don't you think
the size difference is way too big?

433
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,625
I like these too.

434
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:09,213
-Eat up. Thanks.
-Okay, enjoy.

435
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,559
It's good.

436
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,855
-You know.
-Yes?

437
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:29,692
Do we have to try so hard
with the video and all?

438
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:33,780
I want to show them
our goods and our good taste

439
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,156
since we're traders.

440
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:40,453
Just wait. You'll live to see a day
when people watch everything in videos.

441
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:44,665
People won't be able to resist buying
our product when they see it.

442
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:51,672
I envy you for the ability
to instantly think like that.

443
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,842
What do you mean?

444
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:59,222
You'll have to perform
the most difficult task.

445
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,559
-Thanks.
-Sure.

446
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:12,318
TYPHOON TRADING

447
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,827
You cannot compromise your safety.

448
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:28,835
-I'm going to sell these at full price.
-How?

449
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:36,843
UNITED STATES

450
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,386
EUROPE

451
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,554
Like this.

452
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,224
Are these all for America?

453
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,475
What's inside?

454
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,602
Promotional material for safety shoes.

455
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,856
-Let's end everything here.
-No, look.

456
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,233
The key is the payroll cost.

457
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,110
-The payroll cost?
-Yes.

458
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,487
You saw those roses
at the Express Bus Terminal, right?

459
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,655
They came from Europe,

460
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:00,992
so there must be the logistics cost,
but those are expensive as is!

461
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:04,328
-It was nice meeting you.
-Why? Because their wage is higher!

462
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,415
-Please don't leave--
-Don't hold me back.

463
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,762
-What are you doing?
-Hello, sir. I have a brochure.

464
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,764
I'm not a solicitor. It's just a brochure.

465
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,892
You can't leave these here. Please leave.

466
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,102
All right.

467
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:32,190
Asia still has much lower labor costs,
but it's exploding with manpower.

468
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,150
Safety laws still aren't enough.

469
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,528
What do you think
it's like in America or Europe?

470
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,948
They'll have to pay medical expenses
and recruit new people.

471
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,451
And if things go haywire,
they'll end up with lawsuits.

472
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:48,039
In such times, these shoes
will come in handy and prevent everything.

473
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,186
FOR THE HIGHEST QUALITY

474
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:21,734
It comes with five patents.

475
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,117
This place is so clean.

476
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,619
It's nice.

477
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:39,502
Ms. Oh.

478
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,754
-Ms. Oh.
-Yes?

479
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,839
Did you not get enough sleep?

480
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,676
I was too nervous.
I had to memorize English lines.

481
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,928
One second.

482
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:55,726
Are you nervous?

483
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:59,105
I'm not nervous at all.

484
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:03,192
I guess it's a difficult task,

485
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:07,988
but you're the best trader in our company.

486
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:12,159
All done.

487
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:15,913
You got this.

488
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:17,998
I got this.

489
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:21,085
-Let's go.
-Okay. Thanks.

490
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:36,869
Hello.

491
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:38,913
I'm leaving first.

492
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:39,872
See you tomorrow.

493
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,418
-Did I keep you waiting?
-No, not for too long.

494
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,045
Aren't you cold?

495
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,589
-Are you cold?
-I am.

496
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,592
My hands are freezing.

497
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:54,637
One second.

498
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:00,851
What? Why do you always give me this?

499
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,145
Because I can't hold your hand yet.

500
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,400
But this gets cold quickly.

501
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:11,487
-It's okay. I have more.
-Forget it.

502
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:16,617
This way?

503
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,452
This way.

504
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,915
I have to get back to work now.

505
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,918
Okay. Bye.

506
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:27,586
Wait.

507
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,925
Can you leave me a message?

508
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:36,428
I think I'll want to hear your voice.

509
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:37,846
Well…

510
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,598
I'll think about it.

511
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,727
I'll go now, then. What?

512
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,315
You know,

513
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,443
do you think
they'll call and sign the deal?

514
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:52,570
Of course.

515
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,781
And you did such a great job today.

516
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:57,825
I'm not sure.

517
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:01,370
-I feel too uneasy.
-It's all right.

518
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,831
This is just our beginning.

519
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,626
-You're right.
-Oh, my.

520
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:11,547
She's smiling. Does she like Tae-poong?

521
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,508
Wait. I know that voice.

522
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:31,108
Right. I had a present for you.
I almost forgot.

523
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:33,360
-Let me get it.
-A present?

524
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,196
It better not be
something like paper cranes.

525
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:44,496
I made 999 cranes,
and you have to make the last one.

526
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,332
That way, your wish will come true.

527
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,544
My wish is to marry someone rich.

528
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,130
Sure. Make a wish and let me know.

529
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,175
I can be the man you want.

530
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,559
Don't bring this

531
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,270
when you come next time.

532
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,903
What are you doing? Oh, my.

533
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:24,828
See you tomorrow.

534
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,375
Okay. See you tomorrow.
And the day after that!

535
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,044
And next week and next year!

536
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,420
Let's keep seeing each other!

537
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,214
Good night!

538
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:39,760
What's going on?

539
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:42,596
-Is this a special day?
-It's not a special day.

540
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,598
I just made some side dishes. That's all.

541
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,975
-Eat up.
-Goodness.

542
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:51,689
Wait.

543
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,109
-What happened to your hands?
-Oh, nothing.

544
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:58,946
I'm just not used to doing chores at home.

545
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,326
Even if that's the case, how…

546
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,206
It's good.

547
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:12,793
-Be careful.
-Eat up, okay?

548
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,461
It's good, so eat up.

549
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:20,634
Eat up, Beom. Take a big bite.

550
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:24,304
-You should eat, Mom. He's doing fine.
-I'm eating too.

551
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,431
Here.

552
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:31,228
I'm a pretty good cook.

553
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,898
-Eat up.
-Okay.

554
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:42,239
EXPORT TO EUROPE

555
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:51,415
LIST OF COMPANIES
USA

556
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:56,128
EXPORTS TO EUROPE INCREASE BY 10%

557
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,390
Hey, something's coming.

558
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,521
-"Ecnarf…"
-To France.

559
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,816
-Right. To France?
-France.

560
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,359
What's this?

561
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,070
-It's for foot volleyball.
-Jeez.

562
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:30,704
-It's this one, Mr. Kang.
-Right.

563
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,919
Hello, you've reached Typhoon Trading.

564
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:57,147
Yes, thank you! Goodbye!

565
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,900
What did they say?

566
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,485
I think we got a deal.

567
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,153
-We did?
-We got it! My gosh!

568
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,614
-We did?
-Yes, we got it!

569
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:08,367
I don't know how!
My heart is racing so fast!

570
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,494
-Yes!
-We got it!

571
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,120
My gosh. We did it!

572
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:50,033
Dad, I sold something for the first time.

573
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:54,955
Why does this feel so good?

574
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:19,313
Worthwhile…

575
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,527
SHARING GOOD NEWS

576
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:39,833
Worthwhile.

577
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:50,761
Mr. Researcher.

578
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:00,729
Some snacks for you.

579
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,444
Thanks.

580
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:12,991
Goodbye, then.

581
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:41,269
TYPHOON TRADING

582
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:43,897
These are the documents
for export permits,

583
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,774
so give it
to the shipping company or whatever.

584
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:47,776
Okay, then.

585
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:49,611
These will leave in two days?

586
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:52,280
I don't even work here,
so you can't make me work.

587
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,615
Five hours of time online.

588
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,954
Let me know after you file it by 6:00 p.m.

589
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:01,206
-I'll page you if any problem arises.
-Okay.

590
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,710
I'll be there after inspecting
the 2,000 pairs in the Hwaseong factory.

591
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:07,629
-Was it Hongshin Company?
-Yes, she's throwing a party.

592
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,297
Do you want to join us, Mr. Bae?

593
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:11,717
No, I also have a crazy party to attend.

594
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:14,261
-See you tonight.
-See you.

595
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:20,809
-Are you starting now?
-Yes, please check the time.

596
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:25,272
It was five hours.
You have until 1:10 p.m.

597
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,190
Let's drop ten minutes
and start at 8:00 a.m.

598
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:45,751
What?

599
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:48,962
What do you mean,
you can't load our shoes now?

600
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:50,756
Are you kidding me?

601
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:54,426
-Where's Tae-poong now?
-He went straight to the shipping company.

602
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:57,512
This is driving me crazy.

603
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:02,642
What do you mean the shipping company
canceled the shipment?

604
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:07,522
What? Typhoon Trading is on a blacklist?

605
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,649
Have you lost your mind?

606
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,651
ANNOUNCEMENT: SHIPPING BLACKLIST

607
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:15,655
-Why are we blacklisted?
-I don't know the reason.

608
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:20,577
These are to leave in two days.
You can't just cancel it like this.

609
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:24,039
We just received an order,
so we don't have a choice.

610
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:27,417
We won't have enough time
to find a new shipping company.

611
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,504
Can you please help us out?
I'm begging you.

612
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:35,550
There's no use in doing this.
I can't help you. I don't have any power.

613
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:37,427
Who's this punk?

614
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,304
-Hello, sir.
-Why is this fraud here?

615
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:42,891
What's going on?

616
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,392
Mr. Vice CEO.

617
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:47,145
Do you remember Typhoon Trading
I mentioned earlier?

618
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:49,189
He's the guy.

619
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,274
Last time, he scammed us
with the quantity,

620
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:55,654
and this time,
he even stole products from loan sharks.

621
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:57,155
No, sir.

622
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:01,159
I'm not sure what you heard from him,
but we didn't do that.

623
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:03,954
Please let us load the products
as you have promised,

624
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:05,997
and then we can undo the misunderstanding.

625
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:08,375
Why don't we head
to the raw fish restaurant?

626
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,418
I made a reservation
at a phenomenal place.

627
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:13,880
It won't do your ears any good
to hear out a sham like him.

628
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,842
Mr. Vice CEO,
please hear me out just once.

629
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:20,554
I would've been in big trouble
if it hadn't been for you, Mr. Pyo.

630
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,222
Where's the restaurant again?

631
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,765
-Let me lead the way.
-Goodbye, sir!

632
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,893
-Let's go, sir.
-Where is it?

633
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:27,894
Goodbye, sir.

634
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,981
Will you leave now? Goodness gracious.

635
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:35,819
You also know the punk
at Pyo Merchant Marine, right?

636
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,612
He's just no good.

637
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,155
Yes.

638
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,619
I talked to Ms. Oh.

639
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:47,622
But it looks like
there's no way around this.

640
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:51,418
I looked up ways to ship it via plane,
but that'll cost much more.

641
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:54,588
I can't believe these jerks
stopped you from shipping these out!

642
00:52:57,173 --> 00:52:59,467
Where are you going? Hey!

643
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,303
Where are you going, Tae-poong?

644
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:03,889
What's he going to do?
What will he do with these?

645
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:16,985
This is fun.

646
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,908
Jeez. That startled me.

647
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:46,848
What an idiot.

648
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:03,865
What do you think?
It's stronger than your head, isn't it?

649
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:06,868
I really love these.

650
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,207
You crazy punk.

651
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:14,334
Didn't you know I was crazy?

652
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,921
You know how people would come out on TV

653
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:21,508
and say things like, "This work
or this product is like my child"?

654
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,343
I never knew what that meant.

655
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:27,138
But these feel that way to me.

656
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,768
It's the first ever product I've sold.

657
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:35,814
They feel like my own children.

658
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,026
So what, you punk?

659
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,616
Do whatever else you can.

660
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,869
But the next time,

661
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,455
what breaks won't be this window.

662
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:55,333
It'll be

663
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,003
right up here.

664
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,091
And Jeon Sa-dok loses.

665
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:06,886
Let's go, my baby.

666
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:15,311
Jeon Sa-dok loses?

667
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:23,319
Darn it!

668
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:29,200
This is bad.
Those should've been loaded by now.

669
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:33,204
Even if we find another company,
Pyo won't let it happen.

670
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:36,166
Mr. Park will be devastated
if he finds out.

671
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,753
So what's your plan?

672
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:50,180
Of course…

673
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:53,892
I do have a plan.

674
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:55,185
What's with you?

675
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:57,896
Why do you seem so off?

676
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,405
This isn't water! It's alcohol!

677
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:08,698
Hey, this is alcohol!

678
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,241
What are you talking about?

679
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:12,619
Oh, my.

680
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,996
Hey, I left alcohol in there
to wash tripe.

681
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,456
How did it end up there?

682
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:19,918
You know, I always have a plan.

683
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,215
Now, listen.

684
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:30,428
I'll take the shoes and tie everything up.

685
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:32,013
-Tie them up?
-Tie them up.

686
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:36,601
Then I'll put them on my huge shoulders.

687
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:37,936
-I'll do that.
-Okay.

688
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:41,898
I'll swim freestyle or breaststroke

689
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:44,567
to cross the Pacific.

690
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,737
Then I'll do the backstroke
to cross the Atlantic.

691
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,614
My goodness!

692
00:56:53,868 --> 00:57:00,333
I was a former swimmer
at the YWCY baby sports team.

693
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:08,800
You held out for a while.

694
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,773
Jeez!

695
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,608
Use your legs a little, you punk.

696
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:32,699
When did you get here, Mr. Park?

697
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:36,327
Did you hear the news?

698
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:41,416
What can he do?

699
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:45,044
-He did his best.
-Let's go.

700
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:48,423
-Ms. Jung.
-Yes?

701
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:51,885
How long does it take
to get to Wando Island from here?

702
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,595
Wando Island? Why?

703
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:57,056
We should save this young man.

704
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,896
I'm telling you, use your legs!

705
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:03,938
We're almost there.

706
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:06,357
-Where?
-Pull yourself together!

707
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,734
I've walked for too long.

708
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:09,652
Gosh.

709
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,029
The lights are on.

710
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:13,406
Is Bo-ram still up waiting for you?

711
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:17,827
Thank you
for showing concern for Bo-ram too.

712
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,747
Bo-ram!

713
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:24,876
Wait.

714
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:28,463
-Sir, why are you doing this?
-Why didn't you come sooner, you idiot?

715
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:29,422
What are you doing?

716
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,174
You're late.

717
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:32,967
Don't touch her.

718
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,554
-She'll wake up.
-Do you like kids?

719
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:39,474
I don't.

720
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:42,435
Hey, how dare you come here?

721
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,478
Ms. Jung.

722
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:45,647
Am I not allowed to be here?

723
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,066
I like it here.

724
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,155
So you couldn't load your stuff?

725
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,286
What about my money?

726
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:07,252
Have you been tailing me?

727
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,212
I know everything
that's happening in Pusan.

728
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:14,300
You know what I like?

729
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,471
Those sparkly eyes of yours.

730
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,474
They seem so familiar.

731
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,687
Was it here?

732
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:29,732
They'll be mine in a month.

733
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:34,445
Keep them safe.

734
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:39,993
What's he talking about?

735
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,078
Ms. Oh.

736
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,289
Who's she?

737
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,833
I am Senior Staff Oh Mi-seon
of Typhoon Trading.

738
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:51,087
Is the girl yours?

739
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,382
May I ask you to elaborate
on what you just said?

740
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:11,399
DEBT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FORM
COLLATERAL: TWO EYEBALLS

741
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:25,455
And you're serious?

742
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,916
I never tell jokes.

743
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:33,921
Okay.

744
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,217
Ms. Oh.

745
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:44,807
Ms. Oh.

746
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,353
Wait up, Ms. Oh.

747
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:54,859
-Where are you going at this hour?
-To Seoul. I'll find a way.

748
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:56,986
I'm sorry. I can explain.

749
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:59,238
-I was going to tell you, but--
-Mr. Kang.

750
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:01,699
Are you serious?

751
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:03,993
What do you mean?

752
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:07,789
Do you think everything we're doing
and have done is a joke?

753
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:11,751
Are you saying the work I did was a joke?

754
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,002
It wasn't?

755
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:19,217
Then what were you thinking
when you signed that form?

756
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:22,553
-Did it make any sense to you?
-I get what you mean.

757
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:26,182
But Mr. Park was in real danger!

758
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:34,190
So what?

759
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:38,861
Did you pity him?
Did you want to help him and look cool?

760
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:41,656
All right. Everything's great.

761
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:44,200
But you should've done that personally.

762
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:46,953
You went there to find our product
as the CEO of Typhoon Trading!

763
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,080
And what? Did you go there to play a hero?

764
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:53,876
Play a hero?

765
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,130
If you're going to be emotional,
there's no point to doing all this.

766
01:01:58,005 --> 01:01:58,881
No.

767
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:01,592
It's not just about money.

768
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:05,138
What was it like after Mr. Kang passed?
How could you sign yourself away again?

769
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:07,849
Then Typhoon Trading and I
would've lost the CEO twice.

770
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:09,767
Has it crossed your mind? Was it so easy?

771
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:13,646
How am I going to trust
a CEO like that and continue to work here?

772
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:18,151
We're not a rescue organization.

773
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:20,069
We're a trading company!

774
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:25,032
You have no idea
what's the most important to us.

775
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:38,212
What do you think
is the most important to us?

776
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:40,423
We're a trading company,
so it's making money,

777
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:43,342
paying off debts, and saving our business.

778
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:50,224
My mom keeps making me bulgogi,
although I don't bring her a penny.

779
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,561
Everything you said was right.

780
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:55,313
I'm not good enough,

781
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:57,982
and I'm too emotional.

782
01:02:58,065 --> 01:03:00,276
But I've never considered this a joke.

783
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:03,821
Actually…

784
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:11,412
Actually, it's difficult and scary.

785
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:12,413
But, Ms. Oh,

786
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:14,999
no matter how hard and scary it is,

787
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:18,836
we can't turn a blind eye to someone

788
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:22,465
who's dying before us
and begging for help.

789
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:29,388
I'm sorry for not giving you enough faith.

790
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:33,768
But I'll always make the same choice.

791
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:37,605
I can't help it.

792
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:40,274
This is who I am.

793
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:52,328
Let's go back to Seoul.

794
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:23,734
Do you know where you're going?

795
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,739
I don't know anything.

796
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:32,201
I don't even know what's important.

797
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:39,750
If I say
we should walk over to the lights,

798
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:42,503
will you think that's too emotional?

799
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:46,090
You're holding grudges now?

800
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:51,429
-What now?
-Just come.

801
01:05:05,943 --> 01:05:08,112
CAUTION: SLIPPERY FLOOR
WEAR ANTI-SLIP BOOTS

802
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:14,410
Look who it is. Aren't you two from Seoul?

803
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:16,621
-Hello.
-Hey, there.

804
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:19,081
What brings you here in the dead of night?

805
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:20,583
No reason.

806
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:24,003
Did you two fight?

807
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:25,588
-No.
-Yes.

808
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:28,466
-You're right.
-How adorable.

809
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:29,592
No, we're not.

810
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:31,969
Look at you two.

811
01:05:32,553 --> 01:05:34,805
What's this fish?

812
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:37,934
These are mackerels,
and these are horse mackerels.

813
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,478
Hey, Captain!

814
01:05:40,561 --> 01:05:42,146
Great work today.

815
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:44,941
The horse mackerels are quite fresh.

816
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:50,196
Captain, where do these come from?

817
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:52,531
You wouldn't know where in the vast sea.

818
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:55,368
It's the sea near our country.

819
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:59,622
But they must've swam here
from quite a distance,

820
01:06:00,414 --> 01:06:02,041
somewhere in the Pacific.

821
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:07,588
Hey, Jeong-gun! Come on.

822
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:16,514
Excuse me, Captain.

823
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:22,395
By the way, how far can this boat go?
Can it reach Mexico?

824
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,480
-Mexico?
-Yes.

825
01:06:24,563 --> 01:06:27,608
If it ends up in Mexico,
it'll be a shipwreck.

826
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:33,197
But there are fishing boats
that travel to South America.

827
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:37,076
You'll find
deep-sea fishing vessels over there.

828
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:38,995
They don't just go to South America.

829
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:42,748
They go to Alaska, Europe,
and all around the globe.

830
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:45,418
Why?

831
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:49,046
-Do you want to get on one?
-No, not us.

832
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:50,715
Just forget it.

833
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:53,676
Once onboard,
you're out there for two years minimum.

834
01:06:53,759 --> 01:06:58,097
By any chance,
do you know where I can find such a ship?

835
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:01,350
That must be it.

836
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:05,312
FV IMAGIN

837
01:07:08,649 --> 01:07:11,569
Hi, is the captain here?

838
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:15,322
Captain! Sir!

839
01:07:15,906 --> 01:07:17,074
What do you want?

840
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:19,118
Hello.

841
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:21,495
My name is Kang Tae-poong
of Typhoon Trading.

842
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:25,958
We wanted to ask you for a favor, sir.

843
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:30,379
Do you load different items on your ship,
such as shoes?

844
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,132
We have 5,000 safety shoes
that have to go.

845
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:37,303
Can you ship them to Mexico?

846
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:44,560
Did he just say yes?

847
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:46,562
-I think so.
-Right?

848
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:48,147
Boys.

849
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:50,024
-Did it work?
-I think so.

850
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:55,571
What? Why?

851
01:07:55,654 --> 01:07:56,781
-Goodness!
-What is it?

852
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:58,949
-Wait! Why?
-Why?

853
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:09,543
THE LEGEND OF AMBITION

854
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:44,578
TYPHOON FAMILY

855
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:47,039
Why do you make me worried sick?

856
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:48,040
You punk!

857
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:49,625
Do you know how much damage you caused?

858
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:53,003
Do you have what it takes
to take Kang Tae-poong down?

859
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:54,338
What are you doing?

860
01:08:54,421 --> 01:08:57,633
I want to sell this,
but I don't know where to begin.

861
01:08:57,716 --> 01:09:00,136
We'll start exporting to Thailand now.

862
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:04,890
I didn't think it seemed right
for Ms. Oh Mi-seon to be in sales.

863
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:07,309
But Ms. Oh is Typhoon Trading's trader.

864
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:09,228
And when you smile, you're beautiful.

865
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:11,272
I think I like you.
