TYPHOON FAMILY

2
00:00:51,364 --> 00:00:52,991
I've long dreamed of being a trader.

3
00:00:54,492 --> 00:00:57,745
A trader who, even if not remarkable,
always fulfills her share of the work.

4
00:00:58,872 --> 00:01:00,748
That has been my goal.

5
00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:03,293
We've got so many here.

6
00:01:03,376 --> 00:01:04,836
We should start sorting them out.

7
00:01:07,672 --> 00:01:11,342
I've thought that was my dearest wish.

8
00:01:48,046 --> 00:01:49,714
Oh, dear.

9
00:02:18,493 --> 00:02:19,577
What is that smell?

10
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,517
What?

11
00:02:52,485 --> 00:02:54,070
Oh, my! What do I do? Hold on.

12
00:02:55,029 --> 00:02:57,115
No, this can't happen!

13
00:02:57,198 --> 00:02:58,950
What do I do? But how?

14
00:02:59,033 --> 00:03:00,076
How did a fire break out?

15
00:03:21,931 --> 00:03:23,725
No, please.

16
00:03:25,268 --> 00:03:26,436
Please stop.

17
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:27,854
No.

18
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,735
Oh, no.

19
00:03:36,529 --> 00:03:38,072
SAMGOK WAREHOUSE

20
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:51,127
It's hot!

21
00:03:52,045 --> 00:03:52,879
What do I do?

22
00:03:56,924 --> 00:03:58,217
Please help!

23
00:04:01,346 --> 00:04:02,555
This can't be happening.

24
00:04:09,145 --> 00:04:10,438
What do I do?

25
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,088
Ms. Oh!

26
00:04:35,713 --> 00:04:36,714
Ms. Oh!

27
00:04:37,548 --> 00:04:38,925
Darn it.

28
00:04:39,008 --> 00:04:40,009
Oh Mi-seon!

29
00:04:40,551 --> 00:04:42,345
Hold on. Hang in there.

30
00:04:59,737 --> 00:05:00,988
Please…

31
00:05:01,072 --> 00:05:02,323
Ms. Oh!

32
00:05:11,624 --> 00:05:14,877
Now, before the dreams I once longed for,

33
00:05:15,962 --> 00:05:17,630
regrets come to mind first.

34
00:05:23,428 --> 00:05:25,555
I should've said goodbye
to my grandmother.

35
00:05:27,598 --> 00:05:30,351
I should've told Mi-ho to quit her job
at the department store.

36
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,897
I should've bought
Beom's underwear sooner.

37
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,445
But what I regret the most now…

38
00:05:42,405 --> 00:05:43,406
Oh Mi-seon!

39
00:05:46,993 --> 00:05:48,035
Mi-seon!

40
00:05:51,122 --> 00:05:52,540
…is that I never told him

41
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,169
how I actually feel about him.

42
00:05:58,462 --> 00:06:00,131
I wish I had told him that I like him,

43
00:06:01,424 --> 00:06:02,592
his gaze,

44
00:06:03,426 --> 00:06:05,261
and everything about him.

45
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,764
I should've let him know.

46
00:06:13,144 --> 00:06:14,103
Mi-seon.

47
00:06:24,614 --> 00:06:25,615
Hang in there.

48
00:06:31,287 --> 00:06:32,371
Oh Mi-seon!

49
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:55,645
It must've been so scary.

50
00:06:58,147 --> 00:06:59,273
Let's get out of here.

51
00:07:09,158 --> 00:07:12,536
EPISODE 13
LOVE BEYOND FEAR

52
00:07:15,122 --> 00:07:18,376
ANJEONG HOSPITAL

53
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:19,877
That must be painful.

54
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:21,963
Just a minute, ma'am.

55
00:07:22,046 --> 00:07:23,923
Could you check a patient here?

56
00:07:24,006 --> 00:07:25,091
Ma'am, please.

57
00:07:25,174 --> 00:07:27,134
Why isn't she getting any treatment?

58
00:07:27,218 --> 00:07:28,719
She's had the tests already.

59
00:07:28,803 --> 00:07:31,681
She's been waiting for ages.
Why aren't you treating her?

60
00:07:31,764 --> 00:07:35,643
I told you the urgent test came back fine,
and the rest comes out tomorrow.

61
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:38,396
She'll be moved once she wakes.

62
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,524
But she inhaled
a mountain of jet-black smoke!

63
00:07:41,607 --> 00:07:43,359
I bet she has.

64
00:07:43,442 --> 00:07:45,903
Like I said,
please go get tested yourself.

65
00:07:52,368 --> 00:07:54,370
What's going on? Ms. Oh.

66
00:07:54,996 --> 00:07:56,581
Are you coming around?

67
00:07:56,664 --> 00:07:58,040
Are you okay, Ms. Oh?

68
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:00,543
Ms. Oh.

69
00:08:01,752 --> 00:08:02,753
Mi-seon!

70
00:08:03,713 --> 00:08:05,715
Can you hear me, Mi-seon?
Open up your eyes!

71
00:08:05,798 --> 00:08:09,468
-Hey, punk! Keep it down, will you?
-Mind the other patients, okay?

72
00:08:09,552 --> 00:08:10,886
How inconsiderate.

73
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:16,559
Are you okay, Ms. Oh?

74
00:08:19,103 --> 00:08:20,104
Mr. Kang.

75
00:08:20,187 --> 00:08:21,856
What's up? Where does it hurt?

76
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:23,733
Go on, tell me.

77
00:08:28,863 --> 00:08:30,364
I like you.

78
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:34,327
Come again?

79
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,246
I like you.

80
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,957
I'm asking you to go out with me.

81
00:08:45,046 --> 00:08:46,172
You're asking me that here?

82
00:08:52,803 --> 00:08:53,763
Please, ma'am!

83
00:08:53,846 --> 00:08:56,599
Please come take a look at him.
The bleeding won't stop!

84
00:08:56,682 --> 00:08:58,601
Oh, no. Please take a look.

85
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:02,396
-Let me take a look.
-She's losing it.

86
00:09:07,526 --> 00:09:08,527
I mean…

87
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,032
Come on, not in a place like this.

88
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:14,784
What about it?

89
00:09:15,534 --> 00:09:17,662
It's safe and hygienic.

90
00:09:18,412 --> 00:09:21,082
No way. I'll pretend I never heard that.

91
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,210
Let's do this again later.

92
00:09:24,293 --> 00:09:26,420
What, again? Spare me the embarrassment.

93
00:09:26,504 --> 00:09:28,631
No, I'm going to pretend I didn't hear it.

94
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:32,009
This just isn't right.

95
00:09:33,928 --> 00:09:35,096
-Mr. Kang.
-Yeah?

96
00:09:36,472 --> 00:09:38,974
What about our stock?
What happened to the gloves?

97
00:09:39,058 --> 00:09:40,851
How is that the issue now?

98
00:09:40,935 --> 00:09:42,478
Mr. Kang Tae-poong?

99
00:09:44,397 --> 00:09:46,440
Hello, we're from the police department.

100
00:09:47,024 --> 00:09:49,777
We'd like to ask you a few questions
regarding the fire.

101
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:01,831
Ms. Bun-i! Ma'am, wait for…

102
00:10:01,914 --> 00:10:03,165
Wait up!

103
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:06,627
Slow down. Let me come with you!

104
00:10:06,711 --> 00:10:08,879
Ma'am!

105
00:10:08,963 --> 00:10:10,423
Where's my precious girl?

106
00:10:10,506 --> 00:10:12,133
Over there.

107
00:10:12,967 --> 00:10:14,760
-Are you okay, dear?
-Yes, Grandma.

108
00:10:14,844 --> 00:10:16,429
I'm all good. Don't you worry.

109
00:10:16,512 --> 00:10:19,306
-You're okay?
-Honestly, I'm okay.

110
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,391
Mom.

111
00:10:20,474 --> 00:10:22,226
-Gosh, Tae-poong.
-Ms. Bun-i.

112
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:27,064
You rascal.
Look at the state of my baby girl.

113
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,442
How come you're unscathed?

114
00:10:30,025 --> 00:10:30,985
Ma'am.

115
00:10:31,068 --> 00:10:34,572
Ma'am, that wasn't exactly his fault…

116
00:10:34,655 --> 00:10:38,701
Dear me. What if my beautiful bud
of a granddaughter had perished

117
00:10:38,784 --> 00:10:40,828
without ever fully coming to bloom?

118
00:10:41,662 --> 00:10:43,622
Could you have lived with that regret?

119
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,251
-I'm sorry, ma'am.
-I'm okay.

120
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:48,502
You foolish girl.

121
00:10:48,586 --> 00:10:51,464
How did you get into such big trouble?

122
00:10:52,882 --> 00:10:56,093
My old heart
has long hardened like a rock.

123
00:10:56,177 --> 00:10:59,346
A piercing tragedy
might not do that big a damage.

124
00:11:00,264 --> 00:11:02,475
But what about Mi-ho and Beom?

125
00:11:02,558 --> 00:11:06,687
Did you consider how their tender hearts
will get shattered into pieces?

126
00:11:06,771 --> 00:11:07,772
Grandma…

127
00:11:09,356 --> 00:11:10,858
Your siblings aside,

128
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:15,488
have you thought about your life?
What about the life ahead of you?

129
00:11:16,947 --> 00:11:19,492
Value and cherish yourself, okay?

130
00:11:20,493 --> 00:11:22,828
I may have not given you
a comfortable life,

131
00:11:22,912 --> 00:11:26,040
but that doesn't mean
you should knock yourself about.

132
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,210
My dear child.

133
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:32,630
-It must've been so hot in there.
-I'm all good.

134
00:11:32,713 --> 00:11:36,717
-It must've been so suffocating and scary.
-I wasn't scared at all.

135
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,344
-Just how…
-I'm okay, Grandma.

136
00:11:38,427 --> 00:11:41,597
-Don't worry, Grandma.
-You poor little thing.

137
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,183
Grandma, it's okay.

138
00:11:45,476 --> 00:11:48,187
Don't cry.
You'll wear yourself out. It's all good.

139
00:11:49,605 --> 00:11:50,606
I'm okay.

140
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:55,152
HOSPITAL

141
00:11:55,236 --> 00:11:56,320
Here, ma'am.

142
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:09,875
I apologize for the harsh words earlier.

143
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:12,503
I shouldn't have blamed you at all.

144
00:12:12,586 --> 00:12:13,754
No, ma'am.

145
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,131
It was my fault.

146
00:12:19,969 --> 00:12:21,428
Can you make me a promise?

147
00:12:21,512 --> 00:12:25,266
-I feel like I can ask you for a favor.
-Of course you can.

148
00:12:25,849 --> 00:12:27,518
I noticed that my dear girl

149
00:12:27,601 --> 00:12:30,604
has begun to smile again
after meeting you.

150
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,940
I mean, she's smiling again.

151
00:12:36,068 --> 00:12:37,695
I'll fill her life with smiles.

152
00:12:39,196 --> 00:12:40,531
All smiles and no tears.

153
00:12:40,614 --> 00:12:43,784
Goodness, no. Make her cry.

154
00:12:44,577 --> 00:12:48,539
Help her cry her eyes out
without holding back.

155
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:51,875
She's endured a lot at a young age.

156
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:55,170
Help her let go
of all the sorrows in her heart.

157
00:12:55,838 --> 00:12:57,756
Can you do that for me?

158
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:06,765
Of course, I promise.

159
00:13:08,892 --> 00:13:10,644
You can cry now too, ma'am.

160
00:13:11,854 --> 00:13:13,522
We're a family now.

161
00:13:35,836 --> 00:13:38,047
Get off. Didn't you hear me?

162
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,131
Unbelievable.

163
00:13:51,477 --> 00:13:52,978
You've lost it, haven't you?

164
00:13:53,062 --> 00:13:54,521
What have you done this time?

165
00:13:54,605 --> 00:13:57,232
Did you ask about the delivery date
and the warehouse

166
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,610
to set the place on fire?

167
00:13:59,693 --> 00:14:01,111
Did you torch the warehouse?

168
00:14:01,195 --> 00:14:03,072
I haven't got time for this nonsense.

169
00:14:03,656 --> 00:14:05,949
Listen, you crazy brat.
There was a person inside.

170
00:14:06,742 --> 00:14:09,912
Mi-seon was there.
Did you do it on purpose?

171
00:14:12,915 --> 00:14:13,957
So what?

172
00:14:19,922 --> 00:14:21,715
Did Freckles die or something?

173
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:24,385
If she had died,
I'd be with the police, not you.

174
00:14:24,468 --> 00:14:28,097
Oh, the police? Go ahead.
You've still got time to go see them.

175
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,223
But tell me.

176
00:14:29,848 --> 00:14:31,308
Do you have any evidence?

177
00:14:31,392 --> 00:14:32,893
I didn't do anything.

178
00:14:33,936 --> 00:14:34,937
Listen up, lady.

179
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,982
You seem
to be having trouble grasping things,

180
00:14:38,065 --> 00:14:41,235
but your job is to bring me
that promissory note or whatever.

181
00:14:42,027 --> 00:14:43,696
Not my father, but me. Got it?

182
00:14:44,488 --> 00:14:47,908
What's more, I suggest
you use your common sense.

183
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:51,870
Who do you think is next?

184
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,169
What a handsome kid.

185
00:14:59,253 --> 00:15:02,381
STUDENT ID
PARK MIN-SEONG

186
00:15:04,216 --> 00:15:05,926
Familiar, no?

187
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,865
Think about it.

188
00:15:29,158 --> 00:15:31,285
The door was locked from the outside.

189
00:15:31,994 --> 00:15:34,872
And yet, the warehouse burst into flames.

190
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,708
Are we sure it wasn't arson?

191
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:42,004
So, did you guys visit
Ms. Oh in the hospital?

192
00:15:42,087 --> 00:15:43,422
Mr. Go here

193
00:15:43,505 --> 00:15:46,467
had a total meltdown
at the sight of Ms. Oh in her sleep.

194
00:15:47,134 --> 00:15:49,011
We got kicked out for being so loud.

195
00:15:49,803 --> 00:15:52,639
So, is Ms. Oh going to be fine?

196
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,475
Fine, my foot.

197
00:15:55,309 --> 00:15:56,810
She almost died.

198
00:15:57,394 --> 00:15:59,605
She got first-degree burns
on her hands and arms.

199
00:15:59,688 --> 00:16:01,565
She had some inhalation burn too,

200
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:04,401
but luckily she'll recover
after some rest.

201
00:16:10,657 --> 00:16:12,868
-Hey.
-What's that?

202
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:16,288
-What's inside?
-It's just our goods from the warehouse.

203
00:16:16,371 --> 00:16:17,414
Why bring them here?

204
00:16:18,749 --> 00:16:20,918
-I have to go. I'm late.
-You're leaving?

205
00:16:23,087 --> 00:16:24,421
-Jeez.
-Gosh.

206
00:16:30,385 --> 00:16:31,845
I have a few more boxes in the car.

207
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:33,597
-That's enough, Mr. Kang.
-What?

208
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:36,517
They're all junk.

209
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,977
But why? They didn't get burned.

210
00:16:39,061 --> 00:16:41,730
Take a look for yourself.
They still reek of smoke.

211
00:16:41,814 --> 00:16:43,273
-What?
-These won't do.

212
00:16:57,371 --> 00:16:59,414
They're for surgeries.

213
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,167
You can't use them.

214
00:17:04,795 --> 00:17:05,963
Great effort, though.

215
00:17:10,384 --> 00:17:11,385
I mean…

216
00:17:12,511 --> 00:17:13,846
We know you did your best.

217
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:22,104
What are you even saying?
I can't believe my ears!

218
00:17:22,187 --> 00:17:25,232
The deadline's a week away,
and now there's a problem?

219
00:17:25,315 --> 00:17:26,275
Are you kidding me?

220
00:17:26,358 --> 00:17:28,110
That's why we've come to ask

221
00:17:28,193 --> 00:17:31,280
if you could extend
the deadline just by a few days.

222
00:17:31,864 --> 00:17:32,823
There's no way!

223
00:17:33,407 --> 00:17:37,286
You know all goods are to be collected
and shipped to Africa in one freighter!

224
00:17:37,369 --> 00:17:39,872
My gosh, what an absolute nightmare!

225
00:17:39,955 --> 00:17:41,540
You know what?

226
00:17:41,623 --> 00:17:44,918
You're welcome to book a new ship
and take care of the delivery fees!

227
00:17:45,502 --> 00:17:46,837
Look here.

228
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,506
It wasn't entirely due to
mismanagement on our part.

229
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,799
We had a fire.

230
00:17:51,466 --> 00:17:52,509
"Look here"?

231
00:17:53,218 --> 00:17:54,303
Ma'am, we had a fire.

232
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,475
Help your countrymen in need
before helping other nations.

233
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,270
There's no room for help here.
This is the protocol.

234
00:18:03,353 --> 00:18:05,230
What about the damages for the delay?

235
00:18:05,314 --> 00:18:09,109
Let's not argue over nothing.
Just go secure a new batch of products.

236
00:18:09,818 --> 00:18:12,154
We're only here
because that's not so easy.

237
00:18:12,237 --> 00:18:15,741
My goodness… Did you hear that, Mr. Jung?

238
00:18:15,824 --> 00:18:19,077
This is why I don't want
small businesses getting involved.

239
00:18:19,661 --> 00:18:21,330
How irresponsible!

240
00:18:21,413 --> 00:18:24,541
When things go south, they just pretend
like it's none of their business.

241
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:30,172
In that case,
you could consider giving up your deal.

242
00:18:30,255 --> 00:18:33,508
Then ten percent of the bid bond
will cover the damages--

243
00:18:33,592 --> 00:18:36,720
Don't bring up giving up just yet.

244
00:18:36,803 --> 00:18:39,723
You're taking the private sector's money,
corrupt bureaucrats.

245
00:18:39,806 --> 00:18:42,851
Excuse me, don't make it sound
like we will get that money.

246
00:18:42,935 --> 00:18:45,687
You'd be paying KOICA.
It's a different entity.

247
00:18:46,313 --> 00:18:49,358
Then the right to the deal
will go to the runner-up bidder.

248
00:18:49,441 --> 00:18:52,152
Does that mean it will go
to Pyo Merchant Marine?

249
00:18:52,236 --> 00:18:53,362
-Yes.
-Goodness.

250
00:18:53,445 --> 00:18:56,240
They're just as annoying.
You're like two seeds in a pod.

251
00:18:56,907 --> 00:18:58,075
It's two peas in a pod!

252
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:02,412
Fine! "Two peas in a pod."
But that's not the key issue for me!

253
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:05,457
Just make sure
to deliver your goods on time!

254
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,043
Meet the deadline
and the quantity we agreed upon!

255
00:19:09,253 --> 00:19:11,129
Our guests are leaving.
Validate their parking.

256
00:19:12,214 --> 00:19:13,924
They only gave us 30 minutes.

257
00:19:15,884 --> 00:19:17,844
She's not budging at all.

258
00:19:17,928 --> 00:19:20,013
She wouldn't flinch for anything.

259
00:19:21,014 --> 00:19:22,849
Let's talk to Blaze Eagles first.

260
00:19:34,736 --> 00:19:37,155
Yes, we need that handled quickly.

261
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:42,411
Excuse me.

262
00:19:44,788 --> 00:19:45,998
My goodness.

263
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:47,374
Ms. Jung.

264
00:19:51,712 --> 00:19:52,963
Give me a few minutes.

265
00:20:19,364 --> 00:20:20,449
Is it too rough for you?

266
00:20:21,033 --> 00:20:23,535
Oh, no. I'm good.

267
00:20:23,618 --> 00:20:25,746
This neighborhood
gives you quite the hike,

268
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:27,706
but the air here is so fresh.

269
00:20:28,623 --> 00:20:31,626
It's not like any top-floor unit
of a high-rise complex.

270
00:20:34,504 --> 00:20:35,505
I see.

271
00:20:38,258 --> 00:20:39,217
Hello!

272
00:20:41,428 --> 00:20:42,512
My gosh, it's so hot.

273
00:21:02,783 --> 00:21:04,701
I may not have raised her like a princess.

274
00:21:05,285 --> 00:21:06,578
Gosh, you scared me!

275
00:21:06,661 --> 00:21:11,875
Still, it's admirable
how she seems to cherish others.

276
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,168
You mean the young lady?

277
00:21:14,503 --> 00:21:16,671
It's rather pitiful.

278
00:21:17,547 --> 00:21:20,342
Maybe it's because
she's used to walking on eggshells…

279
00:21:21,134 --> 00:21:21,968
Well, I…

280
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:23,804
Ma'am.

281
00:21:26,181 --> 00:21:27,224
Even so,

282
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:32,813
I'm sure she'll find someone
who'll recognize her warm heart's worth.

283
00:21:34,356 --> 00:21:36,691
Please don't treat her poorly.

284
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:42,781
She may look feisty on the outside,
but she's a kind-hearted girl.

285
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,701
Ma'am, please don't misunderstand…

286
00:21:46,785 --> 00:21:50,705
Her shoulders are squared,
and her tail is curled up beautifully.

287
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:51,790
Tail…

288
00:21:52,624 --> 00:21:55,210
-She's got a tail?
-Sure.

289
00:21:56,753 --> 00:21:58,755
Gosh, a dog! You scared me!

290
00:22:00,966 --> 00:22:03,051
-My heart…
-Ms. Kim, you can wait in our bedroom…

291
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:05,470
My gosh. When did you come out, Ms. Bun-i?

292
00:22:08,265 --> 00:22:11,810
-What's the matter?
-Oh, it's nothing.

293
00:22:13,228 --> 00:22:14,729
-Ms. Jung!
-Hey, Beom.

294
00:22:15,397 --> 00:22:16,398
I got 70!

295
00:22:18,316 --> 00:22:19,317
My gosh.

296
00:22:19,401 --> 00:22:20,527
You got 70 on the test?

297
00:22:22,446 --> 00:22:24,239
See? I knew you had it in you!

298
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:25,824
You sweet thing.

299
00:22:25,907 --> 00:22:27,909
You must be a genius.
What would you like to eat?

300
00:22:27,993 --> 00:22:29,828
-Glazed sweet potato.
-Sweet potato?

301
00:22:29,911 --> 00:22:31,788
I'll make it for you.

302
00:22:31,872 --> 00:22:33,748
Let's get 90 on the next test.

303
00:22:33,832 --> 00:22:37,252
Ninety points.

304
00:22:38,003 --> 00:22:41,923
This is so exciting!
You got a whopping 70 points!

305
00:22:48,388 --> 00:22:49,472
What did they say?

306
00:22:51,641 --> 00:22:53,894
They can't produce more gloves
at the moment.

307
00:22:53,977 --> 00:22:55,437
They can't produce gloves?

308
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,813
Because of recent bulk orders,

309
00:22:56,897 --> 00:22:58,231
they're out of material.

310
00:22:58,315 --> 00:23:00,692
Orders are flooding in,
but they don't have enough material.

311
00:23:01,318 --> 00:23:03,653
It will take three months
until they can resume production.

312
00:23:05,322 --> 00:23:06,781
We're facing bankruptcy here.

313
00:23:06,865 --> 00:23:09,993
Don't even…
Please don't mention it, Myung-gwan.

314
00:23:12,621 --> 00:23:15,707
Surely, the surgical gloves
can't be so hard to find.

315
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,876
Let's keep trying. We'll find a supplier.

316
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:20,045
Keep looking. We've got this.

317
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:23,924
-Come on, everyone.
-Okay.

318
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:29,763
Check for inventory
of the suppliers in the provinces.

319
00:23:29,846 --> 00:23:30,847
Yes, okay.

320
00:23:47,072 --> 00:23:51,326
HAEMONG FLOWER SHOP

321
00:24:25,735 --> 00:24:26,736
Hi, you're here.

322
00:24:29,864 --> 00:24:31,283
It must've been a long day.

323
00:24:31,366 --> 00:24:32,575
It was rough, wasn't it?

324
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:41,042
Sorry I wasn't there for your discharge.

325
00:24:45,255 --> 00:24:46,423
I don't mind it.

326
00:24:50,635 --> 00:24:51,845
Thank you.

327
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,918
Should we have some dinner?

328
00:25:25,754 --> 00:25:26,838
Let's eat.

329
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:34,804
-Thanks.
-You're an amazing cook, Ms. Bun-i.

330
00:25:34,888 --> 00:25:38,308
It's just you're not much of a cook, dear.

331
00:25:38,391 --> 00:25:39,225
Goodness.

332
00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:41,061
Even water might taste better.

333
00:25:41,144 --> 00:25:46,149
Remember, your father-in-law
likes his food well-seasoned.

334
00:25:46,816 --> 00:25:49,819
But Tae-poong prefers
bland dishes over salty ones.

335
00:25:49,903 --> 00:25:52,739
Drink enough water
if the dishes are too salty for you.

336
00:25:53,615 --> 00:25:54,616
It tastes amazing.

337
00:25:57,952 --> 00:26:01,206
Pretty lady, eat up.

338
00:26:01,289 --> 00:26:03,792
-Always stay in good health.
-I will, Grandma.

339
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:06,211
I'm amazed you prepared
all my favorite dishes, Grandma.

340
00:26:06,294 --> 00:26:07,212
Oh, sure.

341
00:26:07,295 --> 00:26:09,214
What about me, Grandma?

342
00:26:09,297 --> 00:26:10,757
Goodness, my baby.

343
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,801
You can have your fill too.

344
00:26:14,761 --> 00:26:15,762
Wait.

345
00:26:16,888 --> 00:26:18,681
We're short of one person.

346
00:26:20,392 --> 00:26:22,477
Mi-ho is meeting her friends, Grandma.

347
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,729
YEOUIDO TOP PUB

348
00:26:24,813 --> 00:26:27,732
STUDIO I LOVE YOU REUNION
AT YEOUIDO TOP PUB

349
00:26:27,816 --> 00:26:28,650
Bang!

350
00:26:31,653 --> 00:26:36,157
-Down a shot!
-Down a shot!

351
00:26:37,283 --> 00:26:38,910
-Let's begin again.
-Zero.

352
00:26:40,286 --> 00:26:41,913
-Zero.
-Seven.

353
00:26:41,996 --> 00:26:43,289
-Bang!
-Bang!

354
00:26:43,373 --> 00:26:44,916
Hey, you got it wrong!

355
00:26:44,999 --> 00:26:45,834
Wait, no!

356
00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:47,627
This time, it's soju.

357
00:26:48,753 --> 00:26:50,713
-Down a shot!
-Cheers.

358
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,387
Hey, we've got another pitcher of beer.

359
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,681
Gosh, we're getting beer non-stop.

360
00:26:59,764 --> 00:27:02,725
We can't leave your glass empty, Mr. Jung.

361
00:27:02,809 --> 00:27:05,186
-Drink up.
-Oh, dear.

362
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,689
Look, I've got some soju.

363
00:27:09,732 --> 00:27:10,567
Gosh.

364
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:13,319
Let me refill your glasses, ladies.

365
00:27:13,403 --> 00:27:15,947
Why aren't you guys drinking?

366
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:19,659
Is Tae-poong skipping again?
I thought he promised to come this time.

367
00:27:20,827 --> 00:27:23,329
Why do we always get
either Kim Chu-seok or him?

368
00:27:23,913 --> 00:27:25,582
-Hey, Man No. 4.
-Yes?

369
00:27:25,665 --> 00:27:27,834
Where's Tae-poong?
You said you called him.

370
00:27:28,585 --> 00:27:31,754
Tae-poong didn't recognize me.

371
00:27:31,838 --> 00:27:32,839
What about him?

372
00:27:32,922 --> 00:27:34,215
Ha Cheong-il impersonator.

373
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:36,801
-Oh, Wang Nam-i?
-Nam-i or whatever.

374
00:27:36,885 --> 00:27:39,721
He sang Park Nam-jung's song,
not Ha Cheong-il's.

375
00:27:40,555 --> 00:27:43,725
His name is Wang Nam-mo, not Wang Nam-i.

376
00:27:44,726 --> 00:27:46,978
-Sure, Nam-mo.
-Nam-mo.

377
00:27:47,061 --> 00:27:48,938
-We know that.
-Of course.

378
00:27:49,022 --> 00:27:51,065
-Don't get it wrong.
-Okay.

379
00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:53,651
-Cheers, everyone!
-Cheers!

380
00:27:54,527 --> 00:27:57,530
-Let's drink up, okay?
-Cheers!

381
00:27:57,614 --> 00:27:59,365
-Jeez, she's wasted.
-Mi-ho sure is.

382
00:28:01,868 --> 00:28:03,786
Can we get more soju, ma'am?

383
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,497
-We're good, ma'am.
-We have some here.

384
00:28:06,164 --> 00:28:07,874
Mi-ho's running late tonight.

385
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:10,919
-What is that?
-This?

386
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:13,588
Do you want to try it?

387
00:28:19,552 --> 00:28:21,471
Ms. Bun-i, they produced this serum

388
00:28:22,096 --> 00:28:26,184
using the technology they developed
while carrying out research on diabetes.

389
00:28:26,267 --> 00:28:29,145
It keeps your skin healthy.

390
00:28:30,188 --> 00:28:32,941
Even the bottle
is designed quite elegantly.

391
00:28:33,024 --> 00:28:34,025
I love it.

392
00:28:34,651 --> 00:28:36,778
If I get prettier than this,

393
00:28:36,861 --> 00:28:40,698
the young men in the area will badger me
for giving them butterflies!

394
00:28:40,782 --> 00:28:42,325
You needn't worry about that.

395
00:28:43,785 --> 00:28:46,496
Ms. Oh. Come here and try this.

396
00:28:46,579 --> 00:28:50,250
-Little Ms. Oh got me this, and I love it.
-Really?

397
00:28:54,754 --> 00:28:55,880
It's pretty unique.

398
00:28:55,964 --> 00:28:57,799
-Right?
-For sure.

399
00:28:57,882 --> 00:28:59,717
Let's keep your skin nice and moist.

400
00:29:00,635 --> 00:29:03,054
-Can I step outside for a bit?
-Okay.

401
00:29:03,137 --> 00:29:05,056
Where are you going? Seeing someone?

402
00:29:05,139 --> 00:29:06,474
Goodness, no.

403
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:09,018
I'm going out for a stroll.
I'll be back soon.

404
00:29:09,102 --> 00:29:10,603
-See you.
-Okay.

405
00:29:12,814 --> 00:29:15,066
-Are you sure you should be out here?
-Yeah.

406
00:29:16,025 --> 00:29:18,403
I had a big meal,
so a walk will help me digest.

407
00:29:19,612 --> 00:29:21,281
It felt rather stuffy inside too.

408
00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:32,959
How does it feel
to see the person you like?

409
00:29:33,459 --> 00:29:35,587
I thought you'd pretend
you never heard it.

410
00:29:38,715 --> 00:29:39,799
I love it.

411
00:29:43,386 --> 00:29:45,013
That I get to see you like this.

412
00:29:56,232 --> 00:29:58,109
It was really rough today, wasn't it?

413
00:29:59,527 --> 00:30:00,486
I felt

414
00:30:02,447 --> 00:30:05,325
somewhat lost.

415
00:30:08,328 --> 00:30:09,871
But I'm good now.

416
00:30:11,497 --> 00:30:12,832
I'm really fine.

417
00:30:21,841 --> 00:30:25,261
I'm sorry.
If only I had noticed the fire sooner.

418
00:30:28,431 --> 00:30:29,432
Don't say that.

419
00:30:32,685 --> 00:30:33,770
It was my fault.

420
00:30:35,104 --> 00:30:41,861
From now on, I will never leave you alone.

421
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,574
You know…

422
00:30:52,163 --> 00:30:53,456
Mi-seon, you are…

423
00:30:59,963 --> 00:31:01,631
The one you really like?

424
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:13,851
No.

425
00:31:17,397 --> 00:31:18,648
The one I love.

426
00:31:55,935 --> 00:31:56,936
Hello?

427
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,814
Man No. 2. Please come over quickly.

428
00:31:59,897 --> 00:32:00,898
What?

429
00:32:00,982 --> 00:32:04,110
Come on. They gave me a twister shot!

430
00:32:04,193 --> 00:32:06,571
A shot of that can take even bulls down.

431
00:32:06,654 --> 00:32:08,740
-Jeez.
-I honestly want to quit drinking…

432
00:32:08,823 --> 00:32:10,241
-Mi-ho!
-Just a bit further.

433
00:32:10,992 --> 00:32:12,118
Who the hell are you?

434
00:32:13,286 --> 00:32:14,579
It's not…

435
00:32:14,662 --> 00:32:16,581
Well… You know…

436
00:32:16,664 --> 00:32:17,874
Are you okay, Mi-ho?

437
00:32:17,957 --> 00:32:20,168
-Why did you get so wasted?
-Hey, that's mine.

438
00:32:20,877 --> 00:32:22,086
It's not what you think.

439
00:32:23,421 --> 00:32:26,215
Hello, Man No. 2. I'm Man No. 4.

440
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,218
Abracadabra.

441
00:32:29,302 --> 00:32:31,345
-Oh, right. Hello.
-Hi.

442
00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:33,931
Why didn't you come
to the Studio I Love You reunion?

443
00:32:34,015 --> 00:32:38,352
Chu-seok said he left both you
and Tae-poong countless pager messages.

444
00:32:38,436 --> 00:32:41,689
He kept inviting us to a group date
with women from other cohorts.

445
00:32:41,773 --> 00:32:43,357
What? When did he ever do that?

446
00:32:43,441 --> 00:32:44,609
What, a group date?

447
00:32:45,193 --> 00:32:47,111
Have you finally lost your mind?

448
00:32:47,195 --> 00:32:49,572
You don't get to say that
in your state, Mi-ho.

449
00:32:50,198 --> 00:32:51,532
What have I done so wrong?

450
00:32:51,616 --> 00:32:53,493
Go on and tell me. What's my problem?

451
00:32:53,576 --> 00:32:55,244
Your sister was just discharged today.

452
00:32:55,328 --> 00:32:56,746
Why were you at the party?

453
00:32:56,829 --> 00:32:59,582
-Are you an alcoholic or what?
-I drank because I was upset!

454
00:33:00,249 --> 00:33:01,459
What's wrong with it?

455
00:33:01,542 --> 00:33:03,252
Do you not approve of a girl drinking?

456
00:33:03,878 --> 00:33:07,924
It becomes an issue if you can't hold
your liquor, regardless of your gender.

457
00:33:08,007 --> 00:33:09,884
Don't you know
how unsafe the world has gotten?

458
00:33:09,967 --> 00:33:11,803
Don't give me a lecture!

459
00:33:11,886 --> 00:33:13,137
Who do you think you are?

460
00:33:14,138 --> 00:33:16,766
-Who are you to say that?
-What?

461
00:33:17,475 --> 00:33:19,352
Hey, do you really have to ask?

462
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,563
Why are you even dating me, Mi-ho?

463
00:33:23,356 --> 00:33:26,400
Are you dating me out of pity
because I kept following you around?

464
00:33:26,484 --> 00:33:27,610
No.

465
00:33:27,693 --> 00:33:29,112
Because you were annoying.

466
00:33:30,196 --> 00:33:32,365
It was because you were annoying
and I was bored.

467
00:33:40,206 --> 00:33:41,833
I'll go grab a taxi. Wait here.

468
00:33:44,335 --> 00:33:46,879
Take this with you, Nam-mo!

469
00:34:07,733 --> 00:34:10,903
I didn't get the fruit basket for you.
It's for your sister.

470
00:34:11,737 --> 00:34:12,989
Take it home with you.

471
00:34:22,915 --> 00:34:25,418
I started seeing you
because you were annoying.

472
00:34:26,627 --> 00:34:28,713
That's how it was at the start!

473
00:34:31,924 --> 00:34:33,467
But I've fallen for you.

474
00:34:35,845 --> 00:34:39,182
I'll still like you
even when your situation worsens.

475
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:45,021
What can I do when I still care for you
even after all the humiliation?

476
00:34:50,693 --> 00:34:54,030
Jeez, I can't stand this stupid melodrama!

477
00:34:55,198 --> 00:34:56,449
Mom…

478
00:34:58,451 --> 00:34:59,869
Get over here, Nam-mo.

479
00:34:59,952 --> 00:35:01,412
Mom, are you drunk?

480
00:35:01,495 --> 00:35:02,496
Come on!

481
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:08,294
Life will get really tiring
if you start squabbling so soon.

482
00:35:09,128 --> 00:35:11,505
If you're not taking this home,
I'll take it--

483
00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:14,300
No, ma'am. I'm going to eat everything.

484
00:35:14,383 --> 00:35:15,384
Really?

485
00:35:15,968 --> 00:35:17,178
Good. Come here, Nam-mo.

486
00:35:20,389 --> 00:35:21,849
Carry it for her.

487
00:35:25,478 --> 00:35:26,729
Why don't we

488
00:35:27,939 --> 00:35:29,857
cure our hangover?

489
00:35:29,941 --> 00:35:31,359
Let's go. Come inside.

490
00:35:42,453 --> 00:35:43,663
That hits the spot.

491
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,623
Gumiho.

492
00:35:47,708 --> 00:35:49,293
Wait, I meant… Mi-ho.

493
00:35:49,835 --> 00:35:53,381
For what it's worth,
Nam-mo makes amazing ramyeon, doesn't he?

494
00:35:55,216 --> 00:35:57,218
Here's your kimchi.

495
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:01,681
-I hope you haven't nagged at Mi-ho again.
-Of course, I didn't!

496
00:36:05,726 --> 00:36:07,561
Have some kimchi with your ramyeon.

497
00:36:11,732 --> 00:36:15,444
To think I gave birth to this brat
and kept him under my roof for decades…

498
00:36:15,528 --> 00:36:16,654
How unfortunate of me.

499
00:36:18,155 --> 00:36:20,908
You don't even like kimchi, Mom.

500
00:36:20,992 --> 00:36:22,702
What do you mean? I love it.

501
00:36:37,925 --> 00:36:38,884
Eat up.

502
00:36:40,011 --> 00:36:42,722
My mom never gives the egg yolk
to anyone, not even me.

503
00:36:42,805 --> 00:36:44,473
I gave it to you plenty of times.

504
00:36:45,516 --> 00:36:47,393
You're so annoying. Hurry and eat up.

505
00:36:54,692 --> 00:36:57,153
Could we get the gloves custom-made?

506
00:36:57,236 --> 00:36:58,904
It's a bulk order.

507
00:36:58,988 --> 00:37:00,406
Oh, I see.

508
00:37:01,657 --> 00:37:03,367
So the latex needs to be imported?

509
00:37:03,451 --> 00:37:06,120
Okay, I understand.

510
00:37:08,372 --> 00:37:09,874
Wasting breath on the obvious.

511
00:37:10,624 --> 00:37:13,878
Why do you keep bringing up rubber gloves?

512
00:37:13,961 --> 00:37:16,213
Should surgeons wear
the dish-washing gloves?

513
00:37:16,297 --> 00:37:19,008
Do you think surgical operations
are the same as making kimchi?

514
00:37:19,091 --> 00:37:21,260
I'm hanging up! You're wasting my time.

515
00:37:33,481 --> 00:37:35,107
They won't even answer. Darn it.

516
00:37:37,318 --> 00:37:39,570
The manufacturer client list was here.

517
00:37:42,656 --> 00:37:43,657
What on earth?

518
00:37:45,701 --> 00:37:46,702
It's a mess.

519
00:37:47,953 --> 00:37:49,997
Did you go through the documents here?

520
00:37:50,081 --> 00:37:53,250
No, the cabinets here are in the shade.
That's bad feng shui.

521
00:37:57,963 --> 00:38:00,091
I swear I had these arranged neatly.

522
00:38:00,174 --> 00:38:02,760
IMPORT DECLARATION CERTIFICATES
CLIENT TRANSACTION INVOICE

523
00:38:06,347 --> 00:38:08,391
-Hey.
-Min-seong.

524
00:38:09,975 --> 00:38:11,227
So you're Min-seong.

525
00:38:11,811 --> 00:38:13,854
-Get a snack with your buddy.
-Min-seong!

526
00:38:17,441 --> 00:38:18,818
What are you doing here?

527
00:38:18,901 --> 00:38:20,319
Go to the study room now.

528
00:38:20,403 --> 00:38:23,072
-This guy came up to me--
-Don't mind him.

529
00:38:24,323 --> 00:38:27,076
This gentleman here is my colleague.

530
00:38:28,327 --> 00:38:31,580
I forgot to bring your meal today.

531
00:38:31,664 --> 00:38:33,374
Get something with your friends.

532
00:38:33,457 --> 00:38:36,961
No, ask the study room owner
to order you jjajangmyeon.

533
00:38:37,044 --> 00:38:38,587
Get going. Come on.

534
00:38:38,671 --> 00:38:39,839
Off you go.

535
00:38:39,922 --> 00:38:41,382
STUDY ROOM

536
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:52,518
Why are you back again?
What's the matter with you lot?

537
00:38:53,269 --> 00:38:56,439
Your son doesn't take after you.
He won't take my money.

538
00:38:58,149 --> 00:39:01,444
I bet you scared him
by forcing him to go upstairs.

539
00:39:03,404 --> 00:39:04,488
Next time,

540
00:39:06,824 --> 00:39:07,825
I'll be taking him.

541
00:39:36,604 --> 00:39:38,230
How many boxes do we have?

542
00:39:38,314 --> 00:39:41,817
It'll take more than a year
to sell them all in the domestic market!

543
00:39:41,901 --> 00:39:44,153
I'll look into wholesale dealers quickly.

544
00:39:44,987 --> 00:39:47,406
Your son had a plan this time--

545
00:39:48,699 --> 00:39:52,411
How could you place an order
on a bid you hadn't even won?

546
00:39:52,495 --> 00:39:53,829
Have you lost your senses?

547
00:39:54,663 --> 00:39:57,041
This time, we had the deal
almost in the bag--

548
00:39:57,124 --> 00:39:58,125
"Almost"?

549
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:00,211
"Almost"!

550
00:40:00,961 --> 00:40:05,382
Have Hyun-jun come quickly
and check the inventory.

551
00:40:06,759 --> 00:40:09,011
-Snap to it!
-Yes, sir.

552
00:40:31,784 --> 00:40:32,952
Aren't you a professional?

553
00:40:33,035 --> 00:40:35,621
Why are you holding back?
Is it because you are broke?

554
00:40:37,081 --> 00:40:39,166
Knock me down,
and I'll pay you, you broke bum!

555
00:40:43,045 --> 00:40:44,129
Take that.

556
00:40:49,802 --> 00:40:50,803
Jeez!

557
00:40:53,097 --> 00:40:54,098
Gosh.

558
00:40:59,562 --> 00:41:00,688
What was that for?

559
00:41:00,771 --> 00:41:02,356
You crazy bastard…

560
00:41:02,439 --> 00:41:03,607
Darn it!

561
00:41:07,069 --> 00:41:08,404
Today's your unlucky day.

562
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,786
I had a really bad day, you know.
Look at me.

563
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,330
You worthless scum!

564
00:41:18,414 --> 00:41:20,374
Hyun-jun! Hey, knock it off!

565
00:41:20,457 --> 00:41:21,584
Hey, stop it!

566
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:22,876
-Let me go!
-Enough!

567
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,545
You broke bastard!

568
00:41:27,548 --> 00:41:28,882
GYEONGIL MEDICAL SUPPLIES

569
00:41:30,509 --> 00:41:32,136
Hello, I'm with Typhoon Trading.

570
00:41:32,219 --> 00:41:34,763
-Hi.
-Do you perhaps have surgical gloves

571
00:41:34,847 --> 00:41:37,224
powdered with corn starch
instead of talcum powder?

572
00:41:37,308 --> 00:41:38,976
We only stock ones with talcum powder.

573
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:40,144
-Really?
-Yes.

574
00:41:40,227 --> 00:41:41,812
We don't have three million pairs.

575
00:41:42,855 --> 00:41:44,732
Right? Thank you for your time.

576
00:41:44,815 --> 00:41:48,027
I heard there was
a major incident of late.

577
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,862
-Pardon?
-About the surgical gloves.

578
00:41:50,779 --> 00:41:51,947
Everyone's in a frenzy.

579
00:42:06,128 --> 00:42:07,171
I've got it.

580
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,965
-What on… Hey, are you okay?
-Ms. Oh.

581
00:42:10,049 --> 00:42:12,092
-Wait.
-Take a seat.

582
00:42:13,677 --> 00:42:15,804
-Slow down.
-I figured it out.

583
00:42:15,888 --> 00:42:17,014
What do you mean?

584
00:42:17,097 --> 00:42:19,975
I know why Blaze Eagles
is short on supplies.

585
00:42:20,768 --> 00:42:23,354
Have you looked
into what I asked, Mr. Bae?

586
00:42:23,437 --> 00:42:26,899
Yes, I talked to the factory manager
in Malaysia just as you asked.

587
00:42:26,982 --> 00:42:30,277
One company placed an order
with Blaze Eagles two weeks ago

588
00:42:30,361 --> 00:42:31,654
for three million pairs.

589
00:42:31,737 --> 00:42:34,907
For three million? Doesn't that
match the quantity of our order?

590
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:37,576
-It's a Korean company too.
-A Korean company?

591
00:42:38,243 --> 00:42:40,412
-Can it be--
-Yes, it's Pyo Merchant Marine.

592
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:44,041
I've talked to all the wholesalers
dealing in medical supplies.

593
00:42:44,124 --> 00:42:46,794
There's a rumor that Pyo Merchant Marine
is seeking a wholesaler

594
00:42:46,877 --> 00:42:49,004
to take their bulk supply
of surgical gloves.

595
00:42:49,088 --> 00:42:52,675
Everyone is worried the large inventory
will cause prices to drop.

596
00:42:52,758 --> 00:42:54,301
They've lost their minds.

597
00:42:54,385 --> 00:42:57,513
They proceeded with the order
even when they had lost the bid?

598
00:43:03,852 --> 00:43:05,938
Turns out they have what we want.

599
00:43:09,233 --> 00:43:11,235
-What now? Don't tell me you're going.
-Mr. Kang.

600
00:43:11,318 --> 00:43:13,654
-No, wait.
-You shouldn't go see them.

601
00:43:13,737 --> 00:43:15,406
They'd never give us their stock.

602
00:43:15,489 --> 00:43:19,201
It will be like
banging your head against a wall.

603
00:43:19,284 --> 00:43:20,869
You know how ruthless they are.

604
00:43:20,953 --> 00:43:23,288
Mr. Kang, you know
it will be a waste of time.

605
00:43:23,372 --> 00:43:24,415
No.

606
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:27,793
At least I'll be able to see it myself.

607
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:34,758
Mr. Kang.

608
00:44:09,168 --> 00:44:10,335
What are you up to?

609
00:44:13,547 --> 00:44:15,716
Why sneak in like some common thief

610
00:44:16,341 --> 00:44:19,052
and take a peek at our goods
without permission?

611
00:44:19,136 --> 00:44:20,763
I thought you're here to see me.

612
00:44:21,472 --> 00:44:22,848
Did you order these?

613
00:44:24,683 --> 00:44:27,352
-Who will you sell these to?
-Jeez, you stress me out.

614
00:44:28,061 --> 00:44:30,981
That's all you've got to ask
after coming all the way here?

615
00:44:32,274 --> 00:44:33,650
By any chance,

616
00:44:35,819 --> 00:44:37,780
did you set our warehouse on fire?

617
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,286
-To get the deal instead?
-What, me?

618
00:44:45,746 --> 00:44:48,332
Do you think I can't sell this junk?

619
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:51,251
I got it wrong, right?

620
00:44:52,753 --> 00:44:54,505
You may not be in your right mind,

621
00:44:55,088 --> 00:44:57,299
but you were never such a lowlife, right?

622
00:44:58,467 --> 00:45:00,928
Thanks for your kind words, punk.

623
00:45:06,558 --> 00:45:08,185
Can you get out of my sight now?

624
00:45:09,019 --> 00:45:11,063
I'm having a really bad day today.

625
00:45:14,191 --> 00:45:15,359
If that's not the case…

626
00:45:18,403 --> 00:45:19,321
I'm saying,

627
00:45:20,822 --> 00:45:21,907
if you didn't

628
00:45:23,575 --> 00:45:24,826
set the fire…

629
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,706
let me borrow these gloves.

630
00:45:33,085 --> 00:45:34,878
-Come again?
-Or sell them to me.

631
00:45:36,088 --> 00:45:37,798
I may not be able to pay you right away.

632
00:45:37,881 --> 00:45:41,218
-But I'll add a handsome interest--
-Wake up, you clown.

633
00:45:41,301 --> 00:45:43,971
Are you that desperate?

634
00:45:44,054 --> 00:45:45,055
Yeah.

635
00:45:45,847 --> 00:45:47,516
I'm really desperate.

636
00:45:53,272 --> 00:45:54,815
If that's the case, Tae-poong,

637
00:45:56,108 --> 00:45:57,985
show me how much you want them.

638
00:45:58,735 --> 00:46:00,195
I might consider it then.

639
00:46:02,614 --> 00:46:06,952
Look, you're not going to have any luck
when you're standing tall.

640
00:46:08,245 --> 00:46:09,246
Come on.

641
00:46:10,956 --> 00:46:14,543
Lower your head humbly. There you go.

642
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:16,253
That's more like it!

643
00:46:17,212 --> 00:46:18,880
That's what I'm talking about.

644
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,843
Tell me everything you want.

645
00:46:24,011 --> 00:46:26,054
All I want in return are these gloves.

646
00:46:29,683 --> 00:46:30,767
What do I want?

647
00:46:37,816 --> 00:46:38,942
Nothing, you idiot.

648
00:46:40,152 --> 00:46:42,404
I'd rather burn them
than give them to you.

649
00:46:46,575 --> 00:46:48,410
I know they catch fire easily too.

650
00:46:53,373 --> 00:46:54,666
Hyun-jun!

651
00:47:02,174 --> 00:47:03,175
I…

652
00:47:07,971 --> 00:47:09,056
I was wrong.

653
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:12,851
I will…

654
00:47:13,644 --> 00:47:16,271
I apologize for everything.

655
00:47:19,941 --> 00:47:20,942
So,

656
00:47:22,778 --> 00:47:23,779
please…

657
00:47:26,782 --> 00:47:28,033
help me out here.

658
00:47:33,455 --> 00:47:35,290
Otherwise, my company won't survive.

659
00:47:43,674 --> 00:47:44,758
Please do me a favor.

660
00:47:54,226 --> 00:47:57,270
That was my goal in the first place.
To make you go bankrupt.

661
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:02,109
Even the back of your head
rubs me the wrong way.

662
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,838
TOJONG SUNDAE SOUP

663
00:48:36,101 --> 00:48:38,228
I thought soju would taste sweet
on a day like this.

664
00:48:40,439 --> 00:48:41,773
It's just as bitter.

665
00:48:43,984 --> 00:48:46,403
I wonder why you loved
this bitter thing so much.

666
00:48:52,409 --> 00:48:54,995
MAKGEOLLI, SUNDAE SOUP

667
00:49:19,311 --> 00:49:21,521
I should've joined you
for a drink back then.

668
00:49:26,568 --> 00:49:28,570
I should've poured you a glass at least.

669
00:49:45,962 --> 00:49:48,715
I never got to do this for you
when it was this easy.

670
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,846
I thought you'd wait for me.

671
00:50:00,185 --> 00:50:02,479
That breaks my heart the most.

672
00:50:06,399 --> 00:50:07,567
What about you, Dad?

673
00:50:09,903 --> 00:50:11,905
What upset you so much that night?

674
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:53,154
Welcome.

675
00:51:00,662 --> 00:51:02,956
-Can we get one more glass, ma'am?
-Sure.

676
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:08,086
Don't pour your own drink.
You'll bring your father bad luck.

677
00:51:10,922 --> 00:51:12,340
I'm here too, Mr. Kang.

678
00:51:14,509 --> 00:51:16,720
You're clueless
about the drinking etiquette.

679
00:51:21,266 --> 00:51:23,727
How did you know
I was saving a spot for my dad?

680
00:51:26,104 --> 00:51:27,731
I just do, punk.

681
00:51:28,315 --> 00:51:29,149
Drink up.

682
00:51:39,034 --> 00:51:40,035
Hey, Tae-poong.

683
00:51:40,118 --> 00:51:41,786
A bizarre thing happened to me.

684
00:51:43,288 --> 00:51:44,456
What kind of bizarre thing?

685
00:51:44,539 --> 00:51:48,418
Back when I was sleeping at your office
after arguing with my mom,

686
00:51:49,085 --> 00:51:51,630
that lady paid a visit
in the dead of night.

687
00:51:51,713 --> 00:51:54,966
You know, the lady
who used to work for your company.

688
00:51:59,638 --> 00:52:01,431
I swear I had these arranged neatly.

689
00:52:03,934 --> 00:52:07,437
Ms. Cha, did you reorganize
the files in this office?

690
00:52:08,021 --> 00:52:09,272
I took a look yesterday

691
00:52:09,981 --> 00:52:13,318
and noticed how they were arranged
by date from right to left.

692
00:52:14,194 --> 00:52:16,029
I know that's how you arrange files.

693
00:52:17,155 --> 00:52:19,407
So, he would never rip out a page
even if he made errors.

694
00:52:19,491 --> 00:52:20,742
DATA ENTRY ERROR, NEXT PAGE

695
00:52:24,621 --> 00:52:26,915

Darn it.

700
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,335
Why do those bastards
keep insisting it's here?

701
00:53:14,045 --> 00:53:16,631
What can it be
that they're throwing this hissy fit?

702
00:53:27,017 --> 00:53:29,019
What are you doing, Ms. Cha?

703
00:53:29,102 --> 00:53:30,854
What exactly are you doing?

704
00:53:34,899 --> 00:53:37,235
Why is everyone out to get me?

705
00:53:38,945 --> 00:53:42,657
Why won't any of you just leave me alone?

706
00:53:42,741 --> 00:53:43,908
Ms. Cha!

707
00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:52,876
I bet it was you.

708
00:53:55,545 --> 00:53:57,005
You hid it, didn't you?

709
00:53:58,089 --> 00:54:00,759
You knew everything
and hid it on purpose, didn't you?

710
00:54:02,177 --> 00:54:03,553
What do you mean?

711
00:54:03,636 --> 00:54:05,472
What is it that I supposedly hid?

712
00:54:06,139 --> 00:54:07,348
You know what.

713
00:54:07,432 --> 00:54:10,143
Without it, my son will be in big trouble.

714
00:54:10,226 --> 00:54:13,271
What are you talking about?
I won't know unless you tell me.

715
00:54:13,354 --> 00:54:15,273
You know, the promissory note.

716
00:54:15,356 --> 00:54:16,483
Promissory note?

717
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:19,110
The proof that Pyo Bak-ho borrowed money.

718
00:54:19,694 --> 00:54:21,112
Are you working under his orders?

719
00:54:23,156 --> 00:54:24,365
You really have no idea.

720
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:28,411
Oh, no. It's truly missing.

721
00:54:28,495 --> 00:54:30,663
What do I do?

722
00:54:30,747 --> 00:54:32,665
-What's this promissory note?
-What am I to do?

723
00:54:32,749 --> 00:54:33,833
Talk to me.

724
00:54:34,959 --> 00:54:37,253
Why the hell do you need it?

725
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,424
You already saw that the ledger
was missing a page!

726
00:54:41,508 --> 00:54:44,969
-The loan must've been on there.
-So why are you looking for the note?

727
00:54:47,597 --> 00:54:48,598
Did he perhaps

728
00:54:49,724 --> 00:54:50,725
bribe you?

729
00:54:57,357 --> 00:54:58,358
Did he?

730
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:01,069
You're right.

731
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:05,448
He offered me money, and I took it.

732
00:55:06,241 --> 00:55:08,076
When your father's funeral was being held…

733
00:55:09,244 --> 00:55:12,831
While his body was in the funeral home,
I accepted a bribe.

734
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:16,209
A huge one, at that.

735
00:55:17,544 --> 00:55:21,339
My hand instinctively reached out
and wouldn't let go of that money.

736
00:55:23,049 --> 00:55:24,801
I had no other choice, okay?

737
00:55:24,884 --> 00:55:25,969
My wage was withheld,

738
00:55:26,052 --> 00:55:29,180
my husband is a total money pit,
and I couldn't pay my son's tutors!

739
00:55:29,264 --> 00:55:31,432
I needed money to keep my family afloat!

740
00:55:31,516 --> 00:55:33,059
So what?

741
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:35,019
What about the others?

742
00:55:37,689 --> 00:55:39,232
Didn't you ever think of them?

743
00:55:41,109 --> 00:55:43,611
You're really clueless, aren't you?

744
00:55:45,029 --> 00:55:46,114
Even if I hadn't complied,

745
00:55:46,197 --> 00:55:49,617
Pyo Merchant Marine might've found it,
perhaps through a harsher way.

746
00:55:49,701 --> 00:55:51,536
Don't you agree? Let's be real.

747
00:55:51,619 --> 00:55:54,372
If they meant to pay,
they would've done it ages ago.

748
00:55:54,455 --> 00:55:57,584
-They were never going to pay it back.
-So what?

749
00:56:00,628 --> 00:56:01,796
"So what"?

750
00:56:05,758 --> 00:56:10,096
If I were you, Mr. Kang,
I'd give it to them and get it over with.

751
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:13,183
Think about how much we suffered
over that note.

752
00:56:13,266 --> 00:56:15,310
We're about to go bankrupt,
and Ms. Oh got hurt.

753
00:56:15,393 --> 00:56:17,770
Who knows what will happen next?

754
00:56:18,479 --> 00:56:20,440
So let's find that note
and give it to them.

755
00:56:20,523 --> 00:56:21,858
-Come on.
-Listen, Ms. Cha!

756
00:56:26,237 --> 00:56:28,323
Don't you feel bad for my father?

757
00:56:30,116 --> 00:56:32,660
Seriously, how could you do this to us?

758
00:56:32,744 --> 00:56:34,871
Snap out of it, Kang Tae-poong!

759
00:56:35,496 --> 00:56:39,083
Why dwell on the dead man?
The living must go on!

760
00:56:57,602 --> 00:56:59,020
What in the world…

761
00:56:59,103 --> 00:57:01,105
MOMO'S PUB

762

TYPHOON TRADING
CEO KANG TAE-POONG

763
00:57:48,444 --> 00:57:49,612
Tae-poong will…

764
00:57:51,781 --> 00:57:53,449
do a good job.

765
00:57:54,158 --> 00:57:55,493
"He'll do a good job."

766
00:57:56,828 --> 00:57:57,996
That's what he said.

767
00:57:58,079 --> 00:57:59,497
He said you'd do a good job.

768
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:36,492

770
00:59:01,267 --> 00:59:02,435
Mr. Kang…

771
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:13,821
Ms. Oh.

772
00:59:15,531 --> 00:59:16,658
I'm sorry to bother you,

773
00:59:18,993 --> 00:59:21,496
but could you place
an order for this again?

774
00:59:24,999 --> 00:59:27,502
TYPHOON TRADING
CEO KANG TAE-POONG

775
00:59:29,671 --> 00:59:31,172
I think it reflects poorly…

776
00:59:33,758 --> 00:59:35,259
on the company, not on myself.

777
00:59:39,555 --> 00:59:41,224
Please take care of it.

778
00:59:43,935 --> 00:59:44,936
Where are you going?

779
00:59:52,485 --> 00:59:54,529
To do my job.

780
01:00:07,125 --> 01:00:09,627
What kind of a jerk
parks their car this way?

781
01:00:10,586 --> 01:00:12,213
They didn't even leave their number.

782
01:00:29,021 --> 01:00:31,774
At least you're consistently ill-mannered,
I'll give you that.

783
01:00:31,858 --> 01:00:33,568
You know Ms. Cha Seon-taek, don't you?

784
01:00:35,153 --> 01:00:36,154
"Cha Seon-taek"?

785
01:00:38,364 --> 01:00:40,158
What, as in tea selection?

786
01:00:40,241 --> 01:00:42,076
You won't be seeing her again

787
01:00:43,786 --> 01:00:45,663
because I found out everything.

788
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:50,251
I don't follow.

789
01:00:51,294 --> 01:00:52,336
By any chance…

790
01:00:55,548 --> 01:00:57,258
did my father come to you…

791
01:00:59,719 --> 01:01:00,845
to ask for help?

792
01:01:09,896 --> 01:01:11,314
What a strange thing to say.

793
01:01:13,983 --> 01:01:16,444
How could I have met Mr. Kang
when he's long gone?

794
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:30,666
Look closely.

795
01:01:32,668 --> 01:01:34,504
Mr. Kang is right here.

796
01:01:36,047 --> 01:01:37,173
You've lost your mind.

797
01:01:44,222 --> 01:01:45,097
What's wrong?

798
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:47,391
Do you feel anxious?

799
01:01:48,726 --> 01:01:50,645
Sure, your father was just as anxious.

800
01:01:51,771 --> 01:01:53,481
Watching your company go bankrupt

801
01:01:54,565 --> 01:01:56,359
must make your stomach churn.

802
01:02:01,113 --> 01:02:02,406
Even if it kills me,

803
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:06,619
Typhoon Trading will never go down.

804
01:02:24,804 --> 01:02:28,641
Why else would a trading company's owner
visit you if not to strike a deal?

805
01:02:32,311 --> 01:02:34,856
-A deal?
-You have surgical gloves.

806
01:02:35,898 --> 01:02:37,149
Sell them to me.

807
01:02:38,401 --> 01:02:39,235
What?

808
01:02:41,737 --> 01:02:43,406
I hope you'll give me a discount.

809
01:02:45,491 --> 01:02:47,410
I suffered a huge loss, you see.

810
01:02:51,497 --> 01:02:54,000
I thought you had
a good head on your shoulders.

811
01:02:55,167 --> 01:02:58,254
-Turns out it was all a bluff.
-Why won't you sell them to me?

812
01:02:59,297 --> 01:03:01,549
I bet you're losing sleep
over what to do with them.

813
01:03:01,632 --> 01:03:03,342
That's none of your concern.

814
01:03:03,426 --> 01:03:05,928
Here's the most important issue.
Do you have money?

815
01:03:07,221 --> 01:03:09,432
I'm asking if you can pay for the gloves.

816
01:03:12,935 --> 01:03:15,605
-You're asking me about money?
-That's right.

817
01:03:15,688 --> 01:03:20,234
Given our history,
you can't be considering buying on credit.

818
01:03:21,110 --> 01:03:22,111
I do have it.

819
01:03:23,321 --> 01:03:24,322
The money, that is.

820
01:03:32,496 --> 01:03:34,498
You took money from my father.

821
01:03:34,582 --> 01:03:36,375
Shouldn't that be enough to cover it?

822
01:03:39,921 --> 01:03:41,714
-What?
-Haven't you heard?

823
01:03:46,761 --> 01:03:48,721
I'm talking about your promissory note.

824
01:03:51,057 --> 01:03:53,601
It seems you haven't heard
that I recovered it.

825
01:03:57,897 --> 01:03:59,231
"Promissory note"?

826
01:04:01,233 --> 01:04:02,818
I can't recall if such a thing existed.

827
01:04:03,694 --> 01:04:06,155
The money from nine years ago
should now be…

828
01:04:07,573 --> 01:04:09,075
What with the interest… No.

829
01:04:09,742 --> 01:04:11,702
Throw in all the overdue interest,

830
01:04:13,162 --> 01:04:14,455
and this office

831
01:04:16,457 --> 01:04:18,084
and the building should be mine.

832
01:04:24,548 --> 01:04:27,802
Watch your darn mouth, you little brat.

833
01:04:28,928 --> 01:04:33,057
Don't you worry.
I couldn't care less about your building.

834
01:04:34,183 --> 01:04:35,017
Then what?

835
01:04:35,101 --> 01:04:37,770
I want the three million pairs
of gloves in your storage.

836
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:40,231
What?

837
01:04:42,191 --> 01:04:43,567
I'm losing out big time, aren't I?

838
01:04:45,194 --> 01:04:46,195
What's the matter?

839
01:04:49,073 --> 01:04:50,241
Do you think I don't have it?

840
01:04:56,372 --> 01:04:57,540
That may be the case.

841
01:05:15,057 --> 01:05:17,768
SEOUL OFFICE OF PUBLIC PROCUREMENT SERVICE

842
01:05:23,816 --> 01:05:25,776
Why is this young man here?

843
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,486
Did I call him over?

844
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:28,571
-No.
-What perfect timing.

845
01:05:28,654 --> 01:05:32,324
-We've been talking about our deal.
-Deal? What deal?

846
01:05:32,408 --> 01:05:35,411
Do you think your company
can deliver the goods on time?

847
01:05:35,995 --> 01:05:39,498
Try it if you can.
We can deliver our goods even today.

848
01:05:39,582 --> 01:05:41,042
Deals aren't some children's game.

849
01:05:41,125 --> 01:05:43,377
We have time until the deadline.
Respect the protocol.

850
01:05:43,461 --> 01:05:45,963
To put it bluntly,
Typhoon Trading hasn't messed up yet.

851
01:05:46,047 --> 01:05:47,048
Exactly. Oh, my gosh.

852
01:05:47,131 --> 01:05:49,300
Hey, you're being nice to us
all of a sudden.

853
01:05:49,383 --> 01:05:51,635
As if! What brings you here anyway?

854
01:05:52,344 --> 01:05:55,056
-It's just--
-We want to ask for a deadline extension.

855
01:05:55,765 --> 01:05:57,808
-You shouldn't have led with that.
-Why not?

856
01:05:57,892 --> 01:05:59,852
Mistakes happen. We're only humans.

857
01:05:59,935 --> 01:06:02,104
Haven't you been listening?

858
01:06:03,856 --> 01:06:05,524
-I'm giving up now.
-My goodness.

859
01:06:05,608 --> 01:06:07,526
Take my gut and do what you want.

860
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:08,986
Tell him he can take my gut.

861
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:10,488
He says to open up his stomach.

862
01:06:11,072 --> 01:06:12,823
Who is sick? I'm a doctor.

863
01:06:14,241 --> 01:06:16,452
Thank you.

864
01:06:16,535 --> 01:06:17,495
Hello?

865
01:06:18,329 --> 01:06:19,705
Hey, Ms. Oh. What's up?

866
01:06:22,833 --> 01:06:23,834
Hello?

867
01:06:28,506 --> 01:06:29,590
What?

868
01:06:30,925 --> 01:06:33,010
Pick up the pace,
and we can all wrap up quickly.

869
01:06:33,094 --> 01:06:35,262
Speed it up even more,
and we'll be out in no time.

870
01:06:36,347 --> 01:06:37,640
Hey, watch your step.

871
01:06:39,809 --> 01:06:41,811
Don't you dare touch them!

872
01:06:41,894 --> 01:06:43,187
You bastards.

873
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:45,648
So, did you come
looking for a fight, Tae-poong?

874
01:06:45,731 --> 01:06:48,359
Bring it on. Come at me, you punk.

875
01:06:55,366 --> 01:06:56,200
Jerk.

876
01:06:56,283 --> 01:06:57,118
Ms. Oh.

877
01:06:59,453 --> 01:07:00,704
Are you out of your mind?

878
01:07:02,248 --> 01:07:03,749
You did it, didn't you?

879
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:18,514
LOVE BEYOND FEAR

880
01:07:50,629 --> 01:07:53,549
TYPHOON FAMILY

881
01:07:53,632 --> 01:07:55,593
You better have it

882
01:07:55,676 --> 01:07:59,054
if you want to save that petty position
your father left behind.

883
01:07:59,138 --> 01:08:00,514
Will an apology change anything?

884
01:08:00,598 --> 01:08:01,807
My father will hear it too.

885
01:08:01,891 --> 01:08:04,310
And you'll hear it too.

886
01:08:04,393 --> 01:08:05,811
I have to find it quickly.

887
01:08:05,895 --> 01:08:08,189
I was feeling rushed
and I'm running out of time.

888
01:08:08,272 --> 01:08:10,232
You can go with Honey Poong

889
01:08:10,316 --> 01:08:12,776
or Baby Poong, something like that.

890
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:14,862
Why don't we take a day trip
to the sea with Beom?

891
01:08:16,071 --> 01:08:17,156
Tae-poong, that kid,

892
01:08:17,239 --> 01:08:19,450
knows about the promissory note,
but he doesn't have it.

893
01:08:19,533 --> 01:08:22,494
Don't you want to know
why I need those gloves?

894
01:08:22,578 --> 01:08:23,787
But I never beg.

895
01:08:23,871 --> 01:08:25,206
I make others beg.

896
01:08:26,707 --> 01:08:31,712
