TYPHOON FAMILY

2
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,446
TYPHOON TRADING

3
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,872
"The Four Asian Dragons."

4
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:26,086
The legend is being written as we speak
here in Seoul, South Korea.

5
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:30,465
I'm here at Typhoon Trading,
one of the small businesses in Ulchiro

6
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,009
playing a central role
in the country's economic growth.

7
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:43,728
CEO KANG JIN-YOUNG
TYPHOON TRADING

8
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,692
The company has survived 26 long years

9
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,153
in the notoriously competitive
import market.

10
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,863
The collaboration of roughly ten employees

11
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:59,619
and their hard work
is what made this achievement possible.

12
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:02,247
One thing of note
is that all employees agree

13
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,165
that they find happiness
not in personal gain

14
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,875
but in the company's success

15
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,711
and securing a better life
for their neighbors and fellow citizens.

16
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:13,258
We rarely chat during office hours
to keep our focus on our daily tasks.

17
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,308
MANAGER GO MA-JIN
TYPHOON TRADING

18
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,852
I'd appreciate a raise, sure.

19
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:27,230
But our company's future
can only be as bright as our nation's.

20
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,566
Moreover, only the company's future

21
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,985
can ensure my future.

22
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,863
So, I'm not hung up about my wage.

23
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,534
ASSISTANT MANAGER BAE SONG-JUNG

24
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,668
Oh, no. It doesn't work that way.

25
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,297
Well, I'm sorry.

26
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,008
No, I wasn't talking to you.

27
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,261
DIRECTOR KOO MYUNG-GWAN

28
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:02,265
Our business partner in Singapore
has gifted us this orchid.

29
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,933
"Friendship between gromwell and orchid,"

30
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,645
-in other words, true friendship--
-Cut!

31
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,814
Isn't it too lackluster?

32
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,612
Excuse me.

33
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,697
Don't you find work challenging?

34
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,865
BOOKKEEPER OH MI-SEON

35
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,074
Were you talking to me?

36
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,787
From 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.,

37
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,123
I work 11 hours in total daily.

38
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:30,126
But it's not challenging at all.
It's part of my daily routine.

39
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:39,218
I find meaning in all my tasks,
even the insignificant ones.

40
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:43,056
Oops, I'm sorry.

41
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,898
The national economy
can have its ups and downs.

42
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:55,193
I think what matters
is our unwavering resolve.

43
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:59,072
I want the whole country
to stick together at all times.

44
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:03,910
These hard-working people are driving
local small businesses to the world stage.

45
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,995
Thanks to their efforts,

46
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,580
the legend of the Four Asian Dragons

47
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,291
and the Miracle on the Hangang River
will continue on.

48
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,237
Now,

49
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,573
let us turn to our youths,
the ones our future depends on.

50
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,244
Mooching off the wealth
their parents worked hard to earn,

51
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:49,497
these young people indulge in pleasures
and only seek one big score.

52
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,749
-Come on!
-Let's go in.

53
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,211
Seriously, you little punk.

54
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,505
Excuse me. Do you have a minute?

55
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,923
We've got hot babes tonight!

56
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,592
What do you think about the Orange Tribe?

57
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:05,638
As one of the citrus fruits,
oranges are tangy and sweet.

58
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:10,601
I don't quite understand
why it is used to refer to young people.

59
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,979
Do you consider yourselves
a part of the Orange Tribe

60
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,523
or just a regular Generation X?

61
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,067
You can't put labels on the youth.

62
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,569
-Will this be aired on TV?
-Well…

63
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:20,862
Can I say a short piece?

64
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:24,407
-I love you, Mom. Love you, Eul-nyeo.
-I love you, Jeong-mi.

65
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,160
-I love you, Mom.
-Thank you, that will be all. Cut!

66
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,746
-Let's go, Korea!
-Let's go!

67
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,248
-Will this really make the news?
-Yes.

68
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,167
-Get over here, Yun-seong.
-Mom, I love you…

69
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,547
The youths' extravagant spending habits
are compromising our society.

70
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:41,924
Hang on.

71
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,134
What's with this shirt?

72
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,637
Is this the designer brand
founded by the Arman family of Italy,

73
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,849
-Empario--
-Not Empario but Giorgia.

74
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:53,019
-This is Giorgia, people.
-Take it off.

75
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:54,771
-Let me try it.
-No way.

76
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,731
Come on, just this once.

77
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,405
Everybody, join me. Come on!

78
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,498
I'll pair you up, okay? Come along.

79
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,500
No thanks. I'm waiting for my friends.

80
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,376
They should be here by now.

81
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,546
Okay, miss. Come on. Please take a seat.

82
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,756
Let's go.

83
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,883
All right.

84
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,384
Look, they're here!

85
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,969
-Where?
-Over there.

86
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,638
They must've just gotten here.

87
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,556
Jump!

88
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,351
Hold on.

89
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,920
You're with DJ "Sexy Tiger" Seong-ho.

90
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,965
This is Julianie Dance Festival!

91
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,147
I love it.

92
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,616
I really loved it. All right.

93
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,744
Now, last but not least…

94
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,414
Hold on.

95
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,166
I see familiar faces.

96
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,337
At the moment,
they're the hottest crew in Apgujeong.

97
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,089
Give it up

98
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,759
for the Apgujeong Boys!

99
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,818
Let's go!

100
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,814
All the liquor is yours.

101
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:44,982
You can have them all.

102
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,442
You get a 75-mL glass if you're alone.

103
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,486
If you're a pair,
each of you gets a 37-mL shot!

104
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,404
-It's all yours!
-Okay!

105
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:54,158
Now seems to be the best time
for some slow dancing.

106
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,451
If you're craving company,

107
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,953
grab a partner.

108
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,997
Have a romantic time for 20 minutes.

109
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:12,843
BABE, I LOVE YOU TO DEATH

110
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:18,349
MY HEART BURNS FOR YOU

111
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:23,062
I LOVE YOU 24-7-365

112
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,452
What's with all these messages…

113
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,454
Tae-poong!

114
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,998
Are you swinging by?

115
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,333
Gosh, I got the rooms mixed up. Sorry.

116
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,751
-Have fun.
-Wait, Tae-poong.

117
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,296
Scoot, guys. Come on.

118
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,880
-What is it?
-Tae-poong!

119
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,593
-I missed you so much!
-Goodness, Yu-rim.

120
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,219
Are you in the next room? I'll join you.

121
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,512
-Just have fun here.
-No way--

122
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,891
Typical for Kang Tae-poong.

123
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,604
You think you can just leave
after ruining my party?

124
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,608
All right,
I'll pay for the food you threw.

125
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,443
Let me give you a piece of advice.

126
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,028
Dance out on the floor, all right?

127
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,406
You're at a club, so go dancing.
Don't be a bunch of sourpusses.

128
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,158
I'm off, then.

129
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,382
Let's be real. This evens things out.

130
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,427
I'll really get going now.

131
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:38,262
Hey.

132
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,354
Out of my way, damn it.

133
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,773
Who do you think you are?

134
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,652
You arrogant punk.

135
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,278
What was that?

136
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,906
Did you call me, sir?

137
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:00,576
Jeez.

138
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,955
Damn it.

139
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,166
-You.
-Yes, sir?

140
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,751
Hey.

141
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,295
-What are you doing?
-Didn't I tell you I disliked the room?

142
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,005
Come on, look at me.

143
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,508
That's enough.

144
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,220
I practically pay your wage, remember?

145
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,971
You brat.

146
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,474
Give it a rest, okay?

147
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,059
You've done enough.

148
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:26,852
You can leave now.

149
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,562
Stop it already, you two.

150
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,605
You should get going.

151
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:30,648
Don't stick around.

152
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,908
-That might be the end of him.
-Who? Your pal?

153
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,827
No, your pal, you idiot.

154
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,620
Dang it.

155
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,512
My Armani…

156
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,521
Not Empario

157
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,274
but Giorgia.

158
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,464
Move aside!

159
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,008
-Let's scram.
-Hey, you!

160
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,634
Out of the way!

161
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,809
Beat it, you punks.

162
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,352
Prop this bastard up.

163
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,521
Hey, Nam-mo. Damn it!

164
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,487
Oh, man.

165
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,866
Go on, come at me.

166
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,117
Get yourself over here, punk.

167
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,870
I dare you to try that kick from earlier.

168
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,831
-Should we go for it? Let's do it!
-Yes!

169
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,055

00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,392
-This way.
-Let's go.

172
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,228
Anything's fine with me.

173
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,688

COUNSELING OFFICE

175
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,945
Hello.

176
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,366
The World Geography course is full.

177
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,953
I don't need a chair. I can just stand
at the back of the lecture hall.

178
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:52,456
Be that as it may, we'll get in trouble
if we sign up more than 120 students.

179
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,376
Take the special course
coming up in the next month.

180
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,714
Take the Earth Science course this month.

181
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,468
Okay.

182
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,765
Here.

183
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,894
The tuition fees have gone up.
It's 40,000 won.

184
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,981
What? It's… 40,000 won?

185
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,275
Oh, no.

186
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,612
Just a second.

187
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,411
Do you perhaps take bus tokens?

188
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:37,585

GANGNAM POLICE STATION

191
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,307
-Why, you!
-I can't stand this!

192
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,934
-Let go!
-Cut it out already!

193
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,728
-Jeez.
-What do you think you're doing?

194
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,439
-Wang Nam-mo.
-Hey, it's Eul-nyeo.

195
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,816
"Eul-nyeo"? You dare call my name?

196
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,860
-What brought you here?
-What do you think?

197
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,654
Do you think I'm your peer?

198
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,656
I brought you into this world, punk.

199
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,658
Why did you lose your shirt,
you scrawny brat?

200
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,286
-My chest!
-Oh, no…

201
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,370
Oh, my gosh.

202
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,914
Are you okay, Tae-poong?

203
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,540
-Oh, you poor boy.
-I'm fine.

204
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,583
-You, Tae-poong!
-Yes?

205
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,919
Don't tell me you want to hit him, too.

206
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:24,089
Of course. Let's not be particular.
We're responsible for these boys together.

207
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,717
-I insist.
-Please, he's just a little boy.

208
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,053
-No, he's a grown man.
-Oh, no…

209
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:32,431
Okay, then. But no smacking in the face.

210
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,267
Please aim at the back of his head.
He doesn't use his brain anyway.

211
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,394
-Mom, I injured my head.
-Still, this will be better.

212
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,438
Guard your face.
I had a nose like Won Bin's, but…

213
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,149
-Oh, no.
-Please, Ms. Kim!

214
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,109
-Unbelievable.
-Oh, dear.

215
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,988
Anyone can get a job these days.
Why won't you even try?

216
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,239
Hey, lady!

217
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,451
-Keep it down, will you?
-You keep it down, you punk!

218
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,162
-How dare you butt in?
-That's enough! Stop it!

219
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:58,082
-Knock it off!
-Come down.

220
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:01,835
Now, that's enough. Let's all calm down.

221
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,213
The assault may not be an issue
since they all threw punches.

222
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,383
But the club is pressing charges for
business disruption and property damage.

223
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,426
They give harsher punishment
if more than two are involved.

224
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,637
You'll have to settle.

225
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,180
-With that punk?
-He started it.

226
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,765
We're not settling.

227
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,857
He should be held accountable
for his actions.

228
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,110
-But honey.
-Let's go home now.

229
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,362
He's an adult. Let him fend for himself.

230
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:32,241
If you leave them be,
they can get a record.

231
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:36,286
I'm afraid you're talking
to the wrong person.

232
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,414
Please talk to him directly.

233
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,249
Of course.

234
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,460
You wouldn't mind what happens
to your castaway son.

235
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,547
Shush, Tae-poong.

236
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,591
-Don't be like this, honey.
-Fancy running into you here, Mr. Kang.

237
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,225
I don't know what to say.

238
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,230
It couldn't be helped, right?

239
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,524
For what it's worth, I sorted things out.

240
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,942
You can ease your mind and go home.

241
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,528
Of course.

242
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,532
Let's go.

243
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,453
Don't gawk.

244
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,789
Why, you…

245
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,708
-My gosh!
-Bring it on!

246
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,418
Go away.

247
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,756
That boy is trouble.

248
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,884
-He should chop off that strand of hair.
-Shut it.

249
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,722
-Wait, honey.
-Excuse me. What do we do now?

250
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,182
-Can we…
-Do go after them!

251
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,767
Can we leave?

252
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,852
Mr. Pyo!

253
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,771
A SAFE NATION, BELOVED GANGNAM POLICE

254
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,357
I just wanted to say

255
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,444
that the young punks
will never come to their senses

256
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,738
if you settle the matter for them.

257
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:57,117
-Why don't we let them--
-We have enough unsavory issues, don't we?

258
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,703
Let's not turn this into one, too.

259
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:00,996
I understand.

260
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,082
Just a minute.

261
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,333
And…

262
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,212
as for the money
I brought up the last time,

263
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:12,091
please don't worry about it too much.

264
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,095
You're like a cat toying with a mouse.

265
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,765
Oh, no. Of course not, Mr. Pyo.

266
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,725
I understand your position.

267
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,771
Allow me to get the door.

268
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,570
Good night.

269
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:45,082
You'll end up stretching my ear.

270
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:48,544
I can assure you that it won't happen.

271
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,879
-You're unbelievable!
-Good night.

272
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:54,383
-I'm terribly sorry about my boy.
-Do you have plans for tomorrow?

273
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,386
Why are you asking that?
To meet up again after all this?

274
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,595
Stop right there, punk!

275
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,014
What are you looking for?

276
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,142
-No, stop it. Come on, Mom.
-Be quiet.

277
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:06,145
-Stay home and look back on your actions.
-You know I have someplace to go.

278
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,896
You're a piece of trash.

279
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,606
Come on, honey.

280
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:14,027
Any other half-wit
would've led with an apology

281
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,780
after dragging their parents
to the police station at this hour.

282
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,866
You have no manners, do you?

283
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,954
To think I considered
an idiot like you my own son…

284
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,291
I'm ashamed of myself.

285
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,173
Are you done?

286
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,009
-What?
-If you are, can I get 10,000 won?

287
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,927
It's gotten late and all.

288
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,477
How could you, honey?

289
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,106
Are you okay, Tae-poong?

290
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,192
What was that for?

291
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,903
Oh, no. Tae-poong…

292
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,201
Tae-poong.

293
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,608
To Incheon Station, please.

294
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,362
Hurry, young man.
The last train's coming in soon.

295
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,030
Thank you.

296
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,867
The last train is coming soon.

297
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,619
Please hurry.

298
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,871
It's the last train of the day.

299
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,689
Guys.

300
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,650
My dad slapped me today

301
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,945
for the first time ever.

302
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,574
He didn't even ask
why I got into the fight.

I'm sorry.

00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,255
The train is now approaching.

307
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:46,258
Please take a step back for your safety.

308
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,974
To maintain order within the train…

309
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,267
I'm sorry.

310
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,980
Please report to the nearest stewardess
or station staff.

311
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,778
Could I perhaps take it?

312
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,197
-Do you want to read it?
-Yes.

313
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,991

326
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,830
Whether to declare Geoyeo Motors bankrupt

327
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:07,208
has been left undecided for two months
after the forbearance agreement.

328
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,879
The verdict at long last
to stabilize the company.

329
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,465
Earlier today, the authorities
and major creditor banks

330
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:17,093
have agreed to extend
the principal repayment term

331
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:20,889
and reduce the interest rate
to the prime rate for Geoyeo Motors.

332
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:24,642
Geoyeo Motors now
has a glimmer of hope for survival.

333
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:28,021
On the other hand,
inspection into Asean Motors has revealed

334
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,773
that the company is unlikely to…

335
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,655
Oh, dear.

336
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,309
Jeez.

337
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:52,897
You shouldn't have slapped him
in the first place.

338
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,233
The regret kept you up all night.

339
00:28:56,151 --> 00:29:00,613
If you're so worried about him,
you could get him a car or something--

340
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,407
Don't be nonsensical!

341
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:06,619
Tae-poong is the only kid
who doesn't own a car around here.

342
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,455
Why does he get a car?

343
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,999
He's in that wretched state
because you coddle him so much.

344
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,334
Calm down. Fine, it's all my fault.

345
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:18,631
Still, he's the only kid thoughtful enough
to shine his father's shoes.

346
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,342
Did I ever ask him to do that?

347
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:24,262
-I'd rather he find a job.
-Lower your voice.

348
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,182
That kid…

349
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:37,233
Why would he say things
that he doesn't even mean?

350
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,360
He can be so hard to understand.

351
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,372
Excuse me. Hey, mister!

352
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,335
How careless.

353
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,128
Darn it.

354
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,812
Wake up, Tae-poong.
Take the phone. It's for you.

355
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,271
-Get up. Do you know what time it is?
-I'm up.

356
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,981
-You rascal.
-I'm up.

357
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:20,151
-I woke up five minutes ago.
-Look at all this mess.

358
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,028
-Out of the bed now.
-Don't!

359
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:24,113
Why would you pull back the curtains?

360
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,699
Hello?

361
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,619
Hey, Nam-mo.

362
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,705
Why aren't you in bed?
Isn't it too early for a phone call?

363
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,542
All out of the blue?

364
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,379
Why?

365
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,506
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

366
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,633
-Good morning, everyone.
-Good morning.

367
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:46,386
My morning's not going that well.
I've lost my appetite.

368
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:47,595
Oh, dear fall.

369
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,473
It's the season for clear skies
and Ms. Cha's weight gain.

370
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,142
-Are you suggesting I gained weight?
-I do apologize.

371
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,727
Jeez, does this have bean filling?

372
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:57,647
Red beans don't agree with me
because of my constitution.

373
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,649
-Where are you, Ms. Oh?
-Yes?

374
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,734
I want some coffee, Ms. Oh.
A two-two-three combo.

375
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,027
I'll take a two-two-four combo.

376
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,946
-I'll have the same one, please.
-Okay.

377
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,866
Aren't you going to say good morning,
Song-jung?

378
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:11,160
I'd like to go by "Jung" from now on.

379
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,204
How come? Did you join the Buddhist order?

380
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,207
I want a one-syllable name like Kang Min
from the series, Star in My Heart.

381
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,419
You used to press your palms all the time
like Cha In-pyo last year.

382
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,588
-What's the matter with you?
-Seriously…

383
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,091
Shall I be Shin Ae-la?

384
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:27,176
I don't think that will work.

385
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:34,934
FUTURE OF KOREA, MBS

386
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:43,735
Jeez, I'm about to lose my mind.

387
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,029
-You came.
-Hey.

388
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:50,199
Are you getting married or what?
This is way over the top.

389
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,743
-Do I look cool?
-Not at all.

390
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,995
Dude, your face.
Couldn't you have covered that up?

391
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,164
I'm wearing makeup to hide all my scars.

392
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,041
-Anyway, let's go.
-Hey, hold on.

393
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,667
Tell me what this is about first.

394
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,211
I can't reach that punk, Yun-seong.

395
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,380
He wouldn't check his pager
or answer the phone.

396
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,466
I was on the verge of losing it.

397
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,218
Could Yun-seong be ill or something?

398
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,720
I don't get why we can't reach him.

399
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,390
-So?
-What do you mean?

400
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:15,642
You're filling in for him.

401
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,061
-What?
-Just this once. It means so much to me.

402
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,354
I love the crocodile jacket.

403
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,356
-That'll be your character.
-Are you today's cast?

404
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,982
-No!
-Yes, we are.

405
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,609
-Please get ready quickly.
-No way!

406
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,903
-Not everyone's cut out for TV.
-It only takes an hour.

407
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,072
You can't put this on me.
I can't fill in for this.

408
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,699
-It'll only take 30 minutes.
-The length doesn't matter!

409
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,617
STUDIO I LOVE YOU

410
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,244
Watch out, Seattle.
Seoul has plenty of sleepless singles too.

411
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,956
They're lonely. Here comes Man No. 1.

412
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:41,626
I'm not a beast, per se,
but I'm looking for my beauty.

413
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,128
Sorry, I got a bit nervous.

414
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,630
MAN NO. 1
KIM CHU-SEOK, 27

415
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:48,967
I'm looking for a woman to enjoy a stroll
under the golden ginkgo trees.

416
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,552
I'm Man No. 1, Kim Chu-seok,

417
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,429
"chu" for fall and "seok" for evening.

418
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:56,057
Fall must be your season,
Mr. Kim Chu-seok.

419
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:56,975
-All right.
-Great.

420
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:01,270
But if you step on the ginkgo fruits,
the foul stench won't leave you.

421
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,230
That's true.

422
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,565
-It's time to meet Man No. 2!
-Man No. 2!

423
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:16,035
The moon she loves so much

424
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,912
It's going down

425
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,873
It's the downfall of the moon

426
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,709
Even if the moon went down

427
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,670
and the earth stopped spinning,
I'd stay by my love.

428
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:28,256
I'm Man No. 2, Wang Nam-mo.

429
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,882
Call me "Wang," as in king.

430
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,802
He seems to have
multiple tricks up his sleeve.

431
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,637
Next up is Man No. 3!

432
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,851
You're so fine!

433
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,519
OH MI-HO, KIM SE-NI, YOON MI-HWA

434
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:44,605
-How handsome!
-We've got a hunk!

435
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:47,483
Hello.

436
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,152
I'm Kang Tae-poong.

437
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,531
-I like flowers.
-Oh, my gosh.

438
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,533
He's my buddy.

439
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,038
Oh, right. I'm Man No. 3.

440
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,959
KANG TAE-POONG, 26, JOBLESS
HORTICULTURE MAJOR

441
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,127
I'm looking for my bride.

442
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,670
Now that I'm getting older,

443
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,756
-Look.
-my family's badgering me to get married.

444
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:10,673
Where?

445
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:16,262
Next is "Pour Your Heart Out,"
where the cast ask each other questions

446
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:18,097
to get to know each other better.

447
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:21,017
Please make the most of this time
to show your personality

448
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,811
and express your interest without reserve.

449
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,188
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

450
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:29,108
I have a question for Woman No. 2,
Ms. Kim Se-ni.

451
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,778
My family has
eight ancestral rites a year.

452
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:35,281
I'd like to know your thoughts
on families with multiple rites.

453
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:40,536
I believe that a family can only thrive
when its members respect their ancestors.

454
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,623
But times have changed,
and women also work.

455
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,125
This may sound a bit revolutionary,

456
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,419
but I'd propose cutting it to four times.

457
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:53,758
How would you react
if the man refuses to compromise?

458
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,928
I'm confident I can convince him
with my bubbly character.

459
00:34:57,011 --> 00:35:00,014
Can we see a bit of your bubbly character?

460
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,183
"How unbelievable."

461
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:09,107
Come to think of it, the ancestral rites
are an outdated tradition.

462
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,067
I'll get rid of all of them.

463
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:17,907
If I may, I have a question for Man No. 3.

464
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,826
You said you liked flowers earlier.

465
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,911
Which flower is your favorite?

466
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:24,163
Cosmos is my favorite.

467
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,749
But it's so common.

468
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,793
Rather than calling it common,

469
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,504
I'd say it is resilient.

470
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,339
Thank you.

471
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:34,799
Here.

472
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,009
You didn't have to.

473
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:41,264
Hang on.

474
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:42,723
What is this?

475
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,225
It's not our payday yet.

476
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:50,565
The Daebang Textile deal
brought us remarkable revenue last month.

477
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:54,610
So, I've decided to give you
a special bonus!

478
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,571
Thank you for your great work!

479
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,531
My gosh, Mr. Kang!

480
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,324
Thank you!

481
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,118
Goodness, Mr. Kang.

482
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,953
What can I say?

483
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:05,663
This is simply very good.

484
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:10,334
My gut tells me
it may be Daebang Textile again.

485
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:13,171
Could they be proceeding
with that mass order they mentioned?

486
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,173
-Ms. Oh.
-Yes.

487
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,301
This is Typhoon Trading.

488
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:25,141
STEAL MY HEART

489
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:33,149
Black cat Nero, Nero, Nero

490
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:36,527
My cute friend is a black cat

491
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:40,406
Black cat Nero, Nero, Nero

492
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:43,868
The troublemaker blows hot and cold

493
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,247
Good luck!

494
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,791
All right!

495
00:36:56,797 --> 00:37:00,259
-During all our time together
-During all our time together

496
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:04,805
-I never got to tell you
-I never got to tell you

497
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:08,392
My feelings for you

498
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,354
Remains the same

499
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:14,732
From the moment we first met

500
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:19,320
-Until I breathe my last
-Until I breathe my last

501
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,947
Only you

502
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:25,117
Have a place in my heart

503
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:28,955
For eternity

504
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:30,665
How charming.

505
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,962
-For eternity
-For eternity

506
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:43,177
-You're amazing!
-Way to go!

507
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:46,973
-Your very own Meg Ryans are all here.
-I loved it.

508
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,683
-Let's keep the great vibe going.
-Sure.

509
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,559
Please welcome Woman No. 1.

510
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:53,145
She'll be singing
Kim Hyun-jung's "Break up with Her."

511
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:56,857
WOMAN NO. 1: OH MI-HO, AGE 21
ASPIRING FLIGHT ATTENDANT

512
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:02,029
I wished she lied out of love for you

513
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,615
I don't think she's feeling well.

514
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:06,492
Is she crying?

515
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:09,620
I trusted you until the end like a fool

516
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:14,083
But even my last hope

517
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:17,420
Was shattered into pieces

518
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:21,090
Drunkenly, I sought you out

519
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:24,468
Only to see you embracing her

520
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,888
The tears are flowing from my eyes

521
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,016
Please pretend you never saw them

522
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,100
Join her. Go on.

523
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,226
Get up there.

524
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,103
It's not like much affection remains

525
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:38,316
But I want you to take it all away

526
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:42,570
A few days have passed
I thought I was over you

527
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,696
Okay.

528
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,698
You're amazing.

529
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:48,200
Yet I want you to come back

530
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,619
And I hate myself for it

531
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,538
She must've been dumped yesterday.

532
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,875
Abracadabra.

533
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,918
-Abracadabra.
-All right. Thank you.

534
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,712
-That will be all.
-Taekwon!

535
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,756
-Tae kwon do?
-A round of applause, please.

536
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,716
Let's give him a big hand.

537
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,766
-This is great.
-Oh, my goodness.

538
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,643
Just how much is it in total?

539
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:15,895
I'm wondering the same thing!

540
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,356
These people go really big.

541
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,858
We should get some eel for stamina.

542
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,985
Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Kang?

543
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,112
I don't know.

544
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,406
To be honest,

545
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:31,118
I find it rather overwhelming.

546
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:35,039
Our Italian business partner
demands an advance payment.

547
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:39,293
Acquiring this many goods
for Daebang Textile

548
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,837
seems rather risky to me.

549
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,215
But still, Mr. Kang.

550
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:46,384
This can be a big break for us.

551
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:50,638
Let's face it.
Daebang Textile is a big name.

552
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,932
You're right about this being a risk.

553
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:57,728
But for the company to expand,
we do need a huge deal like this one.

554
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,855
Hold on. How much is it worth?

555
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,023
Must you run the numbers?

556
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,900
It's at least worth two big ones.

557
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:04,276
The exchange rate is at 918 won.

558
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,862
Add the taxes and our margins…
One, seven, five.

559
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:14,787
-Gosh, it's over a hundred million won.
-What?

560
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,997
-That is…
-Goodness.

561
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,499
I mean, a hundred million won?

562
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:19,667
More than a hundred million.

563
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,961
In that case…

564
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,763
Come in.

565
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,151
-Mi-seon.
-Yes, sir?

566
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,490
What do you think?

567
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:55,161
-Pardon?
-About the deal with Daebang Textile.

568
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,621
I'd like to hear your take on it.

569
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:03,210
To be honest, I'd advise you against it.

570
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,547
You think so? Can you tell me why?

571
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:10,342
Daebang only offers us a favorable rate
because of the disadvantageous conditions.

572
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:14,430
Our Italian partner only offers us
the exclusive deals on advance payments.

573
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,933
Since that's the case,
it is just as you've said.

574
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,810
In this case,

575
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,480
the leverage requires too big a sum.

576
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:26,775
Our profits practically match
the interest we'd have to cover.

577
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:30,696
Sir.

578
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,823
If you don't mind me asking,

579
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,285
what's your decision?

580
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,751
The number you have dialed
is out of service.

581
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:46,921
-Have you heard from Yun-seong?
-Like I said, he's gone off the grid.

582
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,089
Are you sure you called his home?

583
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,675
-The number's out of service.
-Maybe you dialed the wrong number.

584
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,636
No way. I've tried three times.

585
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,764
Why won't he even page us?
What's he playing at?

586
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:59,600
Maybe he's gone on holiday
with his family.

587
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:03,437
At any rate, if you hadn't been there,
the show might have fallen through.

588
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,022
-Come on.
-What can I get you?

589
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,525
-A parfait?
-That is nowhere near enough.

590
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,193
-Are you serious?
-What about pork?

591
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,028
Pork? Try beef, dude.

592
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,738
-Good job today.
-Great work.

593
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:16,909
-During all our time together
-During all our time together

594
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:20,371
-I never got to tell you
-I never got to tell you

595
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:22,998
-Hurry over!
-My feelings…

596
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,341
Hi.

597
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,062
Mi-ho.

598
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,897
It's too late to go out.

599
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,857
Be quiet. Just go play.

600
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:51,735
Keep this a secret.

601
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:54,572
Hey!

602
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,243
Take care, ma'am.

603
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,411
I will.

604
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,461
Oh Mi-ho.

605
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:10,963
You left for MBS bright and early.

606
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:12,423
Where are you sneaking off to now?

607
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:15,843
I honestly have this important meeting.

608
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:16,927
Go back in.

609
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,804
Go on.

610
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,806
Off you go.

611
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:22,266
I'm home, Grandma.

612
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,226
Hey, I'm home. Let's get in.

613
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,311
Hello.

614
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:27,605
I'm Oh Mi-ho,
Inho Technical College Class of 1998.

615
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:30,524
My dream is to be
The Great Mother in the sky.

616
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,736
Like a caring mother,
I'll tend to the passengers' every need.

617
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:35,988
But we don't have a mother.

618
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:38,365
No, you don't.

619
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:49,668
What is she saying?

620
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:51,879
Dear?

621
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:55,215
Where did you find this Yankee Princess?

622
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,676
-Isn't she pretty?
-Forget it. I'm not doing it.

623
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,595
My spot is as good as guaranteed.

624
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,263
No job is ever guaranteed.

625
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:02,181
Practice again.

626
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:05,643
You're like a drill sergeant, bossing me
around for mock interviews.

627
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,353
EVEN WHEN I'M IN COLLEGE, I, OH MI-SEON…

628
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,687
What's this?

629
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:11,857
"Even when I'm in college,
I vow not to go to any group dates."

630
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,567
-Give it back.
-You won't?

631
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,444
I guess you'll get a scholarship, then!

632
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,321
-Give it back here!
-Go on group dates, girl!

633
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:18,614
Consider your age!

634
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:21,742
-What's with this melodramatic manifesto?
-Just give it back, will you?

635
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:24,662
-Big sis, I'm hungry.
-Did you have to hit me?

636
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,747
-Can I have some food?
-I want some, too.

637
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,458
Sure, I'll whip something up in no time.
You must be hungry.

638
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:32,252
-Get up already.
-Mi-seon mistreats me, Grandma.

639
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,312
Oh, shoot.

640
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,190
It's freezing.

641
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:46,160
Oh, dear. Let's see.

642
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:22,613
TYPHOON TRADING

643
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,948
-Here's the purchase agreement.
-All right.

644
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,793
-Mr. Bae.
-Yes?

645
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,461
-Which port is it coming in?
-Incheon.

646
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,004
And the number?

647
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,965
-Just a second. Let me check.
-Okay.

648
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,884
This is Manager Bae Song-jung
with Typhoon Trading.

649
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:30,639
We have a bulk order coming in.
When's the fastest it can be processed?

650
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,142
Unbelievable.

651
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,564
Gosh, Tae-poong!

652
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:40,816
Tae-poong.

653
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,943
I hear you were on the Studio I Love You.

654
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:46,321
Jeez, what a way to disgrace all men.

655
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,115
-Did you really?
-Is this true, Tae-poong?

656
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:50,742
Where are you going?

657
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,744
-There he goes again. Let's leave.
-Hey!

658
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:54,538
What's he driving anyway?

659
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:55,914
-Just walk.
-Why did you do it?

660
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:57,583
Why did you go on that show?

661
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,167
Just because.

662
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:02,087
When I asked you out,
you said you weren't interested in dating.

663
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,171
I did.

664
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:07,134
Let me stop you right there.

665
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,051
Yu-rim.

666
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,553
I can't believe this.

667
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:11,805
Hey.

668
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:13,473
You asked that prick out?

669
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,433
Hyun-jun.

670
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:15,684
Can you just leave?

671
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:18,145
You said you'd drop me home,
and we're here.

672
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:19,730
Tae-poong.

673
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,607
-I need to talk to you.
-Hey, wait…

674
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,108
Are you out of your mind?

675
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,777
Why, you little…

676
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:28,780
Get back in already.

677
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,449
I've waited for you for three hours.

678
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:31,950
Let's go.

679
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,952
-What's your deal? Let go. It hurts!
-Come along.

680
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:35,037
Let go already!

681
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:37,205
Gosh.

682
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:38,832
She clearly said she's not interested.

683
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:40,959
Shall I make the message clearer?

684
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,561
Get home now, Yu-rim.

685
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:01,980
I won't. I need to talk to you.

686
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:04,107
I have nothing to say to you.
Just hurry back…

687
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,286
Hey, Yu-rim. Hop back in already!

688
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:18,955
What's wrong with him?

689
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:20,916
Or I'll run you over.

690
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,918
Get away from Kang Tae-poong!

691
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,044
What do we do with him?

692
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:36,181
Are there only three of you?

693
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,183
What a shame.

694
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:39,685
My party has four guys.

695
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:44,022
Hey.

696
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,565
You can use my City Phone.

697
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,859
Dude, what's the point of this lame thing?

698
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:50,195
It only works around a payphone.

699
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:52,614
Are you up for shivering by a booth
on a freezing winter day?

700
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,616
-You'll end up stuttering.
-I was just offering.

701
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,326
-Hey, you're back.
-Hi.

702
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:59,705
Is Yu-rim going back
to the States or what?

703
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:00,706
Beats me.

704
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:03,041
The exchange rate is keeping
students abroad in Korea.

705
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:04,626
That's why Rodeo Street is so crowded.

706
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,920
Whenever she's around,
Pyo Hyun-jun loses his mind

707
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:07,921
and messes with him.

708
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:10,132
-What has he done wrong?
-Just go out with her.

709
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:12,175
She's been chasing after you
since eighth grade.

710
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:15,011
Stop spewing nonsense, you idiot.

711
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:15,929
Enough of that.

712
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,265
Have you heard from Yun-seong?

713
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,267
Is he ill or something?

714
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,519
Maybe his piles worsened.

715
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:23,645
-Piles?
-He had piles?

716
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:24,646
Yes, and it's nasty.

717
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,731
Guys.

718
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:29,151
I heard that Yun-seong
skipped town in the dead of night.

719
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:30,736
-What?
-He's working night shifts?

720
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,779
-Cut it out.
-I'm saying he ran away.

721
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,990
His family went broke
and just disappeared.

722
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:38,243
My mom's in a money pool with his mom.

723
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:39,161
What's with him?

724
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:41,204
Hey, you disloyal git.

725
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,999
Our friend is in trouble,
and that's all you're concerned about?

726
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:45,375
What a weirdo.

727
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:46,668
Where are you going, Tae-poong?

728
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:47,878
Where are you off to?

729
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:49,254
OVERDUE NOTICE

730
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,720
Did they really leave?

731
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:05,604
URGENT OVERDUE NOTICE

732
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:06,730
NOTICE ON UPCOMING SEIZURE

733
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,948
Hey, you. Who are you?

734
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:19,201
Hey!

735
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,287
Hey, Yun-seong!

736
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:24,372
Yun-seong!

737
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,499
Hey, Hwang Yun-seong!

738
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:26,708
It's me, Tae-poong.

739
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:27,834
Wait a second.

740
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:30,754
Just a moment.

741
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:37,511
I only came back
to see my house one last time.

742
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:38,887
Can't you just let me go?

743
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,680
That's all you've got to say?

744
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:44,059
What happened to your face?

745
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:45,519
Let's go grab a bite.

746
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:49,523
Hey, you'll get in trouble
if you're caught with me. Get going.

747
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,316
Trouble? What trouble?

748
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:54,402
I can take care of it.

749
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:57,656
Come on, now.

750
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:01,409
Tae-poong, don't trust people.

751
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,704
Trust put my family in this mess.

752
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,456
Turns out money comes before people.

753
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,083
Remember that, okay?

754
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:11,795
What on earth are you talking about?

755
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:15,507
Hey, you.

756
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,849
Take this, you idiot.

757
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,085
-I'll get going.
-Okay.

758
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:56,506
Hey, you.

759
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,303
Go to your mom, okay?

760
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:04,806
I'm not going to die.

761
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,601
I'm the sole heir to my family.

762
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:12,981
What a load of crap.

763
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:40,926
MAKGEOLLI, SUNDAE SOUP

764
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:18,088
Hey, this is heavy.

765
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:20,048
Dang it.

766
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:23,051
I think I just hurt myself.
Let's just go home, Tae-poong.

767
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:25,345
Hey.

768
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,138
You suggested quid pro quo.

769
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:29,224
Remember, Man No. 2?

770
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:33,812
They said agencies would reach out
after the show aired.

771
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:38,316
But the only one who keeps calling
is Man No. 1, Chu-seok or Chu-nam.

772
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:42,612
My dream is so hard to reach, buddy.

773
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:47,492
So this happens to be your dream.

774
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,703
Let me take a look.

775
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:53,164
Man, these are beautiful.

776
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:54,624
Right?

777
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:57,168
So, these are the roses you cultivated.

778
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,295
-Yes.
-What's the variety called?

779
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:02,716
I'll give it my name
and call it Kang Rose.

780
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:04,843
Or maybe not. How's K-Rose?

781
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:07,137
You and your family
are hopeless at naming.

782
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,889
Wait, does it mean
this is the first domestic rose variety?

783
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:10,890
Right.

784
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:14,394
At the moment, plant nurseries
graft imported varieties to get roses.

785
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:18,857
But once my variety goes to market,
we can have fully domestic roses

786
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:21,401
with better prices and better colors.

787
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:24,279
I see what you mean.
Doesn't rose only come in red?

788
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:25,822
Did you dye them or what?

789
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:30,035
Hey, isn't it about time
you showed them to your father?

790
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,911
We're almost there.

791
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,205
I'll show him soon.

792
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:44,466
Let me see…

793
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:45,675
Here, Ms. Oh.

794
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:47,260
Thank you.

795
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:51,222
You're precise like a machine.

796
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:54,559
I hear large corporations use
a computer program for everything.

797
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:56,686
Was it Office? Axle?

798
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,688
How long do we have to stick
to the old ways?

799
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:02,150
Be it called "Axle" or even "Brake,"
that costs the company precious money.

800
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:03,568
What's with him, anyway?

801
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:05,945
Why are you grinning ear to ear?

802
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:08,364
He's getting a new car
with this month's pay later today.

803
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:09,449
Are you getting an Atoz?

804
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:10,992
BORN TO RACE, LAMOS!

805
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:12,994
-A Lamos.
-My goodness.

806
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:15,455
Get a car from Ajin Motors.
They offer a massive discount.

807
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:16,498
Just look.

808
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:19,292
You can get La Bella at four million
when it's six million.

809
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,086
Just look. Go on.

810
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:23,213
It won't make a difference to them
if I get it or not.

811
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:24,839
The company's on the brink of collapse.

812
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:28,218
No one could've guessed
a big company like Hanju would go under.

813
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:29,344
Oh, dear.

814
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:31,221
It's all unsettling.

815
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:33,056
I'm getting heebie-jeebies.

816
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:42,273
Mr. Kang.

817
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:44,609
-He's here, everyone.
-Hey, Mr. Kang.

818
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:45,693
You're back.

819
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:49,155
-Thanks for your hard work.
-Sir.

820
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,448
-Thank you.
-Oh, hey.

821
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:53,326
Welcome back.

822
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,629
-Everyone.
-Yes?

823
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:12,262
I have an announcement
for everyone in Typhoon Trading.

824
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:16,432
I just came back

825
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:19,769
from a meeting with the bank.

826
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:24,941
The promissory note
we received from Gisong Chemical

827
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:27,986
was defaulted.

828
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:34,451
I'm afraid you will have to wait
for your wage this month.

829
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:36,744
Well,

830
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,164
for quite a while, actually.

831
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:45,753
Gi… Gisong…

832
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:50,467
But Gisong Chemical
has been around for ages.

833
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:53,094
As for all my resources,

834
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:55,138
I threw in every last penny

835
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:57,390
into the advance payment
for our Italian counterpart.

836
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,727
My financial situation
is tight at the moment.

837
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:04,981
Oh, by the way,

838
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:10,737
when is our cargo for Daebang Textile
reaching the port?

839
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:14,949
Oh, right. The bad weather
is keeping the ship in the Suez Canal.

840
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:18,328
This deal did seem rather risky.

841
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:20,079
I got that hunch, you see.

842
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,499
Did I tell you I'm going
through the Three Years of Calamity?

843
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,459
Come on, now.

844
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:27,086
Companies without a paycheck delay
are so hard to find these days.

845
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,422
Isn't that right?
This is the first time for us.

846
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:32,634
That's right.
My Three Years of Calamity is almost over.

847
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:33,760
We'll be fine.

848
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:35,595
Sweet are the fruits of adversity.

849
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:37,931
Let's see how it goes.

850
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:40,391
Thank you.

851
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:43,186
At any rate…

852
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:47,315
I will…

853
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,735
do my best…

854
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:54,531
to prevent…

855
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,201
withholding your wages for long.

856
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:01,329
I promise to do my utmost.

857
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:07,835
I apologize.

858
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,879
-Oh, no.
-Goodness.

859
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,464
It's fine.

860
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,635
It's all right.

861
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:16,761
Really?

862
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:18,388
-No.
-Get back to work.

863
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,062
Let's hang in there.

864
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:29,566
-Good morning.
-All right.

865
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:44,414
-What was that?
-What's up?

866
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:50,044
-Mr. Kang!
-What's going on?

867
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,130
-What happened?
-Can you hear us?

868
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:54,382
-Oh, my.
-Hey, call an ambulance!

869

Sorry.

871
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:15,320
I'm sorry.

872
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:40,720
Mom.

873

874
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:47,644
I'm here.

875
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:51,439
I can't believe
this has happened to your dad.

876
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:53,691
How is he?

877
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,943
They're running some tests on him.

878
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:57,612
I don't know.

879
01:00:57,695 --> 01:01:00,573
I just don't know.

880
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:01,908
He'll be all right.

881
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:04,994
Yes, I'm sure of it.

882
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:07,163
He's going to be fine.

It's freezing.

886
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:50,498
How many briquettes do we have left?

887
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:51,874
Six, I think.

888
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:53,334
It's so cold…

889
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:56,754
Six?

01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:19,235
Why would you take that out?

893
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:20,570
You startled me.

894
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:22,363
Just wait.

895
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:26,284
They say I'm as good as hired
since I made it to the third screening.

896
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:32,290
That's good news.

897
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,087
Hold on. Why is this here?

898
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:40,214
Did you wear my skirt today?

899
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:41,424
Yes, for a bit.

900
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:43,843
"For a bit"? Oh, please!

901
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:45,261
Don't make me laugh.

902
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:46,637
It's hardly "for a bit"

903
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:49,015
when you leave at 6 a.m.
and get home 12 hours later!

904
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:50,808
The garment is all stretched out!

905
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:52,310
As if.

906
01:02:52,393 --> 01:02:54,020
I won't ever wear it again. There, happy?

907
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:56,272
-It's not a big deal.
-That's what you always say.

908
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:57,482
Take it and buy me a new one.

909
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:59,817
Get me the exact same skirt, fatty!

910
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:05,281
-That was deafening. How is she so loud?
-Seriously…

911
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:07,408
This is the last time
I'm putting up with you.

912
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:08,910
Whatever. See if I care.

913
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:13,391
-Hurry.
-Come on.

Grandma.

918
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,342
What's all this noise?

919
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:53,264
It sounds like it's going to rain soon.

920
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:56,017
But it's not raining yet.

921
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:59,979
We'll probably get a downpour.

922
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:06,736
-Dear child, let's go to sleep.
-Okay.

923
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:18,497
What are you doing?

924
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:19,916
I'm going to pay my boss a visit.

925
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:22,710
You sure are devoted.

926
01:05:22,793 --> 01:05:24,420
Why bother
when he can't pay you your wage?

927
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,839
Watch it, you ungrateful brat.

928
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,842
Don't you know he covered
your tuition for the first semester?

929
01:05:30,968 --> 01:05:32,595
It would've been nothing
for that guy.

930
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:37,808
A briquette burns for 12 hours
regardless of how wealthy you are.

931
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:40,144
His family would have an oil boiler.

932
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:42,772
It's cold. Don't stay out late.

933
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:45,358
Don't you wander about
because your job interview's over.

934
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:46,525
Stay at home.

935
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:50,029
Stay put, okay?

936
01:05:58,579 --> 01:06:01,290
At least his condition is stable,
but I can't be sure

937
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:02,959
if it's a good sign or not.

938
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:06,504
You should get some rest.

939
01:06:06,587 --> 01:06:08,339
Make sure to eat, too.

940
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:11,342
-Is he going to be okay?
-He's okay for now,

941
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:14,136
but we'll need to monitor him.

942
01:06:15,846 --> 01:06:16,764
Thank you.

943
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:35,491
You have one message.

944
01:06:38,035 --> 01:06:39,537
Hey, Tae-poong. I'm at Julianie.

945
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:40,788
Things are really bad.

946
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:42,665
Hyun-jun dragged Yun-seong over here.

947
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:46,168
Nam-mo and Jeong-gwan are all here,
but Hyun-jun and his gang outnumber us.

948
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:50,172
Yu-rim got dragged into his room
along with our boys.

949
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,967
The door's locked,
and they won't let me in.

950
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:54,468
That bastard…

951
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:22,872
I'm Kang Jin-young's guardian.

952
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:25,791
This is my number.

953
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,877
Please page this number
if anything happens.

954
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:28,961
I'll be back soon.

955
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,212
-Please page me.
-Okay.

956
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:06,707
Hold on. You can't come in.

957
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:08,542
-I won't take long.
-No, you must stay here.

958
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:09,835
Hey, don't!

959
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:32,775
Mi-seon.

960
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:35,986
Mr. Kang!

961
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:46,997
Yes?

962
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:53,629
Tae-poong…

963
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:56,507
Tae-poong!

964
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:58,175
Tae-poong!

965
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:00,469
It's a big mess.

966
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:02,930
Our guys are getting pummeled.
What took you so long?

967
01:09:03,013 --> 01:09:04,890
Hey, Yu-rim's badly drunk, too.

968
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:10,813
Hey, it's Tae-poong.

969
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:15,359
-Your acting skills improved, huh?
-Did I do okay?

970
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:18,779
My bad, Tae-poong.

971
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:21,699
Hyun-jun kept asking me
to help him out just this once.

972
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:27,079
Are you good, Yu-rim?

973
01:09:30,082 --> 01:09:33,043
Give up your cool guy act, you idiot.

974
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:35,212
You can't even afford the liquor.

975
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:37,006
The whole act's lost on you now.

976
01:09:38,215 --> 01:09:39,300
Guys.

977
01:09:39,383 --> 01:09:41,677
Today's the day Tae-poong became broke.

978
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:43,888
It's truly a happy occasion,

979
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:46,974
so I called him over
so we could say our goodbyes together.

980
01:09:49,059 --> 01:09:50,769
Bottoms up!

981
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:53,063
-Bottoms up!
-All right!

982
01:09:58,194 --> 01:09:59,612
What are you doing here, Tae-poong?

983
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:01,280
Why won't you check your pager?

984
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:02,781
Get to the hospital, quick!

985
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:15,169
Taxi!

986
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:21,342
Taxi!

987
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:24,470
Over here.

988
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:52,623

KANG JIN-YOUNG, MALE, 52

1001
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:47,089
Dear viewers, the government has decided
to request a bailout from the IMF at last.

1002
01:13:47,172 --> 01:13:49,925
Korea, once hailed
for its economic success,

1003
01:13:50,008 --> 01:13:52,052
is now forced to acknowledge
a de facto national default,

1004
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:54,972
and must turn to the IMF to seek recovery.

1005
01:13:55,055 --> 01:13:56,890
This is truly devastating.

1006
01:13:56,974 --> 01:13:59,351
At 10 p.m. tonight,
Deputy Prime Minister Lim Chang-yuel

1007
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:02,229
will be officially announcing
the government's decision.

01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:07,276
Lim Chang-yuel, the Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister of Finance and Economy,

1010
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:10,362

The Managing Director of the IMF
has been in Korea since the 20th,

1013
01:14:16,493 --> 01:14:19,913
and during this event…

You know I'm an all-rounder, right?

1018
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:27,439
I mean, what if Mr. Kang's son
uses his status as heir

1019
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:29,274
-to take away all company assets?
-Look at that.

1020
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:32,402
We'll be in big trouble
if this goes wrong.

1021
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:35,656
What if there are gold bars inside?

1022
01:15:35,739 --> 01:15:39,243
What would you say are the most important
four digits for Typhoon Trading?

1023
01:15:39,326 --> 01:15:40,410
Let's smile.

1024
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:41,954
Jeez, you must be drunk.

1025
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:43,038
Get going.

1026
01:15:43,121 --> 01:15:44,748
I can't do that.

1027
01:15:44,831 --> 01:15:46,041
Off you go!

1028
01:15:46,124 --> 01:15:48,502
Ms. Oh. Let's have lunch together today.

1029
01:15:48,585 --> 01:15:50,170
I want to be a part of this company.
