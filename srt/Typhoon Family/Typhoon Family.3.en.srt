00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,961
TYPHOON FAMILY

2
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,386
Hey! Move aside!

3
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,637
We cannot

4
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,057
deliver those to Daebang Textile!

5
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,002
Sorry to keep you waiting.

6
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,090
Things will get busy later,
so why don't you stamp here first?

7
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,050
Sorry.

8
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,968
Can I use the restroom?

9
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,430
Oh, it's out the door to your right.

10
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,642
-I'll be right back.
-Sure.

11
00:01:59,077 --> 00:01:59,994
Let's move!

12
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,287
Let's go!

13
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:05,291
-Come on!
-Let's go, everyone!

14
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,544
Let's defend our workplace!

15
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,008
-Pay our wages!
-Pay our wages!

16
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,802
-This way!
-Protect our workplace!

17
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,512
Protect our workplace!

18
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,894
-Pay our wages!
-Pay our wages!

19
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,105
Come this way!

20
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,234
DON'T SHUT DOWN THE COMPANY
PAY OUR WAGES

21
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,320
FACTORY SHUTS DOWN

22
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,907
LETTER OF APPEAL

23
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,306
I'm not scared.

24
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,726
I'm not scared at all.

25
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,495
Wait!

26
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:28,917
Tae-poong!

27
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,462
Wait!

28
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,714
Hold on, Mr. Kang!

29
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,050
Just wait a minute!

30
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,429
Why are you lying down?

31
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,514
Did you

32
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:44,933
send the fax?

33
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,518
No, I didn't. Look at this.

34
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:55,985
My gosh.

35
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:58,613
Get up.

36
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:01,282
-Don't just lie there.
-Okay.

37
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:19,509
That darn boss tried to run off
with the goods without paying.

38
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,426
What now?

39
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,596
You should go back.

40
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:28,851
-You must all be exhausted.
-We're just doing our job, aren't we?

41
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:33,564
-Do you have a place to store these?
-Come on, this isn't our first rodeo.

42
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,819
We'll get a warehouse ready
and cover your travel expenses.

43
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,696
You should go before it's too late.

44
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,074
-Grab the cancellation documents.
-Okay.

45
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:45,827
You should go back with him, Tae-poong.

46
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,330
I'll call the office
and ask them to look for a warehouse.

47
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,540
-All right.
-Good.

48
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,750
Start your engines, guys.

49
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,461
-We've got a long way to go.
-Take care.

50
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:02,844
Tae-poong.

51
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:07,598
-Yes?
-Those guys, especially Mr. Baek…

52
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:11,185
-They're veterans in this field.
-Veterans?

53
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,771
Nothing gets past them.

54
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,398
I see.

55
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,817
I'll figure out the warehouse somehow.

56
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,404
When you get to Incheon,
be sure to buy us some time.

57
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,322
Got it.

58
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:35,668
Get some sleep.

59
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:40,089
-It's okay. I'm not sleepy.
-I doubt that.

60
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,926
Riding in a huge truck
makes everyone sleepy.

61
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,428
We're just used to it.

62
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,141
Take this.

63
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,731
What's your name?

64
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,858
I'm Kang Tae-poong.

65
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,028
-"Tae-poong"?
-Yes.

66
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:05,948
-Who names their kid that?
-My dad.

67
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,620
It's a nice name.
It leaves a strong impression.

68
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,164
Weren't you scared earlier?

69
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:17,835
I was.

70
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,505
But why did you do that?

71
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:24,092
If this goes wrong,
I heard our company could go under.

72
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:27,261
Is your company
more important than your life?

73
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,478
It's worth 26 years of my dad's life.

74
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,575
I gave it to you for a reason.

75
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,911
-You can have it.
-Thank you.

76
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,590
TYPHOON TRADING

77
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,175
Yes, two warehouses.

78
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:10,012
-We know, but this was sudden for us too.
-Do you have a spare warehouse?

79
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,641
-The goods are on their way.
-We need those warehouses, sir.

80
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,893
I'm Thong-jung from French Literature.

81
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,228
Do you remember me?

82
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:20,565
I was wondering
if I could ask you for a favor.

83
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,817
Who rents out a warehouse on credit?

84
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,653
You need to pay upfront.
Your company should know better.

85
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,238
I'm disappointed, sir.

86
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,783
You're acting different just
because Mr. Kang isn't here.

87
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:34,454
We've got three containers
of fabric on the way.

88
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,789
I can't find a warehouse
in the middle of the night.

89
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,542
Companies are going bankrupt
left and right these days.

90
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,127
Can you please help just this once?

91
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,423
-Did it work, Mr. Koo?
-I've asked banks and loan companies.

92
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,800
No one will give us any money.

93
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:52,305
I'm well aware
that everyone is struggling right now.

94
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,891
Couldn't you find a way somehow?

95
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,852
Open up!

96
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,814
They know the boss is back at the company.

97
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,358
-Show responsibility!
-Show responsibility!

98
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,945
CONTRACT TERMINATION AGREEMENT

99
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,823
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

100
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,410
-I'm sorry.
-We're the ones who are sorry.

101
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,370
More importantly,
how will you get out of here?

102
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,540
Let's go!

103
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,173
PROTECT OUR FACTORY

104
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,966
-Let's go!
-Come on!

105
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,135
After them!

106
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,349
Unload the goods.

107
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,684
-Hurry up!
-Please, wait.

108
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,977
Please listen to me.

109
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,104
-Come on!
-Can you please stop and listen?

110
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,273
-Step aside.
-Sir! Please, wait.

111
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,401
We're looking into it.
Please give me more time.

112
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,319
Forget it.

113
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:53,282
-Stop fooling around.
-You can't just unload it like this.

114
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,450
-Come on.
-Yes, sir.

115
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,411
What are you going to do with it?

116
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,289
-Hold on for a bit.
-Why should we?

117
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,709
He's been wasting our time
for an hour now.

118
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,713
-You said you'll get a warehouse.
-Kang Tae-poong.

119
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,758
-Have they called you?
-Wait a minute.

120
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:14,095
Can you please keep this
in your truck for a few days?

121
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:17,306
-Please? At least until tomorrow.
-What kind of nonsense is that?

122
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,561
Give us our return fee right now.

123
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,271
I will.

124
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:27,024
I promise I will. Don't throw them!

125
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:31,445
Do you know
how expensive these are? Stop it!

126
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,714
-Are you okay?
-Are you nuts?

127
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,925
Why did you jump on the road?
Are you crazy?

128
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,053
We're sorry, okay? Just go.

129
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,102
Here's the deal, Kang Tae-poong.

130
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:07,857
Let's settle today's travel expenses
at a later time.

131
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,151
But we'll need to unload the goods.

132
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,945
I get that your situation is tough,

133
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,365
but those people
are barely getting by day-to-day too.

134
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,909
Got it? Now, get up.

135
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,622
-Thank you.
-Everyone's out of work these days.

136
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:26,917
-People are really struggling.
-You're right.

137
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,463
It must be hard for you.

138
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,507
You see that parking lot over there?

139
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,178
Those parking lots

140
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:41,307
used to be packed with trucks like ours.

141
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,518
Now they're completely empty.

142
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,021
Is the parking fee expensive?

143
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,315
What parking fee?

144
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,068
I told you, there's no work.

145
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,331
Hey, Kang Tae-poong.

146
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:35,027
EPISODE 3
MOONLIGHT IN SEOUL

147
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:41,659
NEW STAR MUSIC COMPETITION

148
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,795
-Number 32, Mr. Wang Nam-mo.
-I'm Wang Nam-mo, Number 32.

149
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:53,921
Right now?

150
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:58,384
THE 9TH NEW STAR MUSIC COMPETITION

151
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,804
I'm sorry, my hand slipped.

152
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:07,393
-Sorry, I'm really nervous.
-It's okay. I was like you once.

153
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,188
Take a deep breath
and begin when you're ready.

154
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,065
Okay. Thank you.

155
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,871
I miss you at times like these

156
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:31,250
Moments when I'm all alone

157
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,421
Even though I know you're gone

158
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:41,051
I keep thinking of you

159
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,639
Why did you leave me back then?

160
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:51,270
You said you were tired of it all

161
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,483
I guess that could be the reason

162
00:12:56,609 --> 00:13:00,279
But I just don't understand

163
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:03,699
Lonely night, lonely night

164
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:09,205
I keep remembering how you left me

165
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:14,919
Lonely night, so lonely night

166
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:27,389
The way I want to remember you

167
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,316
Thank you. I'm Number 32, Wang Nam-mo.

168
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,003
Back up!

169
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,884
-Keep going.
-This is so heavy.

170
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:08,430
-This is some hard labor we're doing.
-Okay, let's stop.

171
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,348
Pick it up.

172
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,143
Move it to the left.

173
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,145
How can you still get this wrong?
To the left.

174
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,689
Hurry up.

175
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,817
Hurry up, Man No. 2. This one's next.

176
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,195
-One, two, three.
-This is the last one, right, Man No. 3?

177
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,363
Jeez.

178
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,577
Those birds are pissing me off!

179
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,620
Stop yelling.

180
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,248
-Save your strength.
-Stop paging me.

181
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,834
You think this is it?

182
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,336
-There's more.
-Gosh.

183
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,796
Come on.

184
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:46,552
Don't let it go over the line.
It'll cost more if it does.

185
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,387
You can always pay for more.

186
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,180
-I don't have money.
-Really?

187
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,891
-Okay, then--
-Wait!

188
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,392
-Grab it!
-It's falling!

189
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:55,352
Crap.

190
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:57,897
Did it go over?

191
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,609
This side is okay. I'm falling.

192
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,281
Come on.

193
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:12,411
-Grab it.
-Oh, my gosh.

194
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:15,623
-Don't step on it!
-I didn't mean to.

195
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:16,790
Why'd you step on it?

196
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,336
I can't believe you're making
me work my butt off.

197
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,254
Come on.

198
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,674
Hurry up.

199
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,887
One, two, three.

200
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:34,308
All right. Keep an eye on it. Okay.

201
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,520
-What did Tae-poong say?
-He said he put them someplace safe.

202
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,775
Shouldn't we go check on it?

203
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,903
He said he'll take care of it,
so let's look for warehouses.

204
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,112
So, where is that?

205
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:49,531
What?

206
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,742
You didn't ask.

207
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,744
You didn't ask where he placed them.

208
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,580
-I didn't…
-What?

209
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,374
I didn't ask him.

210
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,603
I won't let anyone take these.

211
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:56,765
What's that?

212
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,737
Kang Tae-poong!

213
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,281
Tae-poong!

214
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,702
Gosh, Tae-poong…

215
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:19,663
Are you okay?

216
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,498
My goodness.

217
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,294
From far away, it looked like
a scene from that movie…

218
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,546
The Gingko Bed.

219
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,173
Was it General Eun?

220
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,134
It's Hwang.

221
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,347
-Yes, General Hwang.
-Gosh.

222
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,184
Just look at him.

223
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:45,481
Compared to the freezing cold
we're used to, this place is the equator.

224
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,524
I'm actually hot here.

225
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,195
You served in the military, right?

226
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,032
Where were you stationed?

227
00:17:56,658 --> 00:18:01,580
-Changwon…
-By the way, we found a place.

228
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,957
They lent us money on credit.

229
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:11,924
You may have heard,
but I was in the Marines.

230
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,968
Batch 498.

231
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,013
I was seriously…

232
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,351
Don't even get me started.

233
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,395
Back then, at the sea…

234
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:29,191
You know what, forget it.
I'll just keep it to myself.

235
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,692
I guess you don't want any.

236
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,612
Let's get a move on, guys.

237
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:37,199
We have stuff to do back there.
Let's go and see.

238
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,119
Help him up.

239
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:45,415
-You're quite a handful.
-One, two, three.

240
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,252
My legs are asleep.

241
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:53,257
How will you get any work done like that?

242
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,677
-Just put the bag down.
-My legs are numb.

243
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,095
Are you ready?

244
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:05,018
PYO MERCHANT MARINE

245
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,944
You should've told me sooner
that this happened.

246
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,991
Your father and I were not strangers.

247
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:27,875
-Work hasn't been easy, has it?
-I still have no idea what I'm doing.

248
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,294
Work is kind of like learning to walk.

249
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:34,214
It feels shaky and uncertain at first.

250
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,009
Everyone else seems to be doing fine

251
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:41,221
while you're struggling not to fall
just after a few steps.

252
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,431
But here's the thing.

253
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,643
You can't learn unless you fall.

254
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,187
That's just how it goes.

255
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,609
Hello?

256
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,694
Is it ready?

257
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,196
All right.

258
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,825
It's ready, so go check it out.

259
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:07,039
-Gosh, thank you so much.
-Don't mention it.

260
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,041
We should help each other out.

261
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:10,709
Thank you.

262
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,630
This should be enough.

263
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,682
-Did you take a look?
-Yes, I took a good, close look.

264
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:30,312
The contract is very detailed.

265
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,523
-Excuse me.
-My gosh!

266
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:37,402
I suppose you don't use this often?

267
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,487
It's rather run-down.

268
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,740
We've done some repairs.
What do you mean it's run-down?

269
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:45,535
No, I mean,
the cracks in the floor are fine,

270
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:51,291
but if you look here,
not only are there cracks here,

271
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,628
but the ceiling
has holes everywhere, doesn't it?

272
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,129
Is that for ventilation?

273
00:20:56,713 --> 00:21:00,842
If you look here,
even the rebar is rusted.

274
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,803
It looks like it could collapse.

275
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,889
And over there, the cracks are stacked
like Tetris blocks.

276
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,308
There are holes over there too.

277
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,352
And the window over here…

278
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,481
Oh, Mr. Koo!

279
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:17,234
Why are you doing that at your age?

280
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,611
-Why are you trying so hard?
-I'm fine.

281
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:24,366
You guys sure have a lot of complaints.
I guess you don't want the contract.

282
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,785
I was trying to help you people, but fine.

283
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,705
-Okay, I'm leaving.
-Wait, it's not like that.

284
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:30,998
Come on, Manager.

285
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:36,586
We're just really grateful,
so we wanted to use the space carefully.

286
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,046
But…

287
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,133
That's why we're checking everything.
Let's wrap this up.

288
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,719
-Still, this is a bit--
-Thank you.

289
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,970
CONTRACTOR: TYPHOON TRADING

290
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,179
There we go.

291
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,019
-Don't make a mess.
-Thank you.

292
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,521
Take care.

293
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,191
Try to read the room, you guys!

294
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:01,570
Who else is willing to lend
on credit alone these days?

295
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,323
-Yeah, but still--
-Then what do you want us to do?

296
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,907
Should we take all the goods back?

297
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,411
Just keep the key safe, okay?

298
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,209
Never mind, I don't trust you.
Give it back.

299
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,211
Give it here.

300
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,841
My back hurts.

301
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:27,137
Good thing we found out
Daebang went bankrupt before the delivery.

302
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:31,391
Let's try to sell at least a roll
and have ox bone stew for lunch tomorrow.

303
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,727
How are we supposed to sell all that?

304
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,563
I heard ox bone stew
helping bones heal is just a myth.

305
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:41,318
But you know,
we almost got screwed over, didn't we?

306
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,111
Screws are used to secure things.

307
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:47,240
Do you have trouble speaking Korean?

308
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:51,453
Actually, I had a bad feeling about it.

309
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,622
You all know about my intuition.

310
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,082
A CRAPPY INTUITION

311
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,626
What intuition? You're way too slow.

312
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,212
-Ms. Oh.
-Yes?

313
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:04,549
-What are you looking so closely at?
-I just wanted to check it one more time.

314
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,426
Every little bit adds up.

315
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,553
Bit by bit, it adds up.

316
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,015
What does that even mean?

317
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,894
What are you guys looking at so intently?

318
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,270
What is it? Let me see.

319
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,815
LIST OF FOOD PRODUCTS

320
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,400
Why are you looking at food products?

321
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:26,279
Are you planning to wrap
gochujang and doenjang in the fabric?

322
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:30,408
I don't know which company you'll end up,
but they'll be tortured.

323
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,993
You're in for a tough time.

324
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,662
-Ms. Oh.
-Yes?

325
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:37,082
-Could you get us all a cup of coffee?
-Sure.

326
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:39,751
-Thanks.
-Ms. Oh. I'll have a two-two-three combo.

327
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,795
-I'll have my regular.
-Okay.

328
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,672
-What about you, Ms. Cha?
-None for me.

329
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,091
Stop making her get coffee.

330
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,968
-Would you like some?
-No, thanks.

331
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,769
One, three, one, four.

332
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:01,231
Eight, seven, zero, five.

333
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,786
-You scared me.
-It's 11:00 p.m.

334
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,663
I've never worked until this late.

335
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,668
Isn't that amazing?

336
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,754
I really can achieve anything.

337
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,757
What's wrong?

338
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,551
The last train.

339
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,428
-The last train!
-You scared me.

340
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,598
-Grab your bag.
-Yes, we should go.

341
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,897
Why do you insist on walking me home
when I can go by myself?

342
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,106
It's not that far.

343
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,401
And it's not safe these days.

344
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:50,030
It's late. You should go home.

345
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,990
I can keep going.

346
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:54,576
Look…

347
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,373
Thank you.

348
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,793
That day at the funeral.

349
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,088
What you said about sadness.

350
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,141
I was talking to myself too.

351
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:24,731
I mean, I was sad
that Mr. Kang passed away,

352
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,399
but I had

353
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,361
given up on my dream.

354
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,321
It felt like a luxury.

355
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,657
What's your dream?

356
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,578
-You don't have to--
-To be an office worker.

357
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:42,249
Someone with duties of my own,
instead of being an assistant.

358
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,209
Like a trader.

359
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,630
-That's nice.
-Yes, it is.

360
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,972
-I should go. See you tomorrow.
-Okay.

361
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,307
-Take care.
-Get home safe.

362
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,993
There's a saying among trading companies,

363
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,536
"From missiles to ramyeon."

364
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:25,125
It means it's the job of a salesperson
to find good products and good clients.

365
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,501
FROM MISSILES TO RAMYEON

366
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:32,465
TRADER

367
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,050
That's the skill of a trader.

368
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,679
-Have you heard of the UAE?
-Arab…

369
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,222
The desert.

370
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,309
They're super rich because they have oil.

371
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:46,563
But due to religious customs,
both men and women wear long clothing.

372
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,606
That's where traders created a plan.

373
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,025
Who has the best fabric?

374
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,778
Italy. Who has
the best processing technology?

375
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:56,656
South Korea.

376
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:01,911
When our company imports fabric from Italy
and sells it to Daebang Textile,

377
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:05,040
they reprocess it
and export it to the UAE.

378
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:08,209
How do you know all this?

379
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:12,922
I admire them.

380
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,177
I think traders are cool.

381
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,974
TRADER

382
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:25,602
A trader.

383
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,499
-It's cold.
-You're dripping wet.

384
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,626
You must be cold.

385
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:55,548
-You're all wet.
-Mi-seon, try this.

386
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:58,134
It's a really expensive cream.
My coworker gave it to me.

387
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,636
No, thanks. You use it.

388
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:02,597
-Stop it!
-Your face is a mess right now.

389
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,474
Fine.

390
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,518
-Put some on Beom.
-Good idea.

391
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,812
-Which one do you want, Beom?
-Put it on.

392
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,146
You must be freezing.

393
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,940
You need to change your pants.
They're wet.

394
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,651
Here, it's warm. I warmed it up for you.

395
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,820
-It's warm.
-Right?

396
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,655
Let's dry your hair first.

397
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:22,117
-How's your job at the department store?
-My job?

398
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,828
-It's not bad.
-That's good to hear.

399
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,704
BELLUA DEPARTMENT STORE

400
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,123
Let's begin the greeting.

401
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:32,293
A bright day starts with your smile.

402
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,047
Good morning.

403
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,758
Welcome.

404
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,760
OH MI-HO

405
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,722
You there, your name tag is crooked.

406
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:47,142
Is your attitude crooked too?
What's going on?

407
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,772
-Where's your name tag?
-My apologies.

408
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,607
Good grief.

409
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,277
All right, keep those smiles up.

410
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,362
Let's start the greeting again.

411
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:03,867
A bright day starts with your smile.

412
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:07,162
-I can't believe this.
-How could this happen so suddenly?

413
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,413
HANJIN BANK
ULCHI BRANCH 2

414
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,707
This is just too cruel.

415
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,419
After all we've endured…

416
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:22,218
This is just unfair!

417
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:28,475
All we did was work hard.
Why are we the ones losing our jobs?

418
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:29,392
Mom!

419
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,396
I told you not to come.

420
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,648
You've worked so hard.

421
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,152
You're finally free after 32 years.

422
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:44,491
Thirty-two years?

423
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:53,082
Only three more years, and I…

424
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,337
would've gotten
the long-term service award.

425
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,024
I knew this would happen.

426
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,987
Gosh…

427
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,491
It's not your fault, Mom.

428
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,076
It's okay.

429
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,119
Cry all you want.

430
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,084
My husband died when I was 30 years old…

431
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,128
I know.

432
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:42,966
Nam-mo…

433
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:48,847
KIM EUL-NYEO
ASSISTANT BRANCH MANAGER

434
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,391
I'm not crying.

435
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,731
Hello, I'm Kang Tae-poong
from Typhoon Trading.

436
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:00,233
Yes.

437
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:04,237
We've imported some stunning,
multicolored fabric from Italy,

438
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,614
and right now, it's…

439
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,868
You don't want it? Got it.

440
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,162
-They don't want it.
-At all?

441
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:16,541
Ms. Cha, have you reached out
to Fiori Textiles in Daegu?

442
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,418
I contacted them ages ago.

443
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:21,671
JUNG CHA-RAN

444
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,466
FX services…

445
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,218
-Tae-poong?
-Yes?

446
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,762
-Have you called Pusan?
-I'm doing it now.

447
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,184
Hello, I'm Kang Tae-poong
from Typhoon Trading.

448
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,436
Hello, Typhoon Trading.

449
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:40,899
-We've imported some fabric.
-Fabric? I don't work with those anymore.

450
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:44,736
I see. Then could you
recommend us someplace else?

451
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:48,656
I heard that a lot of factories
in Daegu are going under.

452
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,868
-I'm sorry.
-It's all right.

453
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,495
Thank you for picking up our call.

454
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:58,791
I heard about Mr. Kang.
I'm sorry I couldn't make it.

455
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:02,879
Please reach out to me if you visit Pusan.
I really mean it.

456
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:03,796
To Pusan?

457
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,466
I will. Thank you.

458
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,265
The floor needs to be mopped, Ms. Oh.

459
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,059
Right away.

460
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:21,105
So, did anyone want it?

461
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:22,607
-I'll do it.
-Okay.

462
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,858
I wish.

463
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,945
Who would start a new business
at a time like this?

464
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,947
It's not like we only have a few.

465
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,491
-Ms. Oh.
-Yes?

466
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:34,369
-Get me a cup of coffee after that.
-Yes, sir.

467
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:35,578
Take your time.

468
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,457
-Are you okay?
-What are we going to do?

469
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,918
None of our clients want it.

470
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,879
We might actually end up losing our jobs.

471
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,881
At least your husband works.

472
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:51,344
I'm about to ask my old man
to pay for the baby's diapers.

473
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,555
Ms. Oh, are you still working on that?

474
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,182
Let's hurry it up.

475
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,560
Why does he keep asking for coffee?

476
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:04,732
Excuse me.

477
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,987
Why don't we return them?

478
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:22,333
I checked the contract,
and there's a clause.

479
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,586
But it only applies
in the case of natural disasters.

480
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,422
Isn't the IMF issue a natural disaster?

481
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:31,134
You can't say that.
That's a man-made disaster.

482
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:33,720
There are victims,
but no clear perpetrator.

483
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:38,349
"Come" for complete, "plea" for begging,
a "call" for help, and "lapse" for breaks.

484
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,560
It's a complete collapse.

485
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,730
We're completely ruined.

486
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,942
But I think this might still be possible.

487
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,319
The conditions are pretty strict, though.

488
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:55,033
If quantity and quality remain unchanged,
the return fee is 15%.

489
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,451
Honestly, 15% is a lot.

490
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,454
The fee's not the issue.
It's whether they'll accept it.

491
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,663
They probably won't.

492
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,498
I think…

493
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,627
Let's double the amount to 30%.

494
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,671
Then they'll accept them.

495
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:11,215
Why don't you just hand everything over?

496
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,760
It says here
that the exchange rate went up.

497
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:14,719
SURGE OF EXCHANGE RATES

498
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,637
It's not a bad idea.

499
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:21,893
The contract exchange rate was 907.5 won,
and today it's 1,823 won.

500
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,728
If it keeps dropping like that…

501
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,190
She memorized all that?

502
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,692
You memorized it? You're so weird, Ms. Oh.

503
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,282
Wait, let me calculate this.

504
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:38,618
It should be…

505
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,204
That's going to take forever. Here.

506
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:46,042
The exchange rate jumps 200 won one day
and drops 100 won the next.

507
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,086
So, let's average it out at 1,600 won.

508
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:02,225
Even after 30% fees,
we still end up with a profit.

509
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,604
And if they refuse the return,
we'll tell them

510
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,482
that we'll dump the fabric
on the market at half price.

511
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:13,569
We may face some losses,
but we need to sell the goods first.

512
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:14,487
Right.

513
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,908
But the value of that fabric will plummet,
and it won't rise back up.

514
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,035
Just like the Dutch tulips.

515
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,330
No one will pay 10,000 won
for something that dropped to 3,000.

516
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,165
It's no longer a premium item.

517
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,291
Don't you think so?

518
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,544
You think they'll risk that?

519
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:33,756
-No, they'll accept the return.
-He's quite ruthless.

520
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,466
I better stay on his good side.

521
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,717
He's a thug.

522
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,639
But it'll be Christmas soon.

523
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,392
What? Do you go to church?

524
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,227
You don't look very religious.

525
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,063
Europeans go on vacation during Christmas.

526
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,858
No one will be there to receive our fax.

527
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,070
You're very smart, Mr. Bae.

528
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,282
-You're a genius.
-Episode 6 of Global Neighbors.

529
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:01,742
The one about Italy.

530
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,414
Yes, they don't work very hard.

531
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,916
And yet, they haven't been hit
with the IMF.

532
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,836
We should still keep sending faxes though.

533
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,422
Are we working overtime?

534
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,153
Is it working?

535
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:39,739
Is it?

536
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,367
-Did you do it right?
-Yes.

537
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:47,496
Did they send it?

538
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,956
-No.
-That's not it.

539
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,166
We sent it.

540
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,460
-He's never done this.
-Just wait.

541
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,811
-We got a call.
-It's here.

542
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:14,649
Hello?

543
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,236
Hello?

544
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:20,613
Don't pick up when there's a fax!

545
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:22,865
It was ringing.

546
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:48,766
TYPING PRACTICE

547
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:57,733
BAD-MOUTH

548
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,411
GAME OVER

549
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,964
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

550
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,093
-Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!
-Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

551
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:26,429
Yes! I win!

552
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,479
There we go!

553
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:54,081
"We may not be mortal enemies."

554
00:38:56,917 --> 00:39:02,798
"But I will avenge my master's death
and capture…"

555
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,967
What kind of story is this?

556
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,012
It's quite old-fashioned.

557
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,141
Are you keeping an eye on the fax?

558
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:16,145
You're always reading that.
That's why you're always sleepy.

559
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:20,524
Don't take your eyes off the fax machine.

560
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,942
You're closer to it.

561
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,862
"I'm not falling
for your nonsense anymore."

562
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:26,447
Your attitude is horrible.

563
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,365
"You fool."

564
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,992
"I'll teach you a lesson."

565
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,745
Let me see.

566
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:34,789
This character's surprising.

567
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,040
-Look.
-Right.

568
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:37,291
I'm reading it.

569
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,877
I almost got the wrong idea.

570
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:44,715
Anyway, don't doze off.
Keep an eye on the fax.

571
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,262
Let's go home, everyone.

572
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,514
He's so dramatic.

573
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:54,392
-Is he still breathing?
-Yes, he is.

574
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:58,354
Let him sleep.
He's always pulling all-nighters.

575
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,863
Why did you turn the lights off?
Ms. Oh's still here.

576
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,497
-Good night, Ms. Oh.
-Take care.

577
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,581
Tae-poong?

578
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:22,229
We got a fax.

579
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,147
-What?
-Get up.

580
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,273
-We got a fax?
-Yes.

581
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:42,374
"We've carefully reviewed your proposal."

582
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:52,510
"We're well-aware
of the IMF issue in Korea."

583
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,057
I can't read it.

584
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,893
What's wrong? Is your stomach hurting?

585
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,854
"This appears
to be beyond anyone's control."

586
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:09,068
"Therefore, we are willing to make
an exception and accept your proposal."

587
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:12,071
So, they'll accept the return?

588
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:18,160
Only if there is no change
in quantity and quality.

589
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:22,748
Hurray!

590
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:25,376
-We did it!
-Finally!

591
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:29,129
Yes! I was so worried
about what we were going to do.

592
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:32,132
We just need two more weeks.
It'll all work out.

593
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,970
I'm so glad!

594
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,972
Send it to them now!

595
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,641
-Yes, send it now.
-What a joyous day. This is great.

596
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,851
We should get banquet noodles
on a day like this.

597
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,853
-I agree.
-Sounds great!

598
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,438
That sounds wonderful.

599
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,274
Let's go!

600
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,864
Here you go.

601
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:59,827
SILVER, GOLD

602
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,121
CERTIFICATE OF COLLATERAL

603
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:03,497
Excuse me…

604
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:07,751
This is less than I expected.

605
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:12,131
We get around 30 to 40 bags
like this one each day.

606
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:14,717
It's not like the Gangnam area
can avoid the IMF.

607
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,552
I've only used it three times.

608
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:21,181
Then why don't you trade your gold?
It's worth more.

609
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:24,768
-What gold?
-The gold ring you're wearing.

610
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,687
No! This is my wedding ring.

611
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:30,816
Everyone's trading in their wedding rings
and other gold rings too.

612
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,526
I don't want to.

613
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,111
All right.

614
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:35,863
That's too high! Lower it.

615
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:41,201
I think it's about to rain.
Let's get a move on!

616
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,202
MOMO'S PUB

617
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:45,372
Hey, Mom.
Take it easy and try some chicken.

618
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,166
I'm such a perfect guy.

619
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,752
I'm even good at frying chicken.

620
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:51,962
It's a bit salty. Try it.

621
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:52,963
-Salty?
-Yes.

622
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,007
It's salty.

623
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:58,510
Make more of these
and give some to the workers.

624
00:43:58,594 --> 00:43:59,553
-Got it?
-Okay.

625
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,096
Hello, sir.

626
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,098
-Hello.
-How have you been?

627
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,893
-You have a sign now.
-I'm starting a pub.

628
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,728
-I'll visit next time.
-Please do.

629
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,104
-Please stop by for dinner.
-Okay.

630
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,649
Thank you. Have a nice day.

631
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:17,905
Hey, mister!
Please lower the left side just a bit.

632
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:48,644
Oh, man.

633
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,522
It's pouring out there.

634
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:56,610
-I'm going out, Mom.
-Where are you going at this hour?

635
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:59,113
It's raining. Take an umbrella, Tae-poong!

636
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:13,335
NOTICE OF FORCED EXECUTION

637
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,635
Mister, it's me, Mi-seon!

638
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:24,388
Please open the door, mister!

639
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:26,390
Mister!

640
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:32,020
-What are you doing here?
-It's an emergency. Please help me!

641
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:35,482
-It's raining too much. I need this.
-Okay.

642
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,902
-Goodness, what's going on?
-It's raining too much.

643
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:40,696
Thank you!

644
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,327
My goodness.

645
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:08,599
Tae-poong!

646
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:10,684
Ms. Oh.

647
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:13,979
-What brings you here?
-There was so much rain.

648
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:16,607
-I was worried, so I came.
-Let's go inside.

649
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:22,654
It's locked.

650
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,532
Back up.

651
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:38,879
What the heck?

652
00:46:39,796 --> 00:46:40,797
Here's a flashlight.

653
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:43,926
-Where's the switch?
-Where is it?

654
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,844
There it is.

655
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,388
Be careful.

656
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:57,689
I knew this would happen.

657
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:02,653
Be careful.

658
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:05,614
Damn it!

659
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:10,827
Oh, my gosh.

660
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,834
Oh, no.

661
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,547
One, two, three.

662
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:24,508
Here.

663
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:27,511
Grab it there.

664
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:31,890
That should do it.

665
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,271
This should work.

666
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,024
-Did it work?
-Just a minute.

667
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,402
-Be careful.
-I will.

668
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:46,863
-Okay.
-That's good.

669
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,615
I'll hold the bottom.

670
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,617
-Pull it down.
-Just a second.

671
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:51,660
-One second.
-Okay.

672
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:54,496
-Hold that part.
-Okay.

673
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,165
-I'll go under it, so please pull.
-Okay.

674
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,378
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

675
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,881
Watch out!

676
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,055
What happened?

677
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,057
-We're tangled.
-This is…

678
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,560
-Wait a minute.
-Wait.

679
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:19,438
-The inside got caught.
-Just tear it.

680
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:20,355
My goodness.

681
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,399
Who's there?

682
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,319
Tae-poong?

683
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,739
Ms. Oh!

684
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:30,991
-Are you okay?
-Tear it.

685
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,659
-Are you hurt?
-No.

686
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:33,785
Thank you.

687
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:36,121
-What's going on?
-There you go.

688
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:37,914
You guys are all here.

689
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,249
When did you get here?

690
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:42,294
We came an hour ago.
We were at the other warehouse.

691
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:46,465
This one's even worse.

692
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:48,967
What the heck?

693
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:51,720
You call this a warehouse?

694
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:54,348
Honestly, I knew this would happen.

695
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,891
Pyo Merchant Marine…

696
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:58,852
They're completely careless.
We should sue them all.

697
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:01,480
Those bastards.

698
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:05,067
Let's hurry up and do this.

699
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:07,861
When I catch a cold, it lasts a long time.

700
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:10,030
But…

701
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,784
What brings you all here?

702
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:17,287
Of course we came.
This is our source of livelihood.

703
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:23,919
We don't have time for this.

704
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,796
-Let's get a move on.
-Yes.

705
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:27,047
I'll go over there.

706
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,382
Let's take care of this.

707
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,385
One, two, three.

708
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:36,890
Here you go.

709
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:38,850
-It's heavy.
-Put it up here.

710
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,019
Ready, go!

711
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,732
-You got it?
-Over here.

712
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:47,567
One more.

713
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,417
Are you okay, Mr. Go?

714
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,380
-Forget about me. What about you?
-I'm fine.

715
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,219
It's only okay when you're young.

716
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:20,600
Once you get older,
your body can't handle it.

717
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:24,146
This isn't the best way to do this.

718
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:28,859
Be careful.

719
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,695
Don't hurt yourself.

720
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:38,702
-We should keep stacking it.
-Okay.

721
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:29,878
"Burned it all… down to pure white."

722
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:34,216
-What?
-Ashita no Joe, by Osamu Dezaki.

723
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,177
Look at that.
The rain stopped once we were done.

724
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:40,222
I'm so hungry, I can't move.

725
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,015
Let's go eat.

726
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:45,393
What's the date today?

727
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:49,856
My goodness! Let's go eat.

728
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:51,650
Right now?

729
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:53,652
It's 7:00 a.m.

730
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:55,070
Don't you guys know?

731
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:58,365
At this hour,
it's broad daylight at the port.

732
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:00,033
Get up. Let's go.

733
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:02,994
Let's just go home.

734
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:08,542
We can go home for food.
I have plenty of it.

735
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:19,052
I'm actually out of side dishes.

736
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,598
Here we go.

737
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:27,561
We had a rough day,
so we need a warm bowl of seaweed soup.

738
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:31,231
Give him one with a big piece of meat.

739
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:34,943
-It's his birthday, after all.
-Why are you making such a big deal?

740
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:37,696
Stop! You're getting sweat everywhere!

741
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:42,659
How did you know?

742
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:46,329
-Do you know what tomorrow is?
-The company founding anniversary.

743
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:50,041
Yes, tomorrow is
our company's founding day.

744
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:53,920
It's the day after you were born.
That's when our company opened.

745
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:56,089
That's why it's called "Typhoon Trading."

746
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:01,261
We should at least
raise our glass with water.

747
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:04,890
-Can't we just eat in peace?
-Come on, guys.

748
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:09,019
Happy birthday to our new employee,

749
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:12,105
-Kang Tae-poong!
-Cheers.

750
00:53:12,188 --> 00:53:13,148
Cheers.

751
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:18,862
This is a new song
that will be released on January 1st.

752
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:23,158
It feels like something
we all need right now.

753
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:24,576
Let's take a listen.

754
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,335
This is delicious.

755
00:53:58,568 --> 00:53:59,945
It's tasty.

756
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:01,988
It's good.

757
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:41,528
Carry on.

758
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:44,197
What are you doing?

759
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,409
Stop that! Who are you guys?

760
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,327
Put it in the truck.

761
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:53,039
-Let's get a move on, guys!
-Excuse me!

762
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,374
Oh, dear.

763
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:57,836
I was about to call you.
What brings you here?

764
00:54:57,919 --> 00:54:59,129
What are you doing?

765
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:01,840
We're confiscating the goods
from warehouses 22 and 23.

766
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:04,926
-What?
-What are you talking about?

767
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,261
What the heck is this?

768
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:09,472
Stop right there. Put it down!

769
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:11,224
-Hey!
-Ms. Cha!

770
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:13,643
Ms. Cha!

771
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,311
What do you think you're doing?

772
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:17,814
-Why are you doing this?
-Why, you ask?

773
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,400
Bring me the contract, Mr. Kim.

774
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,696
I tried to help you guys out,

775
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:28,783
but your company hasn't paid
nor retrieved your goods.

776
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:34,122
Even with a rough estimate,
there's quite a bit of overdue payment.

777
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:36,791
What overdue payment?
We don't owe you anything!

778
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,835
You're not making any sense.

779
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:40,670
I'm done talking.

780
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:46,885
"Pyo Merchant Marine agrees
to store the goods

781
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:49,846
at Warehouses 22 and 23
at the request of Typhoon Trading."

782
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:52,015
Exactly. What overdue payment?

783
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:54,392
Why do you keep reading that part?

784
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:56,436
-Read the back too.
-The back?

785
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:59,022
There's a second page?

786
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:06,613
"The storage period is up to 72 hours
starting from the request date."

787
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,364
It's been over 72 hours!

788
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:12,827
"If you fail to make the repayment or
request an extension within this period,

789
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:16,206
the received fabric may be
confiscated and disposed of."

790
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,959
See? I was right.

791
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,712
-Move everything!
-Yes, sir.

792
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,089
Let's go, guys.

793
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:25,256
Move them!

794
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:30,512
Oh, no! What do we do?

795
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:34,682
-How could you…
-No, you can't!

796
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:36,684
Please wait!

797
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:40,438
Please don't!

798
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:43,942
-Hurry up!
-Stop it!

799
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:20,562
PYO MERCHANT MARINE

800
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:22,230
Can I help you?

801
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:24,482
-What brings you here?
-I'm here to see the CEO.

802
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:26,901
Did you make an appointment?
Stop right there!

803
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:31,406
-Please stop him.
-Let go of me!

804
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:33,908
You can't be here.

805
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:35,034
Let go of me!

806
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,203
I said, let go.

807
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,663
-He's not here.
-Mr. Pyo!

808
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:40,248
What are you doing?

809
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:42,834
If you had something to say,
you could've told me.

810
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:46,337
I have nothing to say to you.
I just need to talk to Mr. Pyo.

811
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:47,964
-Mr. Pyo!
-Take him outside.

812
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:49,883
-Mr. Pyo isn't here!
-Let him in.

813
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:01,978
Hello, Mr. Pyo.

814
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:04,814
I think there's something wrong
with the contract.

815
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:07,066
-Could you please take a look?
-You need

816
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,527
to learn basic business etiquette first.

817
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:14,032
Who just barges into a CEO's office
without an appointment?

818
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:18,411
Apologies, sir. I was in a rush.

819
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,413
I told you, Dad.

820
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:24,125
That guy's just an idiot.

821
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:28,963
That's why he was out clubbing
while his dad died.

822
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:37,472
I'm sorry, sir.
But this contract doesn't make any sense.

823
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:41,267
It says here that
there's only a 72-hour storage period,

824
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:45,939
and unless we make a request, the fabric
could be confiscated or disposed of.

825
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:47,315
If this is true…

826
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:50,318
If this is true,
then right from the start…

827
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,214
This was a scam.

828
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,341
Was it?

829
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:18,972
I'm just a businessman who saw a profit.
I don't see how that's a scam.

830
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:24,018
You should've read the contract carefully
and taken the goods on time.

831
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,312
Why are you blaming me?

832
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:31,317
Don't throw a tantrum here
because your company was careless.

833
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,944
This is outrageous.

834
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,739
This contract is ridiculous.

835
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,535
Let me see the others.

836
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:44,122
You crazy bastard.

837
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:46,499
Have you lost your mind?
Get him out of here!

838
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:50,545
Have you seriously lost it? Hey!

839
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,217
If you touch me right now,

840
00:59:58,094 --> 00:59:59,220
I'll kill you.

841
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,187
Mr. Pyo!

842
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,189
This is ridiculous!

843
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,775
Mr. Pyo! Please show me
the other contracts!

844
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,944
Mr. Pyo! Let go of me!

845
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:18,323
The apple doesn't fall
far from the tree, does it?

846
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:35,798
TYPHOON TRADING

847
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:39,135
We have no other choice. I'm sorry.

848
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:41,429
Yes? Who's calling?

849
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:42,513
I see.

850
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:45,099
We're aware, but we're having problems.

851
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,060
I'll let the director know you called.

852
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:49,937
I'm afraid we can't pay today.

853
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:53,941
I can't give you an exact date right now.

854
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:58,404
I apologize. I'll call you back.

855
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,031
We're sorry.

856
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:03,660
Hello?

857
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,245
How many times have you called?

858
01:01:06,954 --> 01:01:08,539
I told you multiple times.

859
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:12,543
-Hello?
-I don't know where you heard the rumor.

860
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:16,089
-But it's not true.
-Please don't call me a "bastard," sir.

861
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:18,466
I understand your situation, but…

862
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:21,511
It's not like we've gone bankrupt.

863
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:23,054
-I'll call you back.
-Sue me.

864
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:24,555
Sue me, then!

865
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:26,849
Have you found anyone?

866
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:30,019
All banks and lenders said no.

867
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,816
How did this happen?

868
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,245
What are we going to do?

869
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:50,248
The rumors have spread about us.

870
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,834
I think we're really going under.

871
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:56,379
I'm scared they're going to come for us!

872
01:01:56,462 --> 01:02:00,758
Screw it, tell them to come.
It's over for us anyway.

873

SAVINGS ACCOUNT

01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:31,873
-My name?
-Yes.

876
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:49,056
CEO'S OFFICE

877
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:57,565
Why are you still here?

878
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:00,359
I was just organizing something.

879
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,953
By the way, this is for you.

880
01:03:12,997 --> 01:03:13,998
Happy birthday.

881
01:03:22,089 --> 01:03:25,218
It was a tough birthday, wasn't it?

882
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:27,595
I mean…

883
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:29,639
It was…

884
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:32,683
It was memorable.

885
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:39,899
-Thank you.
-You worked hard today.

886
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,246
Ta-da!

887
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:57,500
It's from Brown Bakery cake,
which you like.

888
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:59,502
I had a hard time getting this.

889
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,798
-Blow out the candle.
-Let's blow it out together.

890
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:07,134
-You're right, I earned it.
-Exactly.

891
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:09,095
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

892
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:12,807
-Happy birthday!
-Thank you.

893
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:14,851
Open the door!

894
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:17,061
-Open this door, right now!
-Quiet.

895
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:18,646
They'll leave if we're quiet.

896
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:20,731
-Mrs. Kang!
-Get out here!

897
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:22,608
Is no one home?

898
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:25,194
Open this door!

899
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:29,574
They're gone.

900
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:31,701
Let's eat.

901
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,579
Eat up, son. Have some bulgogi.

902
01:04:34,662 --> 01:04:35,663
There's japchae.

903
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:38,291
Eat up, okay?

904
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:40,209
-Mom.
-Yes?

905
01:04:42,336 --> 01:04:44,505
Should we run away
like Yun-seong's family?

906
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:50,136
-Somewhere where no one will find us.
-I don't want to.

907
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:54,432
I don't want that.

908
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:56,976
But it's scary.

909
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:00,605
And sad.

910
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:02,899
And pathetic.

911
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:10,281
I may never be called a "madam" again,

912
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:13,409
but I never want
to be called a bad person.

913
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:16,704
It's okay to be a bit pathetic.

914
01:05:16,787 --> 01:05:21,542
But I don't want to throw away
my integrity, even if I'm poor.

915
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:25,338
Your father wasn't like that.

916
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:33,512
Come on, dig in.
I worked really hard making these.

917
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,514
-Okay.
-Eat up.

918
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:37,600
Have some beef too.

919
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:43,522
-It's delicious.
-Really?

920
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:44,607
Yes.

921
01:05:46,692 --> 01:05:49,111
You're going to eat all that at once?

922
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:52,949
I can't believe you did that.

923
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:57,495
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

924
01:06:07,004 --> 01:06:08,297
Look.

925
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:12,176
Can you please stay still?
It's hard to focus.

926
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:15,513
You should pack your belongings too.

927
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:20,476
You think I feel happy doing this?

928
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:25,690
What choice do I have?
My family is running out of food.

929
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,193
I need to do manual labor somewhere.

930
01:06:29,276 --> 01:06:30,236
What else is there?

931
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:32,738
Do you guys have a solution?

932
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:38,077
-Say something, Mr. Koo!
-Can you please stop, Mr. Go?

933
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,038
We all feel the same way.
Why do you keep yelling?

934
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:00,683
Ms. Cha.

935
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:03,144
-You're done packing too?
-Yes.

936
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:06,564
Ms. Oh.

937
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:10,443
You should try calling here.
You only need to do the interview.

938
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:11,652
SEYEONG DISTRIBUTION

939
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:13,821
It's a small distribution company.

940
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:15,740
But shouldn't we…

941
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:20,786
Shouldn't we try
to keep the company going?

942
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:21,829
Ms. Oh.

943
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:25,291
An employee shouldn't have to do that!

944
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:30,504
A company should look after its employees.

945
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:34,759
I need to be able to feed myself,
sleep under a roof,

946
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:37,970
and raise my kid.

947
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:42,683
That's how I managed to
get through ten hours at this place.

948
01:07:44,101 --> 01:07:47,354
When Daebang Textile went down,
it was over for us too.

949
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:51,525
It's not over yet.

950
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:57,948
Don't you feel wronged?

951
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:02,828
Just wait. You can't give up so easily!

952
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,539
Easily? Does this look easy to you?

953
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:07,124
All of us here

954
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:11,462
depend on this company
to put food on the table.

955
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,931
Sure, this is so easy.

956
01:08:23,015 --> 01:08:24,183
Tae-poong.

957
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:28,229
Let's face the facts.
We've all tried our best.

958
01:08:29,063 --> 01:08:32,983
And I've worked
in this company for 26 years.

959
01:08:34,151 --> 01:08:36,987
Sapdari Logistics isn't the only company
we owe money to.

960
01:08:38,739 --> 01:08:40,491
Can I have that document, Ms. Oh?

961
01:08:46,747 --> 01:08:48,457
This is the business closure form.

962
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,460
Just submit it at the tax office.

963
01:08:52,419 --> 01:08:53,921
Go today.

964
01:08:54,713 --> 01:08:56,507
You never know what could happen.

965
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:04,640
Ms. Cha…

966
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:13,691
Just in case, disclaim the inheritance.

967
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:17,695
Look into filing for bankruptcy as well.

968
01:09:23,075 --> 01:09:24,243
Mr. Bae.

969
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,809
We should go too.

970
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:28,349
BUSINESS CLOSURE FORM

971
01:10:36,857 --> 01:10:41,278
JONGNO TAX OFFICE

972
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:16,689
Rose hip.

973
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:24,571
When people see flower petals falling,

974
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:27,032
they say the flowers are withering.

975
01:11:27,866 --> 01:11:29,827
But that's not it.

976
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:33,956
The flowers are trying their best to win

977
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:36,750
and bear fruit.

978
01:12:09,783 --> 01:12:10,701
Thank you…

979
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,371
for bearing fruit.

980
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:39,605
Ongoing instability in financial markets

981
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:42,775
is stirring uncertainty
in the Korean economy.

982
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:46,320
Foreign investors continue
to withdraw their capital,

983
01:12:46,403 --> 01:12:49,573
and the nation's credit rating
is once again under pressure.

984
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:53,410
Responding to IMF's requirements,
the government made layoffs…

985
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:41,125
SEYEONG DISTRIBUTION

986
01:13:55,389 --> 01:14:02,354
RESUME
NAME: OH MI-SEON

987
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:22,916
Where is she?

988
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:42,686
Tae-poong?

989
01:14:45,272 --> 01:14:46,273
Is that you, Tae-poong?

990
01:14:47,691 --> 01:14:48,734
Tae-poong!

991
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:52,863
What are you doing here?
Look at your face.

992
01:14:54,114 --> 01:14:57,784
-Did you walk all the way here?
-Thank goodness.

993
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:01,705
I was worried you'd be asleep.

994
01:15:01,788 --> 01:15:04,333
Why are you here at this hour?
It's freezing.

995
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:07,503
I wanted to say something.

996
01:15:09,087 --> 01:15:09,963
Did you

997
01:15:11,798 --> 01:15:13,800
file for business closure?

998
01:15:16,803 --> 01:15:18,263
Don't go to the interview tomorrow.

999
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:19,806
Pardon?

1000
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:21,558
I have something for you.

1001
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:38,951
I went to the tax office

1002
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:42,162
and applied
for a change of representative.

1003
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:46,375
They said I need to provide
a payment guarantee.

1004
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:52,297
TYPHOON TRADING
CEO KANG TAE-POONG

1005
01:15:56,969 --> 01:15:59,054
You're the CEO now.

1006
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:00,889
Yes.

1007
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:05,602
I just became

1008
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:08,230
the CEO now.

1009
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:11,316
But I have no employees…

1010
01:16:13,777 --> 01:16:15,112
or any money…

1011
01:16:17,864 --> 01:16:19,491
or any things to sell.

1012
01:16:21,493 --> 01:16:22,828
But what I'm trying to say is,

1013
01:16:25,205 --> 01:16:26,206
Ms. Oh Mi-seon…

1014
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:35,507
Will you come and work…

1015
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:39,094
for Typhoon Trading…

1016
01:16:41,471 --> 01:16:42,806
as a trader?

1017
01:17:07,539 --> 01:17:08,415
Yes.

1018
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:47,245
MOONLIGHT IN SEOUL

1019
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:23,532
TYPHOON FAMILY

1020
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:25,659
I want to visit this place in person.

1021
01:18:25,742 --> 01:18:27,244
-Mr. Kang Tae-poong?
-There she is.

1022
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:29,746
You'll find any currency here.

1023
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:32,124
I'm Park Yun-cheol, the CEO of Shoe Park.

1024
01:18:32,999 --> 01:18:35,794
And fivefold if we sell it at 50,000 won.

1025
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:38,380
Why don't you
just hand over the company to me?

1026
01:18:38,463 --> 01:18:40,716
There must be something important
at Typhoon Trading.

1027
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:42,426
Take this and cancel the agreement.

1028
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:44,594
I got these at a dirt-cheap price
for paying up front--

1029
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:46,096
Kang Tae-poong!

1030
01:18:46,179 --> 01:18:48,014
You'd be better off
staying out of the business.

1031
01:18:48,598 --> 01:18:49,808
People never change.

1032
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:52,144
It's fun.

1033
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:54,730
Do you feel confident?

1034
01:18:55,772 --> 01:19:00,777
